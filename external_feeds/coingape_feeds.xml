The consolidation reflected uncertainty among traders as the prices strictly resonated between the aforementioned levels. However, the crypto market witnessed a sudden sell-off today and assisted sellers to breach the lower support of this range. Here’s how you may trade this breakdown.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish breakdown below the $0.00000975 support accelerates the supply pressure in the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) hint any potential recovery attempt may face multiple resistance in its way</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $180.45 Million, showing a 45% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/RkTBWb41.png" alt="SHIB Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the daily time frame chart, the Shiba Inu price shows a decisive breakdown from $0.00000975 support of the current range formation. This breakdown backed by the above average volume indicated sellers are confident to plunge this memecoin’s market value lower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the pierced support may flip to viable resistance and offer sellers an additional barrier to pressurize buyers. If the daily candle closes below $0.00000975, the interested traders may wait for a bullish pullback to get a better entry opportunity.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-ai-based-meme-coins-list/">Top AI Based Meme Coins List 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the potential downfall may plunge the Shiba Inu price 18% down to revisit December 2022 low of $0.00000777.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> dives deeper into the bearish territory reflecting the increased negative sentiment among traders.</span></p>
<p><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the coin price falling close to the lower band of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger Band indicator</a> reflects momentum selling in the market.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiba Inu Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.0000944</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.0000107 and $0.0000117</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels: $0.00000885 and $0.0000077</span></li>

Crypto advocate Chris Blec made a tweet about the possible </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1654694693446332418?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400">harm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of investing in memecoins, including PEPE which he hinted could be a potential scam. He explained to his 48k Twitter followers that the memecoin may eventually cost people their lives if they are not careful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Coins like $PEPE don’t happen by accident. Big money, powerful people &amp; careful planning goes into creating these scams. You’re just a pawn in a much bigger game. And games like this have cost many people their lives. Don’t be a fucking idiot,&#8221; he tried to clarify.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Coins like <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PEPE</a> don’t happen by accident.</p>
<p>Big money, powerful people &amp; careful planning goes into creating these scams.</p>
<p>You’re just a pawn in a much bigger game.</p>
<p>And games like this have cost many people their lives.</p>
<p>Don’t be a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>&mdash; Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1654694693446332418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to his post, a Twitter user asked for the difference between PEPE and traditional finance TradFi and all Blec could itemize is the lack of regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notably, Blec is not the first crypto expert that has warned the public about an impending collapse of the memecoins. Many are still in awe of how the coin is about to reach a $1 billion market capitalization in just a few weeks after it went live.</span></p>
<h2><b>PEPE Outrageous Price Rally Pulls in Traders</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within the last two weeks, PEPE has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/pepe-coin-trading-volume-the-largest-after-btc-and-eth-8m-worth-of-coins-locked/"><span style="font-weight: 400">gained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> up to 500% according to data from CoinGecko and is still shooting further. Only yesterday, the price of FLOKI jumped by 40% and PEPE skyrocketed by 60%. This price rally has caused a high volume of hype around the meme coin causing crypto exchanges like </span><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-exchange-wazirx-follows-binance-to-list-pepe-coindcx-denied-listing/"><span style="font-weight: 400">WazirX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and Binance to list PEPE on their platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Global leading digital asset service provider Binance listed the memecoin together with FLOKI. On the other hand, the Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX wants nothing to do with PEP while citing high-risk factors. Investors seem to be paying more attention to the price rally than the sustainability of the uptrend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Billy Markus, the creator of Dogecoin (DOGE) has not made an attempt to discourage PEPE investors even though he has not bought the much-hyped memecoin. Instead, he congratulated every investor who has made a profit so far from their PEPE trade. Also, he </span><a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/dogecoin-creator-has-this-to-say-to-pepe-investors/"><span style="font-weight: 400">advised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> them to tuck away enough money as such short-term capital gains have tax implications.</span></p>

In theory, this pattern offers brief consolidation before offering a directional move on the breakout side. Thus, amid today’s sell-off in the crypto market, the BNB price breached the pattern’s support trendline indicating a prolonged downfall in the near future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A symmetrical triangle breakdown intensifies the selling pressure in the BNB price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Binance coin will maintain an overall bullish outlook until the price remains above the 50% FIB level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the BNB coin is $535.2 Million, indicating an 15.4% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/t/TXiRh6AW.png" alt="Binance Coin Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 4-hour time frame, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/binance-coin/">Binance coin price</a> gave a decisive breakdown from the support trendline of the triangle pattern. The breakdown backed by above-average volume reflects the sellers’ conviction to prolong the ongoing correction phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the BNB price may show a minor pullback to retest the pierced support as potential resistance. If the coin shows sustainability above the trendline, interested traders may grab a short-sell opportunity. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-breakdown fall may tumble the Binance coin price 10% down to hit the $290 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the $290 mark is still above the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> indicating the overall market trend remains bullish and the long-term traders should not worry.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative strength index:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A sharp fall in the 4-hour chart <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> reflects the aggressive selling pressure in the market.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With the recent drop, the BNB price plunged below crucial <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a>(20, 50, 100, and 200) giving an additional edge to short sellers.</span></p>

The global crypto market cap fell over 2.60% to $1.18 trillion, with over <strong>$182 million</strong> worth of crypto assets liquidated in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price fell 5% to below $28,500, with the price currently trading at 28,573. In the last 24 hours, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price</a> recorded a low and high of $28,468 and $29,820, respectively.</p>
<p>Ethereum prices also plummeted sharply below the $2,000 level. The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH price</a> fell over 7% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $1,882. The 24-hour low and high are $1,870 and $2,017, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Ethereum Foundation</strong> and Ethereum creator <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong> selling over 15,000 ETH is likely the trigger behind the recent crypto market selloff. CoinGape Media reported that the last major selloff of ETH by Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik Buterin in November 2021 caused the ETH price to fall 40% in 2 months.</p>

<p>Altcoins including PEPE, FLOKI, LUNC, Arbitrum, Litecoin, and Aptos witnessed a major downfall. Massive Profit-booking was recorded in PEPE and FLOKI after both rallied over 50% in the last 24 hours. <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-suspends-market-order-functions-for-shib-floki-pepe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance introduced some restrictions</a> in the market order functions for majorly Shiba Inu (SHIB), FLOKI, and PEPE trading pairs.</p>

This is a well-known bullish reversal pattern that could intensify the underlying buying momentum and initiate a sustained directional uptrend. Amid the recent growth in the crypto market, the sideways trend in FLOKI price formed a new higher low, indicating an early sign of trend reversal. Here’s how interested traders may grab an entry opportunity in this coin for a massive price rally </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The formation of a rounding bottom pattern gives an early sign of a new recovery cycle</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent breakout from $0.000041 resistance set the Floki price for a 61% rise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the Floki coin is $318 Million, indicating a 73% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/5/5xUKINV8.png" alt="Floki Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 5th, the Floki coin price witnessed a massive inflow and recorded a 50% intraday gain. This strong growth is likely to be associated with the Floki coin listing announcement on the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent price rise, the FLOKI coin breached a local resistance of $0.000041 offering a significant launching for buyers to further extend the bullish rally. However, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> is 9.5% down on intraday retest of the pierced resistance as potential support.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the aforementioned support aligned with the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement</a> which created a strong reversal point for Floki price. Interested traders can look for an entry opportunity at $0.000041 mark if the coin price shows sustainability above it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of this pattern, the Floki price may rise 61% just to hit the $0.0000685 neckline resistance. A bullish breakout from the neckline will accelerate the buying pressure. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Moving average convergence/divergence : </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wide gap between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) line after a bullish crossover accentuates the aggressive buying in the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By these insights in this shared data, it means addresses holding a certain amount of BTC added to the count and effectively, the total launched addresses may be significantly more if those holding no BTC are added to the mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Glassnode highlighted that across the 4 different Bitcoin Epochs, the relative addition of new non-zero addresses slowed, however, the absolute growth soared to new heights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first Epoch, the addresses on the Bitcoin network were approximately 1 million with a 1.3 million percent growth. The second epoch recorded a total of 784% growth with more than 8 million addresses present on the network. The growth rate reduced in the third epoch as address count soared 233% with about 21 million addresses added to the network. The fourth epoch recorded a growth of 54% with 16 million addresses added to the mix.</span></p>

<h2><b>Bitcoin Adoption: the Visible Attraction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In championing the adoption of Bitcoin, there are visible attractions that both retail and institutional investors are always banking on. One of these is the price action of the mega digital currency. Bitcoin has maintained a relatively more resilient price action thus far this year when compared to most of the top investment assets on Wall Street and other stock markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With inflationary fears that has largely fueled the interest rate hikes, Bitcoin has acted as a viable hedge against this inflation with a 72.64% growth in the Year-to-Date (YTD) period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In deciding the factors boosting the adoption of BTC, the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/btc-price-29k-1-year-countdown-bitcoin-halving/"><span style="font-weight: 400">upcoming Halving event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a major consideration as many experts are already projecting a subsequent price upsurge following the event. Bitcoin’s supply is still pegged at 21 million and with the growing adoption, there is a gradual scarcity that is being introduced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This scarcity is bound to fuel additional value addition, and accounts for why MicroStrategy Inc has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-holding-reaches-140k-adds-1045-more-btc/"><span style="font-weight: 400">continued to accumulate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the cryptocurrency.</span></p>

<p>Typically, Ethereum Foundation sells small amounts of ETH to manage operations and Vitalik Buterin usually dumps meme coins he received in his wallet for ETH. But this time it&#8217;s different.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik Buterin Transfers Over 15K ETH</h2>
<p>On Friday, Vitalik Buterin related address vitalik.eth <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xedbb0d22f37376b415e449d582a14afd162b92ba801916547834551f499201c8" target="_blank">transferred</a> 200 ETH to crypto exchange Kraken as per PeckShieldAlert. As per Etherscan <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x8ae0231ca03e2808dd78c43d7742b2cd8cf01e72" target="_blank">data</a>, this is not the first time the address transferred ETH to the same Kraken wallet. There are 5 similar transactions to Kraken in the last 2 months.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FvW4GY4acAAJgy-?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>Ethereum Foundation followed suit and transferred 15k ETH to Kraken, as per the transaction <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x22dbf6ddbaf25a394c70cbd937c21b82f57352ea2cf1c849c727a160dc5fa76f" target="_blank">reported</a> by PeckShieldAlert on Saturday, May 6. The large transaction by Ethereum Foundation raised FUD in the crypto community, with many thinking that an ETH price and meme coins crash could be coming.</p>
<p>As per historical data, a large ETH move by the Ethereum Foundation led to a massive fall in ETH prices. The last time 20,000 ETH was <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf22e8254c32866d28f5b69f009d59ca2b45891f05e2a073b94679bd107c828a1" target="_blank">transferred</a> to Kraken on November 12, 2021. After the Ethereum Foundation cash out at $4,722, near ATH, the ETH price fell 40% in 2 months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin has sold several meme coins historically. The coins Vitalik Buterin sold mostly get rekt, similar to last time when shitcoins lost most value after he dumped massive amounts of shitcoins. In March, <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-creator-vitalik-buterin-dumps-multiple-memecoins-is-a-crypto-crash-imminent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik sold</a> 50 billion MOPS for 1.25 ETH, 10 billion CULT for 58 ETH, and 500 trillion SHIK for 380 ETH. In Addition, he sold 3.4M <span class="link-complex-target">BITE</span> for 5.9 <span class="link-complex-target">ETH and transferred <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">214 </span><span class="r-18u37iz">ETH</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> worth $337k to Ethereum Foundation.</span></span></p>

<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/Ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH price</a> jumped 3% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $1,964. The 24-hour low and high are $1,894 and $2,017, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased slightly by 52% in the last 24 hours, indicating an interest among traders.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, some tokens will be reserved to conform as a bridge to ETH as this is of utmost importance. Ultimately, it is believed that this strategy will cause transaction fees on the protocol to drastically reduce to 0%.</span></p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exciting News: A Proposal to Strengthen Security with a 100 Quadrillion Token Burn on ETH and fee reduction to 0%</p>

<p>&mdash; Baby Doge (@BabyDogeCoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BabyDogeCoin/status/1654810651674419202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The BabyDoge team said it has been listening to the concerns of its community and “have come up with an innovative solution to further enhance the security and integrity of our project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It detailed that the 100 quadrillion tokens it wants to burn have been sitting idle since it launched on ETH and that the proposal to burn them off will “reduce potential exploitation risk associated with them.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-burn-rate-plummets-is-shib-allure-fading-away/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Token burns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are not uncommon with memecoins with Shiba Inu notably burning millions of its token on a regular basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Markedly, BabyDoge is keen on providing seamless and cost-effective services to its community. Hence the need to strengthen its project and enhance security. In the end, users can have access to inexpensive transactions on the ecosystem that also offers a higher level of efficiency. </span></p>
<h2><b>BabyDoge Prepares For Official Proposal to DAO</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, the proposal has received 4,812 votes with 96% in favour of a burn and the other 4% requesting that things are left the way they are. Others who have not voted still have about 23 hours to take a stance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While this is an unofficial voting process, the protocol has promised to draft an official proposal for the DAO when the time comes. This time would be after the current proposal records overwhelming support from its community. With the turn of events, it seems like the official proposal will be going out very soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">BabyDoge believes that there is a very high likelihood that this would go down as one of the biggest token burns in history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The burn is currently estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. For this initial phase, BabyDoge is leveraging the ETH blockchain but it would eventually move to BNB Chain depending on its success. Meanwhile, BabyDoge is still in close </span><a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/floki-surpasses-babydoge-bone-up-33/"><span style="font-weight: 400">competition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with FLOKI and Shiba Inu whose burn rate has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-spikes-30000-can-shib-price-make-a-comeback/"><span style="font-weight: 400">jumped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by more than 30,000%.</span></p>

Amid this win, it also announced the launching of an international exchange offering <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and Ethereum (ETH) perpetual futures leaving people confused. However, one of Ripple&#8217;s board members has hinted at what could be the next move of Coinbase.</p>

<h2>Coinbase Moving Ahead Of Being Just A Crypto Exchange</h2>
<p>Asheesh Birla, Board Member at Ripple commented on the recent actions taken by the <a href="https://coingape.com/companies/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> lately. He stated that Coinbase is transitioning from a crypto exchange to a crypto enabled banking service.</p>
<p>Birla mentioned that Coinbase has updated its mission in order to build a crypto economy that will be a more fair, efficient, accessible, and transparent financial system for digital assets. However, Coinbase in a blog stated that it is dedicated to partnering with high bar regulators across US and Non US jurisdictions in order to update the financials system. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/?utm_source=menubar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More Ripple News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>

<p>Coinbase recently shared its quarter 1 2023 earnings. As per the data, its revenue on deposits via interest income, custodial fees and blockchain rewards are now making a huge part of its revenues. Birla mentioned that interest generated on the USDC deposits is alone generating $199 million which is 18% of all the Coinbase’s revenue.</p>
<p>This directly depicts that Coinbase revenues are now shifting from consumer to high margin institutional customers. Its institutional trading revenue has increased by 67% over the last quarter. Ripple board member added that the U.S. biggest crypto exchange is benefiting from banking like revenues that are less dependent on the crypto market. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEPE Price Prediction: The trending Meme cryptocurrency PEPE recorded remarkable growth this month as more and more <a href="https://coingape.com/pepe-price-shoots-106-as-kucoin-crypto-com-announce-listing/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">crypto exchanges announced their listing</a> very recently. On March 5th, the parabolic growth in this memecoin marked a new All time high of $0.0000049 and reverted immediately for a correction phase. Anyhow, after massive growth, this retracement was not surprising as it may confirm price sustainability at higher levels and offer a dip opportunity to interested traders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The correction phase above the 50% FIB level indicates the bullish momentum is healthy to prolong the price rally</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the flag pattern offers a long entry opportunity to traders.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the PEPE is $1.42 Billion, indicating a 292.5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/1/1h6UMoAp.png" alt="PEPE Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 4-hour time frame chart, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/pepe-price-prediction-is-it-too-late-to-buy-pepecoin-after-its-massive-108-price-rally/">PEPE price</a> showed a high wick rejection at the new ATH of $0.0000049, indicating the exhausted bullish momentum. The resulting correction tumbled the Pepecoin price by nearly 32% and plunged it to the current price of $0.0000030. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this pullback is still above the 50% Fibonacci retracement indicating the overall market trend is bullish. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullish Pattern in the Hourly Chart Offers an Entry Opportunity</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/1/1h6UMoAp.png" alt="TradingView Chart" /></span></p>
<p>Source- Tradingview</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pepe coin shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bull-flag-pattern-in-crypto-meaning-and-how-to-identify/">flag pattern</a> in the hourly time frame chart. A slight upswing in price gave a bullish breakout from the pattern’s resistance trendline, indicating a higher possibility of upcoming recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coin price shows sustainability above the breached trendline, the pepecoin could be 45% higher to rechallenge the ATH ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the coin price breaks below the trendline this bullish thesis will get invalidated.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the hourly chart, the 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> acts as excellent dynamic support to assist buyers during occasion pullbacks.</span></p>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hourly <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> above the midline(50%) indicates the market sentiment remains positive. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEPE Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.00000306</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.0000038 and $0.0000045</span></li>

Reports say several traders are turning their <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-eyes-2000-as-traders-convert-pepe-profits-to-eth/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">Pepecoin profits into Ethereum</a> causing this sudden spike in price. Furthermore, with the recent jump, the coin price breached a resistance trendline of a symmetrical triangle pattern indicating an additional confirmation for a recovery rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price correction didn’t plunge below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level indicating the overall market trend is bullish.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the symmetrical triangle patterns may trigger a fresh recovery in the Ethereum price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.9 Billion, indicating a 65.5% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent correction in Ethereum price turned sideways after hitting the $1800 support and shaped into a famous chart pattern called a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a>. This pattern formation creates a temporary consolidation phase which eventually triggers a direction rally once the price breach either of its trendlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent price hike, the buyers breach the pattern’s overhead trendline and local resistance of $1946, offering an addition for uptrend resumption. However, the coin price is 3%, and retest the aforementioned resistance as potential support.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-ai-based-meme-coins-list/">Top AI Based Meme Coins List 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum price</a> manages to sustain above the new flipped support, interested traders can look for an entry opportunity to go long. The post-breakout rally may surge the coin price 10% higher to hit the last swing high of $2140.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the daily candle closes below $1946 or the pattern’s trendline bullish thesis will offset.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) line hints at a sign of upcoming recovery. </span></p>
<p><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price surged above the midline of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger Band</a> indicator suggesting the market buyers are wrestling to take trend control.</span></p>

As of press time, ETH is trading at $1,966 with a market cap of $236 billion.</p>
<p>The latest development comes as active deposits on the Ethereum blockchain network shoot a 1.5-year high. As per on-chain data provider Santiment, a large number of crypto traders are converting their PEPE profits into ETH.

<p>The massive rally in the memecoin PEPE has created a major buzz in the crypto space currently with its trading volumes shooting past $2.7 billion, just after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<h3>Ethereum Gas Fee Jumps At 12-Month High</h3>
<p>As the frog-themed memecoin aka Pepecoin (PEPE) created a massive frenzy, the daily median gas fee on the Ethereum blockchain has touched a new 12-month high of 87 gwei. Just for context, since the launch of Pepecoin (PEPE) on April 18, the gas fee on Ethereum has shot up by 50% as per pseudonymous analyst @hildobby&#8217;s Ethereum Gas tracker on Dune Analytics.</p>
<p>The ERC20 memecoin PEPE has been on an unstoppable price rally. The frenzy surrounding PEPE is so strong that Uniswap&#8217;s pepecoin-wrapped ether (PEPE-WETH) liquidity pools just became the most active liquidity pool by the number of transactions.</p>
<p>As per on-chain data, traders conducted a total of 413,283 PEPE Uniswap transactions burning over $10 million in gas fees.</p>

<p>However, investors also need to stay cautious as Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation recently <a href="https://coingape.com/historical-data-suggestethereum-foundation-vitalik-buterin/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dumped over 15,000 ETH</a>. Thus, one must stay watchful before the current momentum spirals into major sell order for Ethereum anytime soon.</p>

<p>WaxirX in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WazirXIndia/status/1654726232838230020" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on May 6 revealed that deposits for PEPE meme coin are live on the crypto exchange and users can start depositing their coins onto the exchange. In a following tweet, the exchange announces that it has opened trading for PEPE as deposits reached a sufficient level.</p>
<p>As per WazirX, users can start trading PEPE against USDT trading pair on the platform.</p>

<p>&mdash; WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) <a href="https://twitter.com/WazirXIndia/status/1654795398651977728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The demand for listing meme coins continues to rise in the crypto community as meme coins&#8217; prices rally higher. WazirX has listed several meme coins including FLOKI in March. FLOKI price continues to rise after Binance.US and Binance also listed FLOKI.</p>
<p>The PEPE listing came <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-to-list-pepe-coin-amid-meme-coin-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after Binance</a> and several top exchanges listed PEPE on Friday. PEPE price is currently trading at $0.00000287, up 50% in the last 24 hours and 800% in a week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another leading Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX has denied listing PEPE citing investment risk to users. CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/smtgpt/status/1654506483004874752" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> the exchange whas decided to not list PEPE, despite the hype and listing by top exchanges.</p>
<p>He further added that limited on-chain liquidity on Uniswap is the major challenge with PEPE. The exchange will continue to monitor the market and list assets that offer value to its users.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We take our responsibility as a trusted platform very seriously, and we believe that listing PEPE could potentially put our users&#8217; investments at risk.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
