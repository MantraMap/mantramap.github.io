The collection is offered exclusively on https://chenman.liveart.xyz.</p><p>Chen Man, a contemporary photographer and visual artist whom the New York Times called &ldquo;The Chinese Annie Leibovitz&rdquo; has created a unique visual language that revolutionized fashion photography in China. Over the years, Chen Man has continuously collaborated with world-leading magazines, including Vogue, Elle, Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar, i-D, Muse, and more. Chen Man's works have entered permanent collections at Victoria &amp; Albert (V&amp;A) Museum in London and Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. Chen Man&rsquo;s works are collected by many high-profile collectors, with prints selling for up to $25,000. In April 2011 Chen Man had a solo exhibition at Beijing Today Art Museum followed by another solo exhibition in Museum of Contemporary Art Shanghai. Chen Man&rsquo;s muses include Rhianna, Miranda Kerr, David Beckham and Grimes. Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dior and most of the major fashion houses have partnered with Chen Man.</p><p>Chen Man has transcended the fashion world to become an influential contemporary artist. She infuses the legacy of fashion photography with our contemporary digital reality, creating sublime images that transform our perceptions of beauty, fashion and identity.&nbsp;</p><p>LiveArt is introducing Chen Man to the global Web3 audiences with the multi-chapter &ldquo;Silent Noise&rdquo; NFT series consisting of highly collectible artworks, with an underlying theme of humanity&rsquo;s and AI&rsquo;s future, details can be found on LiveArt, accessible at https://chenman.liveart.xyz.</p><p>For her genesis digital collection, to be released on May 24th on LiveArt, Chen Man has chosen an iconic shoot with Grimes entitled &ldquo;The Last AI Robot On Earth&rdquo; shot the day before Grimes gave birth to X AE A-Xii. Both Grimes and Chen Man share a passion for the study of AI, its origins, and its possibilities. This shared passion fuels the underlying theme of Chen Man&rsquo;s genesis Web3 project, a multi-chapter experiential deep dive into the imagination of one of the 21st century's most important artists.&nbsp;</p>&ldquo;This NFT collection has allowed me to have more experimentation with photography. I am much more free to impose my own artistic vision into the genre, to push the limits of photography without any constraints. Photography is a fantasy, it allows one to dream, it allows artists to create new worlds. And in creating new worlds we transform the way we think about ourselves,&rdquo; says Chen Man.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just as Beeple carved a path in the Web3 art world for digital illustrators, Chen Man is doing the same for photographers that wish to build a collector base for digital works in Web3,&rdquo; says Vincent Harrison of iv gallery.<p>Chen Man's mission is to create an interactive, safe, inclusive, and engaging experience for her audience as they embark on this journey of discovery and adventure with her. Each &ldquo;Silent Noise&rdquo; drop will coincide with multiple chances to gain $ART token rewards, unique 1/1 works, and even attend a photoshoot with Chen Man. As always, LiveArt will be offering additional rewards to its X Card holders.</p><p>A few fortunate collectors will have the chance to be immortalized in the second chapter of this epic journey, &ldquo;The Memory Brick&rdquo;.&nbsp;As AI is developing rapidly, human memory is at risk of being manipulated, tampered with, distorted, and even erased. &ldquo;The Memory Brick&rdquo; will combine physical/digital art and social commentary as a museum exhibit based around recording and storing the last biological memories.</p>&ldquo;This is one of the most innovative, complete, and well-thought-out projects we've seen &ndash; plus it has rockets, AI, and the Musks, who are tech royalty. The buzz is off the charts, I think it will be pretty tough to grab one,&rdquo; says Boris Pevzner, CEO of LiveArt.&nbsp;<p>"Silent Noise: Episode 01&rdquo; will be offered as a limited edition of 500 NFT's at $100 each, to create an affordable, attractive entry level into the Chen Man Universe. It will be available exclusively on LiveArt, accessible at https://chenman.liveart.xyz.</p><p>About LiveArt</p><p>Founded by Sotheby's and Christie's art market veterans and backed by Binance Labs and Animoca Brands, LiveArt is the global Web3 platform for art and culture.
