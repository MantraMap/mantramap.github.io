Over a dozen Russian banks are going to take part in the trials with real transactions and users scheduled to commence in mid-August.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia Prepares to Pilot Operations With New Digital Ruble</h2>
<p>Financial authorities and institutions in the Russian Federation are gearing up to start testing the country’s central bank digital currency (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>) in actual <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-launch-digital-ruble-transactions-with-real-users-in-august/">transactions between real users</a>. The trials are set to begin on Aug. 15.</p>
<p>Around 600 people and 30 companies will participate in the initial stage of the pilot, First Deputy Chair of the Central Bank of Russia, Olga Skorobogatova, unveiled at a press conference, quoted by the crypto news outlet Bits.media.</p>
<p>After verifying all operations conducted by the first group, the number of participants will be increased, she added. The tests will be carried out in 11 Russian cities, including Moscow where digital ruble transactions will be launched in the public transportation system.</p>

<p>The capital city’s subway has been a testing site for innovations, noted Maxim Liksutov, deputy mayor for transport. Local authorities plan to launch ticket sales for digital rubles in the Moscow metro and eventually introduce CBDC payments in other types of urban transportation, he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Skorobogatova revealed that 13 Russian banks will join the digital ruble pilot. During the briefing, First Deputy Chairman of the Board of Sovcombank, Sergey Khotimsky, said that commercial banks are also going to compete with the digital ruble platform, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will try to do the same as it was in the case of cash, when banks created services and introduced mechanisms to make non-cash money more profitable and interesting. And we will continue to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Khotimsky emphasized that Russian banking institutions would like the bank account to remain Russians’ main account. Officials have previously made it clear that the digital ruble, as the third form of Russian fiat, is meant to complement, not replace, paper cash or electronic bank money.</p>
<p>Legislation regulating the introduction of Russia’s central bank digital currency was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-state-duma-passes-digital-ruble-law/">adopted</a> by both houses of parliament in July. Also last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-signs-digital-ruble-law-allowing-cbdc-payments-in-russia/">signed</a> the digital ruble bill into law opening the way for CBDC payments in the country.</p>

In a recent article, Brooks and Calomiris call for regulations to allow stablecoin issuers to have the clarity needed for the assets to thrive.</strong></p>
<h2>Stablecoins Might Help the U.S. Dollar Maintain Its Reserve Currency Status</h2>
<p>Brian Brooks, former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, and Charles Calomiris, former chief economist of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/stablecoins-can-help-keep-the-dollar-the-worlds-reserve-currency-yuan-china-ef1047c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> an op-ed article explaining how stablecoins could contribute to maintaining the status of the dollar as a reserve currency.</p>
<p>Brooks and Calomiris detail that stablecoins can be significant tools in the fight against worldwide de-dollarization, serving as catalysts for the demand for dollars for citizens in developing countries, even when their governments do not support dollarization per se.</p>
<p>They cite Argentina and Venezuela as examples of countries facing extremely high inflation levels with governments taking measures to cut dollar dependency, but whose citizens use dollars to protect their incomes and savings from losing value while stored in their national currencies.</p>
<p>In this sense, they explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faced with the dismal prospect of saving their wages in local currency stored in local bank accounts, more citizens of high-inflation countries are opting to use dollar-backed stablecoins as a synthetic savings account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, referring to the recent decline in the usage of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, Brooks and Calomiris explain the problems that a de-dollarized world might bring the U.S., stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A de-dollarized world would damage the U.S. The dollar’s reserve status reduces U.S. borrowing costs, which is crucial in an era when government borrowing and spending are at a record high and still climbing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Regulation Seen as Necessary</h2>
<p>Brooks and Calomiris raise a timely issue: regulation is necessary for these instruments to thrive and grow. They refer to the bill backed by Rep. Patrick McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, as a significant part of the puzzle to bring stablecoins to the mainstream level.</p>
<p>They stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is why Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry’s bill to regulate stablecoins is vital. It would establish federal and state oversight for stablecoin issuers, impose qualifications for reserve assets, and implement rules on redemptions and public disclosure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The House Financial Services Committee recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-house-financial-services-committee-passes-stablecoin-legislation-after-a-few-fireworks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> the Clarity for Stablecoins Act with bipartisan support. In the face of the launch of Paypal&#8217;s stablecoin PYUSD, McHenry reinforced the need for clarity in the digital stablecoin market, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-representative-patrick-mchenry-stablecoins-hold-promise-as-a-pillar-of-our-21st-century-payments-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declaring</a> that &#8220;clear regulations and robust consumer protections are essential to enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential.&#8221;</p>

The business intelligence firm now holds 152,800 bitcoins, acquired for a total cost of $4.53 billion, and it has plans to buy even more.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Microstrategy&#x2019;s Stock Outperforms Bitcoin, S&P500, Nasdaq, Gold, Silver</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The stock of business intelligence firm Microstrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) has risen 206% since the company adopted its bitcoin strategy, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor stated on Twitter Friday. He tweeted:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Three years ago today Microstrategy announced that it had adopted bitcoin as its Primary Treasury Reserve Asset, purchasing 21,454 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for $250 million, or ~$11,653 per bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Microstrategy adopted its bitcoin strategy on Aug. 10, 2020. In comparison, during the same time period, bitcoin has experienced a 145% increase, while the S&P 500 has risen 33% and the Nasdaq 25%, according to a chart Saylor shared on Twitter. Meanwhile, gold has seen a decline of 5%, and silver has decreased 19%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Blackrock, the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager, is a major shareholder of Microstrategy. In February, Blackrock disclosed that it owns 760,000 shares of Microstrategy Incorporated, which represents 8.1% of the company. The asset manager is also trying to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">launch</a> a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Earlier this month, Microstrategy disclosed that it now holds <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategy-increases-bitcoin-holdings-to-152800-btc-plans-to-buy-more-with-750-million-stock-sales/">152,800 bitcoins</a>, acquired for a total cost of $4.53 billion, or $29,672 per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The company is also planning to buy more <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> with stock sales of up to $750 million.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Saylor explained in August 2020 that his company&#x2019;s bitcoin strategy &#x201C;seeks to maximize long-term value&#x201D; for shareholders. He described the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency as &#x201C;a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash.&#x201D; The executive added: &#x201C;Since its inception over a decade ago, bitcoin has emerged as a significant addition to the global financial system, with characteristics that are useful to both individuals and institutions.&#x201D;&#13;<br />

Bittrex and Bittrex Global agreed to pay $24 million. The SEC&#x2019;s director of enforcement alleged that for years, Bittrex worked with token issuers to &#x201C;scrub&#x201D; their online statements &#x201C;to evade the federal securities laws.&#x201D;</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bittrex Settles With SEC</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-150">announced</a> Thursday that crypto trading platform Bittrex Inc., its co-founder and former CEO William Shihara, and Bittrex&#x2019;s foreign entity Bittrex Global GmbH have reached a settlement with the regulator. The SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-crypto-exchange-bittrex-with-operating-unregistered-exchange-broker-and-clearing-agency/">charged</a> Bittrex entities and Shihara in April.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Specifically, the SEC explained that Bittrex and Shihara &#x201C;agreed to settle charges that they operated an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.&#x201D; Meanwhile, Bittrex Global &#x201C;agreed to settle charges that it failed to register as a national securities exchange.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The securities watchdog stated that as part of the settlement, subject to court approval, the defendants consented to be permanently enjoined from violating the securities laws. Moreover, the SEC detailed:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Bittrex and Bittrex Global agreed to pay, on a joint and several basis, disgorgement of $14.4 million, prejudgment interest of $4 million, and a civil penalty of $5.6 million, for a total monetary payment of $24 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&#x2019;s Division of Enforcement, commented: &#x201C;For years, Bittrex worked with token issuers to &#x2018;scrub&#x2019; their online statements of any indicia that they were investment contracts &#x2014; all in an effort to evade the federal securities laws. They failed.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The SEC has taken several enforcement actions against major crypto firms this year, including <span style="font-weight: 200;"> </span>and Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN). The Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase, which attempted to have the charges against it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-urges-court-to-dismiss-sec-case-claiming-regulator-overstepped-its-statutory-authority/">dismissed</a> last week, claimed that the SEC &#x201C;overstepped&#x201D; its statutory authority. The regulator reportedly asked Coinbase to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-sec-asked-coinbase-to-delist-all-crypto-assets-except-bitcoin-prior-to-filing-lawsuit/">delist</a> all crypto tokens except bitcoin in order to comply with securities laws. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who has been slammed for his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmakers-call-on-sec-to-stop-regulatory-assault-on-crypto-following-xrp-ruling/">enforcement-centric approach</a> to regulating the crypto industry, believes that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a> except bitcoin are securities. He also said that crypto is a highly speculative field that is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-says-crypto-is-a-highly-speculative-field-rife-with-fraud/">rife with fraud</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The SEC has also revealed its plan to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-to-appeal-ripple-xrp-ruling-requests-stay-of-proceedings/">appeal</a> the Ripple decision made by District Judge Analisa Torres regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>. The securities watchdog believes that some parts of the Ripple ruling are &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-says-xrp-ruling-in-ripple-case-wrongly-decided-signals-appeal/">wrongly decided</a>,&#x201D; according to Gensler.&#13;<br />

That’s valid in particular for cross-border trade and de-dollarization, said Mohamed El Yattioui, professor at the American University in the Emirates.</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS Bloc to Benefit From Inducting New Members Like UAE and Saudi Arabia, Academic Says</h2>
<p>“The role of BRICS has been increasing during the last years and in the last decade,” Mohamed Badine El Yattioui, doctor of political science and assistant professor of international affairs and strategy in the College of Security and Global Studies at the American University in UAE, told Russia’s Tass news agency.</p>
<p>The academic emphasized that “for the United Arab Emirates, it’s important to become part of the BRICS group,” which currently consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. He believes that the expansion will allow the bloc to put pressure on the West to recognize changes in the system of international relations.</p>
<p>The admission of the UAE and other candidates will help BRICS to “push the Western countries towards accepting some modifications of the new world order, especially those regarding international trade, international political economy in general, currency and leaving the dollar,” El Yattioui elaborated.</p>
<p>The professor highlighted that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have strong economies and high gross domestic product (GDP) and are offering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRICS</a> many opportunities, especially regarding energy. “It is in the interest of BRICS to have them inside the group,” he remarked.</p>
<p>Enlargement was one of the topics discussed by the foreign ministers of BRICS member states in Cape Town, South Africa, in June. The meeting was also attended by diplomats from 12 other nations that have expressed intentions to join the group of the largest developing economies.</p>
<p>This year’s BRICS summit is scheduled to take place on Aug. 22–24 in Johannesburg. The hosting country’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/23-countries-apply-for-brics-membership-as-leaders-prepare-to-convene-at-summit/">unveiled</a> that the organization’s leaders will talk about its expansion. A total of 23 nations have so far submitted formal applications for membership, she said.</p>
<p>Earlier in August, the Press Secretary of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Peskov, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nuances-exist-among-brics-members-regarding-blocs-expansion-kremlin-admits/">admitted</a> that “certain nuances exist” among the five current BRICS members regarding the bloc’s expansion and these will be discussed at the summit. He was referring to a report by Bloomberg, according to which China’s push for a rapid enlargement is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-faces-opposition-to-rapid-brics-expansion-from-india-and-brazil-report/">facing opposition</a> from India and Brazil.</p>

Last month, Custodia started serving external business customers in select U.S. states, offering U.S. dollar deposits and government money market fund services, with bitcoin custody pending launch. The launch comes after overcoming regulatory pressures and challenges with the Federal Reserve Board. </strong></p>
<h2>Custodia Bank Debuts Services</h2>
<p>Many crypto and narrow banking proponents have awaited the arrival of <a href="https://custodiabank.com/">Custodia Bank</a>, a financial institution that is tech-forward and customer-centric. “We&#8217;re grateful to our partners, who appreciate our approach of complying with banking laws and regulations; to Wyoming for its enabling laws; to our team and investors; and to the law-abiding digital asset industry,” <a href="https://twitter.com/custodiabank/status/1690012708513390592?s=20">said</a> CEO Caitlin Long. Custodia says the bank&#8217;s regional bank-style risk management program, along with its dedication to following regulations, sets it apart from competitors.</p>
<p>Services now available include U.S. dollar deposits and U.S. government money market fund services, tailored to U.S.-based business customers. This includes digital asset businesses, fintechs, banks, corporate treasurers, trusts, pension funds, and start-ups. The bank&#8217;s strategy is to eventually serve customers worldwide, providing enhanced regulatory clarity and minimized transactional risk with its unique reserve model.</p>
<p>Custodia operates under the first special purpose depository institution (SPDI) legal and regulatory framework in the United States. This approach allows the bank to offer a full suite of financial services for both U.S. dollars and digital assets. Demand deposit accounts are protected under a 100% reserve requirement, and the bank offers API solutions for programmable accounts, payments, settlement, and future custody products, Custodia’s website <a href="https://custodiabank.com/">discloses</a>.</p>
<p>Custodia Bank&#8217;s journey to this point has been marked by challenges. In December, they informed the U.S. Federal Reserve of their intention to complete a specific task list and followed through despite it no longer being required. Independent reviews, new partnerships, and the development of new services to meet market needs were all part of the process, Custodia detailed on Friday.</p>
<p>In January 2023, the Federal Reserve Board <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-bank-custodia-denied-membership-in-us-federal-reserve-system/">issued a denial</a> for Custodia&#8217;s application to become a member of the system, citing “significant safety and soundness risks” related to crypto assets and an insufficient risk management framework. The denial reflected <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/a-look-at-the-feds-recent-custodia-bank-denial-and-the-central-banks-push-back-against-narrow-banking/">broader regulatory skepticism</a> towards digital assets and narrow banking techniques. However, Custodia&#8217;s perseverance and alignment with Wyoming&#8217;s innovative legal framework for SPDIs have allowed them to navigate these challenges and emerge as a regulated bank.</p>

Folashodun Shonubi, the acting governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, insists that the naira is currently undervalued. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Nigeria&#8217;s &#8220;loose&#8221; fiscal and monetary policies are to blame for the naira&#8217;s woes.</strong></p>
<h2>Nigeria May Abandon New Exchange Rate Policy</h2>
<p>Nigeria’s rapidly depreciating currency recently breached the 900 per dollar mark for the first time after its parallel market exchange rate versus the greenback reportedly fell to a new low of NGN950:USD1 on Aug 9. The currency’s latest plunge came just days after the Economic Intelligence Unit <a href="https://country.eiu.com/nigeria">warned</a> that Nigerian authorities may consider abandoning the floating exchange rate regime adopted in mid-June.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.thecable.ng/breaking-naira-tumbles-to-all-time-low-of-n950-at-parallel-market">report</a> from The Cable, the ongoing shortages of the greenback on both the formal and informal markets have fueled the naira’s latest slide versus major currencies. Meanwhile, the currency’s fall has now prompted some Nigerian economic commentators to forecast a further depreciation of the naira over the course of the next few weeks.</p>
<p>However, despite the currency’s continuing decline, Folashodun Shonubi, the Central Bank of Nigeria’s acting governor, insists that the naira is currently undervalued. In his remarks made at the National Institute of Security Studies (NISS), Shonubi maintained economic modeling had proven this assertion to be correct.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were to conduct an economic modelling of Nigeria using purchasing power parity, you would discover that the Naira is currently significantly undervalued,&#8221; the acting governor <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/08/naira-is-currently-undervalued-says-ag-cbn-governor/#:~:text=CBN%20Governor,-%E2%80%A6&amp;text=The%20Acting%20Governor%20of%20the,modelling%20using%20purchasing%20power%20parity.">said</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p>Shonubi identified the channeling of diaspora remittances away from the formal foreign exchange market as one of the reasons why the naira has performed badly against the greenback. He also accused unnamed Nigerian banks of fueling the naira’s depreciation via &#8220;illegal&#8221; dollar sales. The acting governor warned that the CBN would soon descend on banks suspected to be behind the unsanctioned dollar sales.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reportedly blamed the naira’s woes on the country’s &#8220;loose&#8221; fiscal and monetary policies. However, according to Ari Aisen, the global lender’s representative in Nigeria, the country can still give the naira a fighting chance by tightening its policies.</p>

Matthew Russell Lee of the Inner City Press disclosed a synopsis of the August 11 hearing on the social media outlet X, where Bankman-Fried&#8217;s legal counsel revealed that the attorneys intended to challenge the ruling. However, despite these intentions, Bankman-Fried was subsequently taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals.</strong></p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Remanded to Jail After Bail Revocation</h2>
<p>In the past fortnight, the legal team prosecuting the case against Sam Bankman-Fried has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-seeks-to-avoid-jail-denies-witness-tampering-in-ftx-case/">striving to incarcerate</a> the former FTX CEO on grounds of suspected witness tampering. Bankman-Fried disseminated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ex-alameda-ceo-caroline-ellisons-google-docs-diary-exposes-struggles-prior-to-ftx-collapse/">selected passages</a> from an online journal penned by former Alameda CEO <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-suggest-caroline-ellison-is-working-with-feds-and-snitching-on-ftx-co-founder-bankman-fried/">Caroline Ellison</a> to a New York Times journalist.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has asserted that these leaked fragments were designed to cow a witness slated to testify against the one-time head of FTX. Since these excerpts surfaced, a heated debate has ensued between the parties, as they sparred over whether Bankman-Fried&#8217;s action constitutes a mere exercise of free speech or a deliberate attempt at witness intimidation.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690061503645229056?s=20">X thread</a> published by Matthew Russell Lee of the Inner City Press, the judge presiding over the case has decided to remand Bankman-Fried to jail. Just before mentioning the revocation, the judge <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/prosecutors-seek-restrictions-on-former-ftx-ceos-electronic-devices-following-vpn-use-for-football-streaming/">mentioned</a> Bankman-Fried leveraging a VPN to watch television.</p>
<p>“[Bankman-Fried] subscribed from the Bahamas and used a VPN as if he were in the Bahamas when he was in Palo Alto and could have watched it on public TV. It shows the mindset. All things considered, I am going to revoke bail,” the judge said in a quote <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690080018565627904?s=20">cited</a> by the Inner City Press.</p>
<p>Then the judge and the U.S. government discussed sending Bankman-Fried to the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) or Putnam County Correctional Facility. The discussion concerning which jail to send him was about whether or not Bankman-Fried could still access a laptop.</p>
<p>“The FBI would assist with transporting him to Putnam. During trial, in the MDC,” the prosecutor <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690081938743218178?s=20">said</a> and the judge agreed. The prosecutor further noted that there was “a reason for concern,” and further <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690083129292095488?s=20">stated</a> “who knows what mischief he could accomplish in the next few days.”</p>
<p>Russell Lee then detailed that after the judge’s decision was made, U.S. Marshals moved in to arrest Bankman-Fried. He had to take off his jacket and tie and remove his shoelaces. “Now, still in [the] courtroom, handcuffs are applied to Sam Bankman-Fried. He&#8217;s taken out the door,” Russell Lee’s account of the proceedings <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690084652805996544?s=20">explained</a>.</p>

<h2>SEC Seeks Public Opinion on Spot Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>The SEC put out a 34-page <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2023/34-98112.pdf">request for comment</a> on the Ark Invest and 21Shares application, seeking views on whether the proposal meets regulatory standards. The move pushes any decision on the bitcoin ETF beyond the initially reported August deadline.</p>
<p>The agency asked for public input on concerns around potential manipulation of the proposed ETF and the underlying bitcoin market. It raised questions about whether the CME bitcoin futures market is a “regulated market of significant size” for the spot ETF.</p>
<p>The SEC also seeks feedback on the liquidity and efficiency of bitcoin markets and plans for the ETF sponsors to share surveillance data with the agency. “Written data, views, and arguments&#8221; are due in 21 days, the request details.</p>
<p>This marks the latest roadblock for approval of a spot bitcoin ETF after years of applications. The SEC has greenlighted bitcoin futures ETFs but resisted spot funds over worries about manipulation and insufficient regulation of crypto markets.</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s request likely extends the long wait for a spot bitcoin ETF, which issuers say would provide a safer way for mainstream investors to gain exposure. The SEC will weigh the new feedback before making any final decision on the Ark and 21Shares application. The senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1690009258643890176?s=20">said</a> the SEC move was “pretty standard.”</p>

The majority of value locked comprises 75,244 ether and nearly $26 million worth of the USDC stablecoin.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Coinbase&#x2019;s Base Grows to $175 Million TVL</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
As one of the pioneer publicly-listed firms to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/base-opens-ethereum-bridge-mainnet-to-launch-august-9/">roll out</a> its own L2 blockchain, Coinbase&#x2019;s Base has witnessed consistent growth. On July 30, 2023, daily active Base users reached 55,417 and surged to an all-time high of <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2839431/4741865">136,047</a> just 11 days later. This surpassed L2 Optimism&#x2019;s <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/optimism">114,736</a> daily active users on the same day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Unlike Coinbase&#x2019;s Base protocol, Optimism&#x2019;s usage also benefited from the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-opens-probe-into-worldcoin-personal-data-treatment-procedures/">Worldcoin</a> launch since its native asset WLD resides on the L2 network. At 9:00 a.m. (ET) on Friday, August 11, 2023, the total value locked (TVL) within Base was approximately $175,915,994 based on Dune Analytics metrics.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://dune.com/tk-research/base">Dune data</a> shows the Base TVL mainly consists of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> and USDC with 75,244 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> and 26,075,940 USDC secured in Coinbase&#x2019;s layer. About 6,428,425 DAI is also circulating on Base along with 2,183 CBETH &#x2014; Coinbase&#x2019;s liquid staking Ethereum derivative token.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Data from defillama.com <a href="https://defillama.com/chains">reveals</a> that on August 11, Base&#x2019;s TVL would have ranked beneath Cardano&#x2019;s TVL, if it were listed. At that time Cardano&#x2019;s TVL stood at $179.17 million spread across 24 defi protocols and encompassing 36,160 users. Surpassing Bitcoin&#x2019;s value locked at $171.73 million &#x2014; Base&#x2019;s TVL lags compared to Arbitrum and Optimism with respective TVLs of $849.42 million and $1.928 billion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Base&#x2019;s <a href="https://dune.com/tk-research/base">daily transaction count</a> peaked at 607,699 on July 30 and achieved 579,752 transfers on August 10. Coinbase&#x2019;s defi solutions have become prominent fixtures in the ecosystem as the company&#x2019;s liquid staking derivative protocol holds the <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">second-largest</a> number of ether locked, under Lido Finance.&#13;<br />
