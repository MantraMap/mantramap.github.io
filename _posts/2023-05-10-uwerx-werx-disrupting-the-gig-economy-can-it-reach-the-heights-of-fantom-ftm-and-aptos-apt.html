<p>Blockchain technology penetrates markets at an astounding rate; even the European Banking Federation has recently pushed for a digital euro. But beyond this, crypto projects and their blockchain fundamentals are transforming traditional industries. A classic example would be Uwerx, totally disrupting the gig economy, which many analysts believe could reach the heights of Fantom (FTM) and Aptos (APT) in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX) Tackling Freelancing&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freelancing has been the pervading trend in the jobs sector for the past several years, and given how popular it is amongst millennials, experts expect it to be the defining work trend of the decade. Forbes quoted Kasriel, Co-chair of the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s council on the Future of Gender, Education, and Work: &lsquo;&lsquo;Increased earnings contributed to total freelance earnings of $1.4 trillion, up from $1.1 trillion last year. To me, that is a shockingly high number.&rsquo;&rsquo; Uwerx currently raises funds to build and deploy a new decentralized freelance marketplace on the Polygon (MATIC) network. Uwerx has outlined a plan to develop this service with freelancers at the forefront and will include in-built collaboration tools, transparent pricing, and personalized matching. Additionally, Uwerx will incentivize freelancers with the WERX token, which powers the entire platform; this is on top of being more cost-efficient and trusted than the current market incumbents. Analysts have pointed to Uwerx&rsquo;s market fit and stated that the token may trade as high as $4 by 2024- a massive movement from its presale price of $0.225. Fantom (FTM) Price PredictionFantom (FTM) enjoyed meteoric success in 2021 with the rise of the alternative layer one narrative. Analysts believe that Uwerx could display similar growth metrics as Fantom (FTM) did in its early days. Fantom&rsquo;s (FTM) growth has not stopped, largely thanks to the Fantom (FTM) Foundation, which has continued to drive adoption and development through unique incentive schemes such as the gas monetization program. Fantom (FTM) trades at $0.37, with analysts giving price predictions ranging between $0.79 and $0.88 in 2024. Fantom (FTM) still has room to grow, but the time to buy Fantom (FTM) for outrageous returns was in 2020.Aptos (APT) Price Prediction Aptos (APT) is a layer one blockchain that received criticism due to the amount of Aptos (APT) tokens held by insiders and venture capital investors. But this did not stop Aptos (APT) from rallying impressively throughout the start of this year. Aptos&rsquo;s (APT) pivot towards GameFi has excited investors and analysts, and GameFi seems to be a perfect application for the Aptos (APT) chain, given its excellent throughput. Aptos (APT) trades at $8.35, with price predictions from analysts putting its price between $21 and $24 in 2024. Join the Presale Today&nbsp;</p>
