<p>Russia launched a cross-border payment system &ldquo;bound by no restrictions&rdquo; where digital currencies can settle cross-border transactions. </p>
<p>On Monday, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov announced that the country is to implement a new cross-border payment system &ldquo;bound by no restrictions.&rdquo; Minister Siluanov said digital currencies could be used for international payments without interference.</p>
<p>Russian news outlet Tass reported the news.</p>
Russia Introduces an Unrestricted Crypto Cross-Border Payment System
<p>The finance minister is quoted as saying:</p>

<p>We are launching an alternative system of payments based on modern technologies (digital financial assets, digital currencies).</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>Digital currencies could be used in cross-border payments. This is just at the earliest phase of discussions, but the future lies with the use of the digital ruble, the digital yuan, and other similar currencies.</p>

<p>Minister Siluanov emphasised:</p>

<p>This is a system of payments that is bound by no restrictions. Two parties come to an agreement, make settlement payments, and no other country could step in and freeze such payments.</p>

Russia Crippled by Economic Sanctions
<p>Following Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Western nations imposed harsh economic sanctions on the Federation. In a bid to circumvent the sanctions and a bit of desperation, the State Duma &ndash; the lower house of parliament, said it would consider a bill that would legalise a crypto market within the country.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s infamous president, Vladimir Putin, criticised the sanctions against his home country, labelling them as &ldquo;illegitimate restrictions.&rdquo; President Putin pointed out that the current global financial system is highly monopolised and expressed the need for a global payment system powered by blockchain technology devoid of interference. He added:</p>

<p>The existing system of international payments is expensive, the system of its correspondent accounts and regulation are controlled by a narrow club of states and financial groups.</p>

Bank of Russia Tests International Crypto Payments
<p>Not long after President Putin commented on the usefulness of a blockchain-based global payment system, the Bank of Russia (BoR) said it was planning to test the use of cryptocurrencies for international payments within a regulatory sandbox framework.</p>
<p>First Deputy Chairperson of the Central Bank, Olga Skorobogatova, said the BoR would implement a pilot project with interested market players. She added:</p>

<p>We currently plan to test using cryptocurrency for international payments, meaning for international economic activities, within the framework of the regulatory sandbox.</p>
