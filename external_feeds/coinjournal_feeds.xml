<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>The decentralised application (Dapp) industry saw a 50% growth in unique active wallets in 2022.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>DappRadar&rsquo;s 2022 report shows that DeFi, gambling and blockchain games dapps were the most popular.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>However, DeFi protocols unique active wallets grew only 2% even as total value locked (TVL) by 73%.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">2022 has been one of the most brutal for the cryptocurrency industry, with the crypto winter punctuated not just with plummeting prices but also major negative events. FTX&rsquo;s implosion is a case in point, DappRadar, the world&rsquo;s largest dapps store, noted in its <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/dapp-industry-report-2022-dapp-industry-proves-resilient-in-crypto-winter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dapp Industry Report 2022</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But despite the turmoil and the ongoing bear market, crypto has shown a resilience that&rsquo;s reflected in events such as Ethereum&rsquo;s successful Merge that has seen energy consumption decline by 99.9%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The year has also witnessed several other surprising growth metrics, DappRadar indicated in the end-of-year report. One of these is the significant growth in a key metric for the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps/">decentralised applications</a> (dapps) sector &ndash; an increase in overall daily unique active wallets.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Dapps saw 50% growth in unique active wallets</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to the DappRadar report, the dapp industry registered a 50% increase in daily unique active wallets (dUAW) for 2022. Per the data, dUAWs rose from average of 1.58 million in 2021 to over 2.37 million in 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As per the report, DeFi, gambling, and games were the most popular dapps categories. Although DeFi activity reduced, with dUAW only increasing by 2% to a daily average of 652,970 from 641,510 in 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gambling dapps registered 53,364 dUAW in 2021, but that number increased by 106% in 2022 to reach an average of 110,140 dUAW.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blockchain-based games also saw a significant jump in daily unique active users, with an 85% increase in 2022 pushing the metric from 622,620 dUAW to 1,152,255 daily unique active wallets.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">DeFi industry TVL decreased significantly in 2022</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While the dapps industry remains on the path to greater adoption &ndash; we <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/defi-sees-31-jump-in-users-despite-2022-market-conditions/">recently highlighted</a> the sector saw a 31% growth in users in Q3, 2022 &ndash; the Total Value Locked (TVL) shrank massively amid the bear market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2022, DeFi TVL decreased by 73.97% to $55 billion as of December, down from the all-time high above $256 billion in December 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the significant declines, the top two DeFi chains remain as Ethereum and BNB Chain &ndash; which have unfortunately seen their TVL shrink by 74.56% and 62.5% respectively in 2022. Meanwhile, layer2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism have fared better. For instance, Arbitrum&rsquo;s TVL only fell 12% while Optimism&rsquo;s jumped 127%</p>

<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>Binance Feed offers access to content across 400+ cryptocurrency and Web3-focused topics.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Global cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a> has today unveiled new features for its Web3-focused social platform Binance Feed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to details the exchange shared with <em>CoinJournal</em> on Thursday, the new features will allow users to experience <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/">crypto news</a> and content creation seamlessly on different devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The updated version also features a redesigned profile section that offers full customizability for creators and a &lsquo;poll&rsquo; and &lsquo;emoji animations&rsquo; section that allows for dynamic and interactive engagements for the community members.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>That&rsquo;s not all.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the press release, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;comment&rdquo; feature that the community can tap into to foster greater engagement and participation.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">A platform for latest Web3 news and trends</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Binance launched the Binance Feed platform in October this year, designing it as a single touchpoint for the crypto community to access the latest trends and news in crypto and Web3. The social platform brings together content creators, thought leaders and influencers and covers more than 400 topics within the crypto and Web3 space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Binance Feed gives me news on the move and at times faster than Twitter. That&rsquo;s the reason why I am using it. Compared to other platforms, Binance has a more active base of users, and the feeds are more timely</em>,&rdquo; Anndy Lian, a Binance Feed contributor, said in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since its debut, the social platform has registered nearly one million daily active users, with 50% month-over-month growth. There are also more than 1,200 creators currently sharing content, while some of the leading crypto publications have registered more than 30,000 followers already.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The service has been accessible on the App Pro Mode since its launch, and also on desktop from November this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 22nd December, 2022, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p><i>-The strategic partnership will allow AFA to engage fans with a better understanding of how the metaverse works, how to contribute and benefit, while also expanding fan engagement and connecting fans to the teams and players they admire&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>-The partnership represents the first Argentinian football presence in the metaverse and the first time for Upland to offer exclusive in-game video footage ownership to fans</i></p>
<p>The Argentine Football Association (AFA), FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022&trade; World Champions, and <a href="https://upland.me/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Uplandme, Inc.</u></a> the leading metaverse platform in mapping the real world that already has more than 3 million registered accounts, today announced the signing of an official license agreement to bring the First Division Argentina (Professional Football League or short &ldquo;LPF&rdquo;) to the Upland metaverse.</p>
<p>This strategic partnership will allow AFA and LPF to engage Argentinian fans with the metaverse, contributing to the digital community while benefiting from the extensive participation of the global Argentinian football community, connecting users with their teams and favorite players.</p>
<p>Not only does Upland connect fans, collectors and players from around the world in a single virtual network, but the open metaverse platform also has various gamified opportunities for users to interact with a complete set of iconic Argentine football digital collectibles including teams, Clubs, Players, Tickets, Gameplay Footage, Historical Moments, Platform Exclusive Moments, and the Official Upland Market.</p>
<p>This agreement is a further expression of the internationalization of the Argentine Football Association and the reach of the Argentine Professional Football League brand, attracting new fan audiences: global gamers, web3 enthusiasts and collectors of digital assets in virtual markets.</p>
<p>This deal represents the first presence of Argentine soccer in the metaverse and the first time Upland has offered exclusive ownership of in-game video to its fans. During the next four years, a new source of income will be created for the Argentine Professional Football League, through the acquisition by the user of multiple assets of virtual goods licenses.</p>
<p>Through this strategic partnership, Argentine soccer fans will gain a unique experience within the metaverse benefiting from a community environment focused on first division football.</p>
<p>Unique to Upland, fans can start virtual businesses to resell LPF virtual goods and other digital collectibles in player-owned and operated shops located on their virtual properties &ndash; including the 22 cities that are already open in Upland. Upland&rsquo;s agreement with the Argentine Football Association also expands its involvement with global and European football following the recently launched partnership with FIFA, where fans are able to get access to the highlights of the FIFA World CupTM &nbsp;including the goals of the final as digital collectibles.</p>
<p><b>Claudio Fabian Tapia, President of AFA, said:</b> &ldquo;We are very happy to present this new commercial strategic agreement with Upland. The Argentine Professional League has long awaited opportunities to take advantage of emerging technologies to enhance our League&rsquo;s fan experience. This agreement allows us to partner with the best creators of technology and new digital products and thus generate a new source of income for all participating clubs. We welcome Upland as a new commercial partner of our Argentine Football Association and the Argentine Professional Football League.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Dirk Lueth, Co-founder and Co-CEO of Upland, said:</b> &ldquo;We are thrilled with the completely loaded licensing agreement and partnership with the AFA to continue to expand Upland&rsquo;s footprint and community around the world. With AFA, we are able to offer more opportunities than ever before to Argentinian fans new and old, empowering them with the true meaning of web3, which is community-focused and entrepreneurial, allowing fans to contribute ideas and creations to showcase their team pride in engaging new ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Leandro Petersen, Chief Commercial Marketing Officer of AFA, said:</b> &ldquo;Upland is at the forefront of a new category of virtual NFT memorabilia. The platform uniquely combines digital collectibles uniting all global NFT markets into their own Metaverse. In this way, our Professional League will be able to get closer to football fans from all over the world and to the players who hope to be closer to the stars of our Argentine football teams every day. We are excited about the potential of this association and it is very important for us to continue generating new sources of income for AFA and the LPF. We continue with the expansion process started and develop digital products that increase the presence of Argentine Soccer in the world. With this agreement with Upland, we are achieving a great goal for the Argentine Professional Football League.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Crypto was crushed across the board, with all of the top 10 coins getting hammered</li>
<li>LUNA was the worst as it death spiralled to near-zero in May</li>
<li>Solana has lost 92% of its value this year, falling from the third biggest crypto to sixteenth</li>
<li>Three best performers have been BNB, XRP and Dogecoin, but they still pared back 56%+</li>
<li>Bitcoin dropped 64% and Ethereum fell 67%</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2022. What a year.</p>
<p>In crypto markets, it&rsquo;s safe to say that it hasn&rsquo;t been one the best. The world has transitioned to a new interest rate paradigm, with markets realising quite how much of the crypto space was predicted on overleverage at cheap rates.</p>
<p>That cheap credit is gone now and the rug of liquidity has been pulled, with market prices collapsing as a result. Throw in a few scandals &ndash; FTX, LUNA and Celsius, to name a few &ndash; and the markets have been absolutely torrid.</p>
<p>In this piece, we look back at the top 10 coins at the start of the year.</p>
<h2><strong>2022 seems a long time ago now</strong></h2>
<p>The below is a historical screenshot from the start of the year, taken off CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/22/1671717240998-052bb749-7b4e-4f1d-bbe4-e0835df7cc5c.jpg" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="473">Bitcoin is not far off a trillion dollars, trading close to $50,000 and leading the way for the market at large. Ethereum has recently dipped below $4,000, while the third spot is occupied by Binance&rsquo;s coin, BNB. </p>
<p>Tether is the first stablecoin on the list in fourth, while Solana jumps out next in fifth place. The coin, linked with a revered entrepreneur by the name of Sam Bankman-Fried, is marketing itself as an ETH killer and making serious gains, now over $50 billion in market cap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other stablecoin is USD Coin in seventh, while Dogecoin ranks tenth when excluding the stablecoins, or twelfth overall. There is also LUNA, or Terra, in ninth &ndash; the coin which powers the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem that is Terra.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life is good, life is fun, life is up-only. Sure, the market has peeled back a little from November, when Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $68,739, but prices are still high and profits are flowing. Happy New Year, and roll on 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>One year later</strong></h2>
<p>One year later, you could probably argue things are a little different. I have collated the performance of the top 10 coins (excluding the two stables) into the chart below:&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12247290">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p>Luna, obviously, has pretty much gone to zero. Solana comes in as the second-worst performer, losing a staggering 92% of its value in 2022. From being ranked as the fourth biggest crypto, it is now sixteenth. Avalanche has also killed investors, falling from eleven to eighteen and shaving 87% of its value in the process.</p>
<p>The best performers, on the other hand, are BNB, XRP and Dogecoin, the trio losing &ldquo;only&rdquo; 56%/57% of their value. BNB, despite the recent controversy around Binance, looks set to end the year as the fifth biggest crypto, having let USDC and USDT overtake it.</p>
<p>This year, it really has been only stablecoins that have been immune to the price action. Even Bitcoin and Ethereum are down 64% and 67% respectively. Again, all these figures would be enlarged even further if expanded back to all-time highs of November.</p>
<p>Investors will be relieved to see the year come to a close, such has been the punishment in markets. The only problem is, we are still in a high-interest rate environment, the industry is still dealing with the fallout of FTX, and the world is a very uncertain place right now.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The price of Bitcoin fell below $16,000 after FTX&rsquo;s implosion, but as <em>CoinJournal</em> <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-whales-gorge-on-another-726-million-worth-of-btc/">recently reported</a>, large investors appear to have used that as an opportunity to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/buy/">buy more</a>. That is interest that has reflected throughout the year as prices nosedived from last year&rsquo;s peak above $69,000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to an in-house metric Yahoo Finance uses to measure investor interest across the markets, BTC has seen a laser-like focus from investors even as prices plunged to lows last seen in 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-interest-surged-in-2022-as-crypto-winter-arrived-morning-brief-103134240.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> the company published on Thursday showed that the BTC/USD quote has so far accumulated over 157 million views in 2022. Ranked alongside other top assets, the flagship cryptocurrency falls within the top 10. Indeed, as of Thursday, bitcoin ranked 8th on the platform&rsquo;s list of top 10 trending tickers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking at the list, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) stock quote ranks first with more than 398 million views, followed by the three major US indices (the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq). Tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL) sits 5th&nbsp;with more than 249 million page views while Amazon (AMZN) comes next with 199 million views so far.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) is 25th on the list in terms of investor interest as measured by 63.8 million page views so far. Elsewhere, Coinbase (COIN) has also been on top of investors&rsquo; list of interesting assets, with the crypto stock ranked 30th after more than 57 million quote views.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The Terra Classic Shuttle bridge will shut down in January</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Terra Classic team announced via Twitter on Thursday that its Terra Classic Shuttle bridge will sunset on Jan. 31st, 2023, 0000 hrs (UTC). The team urged its community members to bridge assets back to Terra before then to ensure they don&rsquo;t lose their assets.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a> has resulted in LUNC outperforming the broader cryptocurrency market. At press time, LUNC is trading at $0.0001358, up by more than 6% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The broader crypto market has been trading in the red zone for the past two days. The total crypto market cap is now around $810 billion and could drop below $800 billion if the bearish trend continues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $16,883, down by less than 1% in the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Key levels to watch</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The LUNC/USDT 4-hour chart is bearish despite Terra Classic performing well over the last few hours. The technical indicators, however, show that LUNC&rsquo;s sentiments are improving.</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable fr-fil" style="width: 600px"><span class="fr-img-wrap">
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/22/1671714000374-6144be44-18ec-45bf-b26f-7899d9d31e60.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" width="600" height="285"><span class="fr-inner"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LUNCUSDT/?exchange=BINANCE"><u>LUNC/USDT Chart By TradingView</u></a></span></p>
<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">The MACD line remains in the negative zone, indicating that the bears are still in control of the LUNC market. The 14-day RSI of 48 shows that LUNC is no longer in the oversold region.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the bullish momentum increases, LUNC could move past the first resistance level at $0.0002074 before the end of the day. However, LUNC could find it hard to surpass the second major resistance level at $0.0002343 in the near term.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Where to buy Terra Classic now</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
                </p><p>As LUNC is such a new asset, it's yet to be listed on major exchanges. You can still purchase LUNC using a DEX (decentralised exchange) though, which just means there are a few extra steps. To buy LUNC right now, follow these steps:</p>

                                    <h3>1. Buy ETH on a regulated exchange or broker, like <a href="/visit/etoro-crypto?guid=OTgxNTU&amp;component=news-table-1inch" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored">eToro &rsaquo;</a></h3>
                    <p>We suggest <a href="/visit/etoro-crypto?guid=OTgxNTU&amp;component=news-table-1inch" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored">eToro</a> because it's one of the world's leading multi-asset trading platforms, an exchange and wallet all-in-one with some of the lowest fees in the industry. It's also beginner-friendly, and has more payment methods available to users than any other available service.</p>
                                    <h3>2. Send your ETH to a compatible wallet like Trust Wallet or MetaMask</h3>
                    <p>You'll need to create your wallet, grab your address, and send your coins there.</p>
                                    <h3>3. Connect your wallet to the 1Inch DEX</h3>
                    <p>Head to 1Inch, and 'connect' your wallet to it.</p>
                                    <h3>4. You can now swap your ETH for LUNC</h3>
                    <p>Now that you're connected, you'll be able to swap for 100s of coins including LUNC.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin was the best performing asset class between 2011 and 2021, but the year 2022 has brought nothing but pain</li>
<li dir="ltr">After rising 14X from its pandemic low in March 2020 to its all-time high in November 2021 of $68,739, Bitcoin has struggled amid risk-off environment</li>
<li dir="ltr">Pullback has been so severe that majority of the supply is in loss-making position</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">What a ride it has been for <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But as we close the chapter that is 2022, the party has turned into a nightmare for most. Literally, most. Because the majority of the Bitcoin supply, which as I write this is 19.24 million bitcoins, is in a loss-making position.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12215218">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I have <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/majority-of-bitcoin-addresses-now-underwater/"><u>written before</u></a> about this trend, and as the chart above shows, we have seen greater than 50% of the supply in a loss-making position before. But after a respite, the market has again careened downward after a certain Mr Bankman-Fried was exposed.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But it is quite the sobering statistic when considering that in the decade between 2011 and 2021, Bitcoin was the best performing asset class in the world. Exploding from fractions of a penny to near $69,000 last year, it made a lot of people very, very rich.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But for anybody who bought in during the pandemic, the story is likely very different. In extending out the above graph back over the course of the decade, the ups and downs are evident.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12215562">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    </strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Macro environment unprecedented for Bitcoin</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The one thing that is glaring is that for the first time in Bitcoin&rsquo;s history, it is now experiencing a bear market in the wider economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Launched in 2009, Bitcoin had, until 2022, enjoyed one of the longest and most explosive bull markets in financial history. Risk assets across the board went sky-high, with the S&amp;P 500 printing a 7X return from its low point amid the Great Financial Crash to its level at the start of 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12216031">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;The scandals and idiosyncratic risk in the cryptocurrency space have been many this year. Nonetheless, despite the torrid happenings in the crypto industry which have undoubtedly made things a lot worse, Bitcoin has plummeted due to the wider macro environment, which has made a mockery of any thought that Bitcoin is not a high-risk asset&rdquo;,&nbsp;</em>said Max Coupland, director of CoinJournal, when assessing Bitcoin&rsquo;s 2022 price action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On this note, when plotting Bitcoin&rsquo;s price level against the S&amp;P 500, all looks healthy. Only thing is, I cut the chart off at the start of 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12215880">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The below chart then does the same &ndash; plots the S&amp;P 500 against Bitcoin. Only this time, it focuses on 2022, showing that both the stock market and Bitcoin have plunged.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12215909">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    </strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">&ldquo;Bitcoin is uncorrelated&rdquo; narrative killed</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, the narrative that Bitcoin is uncorrelated is completely dead. Not only that, but the misguided thinking that led some to conclude that Bitcoin is an inflation hedge has been proven foolish.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is no other way to put it &ndash; Bitcoin has traded like a high risk asset.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In fact, it has traded like such a high risk asset that not only was it the best performing asset of the decade between 2011 and 2021, when markets surged up and all these risk assets printed meteoric gains, but now that we are experiencing the flipside, it has performed worse than nearly anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It has pulled back so severely that those gains which saw it claim that best performing asset title are now not enough to prevent the fact that most of the supply is held by investors in loss making positions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Blockchain shouldn&rsquo;t be blamed for FTX&rsquo;s collapse</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrency exchange&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/this-week-in-crypto-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>FTX collapsed</u></a> in November following the mismanagement of customer funds by Sam Bankman-Fried and his executives. Since then, the news of the collapse has dominated headlines, with regulators and legislatures in the United States currently talking about the best way to regulate the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, while commenting on the event, Pantera Capital&rsquo;s CEO, Dan Morehead, said FTX&rsquo;s collapse doesn&rsquo;t mean that blockchain technology has failed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a&nbsp;<a href="https://panteracapital.com/blockchain-letter/the-need-for-trustless-systems/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>letter to investors</u></a> a few days ago, Morehead said blockchain didn&rsquo;t fail. He added that there are regulated entities in the cryptocurrency space that are still working. He said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;There are exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp that, when a client sends money to them, they just put it in a bank. The solution is pretty straightforward. The narrative that blockchain skeptics and some regulators and politicians are pumping out misses the point. &nbsp;The collapse of FTX had nothing to do with blockchain technology. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not crypto that failed. &nbsp;Bitcoin and all the other protocols worked perfectly.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to centralised crypto exchange, Morehead added that decentralised protocols are still working fine. The Pantera boss pointed toward decentralised exchanges like Uniswap, 0x, 1inch, Balancer and Dodo, stating that they continue to work fine.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Safe entities are now attracting businesses in the space</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Morehead added that business in the cryptocurrency space is now going to safe and secure companies. Cryptocurrency companies need to be audited to ensure that their finances are fine. The Pantera Capital CEO said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Regulated, transparent, onshore, and/or audited exchanges are seeing a dramatic increase in market share. &nbsp;This is essentially getting back the customers who fled to offshore exchanges for more assets/potentially unregistered securities offered to trade, more leverage, and lower fees. &nbsp;Since October, the market share of exchanges like&nbsp;</em><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em><u>Coinbase</u></em></a><em>, Kraken, Upbit, and Bitstamp has increased 30 percentage points.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Morehead added that he hopes the trend continues as that would ensure the growth of the broader cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;</p>
