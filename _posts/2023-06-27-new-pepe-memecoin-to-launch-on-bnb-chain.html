<p>Eden Island, Republic of Seychelles, June 27th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>A new PEPE memecoin is launching, following hot on the heels of its Ethereum namesake. Issued as a BEP20 on BNB Chain, PEPE is a novel memecoin with a number of unique mechanisms programmed into its tokenomics.</p><p>Like the original PEPE token, which has proven a runaway success in 2023, the BEP20 PEPE draws its cues from the mischievous frog of the same name, whose design was derived from the webcomic "Boy's Club."</p><p>The market capitalization of the original PEPE token, which debuted on Ethereum in April, exceeded $1 billion on May 5th, prompting a new wave of memecoins, including a number of frog-themed efforts. Unlike subsequent memecoins, the PEPE (BEP20) has several unusual features programmed in including a syndication system designed to support price stabilization.</p><p>The team behind the BNB Chain PEPE aren&rsquo;t settling for just one memecoin either: they plan to launch multiple PEPE projects, all based on the loveable frog. 13 such launches have been cued up for 2023 alone.</p><p>Although each PEPE project will operate independently, the introduction of a "Burn &amp; Drop" system will govern the consortium. Burn &amp; Drop is a first-of-its-kind system in which burning one token leads to the airdrop of another.</p><p>To initiate a Burn &amp; Drop, two types of tokens are required. For example, this could involve a scenario in which Token A is priced at $1 and PEPE (BEP20) is also priced at $1. However, if the price of Token A were to drop to $0.8, Token A holders would have the option to burn their tokens on the Burn &amp; Drop platform, automatically receiving PEPE (BEP20) through an airdrop, and with Token A having been burned, its total supply would decrease.</p><p></p><p>By initiating the Burn &amp; Drop process between tokens, excess volatility can be reduced while possibly providing trading opportunities for arbitrage and intra-token trading. This logic is a fundamental component of PEPE (BEP20), and one which users can engage with directly within the platform.</p><p>In addition, PEPE (BEP20) has plans to introduce numerous services that will further extend the token&rsquo;s utility. To further increase interest in the project, PEPE (BEP20) is currently running an airdrop campaign on Twitter that&rsquo;s open to everyone.</p><p>About PEPEBEP20</p><p>PEPE is a project launched on the Binance Smart Chain, taking the form of a BEP20 token. The Pepe Syndicate and the unique "Burn&amp;Drop" mechanism of Pepe are designed to manage the token's price volatility. This is not a guarantee of price stability, but a mechanism to potentially mitigate price fluctuations. Furthermore, various projects that participate in the "Burn&amp;Drop" system collaborate with each other, fostering a robust Pepe Syndicate network.</p><p>For more information regarding the campaign, please visit PEPE BEP20's Twitter (@pepecoinbep20) or Join PEPE BEP20's Telegram</p><p>https://pepe.markets/</p><p> PEPEBEP20 is the source of this content.
