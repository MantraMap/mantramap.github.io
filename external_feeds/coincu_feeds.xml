<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Base Leetswap&#8217;s largest DEX has reopened trading for several tokens.</em></li>



<li><em>Users can make sales but cannot buy tokens because of the risk of re-attack.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, the exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/208077-leetswap-recovers-314-eth-resume-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recovered </a>about 400 ETH from the risk liquidity pool, and this money will be redistributed to different pools for a restart.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the official announcement from Leetswap, the largest DEX on the layer 2 Base platform, now DEX transactions have resumed, but users cannot buy tokens.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255.png"><img decoding="async" width="826" height="390" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255.png" alt="Leetswap Trading Restarted But User Can&#039;t Buy Tokens" class="wp-image-208276" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255.png 826w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255-300x142.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255-768x363.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-255-750x354.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" title="Leetswap Trading Restarted But User Can&#039;t Buy Tokens 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Specifically, transactions have now resumed on the DEX. Users can sell those tokens affected in their hack, as their remaining liquidity cannot be rescued by white hat hackers. A <a href="https://t.co/YWIrZag3eZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">URL</a> is attached to be able to withstand more loads if the leading site fails to load.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Maybe people didn&#39;t understand, we resumed trading to let you DUMP THE SHITCOINS WHOSE LIQUIDITY COULD NOT BE RESCUED.<br><br>DO NOT BUY ANY TOKENS AS THE DEX LIQUIDITY CAN AND WILL BE EXPLOITED BY HACKERS IF YOU DO.<br><br>We DID NOT RELAUNCH the DEX.<br><br>The contract code is immutable andâ€¦ <a href="https://t.co/3CLmnQMjpV" target="_blank">https://t.co/3CLmnQMjpV</a></p>&mdash; LeetSwap (@LeetSwap) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeetSwap/status/1687241614354227200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The purpose of trading resumption is to allow users to dispose of illiquid tokens. However, Do not buy any tokens because if you do, the liquidity of the DEX could again be exploited by hackers.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, on August 1st, the axlUSD/WETH pool in LeetSwap was hit by a price manipulation attack, and the loss amounted to around $620,000. Yesterday, about 400 ETH was recovered from the risk liquidity pool, and this money will be redistributed to different pools for restart.</p>



<p>The liquidity hack is the second-biggest LeetSwap mining after a project creator (believed to be Sam Bankman-Fried) withdrew $12.5 million from a Layer 2 Base meme coin, BALD. Launched in 2022, LeetSwap is the largest decentralized exchange on Coinbase&#8217;s Base network, which aims to provide higher transaction speeds and lower fees than Ethereum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SEC freezes assets of crypto mining firm over alleged fraud.</em></li>



<li><em>DEBT Box was accused of selling unregistered securities with false promises of cryptocurrency mining profits.</em></li>



<li><em>18 defendants were charged and accused of misappropriating funds for personal use.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taken decisive action</a> against Digital Licensing Inc., a Utah-based crypto mining company, for its alleged involvement in fraudulent activities. The commission announced an emergency asset freeze and obtained a restraining order against the company, which operates under the name DEBT Box.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249.png" alt="SEC Cracks Down On Crypto Fraud: 18 Defendants Charged In DEBT Box Scandal" class="wp-image-208262" width="929" height="523" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-249-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="SEC Cracks Down On Crypto Fraud: 18 Defendants Charged In DEBT Box Scandal 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to the charges, DEBT Box and its four principals, including Jason Anderson, Jacob Anderson, Schad Brannon, and Roydon Nelson, along with 13 other defendants, orchestrated a scheme that began in March 2021. They allegedly targeted hundreds of U.S. investors, raising a substantial sum of approximately $50 million by selling unregistered securities known as &#8220;node licenses.&#8221;</p>



<p>Investors were misled into believing that these licenses would facilitate cryptocurrency mining, promising potential increases in value over time. However, the truth was that the defendants were merely generating the cryptocurrency instantly using blockchain code, as revealed by the commission.</p>



<p>Tracy S. Combs, Director of the SEC&#8217;s Salt Lake Regional Office, expressed outrage at the defendant&#8217;s actions, accusing them of deceptive practices: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We allege that DEBT Box and its principals lied to investors about virtually every material aspect of their unregistered offering of securities, including by falsely stating that they were engaged in crypto asset mining,&#8221; Combs stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The complaint further claimed that the defendants misappropriated the raised funds for personal gains, including purchasing luxury vehicles and homes, extravagant vacations, and lavishing themselves and their acquaintances with cash.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-250.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-250-1024x536.png" alt="SEC Cracks Down On Crypto Fraud: 18 Defendants Charged In DEBT Box Scandal" class="wp-image-208263" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-250-1024x536.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-250-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-250-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-250-750x393.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-250-1140x597.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-250.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Cracks Down On Crypto Fraud: 18 Defendants Charged In DEBT Box Scandal 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>DEBT Box had purportedly propagated its fraudulent scheme through numerous online videos, social media posts, and events, falsely assuring investors of massive gains from their crypto mining endeavors. The SEC, however, asserted that the so-called &#8220;node licenses&#8221; were nothing more than a deceptive front.</p>



<p>In total, the commission charged 18 defendants for their involvement in the sale of unregistered securities offerings. The emergency asset freeze and restraining order come as the regulatory authorities ramp up efforts to protect investors from potential crypto-related scams and fraudulent activities.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>New York resident Ilya Lichtenstein confesses to $4.5 billion Bitcoin hack.</em></li>



<li><em>Lichtenstein admits guilt in money laundering conspiracy.</em></li>



<li><em>It was disclosed that Lichtenstein had converted some of the stolen assets into gold coins.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/03/new-york-man-admits-being-original-bitfinex-hacker-during-guilty-plea-in-dc-to-bitcoin-money-laundering.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em>, Ilya &#8220;Dutch&#8221; Lichtenstein, a New York resident, has confessed to being the original hacker behind the infamous 2016 cyberattack on Bitfinex, which resulted in the theft of $4.5 billion worth of Bitcoin.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-245.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="740" height="416" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-245.png" alt="New York Man Reveals $4.5 Billion Bitcoin Hack Confession On Bitfinex" class="wp-image-208257" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-245.png 740w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-245-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" title="New York Man Reveals $4.5 Billion Bitcoin Hack Confession On Bitfinex 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>Lichtenstein made this admission while pleading guilty to money laundering conspiracy charges in a Washington, D.C. federal court. The hacker&#8217;s identity had remained a mystery until this point, making the revelation a major breakthrough in the investigation.</p>



<p>During the plea hearing, it was revealed that Lichtenstein executed a multi-million-dollar exploit on the crypto exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/180518-bitfinex-gets-license-by-el-salvador/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitfinex</a> in 2016. He used a sophisticated money laundering process to move about 25,000 of the stolen bitcoin, eventually depositing the illicit funds into accounts controlled by him and his wife, Heather Rhiannon Morgan.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/204853-crypto-couples-dramatic-plea-deal-bitfinex-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">couple</a> had not been directly charged in the hack itself, but their arrest in February 2022 led to the seizure of over 94,000 bitcoin by the <a href="https://coincu.com/62720-doj-seizes-3-6-billion-2016-bitfinex-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Justice</a>, valued at around $3.6 billion. This seizure marked the largest in DOJ history.</p>



<p>Lichtenstein, who had been held without bond due to being considered a flight risk, will remain in jail until his sentencing on a count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He has, however, agreed to cooperate with federal investigators.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-246.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-246.png" alt="New York Man Reveals $4.5 Billion Bitcoin Hack Confession On Bitfinex" class="wp-image-208258" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-246.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-246-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-246-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-246-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="New York Man Reveals $4.5 Billion Bitcoin Hack Confession On Bitfinex 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>Meanwhile, Morgan, known by her stage names &#8220;Razzlekahn&#8221; and &#8220;The Crocodile of Wall Street,&#8221; also entered her guilty plea in the same case but has been free on $3 million bond since her arrest.</p>



<p>The stolen bitcoin, which was worth only $70 million when initially taken, significantly appreciated in value over the years, reaching an astonishing $4.5 billion. Lichtenstein&#8217;s elaborate money laundering scheme involved converting some of the assets into gold coins and hiding them at undisclosed locations.</p>



<p>With the unexpected twist of former President Donald Trump&#8217;s arraignment in the same courthouse, the case has drawn significant attention and intrigue, attracting plans for a Netflix series about the infamous Crypto Couple.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>BRICS alliance to discuss using local currencies for cross-border transactions in the August summit.</em></li>



<li><em>Aim to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar for global trade and boost local economies.</em></li>



<li><em>Move expected to strengthen intra-bloc trade and challenge Western dominance in finance.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The upcoming BRICS summit in August will see the bloc of five nations discuss the potential usage of their local currencies for cross-border transactions, according to <em><a href="https://watcher.guru/news/exclusive-brics-will-discuss-local-currencies-usage-august-summit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watcher Guru</a></em>&#8216;s report.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-243.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="980" height="426" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-243.png" alt="BRICS Nations Want To Dethrone The Dollar In Epic Financial Showdown" class="wp-image-208251" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-243.png 980w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-243-300x130.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-243-768x334.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-243-750x326.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" title="BRICS Nations Want To Dethrone The Dollar In Epic Financial Showdown 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>With a goal to strengthen their respective economies, <a href="https://coincu.com/188832-brics-economic-alliance-challenges-dollar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BRICS</a> aims to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar in global trade and initiate remittance for imports and exports using their native tender.</p>



<p><em>Reuters</em> had previously <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/brics-currency-not-august-summit-agenda-south-african-official-2023-07-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that a BRICS currency would not be on the agenda for the summit in South Africa. However, the leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa remain committed to shifting away from the U.S. dollar and exploring the use of local currencies for trade and settlements.</p>



<p>Anil Sooklal, South Africa&#8217;s Ambassador at Large: Asia and BRICS, clarified that there had been no discussions regarding a common BRICS currency. Instead, the focus is on trading and settling in local currencies.</p>



<p>The move is seen as an effort to challenge the Western dominance of global finance, particularly amid Russia&#8217;s sanctions-imposed isolation following its actions in Ukraine. Leaders such as Brazil&#8217;s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have supported the idea of a common currency to strengthen the bloc&#8217;s position in the global financial order.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with Watcher Guru, Ambassador Anil Sooklal confirmed that the BRICS alliance will indeed discuss matters related to using native currencies. This demonstrates BRICS&#8217; determination to sideline the U.S. dollar and establish their local currencies as major players in the global financial system.</p>



<p>The discussions at the summit will revolve around deepening the use of local currencies for international transactions, enabling BRICS nations to conduct trade without relying on the U.S. dollar. This strategic move is expected to invigorate local economies and bolster their native currencies in the foreign exchange markets.</p>



<p>By avoiding the U.S. dollar for intra-bloc trade, businesses within BRICS countries are likely to experience increased efficiency, faster transactions, and reduced costs. Furthermore, the alliance&#8217;s decision to utilize local currencies could extend a financial lifeline to other developing nations, helping them strengthen their economies.</p>



<p>It is widely believed that the joint efforts by BRICS nations to escape the pressure of U.S. sanctions on developing countries played a significant role in motivating this shift. As these economies grow stronger and move away from reliance on the greenback, the balance of global financial power could potentially tilt towards the East, potentially posing economic challenges for the U.S. and other Western countries.</p>

<p>The collaboration&#8217;s primary objective is to streamline the clearing processes for various digital assets, ensuring seamless transactions and bolstered risk management protocols. With <a href="https://coincu.com/201806-cboe-coinbase-reach-custody-sharing-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cboe Digital</a> being the first US-regulated crypto native exchange and clearinghouse combination platform offering leveraged derivatives products, the partnership sets the stage for future advancements in the digital asset trading landscape.</p>



<p>The strategic partnership grants Cboe Digital access to Crossover&#8217;s cutting-edge clearing solutions, catering to both spot and futures trades involving multiple digital asset execution platforms. As part of the agreement, CROSSx, Crossover&#8217;s flagship product, will be integrated with Cboe Clear Digital, the clearing division of Cboe Digital Exchange.</p>



<p>Crossover Markets Group has been at the forefront of developing proprietary trading technology to meet the unique liquidity requirements of financial institutions in the cryptocurrency market. Their execution-only Bitcoin Electronic Communication Network (ECN) product, CROSSx, facilitates spot cryptocurrency transactions for institutional and intermediary clients on a dynamic technological platform.</p>

<p>With the addition of CROSSx to its portfolio, Cboe Digital&#8217;s native exchange gains a significant boost in its capabilities. Institutional and intermediary clients now have access to a robust technology platform to execute spot cryptocurrency trades, complementing its native exchange. The clearing platform, Cboe Clear Digital, follows a central counterparty model, adding further value to the collaboration.</p>



<p>The launch of CROSSx in March marked a groundbreaking achievement for <a href="https://coincu.com/189241-crossover-markets-supports-hidden-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crossover</a>, as it became the first external technology venue to offer connectivity to Cboe Digital. The network received strong backing from reputable institutions, including US-based hedge fund Two Sigma and <a href="https://coincu.com/207659-laser-digital-was-fully-licensed-in-dubai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nomura</a>.</p>



<p>By joining forces, Crossover Markets Group and Cboe Digital are paving the way for greater institutional participation in the <a href="https://coincu.com/199318-cboe-updates-bitcoin-etf-spot-profile-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin market</a>, eventually unlocking its full potential. The partnership&#8217;s significance lies in its potential to drive the adoption of fungibility and attract more financial institutions to trade on CROSSx, with Cboe Digital serving as their credit counterparty.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Sandbox strengthens security measures by implementing KYC verification for its staking process, ensuring users&#8217; accounts are verified before participation.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hong Kong-based metaverse game, The Sandbox (SAND), has taken significant strides in fortifying its platform.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-238.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-238-1024x576.png" alt="The Sandbox Expands Offerings And Bolsters Security With KYC Verification" class="wp-image-208237" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-238-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-238-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-238-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-238-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-238-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-238.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The Sandbox Expands Offerings And Bolsters Security With KYC Verification 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>As metaverses continue gaining traction, the key to their survival lies in continuously introducing fresh and engaging user experiences. <a href="https://coincu.com/190439-the-sandbox-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sandbox</a> has recognized this critical aspect and implemented various developments to enhance user security and compliance.</p>



<p>One of the major updates <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame/status/1687084587061501952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> by The Sandbox is the implementation of Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for its <a href="https://coincu.com/184618-binance-nft-attracts-the-sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staking process</a>. By enforcing KYC verification, the platform aims to ensure that users&#8217; accounts are thoroughly verified before they can participate in staking or claim their earnings. While KYC has been a contentious topic in the crypto space, more prominent players are starting to adopt it as a means to combat bots and malicious actors. The Sandbox follows suit, prioritizing the safety and legitimacy of its user base.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-239.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-239-1024x576.png" alt="The Sandbox Expands Offerings And Bolsters Security With KYC Verification" class="wp-image-208238" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-239-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-239-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-239-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-239-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-239.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The Sandbox Expands Offerings And Bolsters Security With KYC Verification 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>Verified users on The Sandbox can now deposit new SAND tokens and claim their weekly rewards securely. Although unverified users are still permitted to withdraw their SAND, the platform seeks to incentivize participation in the staking process through the added benefits for verified users.</p>



<p>This move towards KYC verification might have been influenced by a security incident in May when the Twitter account of The Sandbox&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, Arthur Madrid, was <a href="https://coincu.com/190247-the-sandbox-co-founders-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacked</a>. During the breach, the hacker posted a phishing link for a fake SAND token airdrop, prompting the platform to remind its users to exercise caution and report any suspicious activity promptly. The incident highlights the urgency of strengthening security measures, thus making the KYC verification process an essential component of The Sandbox&#8217;s defense against potential threats.</p>



<p>Moreover, last year, The Sandbox introduced a KYC verification and sales raffle process to ensure a more equitable distribution of landowners. The metaverse platform has been dedicated to providing a transparent and accessible ecosystem for all participants. These initiatives have been outlined as part of The Sandbox&#8217;s comprehensive landowner roadmap, which serves as a guiding document for crucial milestones and future developments.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Marathon Digital Holdings achieved a record 1,176 BTC mined in July 2023, a 20% increase from the previous month and a 1,527% increase from last year.</em></li>



<li><em>The operational hash rate rose by 6%, and the installed hash rate by 5%, driven by the fully operational Ellendale facility in North Dakota.</em></li>



<li><em>The company owns 12,964 BTC and plans to sell some holdings for operational support and corporate purposes.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Marathon Digital Holdings, a prominent player in the Bitcoin ecosystem, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/03/2717834/0/en/Marathon-Digital-Holdings-Announces-Bitcoin-Production-and-Mining-Operation-Updates-for-July-2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> impressive updates regarding its Bitcoin (BTC) production and mining activities in July 2023.

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-233.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-233-1024x538.png" alt="Marathon Digital Holdings Sets New Bitcoin Mining Records In July 2023" class="wp-image-208230" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-233-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-233-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-233-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-233-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-233-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-233.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Marathon Digital Holdings Sets New Bitcoin Mining Records In July 2023 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>In July, <a href="https://coincu.com/195572-marathon-digital-issued-a-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> mined a total of 1,176 BTC, representing a 20 percent surge from <a href="https://coincu.com/200620-marathon-digital-holdings-sells-700-btc-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous month</a> and a staggering 1,527 percent surge compared to the same period last year. This remarkable increase can be attributed to the implementation of enhanced operational computing power and improved system uptime.</p>



<p>One of the key contributors to this achievement was the boost in the company&#8217;s operating hash rate, which rose by 6% to reach 18.8 exahashes per second (EH/s). Furthermore, the installed hash rate also witnessed a 5% increase, reaching 22.8 EH/s. The expansion was largely due to the successful completion of the Ellendale facility in North Dakota. With all six buildings now fully operational at Ellendale, the facility contributed an additional 7.6 EH/s to the company&#8217;s overall operational capacity.</p>



<p>Marathon Digital Holdings now boasts ownership of an impressive 12,964 BTC as of August 1, 2023. To support its monthly operations, manage finances, and for general corporate purposes, the company opted to sell 750 BTC during the month of July. Additionally, Marathon has plans to sell some of its Bitcoin holdings in the future.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s financial position has also seen a noteworthy improvement. As of July 31, 2023, Marathon reported $129.4 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, with $115.1 million being unrestricted. The combined balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and Bitcoin witnessed significant growth, surging from $278.2 million to an impressive $494.0 million compared to the same period last year.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Marathon Digital Holdings continues to make strides toward further advancements in its mining operations. The Garden City, Texas facility is nearing its launch, with tie-in work already completed and energization expected to occur soon.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the company&#8217;s joint venture in Abu Dhabi has shown encouraging progress, commencing hashing activities in early July and producing 16.8 BTC in its inaugural month. Marathon&#8217;s 20% ownership stake in the venture yielded a share of 3.4 BTC for the same period. The project&#8217;s operational hash rate is projected to reach 7.0 exahashes by the end of 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Layer 2 Base network to launch on August 9, with an Ethereum bridge for token movement.</em></li>



<li><em>The network aims for lower fees, appealing to diverse users from regular to DeFi participants.</em></li>



<li><em>&#8220;Onchain Summer&#8221; festival celebrates its arrival with art, music, and developer grants.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase, the prominent cryptocurrency exchange, is set to make a significant stride in the crypto space with the full public release of its Base network on August 9. Additionally, the exchange has already taken the initiative to launch an Ethereum bridge ahead of the scheduled date.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-231.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-231-1024x512.png" alt="Layer 2 Base Network To Launch On August 9, Unveiling Onchain Summer" class="wp-image-208222" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-231-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-231-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-231-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-231-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-231-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-231.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Layer 2 Base Network To Launch On August 9, Unveiling Onchain Summer 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>The introduction of the official bridge is <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1687088084704509952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected</a> to facilitate the seamless movement of tokens between the Base network and <a href="https://coincu.com/207287-ethereum-ico-investor-emerges-after-8-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, enhancing user accessibility and overall functionality.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/204074-coinbases-base-optimisms-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Base</a>, which operates on the OP software stack, is a Layer 2 blockchain that aims to offer lower transaction fees compared to the Ethereum network. This strategic move positions the network as a compelling alternative for a wide range of users, catering not only to Coinbase&#8217;s regular clients but also to participants in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sphere.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-230.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-230-1024x512.png" alt="Layer 2 Base Network To Launch On August 9, Unveiling Onchain Summer" class="wp-image-208221" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-230-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-230-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-230-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-230-1536x768.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-230-2048x1024.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-230-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-230-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-230-1140x570.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Layer 2 Base Network To Launch On August 9, Unveiling Onchain Summer 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>This official release follows the successful deployment of Base&#8217;s developer-only mainnet on July 13, which was primarily accessible to developers during its initial phase.</p>



<p>However, ahead of the full public launch, numerous users took advantage of a portal proxy contract and unofficial bridges to bridge assets to the network. This allowed them to participate in trading new <a href="https://coincu.com/207432-memecoin-bald-rug-pull-price-dropped-pver-80/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memecoins</a> being launched on the platform. While the bridge was initially accessible to a limited audience, its upcoming public launch opens up vast opportunities for users to harness the potential of the network.</p>



<p>In anticipation of the significant event, Coinbase <a href="https://base.mirror.xyz/h028XVTdP7QtZZfWAHuJ9OYmMNs0Fyi4e4fJZH_5ik4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the initiation of &#8220;Onchain Summer,&#8221; a month-long on-chain festival that showcases art, music, gaming, advocacy, and more. This festival, spearheaded by 50 prominent builders, brands, products, artists, and creators, will provide a fun and engaging experience for onchain enthusiasts throughout August.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/207917-coinbase-promises-to-integrate-lightning-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> is also encouraging developers and creators to join in the festivities, offering grants for projects developed and created on Base during the summer in collaboration with PropHouse. This initiative aims to foster innovation and creativity within the growing the ecosystem.</p>



<p>As the network opens its doors to the public on August 9, it is poised to revolutionize the crypto space by attracting a diverse audience of builders and users. With its commitment to lower transaction fees and seamless Ethereum integration, Base has the potential to carve a significant niche in the cryptocurrency landscape, empowering users to experience the full potential of blockchain technology.</p>

<li><em>Binance reaches 150 million users amid US legal challenges.</em></li>



<li><em>According to reports, Chinese users traded $90 billion on Binance in May.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance has once again demonstrated its remarkable resilience and growth as it celebrates reaching an impressive milestone of 150 million registered users.</strong></h5>

<p>The announcement was made by Changpeng Zhao, the CEO, and co-founder of Binance, on Twitter. This achievement comes despite the ongoing legal battles the exchange faces with United States regulators.</p>

<p>In a significant move, Binance has recently re-entered the Japanese market and obtained a license in Dubai. This expansion reflects the exchange&#8217;s commitment to catering to diverse global markets. In Japan, the exchange has officially launched its services, offering spot trading for 34 tokens, including popular cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, BNB, DOGE, DOT, ENJ, ETC, and LINK. The local cryptocurrency exchange service provider, formerly known as SAKURA Exchange BitCoin, Inc. (SEBC), has undergone a rebranding and now operates under the name Binance Japan Inc.</p>

<p>Despite navigating through various obstacles, the exchange has managed to capture the attention of millions of users around the world. However, recent allegations surrounding its operations in China have brought the exchange into the spotlight. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://coincu.com/207915-binance-defies-chinas-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that users conducted an astonishing $90 billion worth of crypto trades within China during May, as revealed through Binance&#8217;s internal platform &#8220;Mission Control.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Binance.com is restricted in China and inaccessible to users within the country. Despite this, SimilarWeb data shows that the exchange attracts significant traffic from various countries, including Turkey, Vietnam, Russia, Argentina, and India.</p>



<p>As the SEC increases its scrutiny of Binance&#8217;s activities in the United States, the exchange is exploring alternative markets for growth.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, Binance has witnessed an impressive increase of 22 million users in just three months, bringing its user base from 128 million in May to the current 150 million. Notably, in July 2022, the exchange had 120 million registered users, indicating a remarkable surge of 30 million users in one year despite the challenging conditions of the bear market experienced during the same period last year, according to <em><a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1687064530239778816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wu Blockchain</a></em>.</p>

<p>Amidst the legal challenges, the exchange remains determined to expand its user base and enhance its services. The exchange has recently introduced two new Launchpools to attract more users.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s growth is indeed impressive, but it is essential to recognize the legal challenges it faces in various jurisdictions. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has <a href="https://coincu.com/206434-binance-vs-cftc-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> the exchange and its CEO for allegedly operating an &#8220;illegal&#8221; exchange and a &#8220;sham&#8221; compliance program. The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly <a href="https://coincu.com/208039-binance-may-be-accused-of-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">considering</a> fraud charges against the exchange but is concerned about potential repercussions on the exchange&#8217;s users.</p>

<p>According to the filing, the Dubai branch had not conducted any business activities prior to its bankruptcy filing in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), making the resumption of operations unlikely. Moreover, FTX Dubai&#8217;s balance sheet was solvent, providing grounds for a voluntary liquidation process under UAE law. The voluntary liquidation would facilitate the timely distribution of the cash balance after settling all outstanding debts and liquidating assets. A hearing on this matter is scheduled for August 23.</p>



<p>The Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition that was filed in the United States included 102 associated businesses and organizations from across the world. One of the entities that are participating in the present legal processes is FTX Dubai, which was founded in February 2022 and is currently controlled by the company&#8217;s European affiliate.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/207888-ftx-creditors-frustrated-plan-get-out-bankruptcy/">FTX</a>&#8216;s move to remove the Dubai branch from the US bankruptcy proceedings highlights its intention to handle the subsidiary&#8217;s liquidation under the laws of the UAE, where it operates. By opting for a solvent voluntary liquidation process, the platform aims to expedite the distribution of funds and complete the settlement of obligations swiftly.</p>



<p>This legal development sheds light on the complexities and considerations involved in global cryptocurrency exchange operations and legal proceedings. As cryptocurrency markets continue to expand internationally, exchanges must navigate varying regulatory frameworks and jurisdictional implications to safeguard their interests and assets. The outcome of the upcoming hearing on August 23 will determine whether FTX Dubai&#8217;s liquidation process will remain under US bankruptcy proceedings or proceed independently under UAE law.</p>
