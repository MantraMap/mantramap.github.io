Bali police have arrested a car rental owner in the state for accepting payments in crypto assets. The arrest came after the state government warned against using cryptocurrencies as payment options for any transaction. Bali Police Worked Undercover To Arrest Car Rental Business Owner While working undercover as customers, Bali police agents arrested an individual identified as TS (33) on May 29 in Jimbaran, Badung, in Bali, Indonesia. The Bali Police’s Cyber Unit started its investigations following increasing reports of people using crypto assets for transactions in the state.

Prihasmoko revealed that TS had started accepting crypto payments from foreigners on the island three months ago.  And following his arrest, the police seized some of the suspect’s assets, including his mobile phone used for crypto transactions. They also seized an Indodax account, a Pajero Sport vehicle, his ATM card, a Telegram account, and Telegram screenshots. According to Nanang, using any other currency for payments or financial obligations except the Indonesian rupiah violates Indonesian law. Offenders of such law could face one-year imprisonment and a penalty fine of IDR 200 million. Bali Warned Against Using Crypto For Payments The government of Bali has previously warned against the use of cryptocurrencies for payments in the region. In a statement by Bali Governor Wayan Koster, the ban on crypto payments cuts across different areas such as shopping, accommodations, restaurants, rentals, and other activities.

He said the state has zero tolerance for violating laws and improper actions from tourists. According to the governor, foreigners violating Balian laws could face deportation,  sanctions, or penalty fines. Indonesia only encourages the use of its local currency, the Indonesian rupiah. It is the only legal tender permitted for conducting transactions in the country. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from TradingView
