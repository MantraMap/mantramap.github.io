<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Kenyans are intrigued by Worldcoin&#8217;s free WLD tokens for eye-scanning verification.</em></li>



<li><em>Quickmart Outlets in Nairobi attract enthusiastic young participants.</em></li>



<li><em>Privacy concerns and token volatility raise questions amidst strong investor support.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The new cryptocurrency Worldcoin has sparked immense interest among Kenyans, as the platform rewards users with free WLD tokens in exchange for verifying their humanity through retinal scans, according to <em><a href="https://nation.africa/kenya/news/kenyans-scanning-their-eyeballs-worldcoin-cryptocurrency-tokens-4319600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Nation</a></em>.</strong></h5>

<p>Launched just five days ago on Monday, July 24, the <a href="https://coincu.com/207022-worldcoin-security-audit-reports-92-6-fixed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldcoin</a> app utilizes special machines, known as Orbs, stationed in 35 countries, including Kenya, to perform the eye-scanning verification process.</p>



<p>The allure of receiving free tokens has drawn a surge of young people to at least 13 Quickmart Outlets in Nairobi, where these Orb devices are located. Eager participants can scan their eyeballs, and upon successful verification, they are rewarded with WLD tokens. These tokens can then be transferred to popular crypto exchanges, such as Binance, and used to purchase various other cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The value of the first 25 WLD tokens stands at around Sh7,786 ($55), offering early adopters a tangible incentive to participate in the scheme. James Makau, a bodaboda driver from Ruaka, shared his success story, having earned Sh6,461 ($45.6) from scanning his iris and subsequently converting his tokens into Kenyan shillings by trading them for USDT, a different cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Worldcoin, co-founded by <a href="https://coincu.com/187287-openai-founder-sam-altman-raise-100-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Altman</a>, the CEO of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT&#8217;s artificial intelligence platform, has ambitious goals. Their mission is to grant global market access to everyone by providing a verified digital ID, free crypto tokens, and a cryptocurrency wallet. According to their whitepaper, Worldcoin aims to create an inclusive digital currency accessible to people worldwide, regardless of their socio-economic status.</p>



<p>Despite the promising prospects, concerns loom over the true implications of this novel approach to identity verification. Worldcoin&#8217;s founders, Altman and Blania, caution that the journey will be challenging, and uncertainties remain in the outcome. To encourage widespread adoption, participants receive a few WLD tokens as compensation for their involvement, with the exception of the United States, where regulatory scrutiny has made this option unavailable.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Worldcoin Sparks Frenzy In Kenya: Free Tokens for Eye-Scanning Verification" class="wp-image-207118" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-750x422.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Worldcoin Sparks Frenzy In Kenya: Free Tokens for Eye-Scanning Verification 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>The core concept behind Worldcoin&#8217;s iris scanning system is to establish a trustless digital identity to combat the growing capabilities of AI and robots to imitate real humans. The free tokens, in addition to potentially granting voting rights within the platform, are intended to facilitate the cryptocurrency&#8217;s adoption on a global scale.</p>



<p>However, the initial performance of the <a href="https://coincu.com/206599-worldcoin-circulating-supply-111-million-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WLD</a> token has been volatile, with its value doubling shortly after launch but subsequently experiencing a sharp 90% drop. Moreover, the project faces challenges raised by the UK&#8217;s data regulator. The regulator emphasizes the importance of users being able to withdraw consent &#8220;without detriment,&#8221; a challenge given the immutability of blockchain technology, which stores data permanently.</p>

<p>Questions have also been raised by prominent figures in the crypto community, including Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Ethereum&#8217;s Vitalik Buterin, further adding to the scrutiny. Notably, Worldcoin has garnered significant support from various venture capital investors, such as Reid Hoffman, Andreessen Horowitz, and Coinfund, among others. Presently, 107 million WLD tokens are in circulation, with a notable concentration held by a limited number of entities.</p>



<p>As the excitement around Worldcoin grows in Kenya, the Office of Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) has issued a warning urging caution. The ODPC advises Kenyans against sharing sensitive personal data until they have been provided with sufficient information regarding how their data will be utilized within the platform.</p>



<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s innovative approach to digital identity verification and its incentivization with free WLD tokens have piqued the curiosity of many Kenyans. However, the venture faces challenges and scrutiny over data privacy and the volatility of its cryptocurrency. As the project evolves, careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits will be vital in shaping the future of this ambitious cryptocurrency initiative.</p>

<p>Speaking on the Unchained podcast with host Laura Shin, Torres <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ocDx7zI0uc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> the <a href="https://coincu.com/206974-sec-and-binance-unite-to-thwart-eeon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a>, led by Chairman Gary Gensler, of employing a &#8220;regulation by enforcement&#8221; approach towards crypto innovators. He argued that the actions taken by the SEC under Gensler&#8217;s leadership seemed arbitrary and capricious, asserting that the agency had declared war on the entire crypto industry instead of solely focusing on bad actors.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="466" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218.png" alt="Ritchie Torres Takes On SEC: Advocates for New Crypto Laws and Bipartisan Support" class="wp-image-207094" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218.png 700w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="Ritchie Torres Takes On SEC: Advocates For New Crypto Laws And Bipartisan Support 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>In alignment with his concerns about the SEC&#8217;s regulatory approach, Torres voiced his support for the recently advanced market structure bill, known as the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act. According to Torres, the FIT Act aims to clarify which crypto assets fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC. The bill proposes that the SEC would have authority over a crypto asset until it can be demonstrated that the asset is sufficiently decentralized. Once proven decentralized, the asset would then be categorized as a commodity and would be governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>



<p>On July 26, the House Financial Services Committee voted in favor of the FIT Act, with Torres being among the lawmakers supporting the bill.</p>



<p>Additionally, Torres threw his weight behind another bill intended to regulate stablecoins and ensure that these assets are fully backed by reserves. He referred to stablecoins as &#8220;the clearest usage case of crypto&#8221; and expressed his approval for giving stablecoin issuers the option to comply with either federal regulations or state regulations, such as New York&#8217;s BitLicense.</p>



<p>However, it was reported on July 27 that the stablecoin bill <a href="https://coincu.com/206573-house-lawmakers-locked-in-battle-stablecoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed</a> to reach a bipartisan agreement, despite Torres&#8217; endorsement.</p>



<p>Undeterred by the setback, Torres remained optimistic about the future of both bills. He revealed that the market structure bill received six Democratic votes, and he expected even more support for the stablecoin bill. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that the bill&#8217;s progress might be hindered if it fails to gain the support of Rep. Maxine Waters, the ranking member.</p>

<p>Responding to claims that Democratic party members were largely opposed to cryptocurrency development, Torres highlighted that recent cryptocurrency legislation had enjoyed bipartisan backing. He also noted that younger lawmakers appeared to be more open to crypto, while Republicans tended to embrace the crypto industry, possibly due to the party&#8217;s pro-business stance.</p>



<p>Previously, Torres had <a href="https://coincu.com/203714-ritchie-torres-urges-sec-to-rethink-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">penned</a> a letter to Gensler, urging the agency to reassess its regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies. This letter was prompted by a legal setback for the SEC in a case involving <a href="https://coincu.com/206896-ripple-prominent-attorney-to-withdrawal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a>, where a federal judge ruled that certain digital-asset transactions did not fall within the agency&#8217;s regulatory scope. Torres used this ruling as evidence to argue that cryptocurrencies themselves were not securities but could be included in investment contracts qualifying as securities.</p>

<p>This achievement underscores the growing popularity and adoption of NFTs within the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin NFT protocol has been gaining traction as a revolutionary way to tokenize and represent unique digital assets, ranging from digital art and collectibles to virtual real estate and gaming items. The exponential growth in the number of mintings reflects the increasing interest and confidence in NFTs as a valuable digital asset class.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the cumulative fee income generated from these mintings has reached a remarkable 1,863,9396 BTC, which is approximately equivalent to a staggering $54.5433 million. This substantial income demonstrates the economic viability and potential profitability of NFTs for creators, collectors, and investors alike.</p>

<p>The surge in minting activity and fee income showcases the Bitcoin NFT protocol&#8217;s robustness and scalability, capable of handling a vast number of transactions with efficiency and security. The protocol&#8217;s ability to process such a significant volume of mintings is a testament to the underlying blockchain&#8217;s strength and the community&#8217;s trust in the platform.</p>

<p>NFTs have emerged as a transformative force in the art, gaming, and entertainment industries, enabling creators to tokenize and sell their work directly to collectors without intermediaries. This decentralized approach empowers artists and content creators, allowing them to retain more control over their creations and receive fair compensation for their artistry.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Alameda Research seeks support from GBTC shareholders in a lawsuit against Grayscale and DCG.</em></li>



<li><em>The lawsuit alleges share redemption prevention and excessive fees.</em></li>



<li><em>Grayscale faces legal pressure amid wider GBTC discount.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In an ongoing legal battle, Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency investment firm that is currently facing bankruptcy, is <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/661579480/Motion-for-a-One-Week-Extension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calling</a> on shareholders holding at least 10% of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to participate in its lawsuit against Grayscale Investments and its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-1024x683.png" alt="Alameda Urges GBTC Shareholders Holding At Least 10% To Join Lawsuit Against Grayscale" class="wp-image-207071" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209.png 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Alameda Urges GBTC Shareholders Holding At Least 10% To Join Lawsuit Against Grayscale 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>The initial lawsuit was filed by <a href="https://coincu.com/204571-former-alameda-co-ceo-admits-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alameda</a> against Grayscale in March, accusing the crypto investment management company of preventing shareholders from redeeming Bitcoin and Ethereum trust shares and imposing excessive management fees.</p>



<p>Now, Alameda has revealed its intention to file an amended complaint against <a href="https://coincu.com/206678-grayscale-sec-concurrent-approval-bitcoin-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grayscale</a>, aiming to add additional plaintiffs who own a minimum of 10% of the outstanding shares of GBTC. The firm is in talks with several GBTC shareholders who are willing to join as co-plaintiffs, but an additional five days have been requested to confirm their participation and contribute to the amended complaints.</p>



<p>Recently, Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey <a href="https://twitter.com/davidfbailey/status/1684725681828028416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urged</a> GBTC shareholders to register on RedeemGBTC.com and become part of the lawsuit, emphasizing that the outcome would affect all shareholders and determine their position as investors or hostages in the dispute.</p>



<p>The initial lawsuit by Alameda Research <a href="https://coincu.com/171897-ftx-alameda-sues-gray-scale-dcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> Grayscale of enriching itself at the expense of shareholders due to its high fees and refusal to allow share redemptions from its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust. The legal pressure adds to the challenges faced by DCG after its unit, Genesis Global Trading, experienced bankruptcy following the crypto market downturn.</p>

<p>Notably, last year, Grayscale <a href="https://coincu.com/201403-grayscale-opposes-sec-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when the regulator rejected the company&#8217;s proposal to convert GBTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Despite this, Grayscale continues to impose fees much higher than those typically paid to advisers on crypto-tied ETFs, as alleged by Alameda Research, causing significant financial harm to the firm.</p>



<p>In May, Grayscale sought to dismiss Alameda&#8217;s lawsuit, arguing that such allegations could only be brought by at least two unaffiliated shareholders owning a minimum of 10% of the Trusts&#8217; shares.</p>



<p>As the legal dispute unfolds, GBTC&#8217;s discount to its net asset value (NAV) has recently <a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widened</a> to 30.11%, after a period of narrowing earlier in the month. Grayscale is currently embroiled in a separate legal battle with the SEC over the approval of its plan to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The outcome of these legal proceedings could have significant implications for both Grayscale and GBTC shareholders.</p>

<li><em>Hester Peirce SEC commissioner expresses concerns over non-audit work for crypto firms.</em></li>



<li><em>Crypto firms fear lack of transparency due to SEC statement discouraging non-audit work by accounting firms.</em></li>



<li><em>Accounting firms urged to adopt all-or-nothing approach to engagements with crypto firms to prevent a lack of transparency for investors.</em></li>

<p>Pierce believes that the statement might discourage sincere efforts by crypto firms due to fear, as they might refrain from providing transparency regarding proof of reserves.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crypto platforms &amp;  their accountants should be clear about what proof of reserves is and isn&#39;t &amp; customers should understand the limitations, but why would we want to discourage good-faith efforts to provide more transparency? <a href="https://t.co/fsuxUGPrrb" target="_blank">https://t.co/fsuxUGPrrb</a></p>&mdash; Hester Peirce (@HesterPeirce) <a href="https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1684689141789798400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 27, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>While Pierce noted that crypto firms and accountants should ensure transparency regarding proof of reserves, specifying what is and isn&#8217;t acceptable, she questioned why accounting firms should be cautious of providing assurance work to crypto firms. She believes that discouraging good-faith efforts to provide transparency is not an ideal approach to regulate the crypto industry.</p>

<p>Munter suggested that accounting firms adopt an all-or-nothing approach to engagements with crypto firms, as partial engagements might result in crypto firms selectively choosing only certain aspects of the business to show accounting firms and then presenting that information as a full audit to clients. Munter believes that such an approach will lack transparency for investors.</p>



<p>According to Munter, if an accounting firm discovers that a client is making misleading statements about its non-audit work to the public, it should take a firm stance and consider making a &#8220;noisy withdrawal, disassociating itself from the client, including by way of its own public statements,&#8221; or report the firm to the SEC.</p>



<p>Mike Shaub, an auditing and accounting ethics professor at Texas A&amp;M University, commented on the statement in a July 29 tweet. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It seems likely they would in virtually every circumstance.

<p>He stated that auditors are bound by confidentiality, which makes it difficult to make public statements as Munter suggested. Shaub also highlighted the issue of some accounting firms aligning themselves with cryptocurrency expertise to boost their reputation but becoming unresponsive when problems surface. Overall, it is important to balance transparency and confidentiality while regulating the crypto industry.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Figure Technologies lays off 90 employees ahead of IPO.</em></li>



<li><em>The lending business shows strong financial performance.</em></li>



<li><em>The company remains optimistic about future prospects.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blockchain-powered fintech start-up Figure Technologies Inc. has made significant strides in its financial performance despite facing challenges in the crypto industry. According to documents reviewed by <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-28/mike-cagney-s-figure-lays-off-20-of-staff-amid-ipo-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, the company recently laid off 90 employees, approximately 20% of its workforce, as it gears up for a planned initial public offering (IPO) for its lending business next year.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-1024x576.png" alt="Figure Lays Off 20% Employees, But Eyes Bright Future With Upcoming IPO" class="wp-image-207056" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2203.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Figure Lays Off 20% Employees, But Eyes Bright Future With Upcoming IPO 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>Figure Technologies was co-founded by Mike Cagney, the former CEO of Social Finance Inc. (SoFi), with the vision of leveraging <a href="https://coincu.com/205617-us-gao-urges-stronger-oversight-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain technology</a> to create innovative financial products. Like many other crypto-related start-ups, Figure had experienced talent loss and funding difficulties during an industry downturn.</p>



<p>However, the company&#8217;s financial milestones present a promising outlook. During the second quarter of the current year, Figure&#8217;s lending business achieved a record volume of $900 million. Additionally, the company reported $83.5 million in revenue in the first half of the year and generated $2.7 million in adjusted profit during the second quarter. According to a letter from Cagney to Figure investors and partners, the lending business demonstrated profitability with a more than 50% contribution margin.</p>



<p>Encouraged by the impressive performance, Figure is now looking to take its lending division, known as &#8220;LendCo,&#8221; public in early 2024. Cagney expressed optimism about achieving a $2.5 billion valuation for LendCo during the IPO, which would surpass the company&#8217;s last valuation of $3.2 billion in a venture-backed funding round in 2021.</p>



<p>Despite the positive developments, the recent layoffs raised concerns among some employees due to their timing. The meeting held to address these job cuts saw several inquiries considered too sensitive to address directly, according to documentation of the event. Approximately half of the laid-off employees were engineers.</p>

<p>In response to the layoffs, Senior Vice President of Engineering, Matt Conroy, sent a message on an internal Slack channel, urging remaining employees to be understanding of the company&#8217;s leadership. Conroy emphasized the bright future ahead, pointing to the strong performance during the first half of 2023 and ambitious goals for 2024. These goals include the planned IPO for LendCo and a potential IPO for their Markets business and other products.</p>



<p>In light of the tough market conditions earlier in the year, Figure Technologies is also seeking fresh funds to navigate through challenges. Reports suggest that the US-based fintech is actively searching for investors to raise up to $100 million. Additionally, the company is exploring the possibility of spinning off some of its businesses.</p>



<p>Figure Technologies employs its Provenance Blockchain to develop traditional financial services, such as lending and payments. While the company faced setbacks in previous attempts to raise funds and go public, the recent financial successes and strategic plans indicate a determined effort to thrive in the market.</p>



<p>Looking forward, remaining team members may be reassigned to new product groups in the coming weeks as Figure Technologies continues its journey toward growth and financial stability in the ever-evolving fintech landscape.</p>

<p>The bank aims to leverage the innovative Ripple Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform to tokenize properties and facilitate faster loan issuance using digital Hong Kong dollars. This move signals a major step towards modernizing the real estate industry and embracing the potential of blockchain technology.</p>

<p>The collaboration between<a href="https://www.fubonbank.com.hk/en/home.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fubonbank.com.hk/en/home.html" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Fubon Bank</a> and Ripple showcases Hong Kong&#8217;s determination to become a frontrunner in adopting digital innovations in the financial sector. By incorporating CBDCs in the real estate market, the bank aims to eliminate traditional barriers to property investments and offer increased accessibility to potential buyers and investors.</p>



<p>During the third quarter testing phase, Fubon Bank plans to tokenize select properties from its portfolio, making them available for investment through digital Hong Kong dollars. Interested parties can acquire fractional ownership in these properties, allowing them to participate in the real estate market with smaller investment amounts.</p>

<p>One of the key advantages of the Ripple CBDC platform is its ability to provide instant settlement for transactions. By harnessing this feature, Fubon Bank can significantly reduce the time typically required for property transactions and loan processing. This improvement in efficiency will not only benefit customers but also enhance the bank&#8217;s overall operational performance.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Worldcoin published the security audit report on its official blog on July 28.</em></li>



<li><em>The report stated that 92.6% were identified as fixed, with the remaining bugs either mitigated or re-verified.</em></li>



<li><em>Regulators previously reviewed the protocol due to concerns about potential privacy risks associated with the collection and storage of sensitive biometric data.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Worldcoin published a security audit report on its official blog that starting April 2023, audit firms Nethermind and Least Authority conducted two independent security audits of the protocol.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Among them, Nethermind focused on examining the smart contract of the agreement and found a total of 26 issues. Of these, 92.6% were fixed after the verification phase, one bug was mitigated, and the other was confirmed.</p>



<p>The Least Authority focused on examining the cryptographic usage of the protocol, found three problems, and made six recommendations. All issues are &#8220;solved or planned to be solved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Worldcoin first surfaced in 2021 when it announced that it would give away free tokens to any user who verified their humanity, which they could do by scanning their irises with a device named &#8220;The Globe&#8221;. The project was co-founded by Sam Altman, the co-founder of AI developer OpenAI. The project started going public on July 25 after nearly two years of development and beta testing.</p>



<p>The crypto community was split when the project launched, with some participants seeing it as the beginning of a dystopian future where privacy would be eliminated. On the contrary, others see it as a necessary step to protect humans from malicious AIs.</p>



<p>Previously, the French and UK watchdogs had also warned that they would scrutinize the protocol with concerns about potential privacy risks associated with data collection and storage of sensitive biometrics.</p>

<p>The initiative is led by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), and supported by Senators Joe Manchin (<a href="http://d-w.va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D-W.Va</a>.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Their proposal, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, aims to enforce stricter regulation of digital assets to fortify national security and align the crypto ecosystem with the existing frameworks that oversee the broader financial system.</p>

To eliminate these illicit activities, the proposed measures would extend the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) responsibilities, including the Know-Your-Customer requirements, to various digital asset network participants, such as wallet providers, miners, and validators. Additionally, the bill plans to strengthen the enforcement of BSA compliance and mitigate the illicit finance risks of digital asset ATMs.</p>

<p>According to reports, in 2022, illicit digital asset transactions reached an all-time high of $20 billion. This alarming statistic highlights the need for more stringent regulations around cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, the bill has garnered support from unlikely sources in the banking world, such as the Bank Policy Institute and the Massachusetts Bankers Association. Senator Warren, a known critic of Wall Street and the crypto industry, has found common ground with these former adversaries on this issue &#8211; a mutual desire to steer cryptocurrencies into safer harbors.</p>

<p>The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act is a critical step towards combating the misuse of digital assets and ensuring greater security for the nation. The proposed measures will bring digital assets in line with existing financial regulations, thereby reducing the risks of illicit activities while also promoting safer and more transparent practices in the crypto industry.</p>
