</ul>
<p dir="ltr">IIn latest <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/cryptocurrency/">crypto news</a>, France&rsquo;s privacy watchdog is reportedly examining legal issues around recently launched Worldcoin (WLD), particularly its biometric data collection.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/frances-privacy-watchdog-says-worldcoin-legality-seems-questionable-2023-07-28/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> on July 28, the Commission nationale de l&rsquo;informatique et des libert&eacute;s (CNIL), had indicated it has questions over Worldcoin&rsquo;s requirements that include users scan their irises using an orb.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The CNIL has said it opened investigations after Worldcoin collected data from users in France, per details published in the Reuters report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Worldcoin offers access to a digital ID and free cryptocurrency (in countries where regulation allows) to people who sign up to a &ldquo;proof of personhood.&rdquo; Data shows the project created by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has seen increased sign ups since its launch on Monday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project says one unique person is scanning their eyeballs for the World ID every 7.6 seconds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since Worldcoin launched, proof of personhood demand has surged. On average, a unique human is now verifying their World ID every 7.6 seconds &amp; new records are being set daily.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience with the project as more work is done to better meet worldwide demand. <a href="https://t.co/gPmr0oQWCR">pic.twitter.com/gPmr0oQWCR</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has generated more than $1.2 million in its first month.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">SHMU&rsquo;s price is increased daily, with the presale set to last for eight weeks.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has underperformed this week. Bitcoin has lost more than 2% of its value in the last seven days and is now trading below $30k. At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $29,212.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the market&rsquo;s poor performance, Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has hit a new milestone. The presale has surpassed the $1 million mark in the first month of its presale.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">AI has become the rage in the world now. Following the launch of ChatGPT earlier this year, we have seen a number of AI solutions crop up to solve numerous problems within society.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is a project that is taking advantage of AI and blockchain technology to make it easier for people to create content and market their services.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to their whitepaper, Shiba Memu is designed to handle the task of 100 marketing agencies. The Shiba Memu machine is always active and is working 24/7 to find the best work going on in creative advertising, consuming it and generating better content marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is launching a meme token thanks to the explosive growth recorded by meme coins in recent years. In 2020, meme coins were practically unknown in the crypto ecosystem but grew to a market cap of over $20 billion within two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, Shiba Memu could be better than most of the meme coins currently available in the crypto market, thanks to its utility. The team explained that Shiba Memu has self-sufficient marketing capabilities powered by AI technology, making it a unique and attractive investment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Shiba Memu, users have a powerful AI that can create its own marketing strategies, write its own PR, and promote itself in relevant forums and social networks. Currently, Shiba Memu is available on the Ethereum and BNBChain blockchains.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale tops $1.2M</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is becoming quite popular amongst cryptocurrency investors despite the recent bearish sentiment in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presale has been on for less than a month, and the team has raised $1.2 million so far. The development team will use the funds to develop some of its products.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most of the funds generated from the presale would be used to develop Shiba Memu&rsquo;s AI technology. With the Shiba Memu AI technology, the platform can engage with users directly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The development team added that the platform would have a robotastic dashboard to interact with the AI, provide feedback, make suggestions, and ask questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a> to find out more about Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale event.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">It is hard to accurately predict Shiba Memu&rsquo;s price as the token is still in its presale phase. Currently, 1 SHMU = 0.016300 USDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team revealed that the&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> price increases every day at 6 pm GMT. In a few hours, the token will go for 0.016525 USDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">SHMU began trading at $0.011125 when the presale began and will trade at $0.0244 when the presale ends. Users can purchase the SHMU token using Ethereum, USDT, BNB and BUSD</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in Shiba Memu now?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">If you are interested in the project, then it is not too late to invest in Shiba Memu. the project&rsquo;s utility could make it one of the leading meme coins in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By combing AI and blockchain technology to ease marketing strategies for companies and organisations, Shiba Memu could gain massive adoption in the coming months and years.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the project gets the necessary adoption, SHMU, the native token of the&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> ecosystem, could record massive gains in the medium to long term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, if the broader crypto market enters a bullish cycle, SHMU could emerge as one of the biggest winners. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are up by more than 40% year-to-date.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the market fundamentals improve over the next few months, SHMU could record excellent growth once it starts trading on cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<li>Crypto.com has earned approvals from seven other regulatory bodies in the recent past.</li>
<li>The exchange&rsquo;s approval in the Netherlands comes weeks after Binance withdrew its license application.</li>
<li>Crypto.com seems to be beating its main competitor Binance in regulatory approvals around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>The well-known cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has made history by obtaining authorization for registration from the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) to provide its services in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Following careful adherence to the nation&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act, Crypto.com received the DNB&rsquo;s approval, demonstrating the exchange&rsquo;s commitment to upholding strict regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>This accomplishment, according to CEO Kris Marszalek, is a turning point for the company&rsquo;s service and demonstrates the exchange&rsquo;s commitment to cooperating closely with regulators to advance the industry responsibly.</p>
<h2>Crypto.com regulatory approvals around the world</h2>
<p>The latest endorsement for Crypto.com by the Dutch regulatory body adds to a long list of worldwide endorsements. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, as previously reported <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-com-completes-its-licensing-process-in-singapore/">here</a>, and the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority, as previously <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-com-secures-approval-as-a-crypto-asset-business-from-uks-fca/">reported here</a>, are among seven other regulatory bodies that have already approved the exchange.</p>
<p>The exchange has improved its standing as a trustworthy player in the cryptocurrency industry thanks to its outstanding success in navigating challenging regulatory environments and obtaining required certifications. Notably, Crypto.com recently acquired a regulatory licence in Spain, underscoring its unwavering commitment to upholding legal requirements.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Crypto.com wants to strengthen its relationships with EU authorities in anticipation of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/european-parliament-finally-adopts-the-markets-in-crypto-assets-act-mica/">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a> regulations that will change how EU countries deal with the cryptocurrency industry. By taking a proactive stance, Crypto.com is positioned to play a significant role in influencing the European crypto industry&rsquo;s future.</p>
<h2>Crypto.com in the Netherlands</h2>
<p>With each new regulatory approval, Crypto.com cements its position as a leading and trusted cryptocurrency exchange, bolstering investor confidence and opening up exciting possibilities for further expansion. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the exchange&rsquo;s dedication to compliance stands as a beacon of reliability, attracting both seasoned and novice investors.</p>
<p>Crypto.com&rsquo;s clearance by the Dutch Central Bank underscores the exchange&rsquo;s exceptional commitment to compliance and responsible practices. The company&rsquo;s growing list of approvals from various global regulatory bodies positions Crypto.com at the forefront of the crypto industry&rsquo;s transformation.</p>

<li>The British Museum is venturing into the Metervese following its partnership with the Sandbox.</li>
<li>Other museums including Ukraine&rsquo;s Kharkiv Art Museum have already ventured into the metaverse.</li>
<li>The Sandbox (SAND) token price reacted minimally following the partnership.</li>
</ul>
<p>The British Museum will be working with the Sandbox Metaverse development platform to bring it into the Metaverse, according to a July 27 <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame/status/1684581767158566912?s=20">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The partnership, according to the announcement, aims to develop fresh &ldquo;immersive experiences&rdquo; for users to learn about global history. The generation of a variety of digital collectibles will take into account the museum&rsquo;s various collections.</p>
<p>The chief operating officer and co-founder of the Sandbox Sebastien Borget called the partnership an opportunity to share the museum&rsquo;s collections with new audiences. He said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This is a great opportunity for The Sandbox players, regardless of where they are, to learn about and enjoy the amazing collections of human history, art, and culture in the British Museum.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>The British Museum ventures into Web3</h2>
<p>The partnership also involves the licencing partner for the museum, a Web3 platform called laCollection, which has previously worked with top museums all over the world to digitise their collections.</p>
<p>The British Museum may be entering the Web3 space for the first time at this time, but it is not the first time a significant museum has entered the Metaverse.</p>
<p>A new exhibition on the expanding nexus between art and blockchain debuted this past spring at the Centre Pompidou, one of France&rsquo;s top museums for modern art and the location of the continent&rsquo;s first modern art collection. As part of a permanent exhibition, the museum unveiled items from some of the most coveted nonfungible token (NFTs) collections in the world, including CryptoPunks and Autoglyphs.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the Kharkiv Art Museum, one of Ukraine&rsquo;s oldest museums of modern art, started an NFT collection as a fundraiser to support its operations and safeguard its cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The first museum in Europe to tokenize a work of classical art with a million-euro value was the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp, Belgium.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer revolutionises betting by making it possible to predict multiple events.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer launched a presale on June 13, which has been happening fast.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The token is a 50x investment in the future as blockchain-based betting gains prominence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">A few weeks since Chancer launched a presale, investors have accumulated more than $1 million of the tokens. Very few presales raise these amounts that quickly, underlying a strong interest in the token of the peer-to-peer betting platform. As the world&rsquo;s first decentralised betting ecosystem, investors believe Chancer could be revolutionary. That stems from the growing interest in betting, which Chancer aims to take to the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>About Chancer and its P2P betting model</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is a new blockchain-based betting platform. The platform will be powered by a $CHANCER token. The token will be the platform&rsquo;s medium of exchanging value and claiming winnings on successful bets and other rewards. There are a total of 1.5 billion Chancer tokens in supply, but only 65% are available for presale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer aims to become the go-to destination for decentralised social and predictive markets. Betting on Chancer occurs through a P2P model, where users set their rules and odds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Picture this: You expect candidate X to win an election. Your peers may hold a contrary opinion. So, you place a bet against them for this probabilistic outcome. Under normal circumstances, you won&rsquo;t be able to bet on such a political event. Chancer allows betting via these less popular events.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Through Chancer, investors can bet on many events. They simply create a P2P Chancer market for the particular event or incidence and bet on it. In other words, Chancer increases investors&rsquo; choice and flexibility in betting. This makes the platform a remarkable way to decentralise betting and enable investors to be in charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The exciting bit is that users are rewarded for creating the P2P markets. The use case makes Chancer more than a betting platform. Users can also generate passive income by sharing the platform and staking the native token.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How big is the P2P betting opportunity?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Since P2P betting is new, estimating the market size is down to estimations. However, it is easy to predict based on the market size and trends in traditional betting.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/sports-betting-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Market reports</u></a> point out that online sports betting was valued at $70.23 billion in 2021. This level is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.7% by 2030. Growth in technology and the proliferation of the digital arena are linked with these strong trends.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The projected growth in betting is positive for Chancer. Traditionally, sports betting dominated, but Cancer wants to bring new ways to bet. Coupled with the ever-growing popularity of blockchain, Chancer will craft a niche from traditional betting. It will also build a new niche that could increase the betting market size further through the P2P model.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given the above, Chancer&rsquo;s betting market size is huge, conferring significant opportunities to investors. A strong demand for the platform is positive for the token and its ability to return huge.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Chancer prediction in 2023, 2024, and the future</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Chancer token&rsquo;s long-term value will be derived from the platform&rsquo;s continued use and demand. As such, quantifying the future value would be highly speculative. Most cryptocurrencies have risen by thousands of percentages after finding and earning the market trust. Thus, a potential 50x increase or more in the future is probable if Chancer lives to its promise.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, in the short term, $CHANCER could start to find higher values when it lists on Uniswap in Q3 2023. This is when the token will unlock more demand and rise, potentially by double or triple-digit percentages.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2024, $CHANCER could rise by over 1,000%. The basis for the prediction is that the main platform will allow $CHANCER to be deployed for real-world use cases. That could unlock organic demand that will sustain the token&rsquo;s value and push it to higher levels.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Immutable X token went vertical on Thursday and Friday morning after a series of partnerships.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer token sale has continued, with the token sale hitting over $1.2 million.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/immutable-x/"><u>Immutable X</u></a> (IMX) price went parabolic on Friday even as the crypto market remained in a consolidation phase. The token jumped by more than 20% and reached a high of $0.9290, the highest level since May 6. In all, it has soared by more than 58% from the lowest point in June this year.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Immutable X new partnerships</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Immutable X is one of the biggest blockchains that focuses on gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the world. It is a layer-2 network that helps solve some of the main challenges in Ethereum&rsquo;s ecosystem. Some of those challenges are higher fees and slow transaction speeds in the network.</p>
<p dir="ltr">IMX, its native token, jumped on Friday, making it the best-performing cryptocurrency in the industry. This rally happened because of the growing partnerships in the network. On Thursday evening, the developers announced a new partnership with Helika Analytics. The partnership will see creators in the ecosystem do in-depth analysis using its no-code tools.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Ef Defense, a developer using Immutable tools, announced its commitment to Immmutable zkEVM tool. In a statement, the CEO said that Endless Frontier had over 30 million downloads, bringing over $80 million in revenue. He added:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I believe that collaborating with Immutable will offer us the opportunity to learn invaluable expertise on how to promote web3 games in various forms, communicate with users, and continue to develop the platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The statement came a day after Immutable revealed that the value of the pipeline of games in its ecosystem had grown to over $2.5 billion. This happened after the developer announced a new&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/polygon-and-immutable-partner-to-accelerate-web3-game-development/"><u>partnership with Polygon</u></a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">IMX price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The 4H chart shows that the Immutable X crypto price made a strong recovery in the overnight session. This rally saw it reach a high of $0.9296, which was much higher than last month&rsquo;s low of $0.5584. It moved above the key resistance level at $0.8420, the highest point in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, the token has moved above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved to the overbought level. Therefore, the token will likely retreat and retest the support at $0.80.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/28/1690521209101-5688a74b-ba33-49e5-af13-094d3b0faea2.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="615" height="338"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AltSignals token sale continues</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Another important&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/"><u>crypto news</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is that AltSignals&rsquo; token sale gained steam this week as the developers raised over $1.2 million. This amount represents about 54% of all the available tokens since the goal of this stage 2 is to raise $2.25 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Buy the AltSignals token&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For starters, AltSignals is a company that hopes to incorporate artificial intelligence in the financial market. The developers will transition their already&ndash;profitable product to one that uses AI, neural language processing (NLP), and machine learning. You can read the comprehensive white paper <a href="https://token.altsignals.io/whitepaper.pdf"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, once complete, the existing platform will transition from a centralized one into a fully decentralized one. In this, $CHANCER token holders will be able to vote for key activities in the network. There will also be profit-sharing mechanisms in the network.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are two main reasons for buying the ASI token. First, the token&rsquo;s price will be hiked by 12% in the next stage of the sale. This means that you can buy more tokens now.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Second, there is soaring demand for stocks and tokens in the AI industry. A good example of this is Intel, AMD, Nvidia, SingularityNET, and Fetch.ai. All these assets have jumped in the past few months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Third, the Fed made what is likely the final interest rate of the year. This decision could lead to more crypto gains later this year.</p>

<li>FTX and Genesis are bankrupt and have been trying to collect funds for creditors under court supervision.</li>
<li>The agreement will resolve FTX&rsquo;s claims against Genesis debtors and vice versa.</li>
<li>Genesis is the largest unsecured creditor of FTX.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX has reached an in-principle agreement with the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Genesis. Legal representatives from both companies informed bankruptcy judge Sean Lane in a letter dated July 27 that a deal had been reached.</p>
<p>Both businesses are in bankruptcy and have been working to recoup money for creditors while being watched over by the court.</p>
<p>The agreement would put an end to FTX&rsquo;s claims against the debtors of Genesis and vice versa. Additionally, it would rescind any ongoing motions pertaining to such claims. It was said that both sides intended to swiftly document and request court approval of the settlement.</p>
<p>The in-principle agreements stated:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Parties have reached an agreement in principle, subject to documentation, regarding a settlement that would resolve, among other things, the claims asserted by the FTX Debtors against the Debtors in these Chapter 11 Cases and the claims asserted by the Genesis Debtors against the FTX Debtors in the FTX Chapter 11 Cases.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>What was the issue between Genesis and FTX?</h2>
<p>FTX previously asserted that Genesis, which is controlled by Digital Currency Group, owed the exchange up to $4 billion. However, in a letter earlier this month to Judge Lane, the exchange reportedly decreased the sum to $2 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/genesis-files-for-bankruptcy-what-does-it-mean-for-crypto/">Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> protection in a New York bankruptcy court in January following the failure of cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. According to court documents, the crypto lender owes FTX and its affiliates $226 million, making it the largest unsecured creditor.</p>
<p>Genesis estimated that it was entitled to claims totalling zero in June; but, with this most recent development, it appears that FTX debtors&rsquo; claims and objections have been resolved. This also comes amid speculations of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-considering-relaunching-in-q2-after-asset-recovery/">FTX resuming operations</a> in the near future.</p>

<li>Bitcoin and EUR/USD have a direct correlation</li>
<li>EUR/USD leads</li>
<li>Bitcoin&rsquo;s recent bullish trend has been based solely on the dollar&rsquo;s weakness</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Today is the last trading day of a busy trading week in the traditional currency market. Three central banks (Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan) have announced their interest rate policy decisions.</p>
<p>For cryptocurrency traders, and especially for Bitcoin investors, the first two central banks directly impact Bitcoin&rsquo;s price action. As it turns out, after being part of numerous institutional investors&rsquo; portfolios, Bitcoin&rsquo;s price just follows the US dollar movements.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the volatility in the cryptocurrency space is much higher than in the traditional currency market. Nevertheless, one cannot ignore the direct correlation between the EUR/USD exchange rate and Bitcoin in the past several months.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/28/1690535318038-9b0a1c51-5fd0-4edf-bb48-47776119c574.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="488"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin chart by TradingView</a></p>
<h2>Bitcoin and EUR/USD have a direct correlation &nbsp;</h2>
<p>EUR/USD bottomed in October last year and has rallied ever since. Sure enough, corrections appeared, but the overall trend remained in place.</p>
<p>The chart above shows the different cycles that the EUR/USD formed from left to right. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin followed.</p>
<p>For example, despite making a new lower low at the end of 2022, Bitcoin bounced and rallied at the start of the new year. Basically, it caught up with the EUR/USD bullish trend.</p>
<p>Since then, every correction or rally on the EUR/USD pair was met with a similar response from Bitcoin. Therefore, it is fair to assume that if Bitcoin hodlers hope for the price to break and hold above $30k, it can only do so with a bullish EUR/USD price action.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Kin&rsquo;s path to decentralisation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">About 4.96 trillion KIN held by the foundation and 2.1 trillion KIN planned for burning by Kik should be destroyed by end of day Friday, July 28. That would see roughly 71% of the total KIN supply burned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;As a next step, the 4.96T Kin Reserves will be sent to a new Solana address and burned. After this the 2.10T Kin that Kik has agreed to burn will follow the same process. Once these burns are complete I will publish a new post that shows the on chain proof of these burns. I am hopeful this will happen by the end of day tomorrow,&rdquo; the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kin/comments/15b7iwc/kin_burn_vote_passes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">update</a> read.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ted Livingston, founder and CEO of Code, says the burn will make Kin a fully decentralised cryptocurrency. There will be no inflation, foundation or website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>The vote to burn the Kin Reserves has passed, with the vast majority of votes in support. Kin is about to become one of the only fully decentralised cryptocurrencies out there, with no inflation, no foundation, and no website. More details to come once the burn is complete</em>,&rdquo; he <a href="https://twitter.com/ted_livingston/status/1684579497386065923" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to data from CoinGecko, the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s current circulating supply is 2,207,205,857,149. The maximum supply is 10 trillion.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">KIN price surges</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/">price of KIN</a> soared after the vote closed, with the token&rsquo;s value having reached an intraday high of $0.000022. KIN was up 22% in the past 24 hours and more than 68% in the past week after its price jumped to highs near $0.000030 following the proposal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">KIN&rsquo;s all-time high of $0.00122572 was reached on January 7, 2018.</p>
