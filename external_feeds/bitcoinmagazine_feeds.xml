In this article, we want to walk through more of those in detail. Across bitcoin’s short history, many on-chain cyclical indicators are currently pointing to what looks to be a classic bottom in bitcoin price. Market extremes — potential tops and bottoms — are where these indicators have proven to be the most useful.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>However, these indicators need to be considered alongside many other macroeconomic factors and readers should consider the possibility that this could be another bear market rally — as we still sit below the 200-week moving average price of around $24,600. That being said, if price can sustain above $20,000 in the short-term, the bullish metrics paint a compelling sign for more long-term accumulation here.</p><p>A major tail risk is a possible market-wide selloff in risk assets that are currently pricing a “soft landing” style scenario along with the potentially incorrect expectations of a Federal Reserve policy pivot in the second half of this year. Many economic indicators and data still point to the likelihood that we’re in the midst of a bear market similar to 2000-2002 or 2007-2008 and the worst has yet to unfold. This secular bear market is what’s different about this bitcoin cycle compared to any other in the past and what makes it that much harder to use historical bitcoin cycles after 2012 as perfect analogues for today. </p><p>All that being said, from a bitcoin-native perspective, the story is clear: Capitulation has clearly unfolded, and HODLers held the line.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Given the transparent nature of bitcoin ownership, we can view various cohorts of bitcoin holders with extreme clarity. In this case, we are viewing the realized price for the average bitcoin holder as well as the same metric for both long-term holders (LTH) and short-term holders (STH). </p><p>The realized price, STH realized price and LTH realized price can give us an understanding of where various cohorts of the market are in profit or underwater.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>On a monthly basis, realized losses have flipped to realized profits for the first time since last April.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1618696733864886272"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Capitulation and loss taking has flipped to profit realization across the network, which is a very healthy sign of thorough capitulation. </p><p>There is a strong case to be made that given the current elasticity of bitcoin’s supply — as evidenced by the historically small number of short-term holders or rather the large number of long-term holders — it will be challenging to shake out current market participants. Especially considering the gauntlet endured over the previous 12 months. </p><p>Statistically, long-term bitcoin holders are usually unfazed in the face of bitcoin price volatility. The data shows a healthy amount of accumulation throughout 2022, despite a massive risk-off event in both the bitcoin and legacy market. </p><p>While liquidity dynamics in legacy markets should be noted, the supply-side dynamics for bitcoin look to be as strong as ever. All it will take for a significant price appreciation will be a small influx of newfound demand.</p><hr><p><em>Like this content? </em><a href="https://bm.b.tc/3Wlped5"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox</em><em>.</em></p><figure>

Included in this reference is the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">bankruptcy of FTX</a>, saying that, “Many everyday investors who trusted cryptocurrency companies—including young people and people of color—suffered serious losses, but, thankfully, turmoil in the cryptocurrency markets has had little negative impact on the broader financial system to date.”</p><p>According to the roadmap, the Administration's focus is on ensuring that cryptocurrencies cannot undermine financial stability, protecting investors and holding bad actors accountable. To achieve this, the roadmap states that experts across the administration have laid out a framework for developing digital assets in a safe and responsible way while addressing the risks they pose.<br><br>“At President Biden’s direction, we have spent the past year identifying the risks of cryptocurrencies and acting to mitigate them using the authorities that the Executive Branch has,” the roadmap reads. </p><p>It goes on to describe how some cryptocurrency entities ignore financial regulations and risk practices. Also alleged is that cryptocurrency platforms and promoters often mislead consumers, have conflicts of interest, fail to make adequate disclosures or commit outright fraud.</p><p>“Agencies are using their authorities to ramp up enforcement where appropriate and issue new guidance where needed,” the post reads. “The banking agencies issued joint guidance, just this month, on the imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system. Agencies across government have launched — or are now developing — public-awareness programs to help consumers understand the risks of buying cryptocurrencies.” </p><p>This, however, is not enough given the events of the last year, according to the roadmap. Therefore, the Administration will reveal priorities for further research devoted to digital assets and development, “which will help the technologies powering cryptocurrencies protect consumers by default.”</p><p>The post also details the Administrations’ belief that Congress needs to step up efforts by expanding regulators' powers, strengthening transparency and disclosure requirements, funding greater law-enforcement capacity building and limiting cryptocurrencies' risks to the financial system. It is careful to note that Congress should not greenlight mainstream institutions like pension funds to dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets as this would deepen the ties between cryptocurrencies and the broader financial system and increase systemic risks. <br><br>The roadmap is the latest in regards to Bitcoin regulation out of Washington, with the Biden Administration having <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/">released</a> the “Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets,” in March 2022 and the “Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States,” <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf">report</a> in September 2022 respectively.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMzg4OTgzNTU5NDk2ODM1/us.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senator Ted Cruz Is Bringing Bitcoin To The Capitol With Vending Machines]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Texas Senator has introduced a resolution requesting Capitol vendors to accept bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sen-ted-cruz-wants-capitol-vendors-accept-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sen-ted-cruz-wants-capitol-vendors-accept-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Texas]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ted Cruz]]></category><category><![CDATA[Washington]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politicians]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 16:59:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg1MDk0MzA2Njg2NzA3MDMz/img_7067.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The Texas Senator has introduced a resolution requesting Capitol vendors to accept bitcoin.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Sen.

Sadly, I am also one of the morons who saw this opportunity, didn’t think too much of it at first and let it fly by. </p><p>In this little story, I’d like to share the path that led me to pass on investing in bitcoin three different times before eventually giving in and becoming a HODLer. So, here are the key lessons I learned along this journey that are worth sharing with anyone who is still doubting BTC.</p><h2>The Inception</h2><p>Given that I started my first full-time job in an online brokerage back in 2011, it should come as no surprise that I had a bunch of colleagues who were really into trading and super passionate about everything related to investments, technology and the progress of the financial world. It wasn’t long before I made a friend named Edgar. We shared some interests, predominantly gaming and our long-standing nicotine addictions. Even though we worked in different departments and rarely had to collaborate for our jobs, we would still ping each other whenever it was time to head out and smoke a ciggy, gleefully chatting about life, the universe and everything else, as we dosed on nicotine and fresh air. </p><p>One day, sometime during 2012, I popped through one of these “smoke?” messages to Edgar when I noticed that his Skype status was some sort of gibberish that looked like a cat had been walking over his keyboard. </p><p>It looked something like this: “1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2.” </p><p>During our smoke session, I asked him, “Was it a cat, or did your account get hacked?” He denied both of these possibilities and then went into a long and complicated explanation about Bitcoin addresses and blockchains. </p><p>Edgar passionately explained what the whole Bitcoin thing is all about, and his excitement instantly got me extremely interested in the topic. Being in the investment industry, I was well aware of many online scams and fake dubious products such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold">e-gold</a>, that seemed, at least at the surface level, to all be similar. But, the more he told me about it, the more Bitcoin seemed like it might be much more than just some fly-by-night scheme; at the very least, it was worth a gamble. </p><p>My biggest problem was that 2012 was probably my worst year on record when it came to financial health, and while <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/584.pdf">3,730,218 public keys already existed</a> on the Bitcoin network by then, I certainly didn’t have the spare cash to go gambling on some new and unproven technology promising to “revolutionize” the way we do money. </p><p>To put it bluntly, I was so poor. So poor, in fact, that by the last week of each month, my grocery store visits would come down to a choice between buying food or killing the hunger pains with a pack of cigarettes. So, I came to the conclusion that, while eating meat was considered a luxury, gambling on the future of digitized tokens was not within the scope of logical spending. Back then, <a href="https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price/">bitcoin was trading for under $10</a>.</p><h2>The Doubt</h2><p>Let’s fast forward to 2015. Having gotten a few good years of work under my belt, I was an experienced employee and had moved up to head marketing strategy and execution for one of the most prominent fintech startups in Europe. The workplace was great. Most of my colleagues were hardcore software developers who worked ceaselessly on retrieving people’s financial data from banks without asking for banks’ permission. As if to enforce the kind of work being done, there was even a good old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolly_Roger">Jolly Roger</a> flying in the office. As you can imagine, many of my colleagues were huge fans of Bitcoin and everything that it stood for.</p><p>Since I’d grown quite a lot professionally, the numbers that indicated my salary had also seen a substantial addition. I was finally able to buy cigarettes <em>and</em> food, while even having a chunk of money that could be set aside for a rainy day. Working in this world, I knew more than most that just keeping your money in the bank is not the way to go and I started thinking of investing my extra capital, as I had no real plan for spending it. </p><p>My colleagues would fling the term “Bitcoin” around the office quite often, but I was still skeptical as to whether it would be a solid investment. At the time, bitcoin was <a href="https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price/">trading at around $250</a>, having just crashed from its all-time high of around $1,000. I approached it with my well-trained investment brain and concluded that bitcoin szx most likely never going to recover and that it would keep dwindling until just a few of the most hardened nerds were still clinging to it. </p><p>I was even looking at the <a href="https://investfox.com/education/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-dominance/">Bitcoin dominance</a> charts and seeing that, despite this fall, it still had a massive dominance over the market, which led me to the conclusion that it was the only cryptocurrency that managed to achieve something, and with no competition, it would never manage to grow to something huge. </p><p>“I need a more stable investment product for my savings,” said the wise investor in my mind, and so I bought $7,500 in gold bullion. Having kept an eye on the continual rise of gold since the economic crisis of 2008, it struck me as one of the most stable investments possible.</p><h2>The Rejection</h2><p>Let’s take a jump to 2018 when everyone was absolutely crazy about crypto. Besides bitcoin, a lot of other cryptocurrencies emerged and the initial coin offering (ICO) boom was in full swing, with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/804748/worldwide-amount-crytocurrency-ico-projects/">$6.88 billion being raised</a> through ICOs in just the first quarter of 2018. Everyone and their mothers were talking about Bitcoin and cryptos. You went for a haircut and would hear about it at the barbershop, go on Facebook and you couldn’t find a single page or group that wasn’t mentioning crypto in some way or other; even my parents gave me a call and asked me if I had any, telling me that I should get some since they heard it is likely to go up.</p><p>At that point in time, I was already offering some content marketing services on a freelance basis, and business was going well as the ICO bros would throw money at nearly any services they were offered as long as they could pay in crypto. Even though stablecoins like <a href="https://kriptomat.io/cryptocurrencies/tether/what-is-tether/">USDT had already been around for a while</a>, it was quite uncommon for anyone to transact in them. I saw most of my payments coming in the form of BTC, with the rate ranging from $4,000 to $13,000 per bitcoin. </p><p>It was during this time that I acquired my first bitcoin, but being swept up in the absolute craziness that surrounded the whole crypto space, I decided not to hold any BTC and sold it all through someone I found via <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/">Local Bitcoins</a> as fast as I got it. Back then, the daily volatility was huge, and I would catch a cab down to the local Bitcoin exchange as soon as the BTC hit my wallet to cash out for the safety of fiat money. </p><h2>The Acceptance </h2><p>The middle of 2018 was a turning point for me, career wise. I quit working full time for someone else and decided to focus on building my own company. At this time, I was also able to flip one of my projects for a hefty sum, which provided the initial capital to get my new venture started, while the funds sitting in my account allowed me to sleep calmly at night as I built the new business. </p><p>Life was good. I already owned some real estate, was making way more money than I could spend and had all the work opportunities I could handle. Things were on the up and up.</p><p>Then, one day, it just hit me. Why on Earth would I cash out? I have plenty of fiat in the bank and plenty of other investments in the markets. How does having an extra $10,000 to my name make any substantial difference to my wellbeing? </p><p>I finally came to the conclusion that it wouldn’t, but having no bitcoin could very possibly lead to me becoming poor again. What if fiat turns to monopoly money? After all, I don't really trust the government and the people who I had met throughout my life who trusted Bitcoin were the ones I actually trusted a heck of a lot more than the people who dealt with fiat. With this in mind, I started hoarding and holding onto as much BTC as my finances would allow. My logic was simple: I get paid in BTC, I get to keep it without cashing out, ever. </p><h2>What Lessons Have I Learned?</h2><p>I am not angry at myself for not acquiring bitcoin earlier. Overall, I am a happy man, and despite the <a href="https://bitpay.com/blog/crypto-winter/">recent crypto winter</a> and events like the <a href="https://www.cryptotimes.io/all-about-ftx-crash-and-chaotic-turn-of-events/">FTX crash</a>, I am still very bullish on crypto as a whole. Yet there are a few specific lessons that I took from my journey with BTC that I would like to share with you now.</p><h3>Lesson One: You’re Never Too ‘Small’ To Invest</h3><p>At the inception stage, I was thinking that it would be so great to spend some $1,000 to acquire BTC, but I simply didn’t have it and I let the opportunity slip. Overall, if you spot the opportunity, take it. </p><p>You should not invest all of your savings or feel uncomfortable because of your investment, but committing even a fraction of your income should not be too hard. Could I have saved $50 somehow back in 2012 to acquire 5 BTC? Most likely yes, but the idea of investing just $50 was a turnoff for me.</p><h3>Lesson Two: Sacrifices Are To Be Made</h3><p>I had to dig up some past experiences to compose this story since I wanted to get the dates right. While doing so, I noticed a $100 hotel booking made in early 2012. This was for one night abroad, which was pretty much a tourist trip with my girlfriend. </p><p>Yes, being broke and spending so much on a hotel is not the wisest decision overall. But hindsight is 20/20 and looking back, I could have certainly salvaged the trip and invested in BTC instead, or I could have simply gone to a cheaper hotel and spent the remainder on buying BTC. There is no use in looking back and feeling bad, but remember that making a sacrifice today could lead to your financial wellbeing a few years down the line. </p><h3>Lesson Three: Balance Your Investment Portfolio</h3><p>Every investment book tells you, “Don't put all of your eggs in one basket.” Nothing is new here. Yet this is something I completely ignored back in 2015. I did have money to invest, and I did have some desire to acquire BTC, but for some reason, I decided to go all-in on a single commodity. If I had invested even just some 20% into BTC, my return would have been substantially higher. </p><h3>Lesson Four: Don’t Chase Historical Prices</h3><p>One of the reasons why I chose to invest in gold instead of BTC is simply because I felt that I was buying gold “cheap.” I weighed this against the fact that I would have had to pay 25 times more for bitcoin at that point than what I could have paid some three years before. In retrospect, I now know that the price now is the price now — don’t discount an investment today just because it looks expensive when compared to three years ago.</p><h3>Lesson Five: Become A Part Of The Ecosystem</h3><p>Accepting and holding BTC is considerably easier (mentally) than purchasing it for fiat. If you offer services or goods, why not let your clients pay in BTC? Just don’t make the mistake that I did and cash everything out as soon as you get it in. </p><p>Keep at least a fraction of your BTC balance intact and forget about it for now. This will only drive the adoption rates higher and will work in your and the whole community's favor in the long run. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Konstantin Rabin.

Instead, merchants will be able to accept Lightning payments from any source — “From Cash App to a node over Tor. If it can make a Lightning payment, you can use it,” Mallers stated on Twitter.</p><p>Mallers clarified that this rollout is part of a 90-day trial period, which will involve measuring the speed and cost of facilitating transactions using the new integration. In addition to that, the amount of business that integrating Lightning brings to merchants will be closely monitored. </p><p>After the pilot, Strike aims to enter the Clover app store, and afterwards, direct integration into Clover. This would enable Lightning by default for all Clover merchants, putting it right next to card networks like Visa and MasterCard. </p><p>“Ultimately, these payment giants want to see Lightning in action,” Mallers said on Twitter. “They want to feel it, touch it, and see people use it. An open, instant, cheap, inclusive, and innovative payment network seems too good to be true. Time to show Lightning is the world's superior payments rail.”<br><br>The trial period is now active and Clover merchants can reach out to Strike in order to enable cheaper, faster payments using the Bitcoin Lightning Network.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/jackmallers/status/1618731431068602368"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzOTk5NDg5MTkzNzQ3OTcz/bitcoin-merchant-payment-accepted-here.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[BitPay Announces Partnership With MoonPay, Removes Bitcoin Trading Fees For Limited Time]]></title><description><![CDATA[BitPay’s partnership with MoonPay is set to offer a superior buyer experience for those looking to purchase cryptocurrencies on the BitPay platform.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitpay-announces-partnership-with-moonpay</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitpay-announces-partnership-with-moonpay</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitpay]]></category><category><![CDATA[Moonpay]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 18:50:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNjE0NjU5/city-of-the-future.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">BitPay’s partnership with MoonPay is set to offer a superior buyer experience for those looking to purchase cryptocurrencies on the BitPay platform.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://bitpay.com/">BitPay</a> and <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/">MoonPay</a>, leading bitcoin and cryptocurrency payments infrastructure providers, have partnered “to provide BitPay users with significantly increased ways to buy cryptocurrency instantly, and at great rates.”</p><p>“BitPay’s unique marketplace experience also presents multiple rates for buyers, ensuring they receive the best possible price for their cryptocurrency purchases,” the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230126005307/en/BitPay-Announces-New-Partnership-with-MoonPay">press release</a> states. “Additional benefits of the integration include fast delivery to any owned wallet address, as well as the ability for buyers to pay with their preferred method, including credit card, debit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay or a variety of local bank transfer methods.”</p><p>The announcement also states that for a limited time, BitPay users will be able to purchase bitcoin with no fees.

But Bitcoin gives us the chance to be human again.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jimmy Song, a Bitcoin developer, educator and entrepreneur and programmer with over 20 years of experience.</em></p><p>We need beliefs. Belief is something that we live for, something that informs our morals, something that defines our metaphysical existence. We need belief because we need purpose. Belief is a necessary part of a fulfilling life and, traditionally, people valued their beliefs more than anything else. Sadly, fiat money debases our beliefs the same way Nickleback debases music and Joel Osteen debases Christianity. </p><p>The end result of fiat money is that those who win don't believe in anything, at least in any traditional sense. And if you don't believe in anything, you are a nihilist. You're probably nodding along because the people in power seem very much like the inner party leaders in George Orwell's “1984.” They change their beliefs to whatever the authorities tell them and do it on command. Heck, we saw that in real time during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>That's the topic of this essay: What happened? And how is it that so many people are so willing to change their beliefs so quickly under government command? How did so many people, especially members of the media, academics and bureaucrats of all types, become sycophantic yes-men to what the government told us to believe?</p><h2>Fiat Obsession</h2><p>Fiat money makes us obsessed with money. It does this by causing us to pay way too much attention to it. </p><p>Because fiat money is continually being debased, people with any wealth at all are forced to invest their money to keep up with that debasement. The more wealth you have, the more obsessed you have to be. The moderately wealthy research stocks and real estate. The truly rich have to research venture funds, private equity and special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Speak with any rich person and they're most likely to talk about the deals they're involved in because this is pretty much the only thing that they truly believe in. The only way to stay rich in a fiat economy is to really be obsessed with money and get involved in Cantillon games, leaving very little room for genuine beliefs. Fiat money rewards cowards who conform to those who align with it and those are the people who get really rich. Ideological diversity is about as welcome in those places as Barry Silbert at the Gemini offices.</p><p>On the other end of the scale, those with no savings are bombarded by offers of debt. Loans and credit are readily available, so those without savings have the option to bring consumption forward. When combined with advertising, propaganda and a lack of savings vehicles, consumption becomes conspicuous. Unfortunately, that enslaves people for many years, possibly their whole lives, as the debt can be rolled over and consumption generally only goes up. Principles and beliefs and well-nigh everything gets sacrificed to serve the debt. Like an overweight person always waiting until tomorrow to start their diet, the cycle of debt puts genuine belief on hold.</p><p>Either way, under a fiat system, the only belief most people end up serving is that of the primacy of money. Sadly, money is a terrible and all-consuming god that requires the sacrifice of everything that makes life meaningful.</p><h2>Anything For Money</h2><p>The primacy of money has meant that other beliefs are put on the back burner, made to be less important and generally debased. In biblical times, tax collectors and prostitutes often made way more money than other people in the economy. Yet they were considered lower than scum. Why? Because they violated something that was more sacred than money: community morals and community belief. To violate those was to violate who you were. </p><p>This isn't an isolated occurrence. In most times and places, it was considered completely dishonorable to make money at the cost of the community. If you made money through grifting, you might have money, but your reputation would be in tatters and many people would not trade with you. It was considered completely unacceptable to take other peoples’ property through deception, or by hurting the community in some way. Nowadays, that's just called marketing. So what changed?</p><h2>Debasement Of Politics</h2><p>Fiat money debases communities because it makes communities completely reliant on its central control and, thus, its benevolence. Even the most tyrannical monarch of the past couldn't control the money to the extent that central banks can today. Central banking was the <a href="https://www.conservativeusa.net/10planksofcommunism.htm">fifth plank</a> of the “Communist Manifesto” for a reason. Karl Marx recognized money's integral function in any community and wanted to control it. It's not a coincidence that the most debased communities, the ones whose very cultures were completely supplanted, were the totalitarian ones in the 20th century. We are all zombies to the necromancing of the central bank.</p><p>People used to believe in things and were willing to fight for them, especially against oppression. This was what led to the spirit of 1776. Belief was what held that community together.</p><p>Yet, looking at the state of politics today, it's pretty clear that most fights are fights over money and power, not over belief. Fiat money is so powerful that it's become the only thing to fight for. Belief has taken a back seat to the power to print money. Naturally, this means that beliefs are malleable and you get more psychopathic behavior from leaders. </p><p>Why is what we're supposed to believe continuously changing? How is it that transgender bathrooms became such an issue so fast? Or Ukraine? Or terrorism? The beliefs that they tell us to believe are more inconsistent than CSW's statements to courts of law. The short answer is that they do this because they can.</p><h2>Debasement Of Work</h2><p>As mentioned above, work used to have some bounds, but now, more than ever, rent seeking is accepted, even celebrated as noble employment. Thus, the psychopathic investment banking character that will do anything for money is something people strive to be. The moral nihilism of the character is something that they don't worry about. </p><p>Of course, it's not just investment banking, but many other professions. The goal is always to climb up the ladder of power at any cost. Status is no longer awarded on the basis of character, it's rewarded on the basis of money and power. Fiat money has made work a place where beliefs go to die. The goal of getting more money has become all consuming and put beliefs completely on the back burner.</p><h2>Toxic Maximalism</h2><p>One of the things I've noticed about the Bitcoin community is just how vicious it can be toward people who would otherwise be welcomed with open arms in any other community. Venture capitalists like Raoul Pal and Mark Cuban would be deferred to and respected for their influence and money anywhere else. Yet in Bitcoin, we pay them no mind and have zero problems questioning their understanding or even making fun of their stupidity. There's no buying your way to influence in Bitcoin. There's no jumping in front of the parade because you have name recognition. </p><p>Bitcoin is decentralized and that's how we like it, thank you. Anyone trying to speak for Bitcoin and trying to change it will be rightly derided as being a detriment to the community. If you try to co-opt this community for your own ends, you will be shunned like the ideological leech you are.</p><p>Altcoiners call this “toxic Bitcoin maximalism,” but this protection of the community is a good thing. Toxic maximalism is not just an immune system keeping the beliefs pure. It's a rejection of the fiat model of doing things. Fiat institutions trade on status, influence and money and their beliefs can be changed for a price. Bitcoiners are principled and no one gets to tell us how it is. That's the main feature of decentralization. The node I run is mine and you can't change it. There's no single point of failure to go bribe.</p><p>Contrast this with what <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/greenpeace-environment-attacks-help-bitcoin">Greenpeace USA started doing</a> once Ripple’s executive chair gave it $5 million. It started FUDing Bitcoin because its beliefs are for sale. It is a fiat institution that can be bought. Cantillionaires can't understand Bitcoiners because they're used to being able to buy their way into everything with their printed dollars. Fiat slaves can't understand Bitcoiners because they're used to changing their beliefs when their fiat jobs depend on changing them. Bitcoiners are misunderstood because we have beliefs that are not for sale. We are not debased.</p><h2>Altcoins Debase Belief</h2><p>Altcoining, though, debases your beliefs pretty quickly. One need not look much further than Erik Voorhees, Trace Mayer and Udi Wertheimer to see that. The minute you sell out your belief and embrace altcoins, you are forced into a lot of mental gymnastics to justify your salary. You have to take untenable positions and end up supporting stupider and stupider projects to ensure some allies. </p><p>Thankfully, when these projects blow up, their reputations blow up along with them. Altcoins operate on the same fiat system of bribery using printed money, but with a lot more volatility and without the monopoly on violence. Hence, it's very easy to get altcoiners to embrace any belief. This is why their pitches can be so stupid and still find an audience. You can buy your way to influence. But of course, this is unsustainable without violence. So in a sense, their crashes are as inevitable as Sam Bankman-Fried making a stupid public statement. </p><p>By contrast, what is endlessly frustrating for VCs, altcoin founders and Bitcoin affinity scammers is that it's impossible to debase Bitcoiners' decentralized beliefs. This is in stark contrast to the fiat world. Just pay some money for influence and you're good. You can't do that in Bitcoin. No amount of money is going to get the toxic maxis to like you. There's no jumping in front of this parade. Bitcoiners have no hesitation rejecting you and there's no central committee to bribe. The rules are different here because Bitcoin is genuinely decentralized.</p><h2>Bitcoin And First Principles</h2><p>Bitcoiners have enriched their beliefs. We've learned to think for ourselves through analysis via first principles. Instead of swallowing what someone is selling us, we have learned to analyze things and come to our own conclusions. This is why you see so many Bitcoiners give carnivory or fasting or Christianity a chance. These are not popular now in the mainstream, but they've historically been popular for a reason. The fact that Big Ag has debased food or that Big Food has made fasting look ridiculous or that Marxism of many kinds has instilled atheism is not lost on Bitcoiners. They look at these things with fresh eyes because the blindfold of fiat money has been taken off.</p><p>In other words, our beliefs which once were debased, have arisen anew through first-principles analyses. Beliefs have become more real and personal through soul searching and logical analysis. This is in contrast to beliefs under the fiat system which are fake and wispy because they're absorbed through propaganda. Talk to any Bitcoiner and you'll likely see that they have many more strong opinions than your typical fiat slave does. That's not a coincidence. Under a fiat system you say whatever to get along and get ahead. Under Bitcoin, you say what you believe.</p><h2>Rent Seekers Don't Believe Anything</h2><p>Belief in a fiat system is a means, not an end. Most people have malleable belief systems so they can get ahead in their careers. This is especially so in the institutions infected most by fiat: academia, media, government, Hollywood and venture capital. The most successful in these institutions are the ones who believe whatever is most convenient to get ahead. As that is often the price of admission, their beliefs are lightly held, not analyzed for inconsistencies and really swallowed without much thought. </p><p>These are also very political institutions and the ability to gauge the temperature of your colleagues and bosses and adjust your beliefs is the key to success in those places. These are debased people, nihilistic at the core and only believing in power. To me, these are not really people at all. And it's not a coincidence that the morals of the people in these places are often completely corrupt. Lest you doubt me, I'll remind you that Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.</p><h2>Belief Is Needed To Be Human</h2><p>Belief is a necessary part of being human. Sadly, fiat money debases our beliefs and as we are more integrated into fiat money, the more nihilistic we become. The more nihilistic we become, the less human we are.</p><p>Bitcoin brings us back to having beliefs again because money is no longer our master, but our servant. The money works for us now by being a savings technology. It's no longer our master who enslaves us through debt or forced investment.</p><p>Belief is a prerequisite to everything that is meaningful in life. Morals and purpose. It's sad to see that these critical things are destroyed by fiat money. Thank God for Bitcoin. And that's where your journey as a liberated human being can begin anew.</p><p>Now, go forth and learn.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jimmy Song.

Wendy Rogers reflects growing interest in bitcoin from U.S. states.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>State Sen. Wendy Rogers (R-AZ) has introduced a set of bills aimed at making <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/1R/bills/SB1235P.pdf">bitcoin legal tender</a> in Arizona and allowing <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/1R/bills/SB1239P.pdf">state agencies to accept bitcoin</a>.</p><p>The proposed legislation aims to recognize bitcoin as a legal form of currency in Arizona, allowing it to be used to pay for debts, taxes and other financial obligations. This would mean that all transactions that are currently done in U.S. dollars could potentially be done with bitcoin, and individuals and businesses would have the option to use bitcoin as they see fit.</p><p>Specifically mentioning bitcoin alone, the legal tender bill defines bitcoin as, “the decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency in which a record of transactions is maintained on the Bitcoin blockchain and new units of currency are generated by the computational solution of mathematical problems and that operates independently of a central bank.”</p><p>The acceptance bill is more broad, saying that, “A state agency may enter into an agreement with a cryptocurrency issuer to provide a method to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method of fines, civil penalties or other penalties, rent, rates, taxes, fees, charges, revenue, financial obligations and special assessments to pay any amount due to that agency or this state.”</p><p>This is the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bill-introduced-to-make-bitcoin-a-legal-tender-in-arizona">second time</a> that Sen. Rogers has introduced a bill aimed at making bitcoin legal tender in her state.

Then, within a year, it capitulated. While mainstream news commentators were quick to pick through the reasons for why <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/12/1066589/bitcoin-mining-boom-kazakhstan/">Kazakh authorities turned against Bitcoin mining operations</a>, the consequence this had on the greening of the network went unreported.</p><p>But because Kazakhstan is fuelled 87.6% by fossil fuel, less mining there means a higher clean energy mix for the Bitcoin network. </p><p>How much higher? </p><p>That’s what I asked myself. And the answer I found was surprising.<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy/country/kazakhstan"><em>Source</em></a></p><figure>

    </figure><p>But what has not been widely reported is that by January 2022 (the last time Cambridge University updated its <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map">Bitcoin mining map</a>), it had already fallen to 13.2% of global hash rate.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>And that was before the real pressure came on miners from Kazakh authorities. This pressure came in three waves:</p><ol><li>A raid where equipment from 13 illegal mining farms was seized. The operations were estimated to be <a href="https://eurasianet.org/kazakhstan-13-illegal-data-farms-found-in-crackdown-on-gray-crypto-miners">using over 200 megawatts (MW) of power</a>. </li><li>A follow-up raid on remaining known illegal mining activities which seized assets from <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/15/kazakhstan-crackdown-forces-106-more-crypto-mines-to-close/">a further 106 mining operations</a>.</li><li>The regulated curtailment of mining. Bitcoin mining can now only legally occur at the off-peak hours of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/12/1066589/bitcoin-mining-boom-kazakhstan/">midnight to 8:00 a.m. and on weekends</a>: a reduction from 168 mining hours per week to only 64 mining hours per week.</li></ol><p>Running some calculations, even at the most bullish upper threshold, Kazakhstan now represents at best 6.4% of global hash rate. </p><p>So, what does this mean for Bitcoin’s clean energy mix?</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MzkzMjU2MDEwNDI1NjU4/bitcoin-clean-energy-mix.png" height="570" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>It makes a pretty significant difference, as you can see. The exodus from Kazakhstan flipped the network to become a majority clean-energy user. I ran a simulation on my <a href="https://batcoinz.com/a-more-complete-picture-of-bitcoins-energy-usage/">energy source model</a> with Kazakhstan still at 18.3% of global hash rate. Here’s what that would have looked like: majority fossil fuel use.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MzkzMjU2MDEwMjk0OTcx/bitcoin-network-without-kazakhstan-exodus.png" height="431" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Because Kazakhstan uses so much coal (a much heavier greenhouse-gas emitter than natural gas) the difference to emissions is even more significant. At 18.3% of total hash rate, Bitcoin emissions would've been 36 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent C(MTCO2e). But at current levels, emissions are only 32.4 MtCO2e. That's a 10% reduction in emissions. </p><p>Ten percent emission reduction is significant. There are few industries in the world that have achieved this within a year. And if there were, you would likely have heard all about it. </p><p>An important sidenote: Have you ever seen a Bitcoin mining unit with its own internal combustion engine? Neither have I. Bitcoin mining, like electric vehicles (EVs), uses electricity as its power source. As such, if an EV can claim to be zero emissions, then so can Bitcoin mining. So, when we talk about emission, we are talking about the indirect emissions caused by the component of electricity that was generated using fossil fuels. </p><p>In summary: The Bitcoin network keeps tracking in the right direction, but you have to dig to find this out. </p><p>And some final thoughts on where we are heading:</p><p>According to my model, the Bitcoin network uses 4.7% more clean energy now than it did even just a year ago. The factors that have led to this are:</p><ol><li>The exodus from Kazakhstan</li><li>The migration of <a href="https://decrypt.co/97047/bitcoin-miner-marathon-transition-fossil-fuel-generation">Marathon’s remaining coal-based mining onto renewable supply</a></li><li>Continued migration toward mostly renewable-based, off-grid mining </li></ol><p>This trend shows no sign of abating. Based on the trendline, the network is set to use <a href="https://batcoinz.com/a-more-complete-picture-of-bitcoins-energy-usage/">4% more clean energy every year</a> for the next three years. </p><p>As far as I’m aware, this is the fastest transition rate to renewables of any industry in the world. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Daniel Batten.

This is not the first foray into the crypto universe for either country, nor will it be the last. But this venture will come to nothing, ultimately bringing both countries one step closer to adopting Bitcoin. </p><h2>Iran’s Foray Into Cryptocurrencies Favor Bitcoin</h2><p>In August 2022, a headline came and went and most did not hear about it, and those who did gave it little thought: “<a href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202208293261">Iran Approves Use Of Cryptocurrency For Imports To Bust Sanctions</a>.” Ignoring the fact that the source for this headline was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/31/concern-over-uk-based-iranian-tv-channels-links-to-saudi-arabia">Saudi-funded media outlet</a> with the likely goal of destabilizing and delegitimizing Iran, it is important to recognize that Iran successfully completed a trade in August with an estimated value of $10 million, which can be assumed to have been conducted in bitcoin. </p><p>Based on daily volume, there are about <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">20 possible cryptocurrencies</a> that could have been used to complete this transaction, however, if we take these cryptocurrencies by daily volume and agree that none with a daily volume less than $1 billion could have possibly been used (anything greater than 1% of daily volume would move the price too significantly: 1% of $1 billion is $10 million) we are left with seven possible cryptocurrencies: Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), USDC, Ethereum (ETH), Binance (BNB), Tether (USDT) and Bitcoin (BTC). </p><p>We can quickly eliminate <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">USDC</a>, <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a> and <a href="https://ripple.com/xrp/">Ripple</a> because they are all run by U.S. corporations and, due to sanction laws (see: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/08/us-treasury-adds-to-tornado-cash-sanctions/">Tornado Cash</a>), they would be forced to prevent Iran from using their platform (also it is safe to assume that the Iranian government chose to avoid U.S. companies for simplicity’s sake). <a href="https://tether.to/">Tether</a> can also be thrown out given its link to the U.S. dollar. I will also throw out Ethereum because Iranians are too cheap to pay those gas fees. This leaves us with two options: BNB and Bitcoin. Personal bias aside, no one is settling international trade with BNB without Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) taking some sort of a victory lap. Bitcoin wins.</p><p>Iran also <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dear-iran-letter-bitcoin">previously banned Bitcoin mining</a> operations due to stress on Tehran’s power grid. It has since <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/iran-court-orders-the-release-of-seized-crypto-mining-equipment">returned all of the mining equipment</a> and, as noted above, made the claim that $10 million in international trade was completed using cryptocurrency. Suffice to say, Iran has begun to see the potential of Bitcoin.</p><h2>Russian Foray Into Cryptocurrencies Demonstrates Need For Unsanctioned Exchange</h2><p><br>Russia has also begun to dip its toes in the broader cryptocurrency space. After the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11869">U.S. government responded to the invasion of Ukraine with sanctions</a>, Russia was forced to explore alternatives to completing international trade. President Vladimir Putin’s response was to forgo the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1188294/monthly-foreign-exchange-reserves-in-russia/">over $500 billion in its reserves</a> and mandate that every buyer of Russian natural gas <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/31/putin-says-russian-gas-must-be-paid-for-in-rubles-from-friday.html">pay in Russian rubles</a>. The ruble responded very positively to this news (see the chart below with a red arrow pointing to when U.S. sanctions began and a green arrow pointing to when the ruble became the only payment for Russian natural gas).</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Russia then slowly began to reverse <a href="https://www.russia-briefing.com/news/bank-of-russia-to-legalise-cryptocurrencies-for-cross-border-transactions.html/#:~:text=A%20significant%20crypto%20regulation%20called,(BTC)%20as%20payment%20methods.">its 2020 position on cryptocurrencies</a>. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/russia-to-let-any-industry-trade-in-crypto">Late last year</a>, Russia announced that it will allow international settlement in cryptocurrencies without any restrictions, a huge reversal from its previous stance. These moves prove that Russia sees the potential for cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange. </p><h2>Sanctions Make The Bond Stronger</h2><p>Both countries have been on the receiving end of U.S./Western sanctions but have found ways to navigate around them to remain in power. The lesson that both of these countries have learned is to trust no one, especially in the world of finances. <a href="https://www.australiannationalreview.com/state-of-affairs/credibility-of-dollar-and-euro-destroyed-putin/">Putin profusely announced</a> that by freezing Russia’s dollar holdings, it “practically defaulted,” signaling that even the mighty dollar may not be as mighty as the U.S. wants you to believe. </p><p>Iran is also no stranger to the empty promises of the West: after negotiating and agreeing to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/02/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-main-points-of-agreement/">nuclear deal in 2015</a>, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html">came in and tore up the old agreement</a>. While this may be common practice in some (shady) business ventures, this is an insult in Persian culture. Every indication that a new nuclear deal will be signed by Iran was laughable: why would Iran assume the next deal would be upheld after this president left office? Needless to say, the Iranian government has very little trust of foreign governments. </p><p><strong>“The enemy of my enemy is my friend” plus “keep your friends close but your enemies closer” equals Iran/Russia relations.</strong></p><p>In 2023, it almost makes sense to Westerners that Russia and Iran would work together. Both countries are deemed villains by many Western countries, and strict sanctions prevent them both from selling their resources to the world. Both have stockpiles of oil and gas that the world desperately needs. And yet, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24482848">their history</a> is far from harmonious. </p><p>Until the 1920s, both the U.K. and Russia fought over control of the resources of Iran. The Qajar dynasty would bend the knee and give anything foreign powers requested in exchange for wealth and riches for its family. This all changed after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1921_Persian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">1921 coup</a> brought an end to the Qajar dynasty and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=VGZItY9kL0AC&amp;pg=PA147">brought to power Reza Shah</a>. </p><p>Reza Shah refused to give concessions to foreign powers and focused on growing Iran. The <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/27629/themes/society/rsussr.html">Soviet Union came to be one year later</a>, which caused the USSR to focus on domestic growth as well. As Iran began to grow in importance to the West (chiefly to the U.K. and the U.S.), Reza Shah and his son (the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Shah), would <a href="https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/9501">use the West’s fear of communism to their advantage</a>. If Iran would not get what it wanted from its Western trade partners, it would go make a small deal with the USSR to remind them who was in charge. </p><p>Despite the once contentious history between these two nations, it seems like they have found a common ground: perception as an enemy of the West.</p><h2>Why The New Stablecoin Will Fail</h2><p>I made a lofty claim that the stablecoin experiment between Iran and Russia will fail and cause them to adopt Bitcoin. How will it fail? There is no trust: there never was and there never will be. </p><p>Trust can be eroded while the network is being formed. While many Russian and Iranian leaders may believe that their countries’ top engineers can craft a product that is able to circumvent any adversarial attacks, what is to stop the other country from giving themselves backdoor access? What is stopping someone from creating a way to double spend tokens? Now, this is all conjecture: I am presenting just a handful of potential flaws in this system — how many more can you think of? </p><p>The largest question is regarding the gold reserves backing the stablecoin: Where will the gold be stored and who will verify that the amount of gold listed is still there? Given the lack of trust, neither country can be expected to blindly accept that the other is holding the amount of gold it claims to be (see “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin+standard&amp;oq=bitcoin+standard&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3j69i65j69i60l3.1571j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">The Bitcoin Standard</a>” for more on this topic), and sanctions prevent a reputable third party from getting involved (although China could fit into the puzzle in some way here). </p><p>As this very large and very important hurdle is met, another question will continue to loom: Why? Why do we need to do any of this when there is a cryptocurrency out there with enough liquidity to suffice their needs and that requires no trust in either party?</p><p>Both Iran and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-unlikely-to-choose-bitcoin-for-cross-border-crypto-payments-analysis">Russia have banned</a> residents from using Bitcoin, but they have also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/iran-court-orders-the-release-of-seized-crypto-mining-equipment">reversed some of their positions</a> over time. It is safe to say that both governments are still in the process of understanding the power and scope of what cryptocurrencies have to offer. It is also worth noting that, should this joint effort be successful, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-a-gold-backed-token-and-how-does-it-work">it will not be the first gold-backed cryptocurrency</a>. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Both countries are still in the information-gathering stage and, if by some miracle, a researcher stumbles across this article, let me spell it out plain and simple: History has proven that when given the opportunity to control money, the people in charge will manipulate the money for their benefit. </p><p>There is a reason the Roman Empire fell and that we don’t use <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/guilder">guilders</a> or pounds as global currencies. Instead of bringing this temptation into the equation, adopting a trustless form of money that cannot be manipulated or inflated is the only solution. Bitcoin is the inevitable money you are looking for. Whether you get there before your enemies is up to you. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Q Ghaemi.

The companies invite all Bitcoiners to attempt to crack that bitcoin wallet and claim all of its sats. <br><br>The announcement sent to Bitcoin Magazine describes how brute forcing will be the method that will allow participants to crack the seed, saying “For this game, brute-forcing a bitcoin wallet means finding the seed words and a passphrase, in this case, arranging them in the right order and using the resulting backup as a way to recover the wallet’s funds. There are many ways to achieve this and general knowledge about bitcoin wallets, script types, derivation paths, checksums, passphrases and BIP-39 seed words will be helpful … As more words are revealed, brute-forcing gets easier, so time is ticking as people from around the world compete to crack the wallet.”<br><br>A 12-word, passphrase-protected bitcoin address (BIP39) generated <a href="https://mempool.space/address/bc1q7kw2uepv6hfffhhxx2vplkkpcwsslcw9hsupc6">a BTC address</a> which now holds the sats up for grabs. Each word from the wallet, including the passphrase, were shared with the 12 partners. Over the week starting with January 23, each partners will share their word using the hashtag #HuntingSats. At the end of the week, if no one has successfully accessed the bitcoin, more hints will be shared. <br></p><p>The partners involved include: </p><ul><li><a href="https://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPay</a></li><li><a href="https://trezor.io/">Trezor</a> </li><li><a href="https://cryptosteel.com/">Cryptosteel</a></li><li><a href="https://blockstream.com/">Blockstream</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bullbitcoin.com/">Bull Bitcoin</a>.</li><li><a href="https://hodlhodl.com/">Hodl Hodl</a></li><li><a href="https://bitcoinreserve.com/">Bitcoin Reserve</a></li><li><a href="https://coinkite.com/">Coinkite</a></li><li><a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/">Swan Bitcoin</a></li><li><a href="https://bitcoin-takeover.com/">BTCTKVR</a></li><li><a href="https://mempool.space/">mempool.space</a></li><li><a href="http://wizardsardine.com/">Wizardsardine</a></li></ul><p>For all general information regarding the contest, including updates about the words that have been revealed to the public, visit <a href="http://huntingsats.com/">HuntingSats.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNjE4NjI5/satoshi-guy-fawkes-coding.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[In 2023, Bitcoiners Must Stop Shooting (Or Blocking) The Messengers]]></title><description><![CDATA[As the New Year begins, Bitcoiners should take this opportunity to engage with constructive criticism.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-shoot-the-bitcoin-messengers</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-shoot-the-bitcoin-messengers</guid><category><![CDATA[Eoy 2022]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Debate]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Heidi Porter]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxMDc2OTYwOTgwNDQ0NTI2/handshake-spending-transaction.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">As the New Year begins, Bitcoiners should take this opportunity to engage with constructive criticism.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by </em><em>Heidi Porter, an entrepreneur with</em><em> </em><em>35 years in the tech industry.</em></p><p>I love Bitcoin — and the world that Bitcoin helps create — as much as any of the most passionate Bitcoiners do. As such, I want to do and say things that help it succeed. This desire is not even an iota unique.</p><p>However, sometimes what does not <em>feel</em> productive, <em>is</em> productive. </p><p>Constructive criticism <em>is</em> productive discourse for Bitcoin. Pointing out incorrect assumptions <em>is</em> productive discourse for Bitcoin. Enumerating dangers <em>is</em> productive discourse for Bitcoin. Calling out hypocrisy of goals versus actions <em>is</em> (or can be) productive discourse.</p><p>That said, illogical or nonsensical criticism is <em>not</em> productive discourse. Criticizing because you haven’t done the work to understand is <em>not</em> productive discourse. Appealing to authority or intuition versus well-researched information is <em>not</em> productive discourse. Refusing to understand different use cases for different people is <em>not</em> productive discourse. </p><p>I think most people would agree in theory with the above. But then, we are human. Our wants, needs and emotions get in the way. </p><p>Getting criticism does <em>not feel</em> good. Giving criticism —regardless of merit — feels good. Immediate or short-term gratification does <em>feel</em> good. These are part and parcel of the incentives in the business of being human.</p><p>The result is that noise is amplified and signal is de-amplified. The result is that the wisest and most prophetic people in Bitcoin are often dismissed or ignored. Or shot. This shoot-the-messenger behavior is not correlated with price. </p><p>Messengers are shot in the bull market. Messengers are shot in the bear market. Messengers are shot in the sideways market. Messengers are just… shot.</p><p>The bullet-riddled know who they are. They repeat themselves, repeatedly. Let’s repeat and review just a few of these messages: </p><ul><li>If you want bitcoin to be for people’s security as well as freedom and human rights, don’t post public photos without people’s consent.</li><li>If you want people to be physically secure using Bitcoin, stop sharing information with third-party marketing firms that do not meet the security required for Bitcoin customers. At the least, require separate customer emails for use in marketing systems versus account access or downloads.</li><li>If you want decentralization of miners throughout the world, stop pushing for excessive mining in your city, your company and your country.</li><li>If you want privacy, don’t shout that something offers complete privacy when that is not completely true. </li><li>If your organization's stated mission is “defending civil liberties in the digital world,” then you should speak up <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sen-warren-unconstitutional-crypto-bill">when a bill is introduced that walks all over those</a>. Looking at you, <a href="https://www.eff.org/about">Electronic Frontier Foundation.</a></li><li>If you want people to use money soundly, don’t tell them to run up credit cards or mortgage their homes to put all their money into bitcoin and HODL. </li><li>If you want a peaceful revolution, definitely don’t suggest that Bitcoin is analogous to weapons.</li><li>If you want people to understand Bitcoin, don’t make irrational equivalences to explain it. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-not-stored-time-energy-war">In a recent Bitcoin Magazine article</a>, Stephen Livera wrote about exactly this issue.</li><li>(Dear reader, insert other similar If-then points here.)</li></ul><p>If you don’t think any of the above is that important, then steel man the counter argument of the above. With the possible exception of the last one, all of the above present real threats to both people’s physical safety and security. All of the points are part and parcel of what people are themselves claiming to be the goals of Bitcoin.</p><p>Human incentives often operate from short-term or immediate gratification versus a look at long-term consequences or results. It takes humble research, hard work and an effort at discourse to deal with the above issues as well as other technical and business concerns that are raised and need to be solved.</p><p>For 2023, let’s not shoot productive messages <em>or</em> their messengers. Instead, let’s all take a good look at our own short-term incentives and gratification — and align them better with the goals we want for Bitcoin…</p><p>..in order to make a happier year for more, not just the few.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Heidi Porter.

The lending arm was FTX’s largest unsecured lender, with claims amounting to more than $226 million. <br><br>Bitcoin Magazine PRO <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/crypto-lender-genesis-contagion-continues">described how the firm</a> needed a liquidity injection of at least $1 billion dollars in order to save itself — but this did not happen. In January 2023, Genesis’ parent company, Digital Currency Group, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/gemini-alleges-dcg-genesis-defrauded-users">was accused by Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss</a> of using Genesis in an elaborate high-yield scheme which transferred the high-risk of these yield generating investments to Gemini’s Earn product users. Gemini Earn was earning this yield via Genesis, which, according to the statements made by Winklevoss, Gemini believed to be a reputable counterparty. <br><br>“Genesis has proposed a roadmap to an exit including a Chapter 11 plan that calls for a framework for a global resolution of all claims through, and the creation of, a trust that will distribute assets to creditors,” the filing describes. “All aspects of the restructuring process will be overseen by an independent special committee of the company’s board of directors.”</p><p>Genesis’ Interim CEO, Derar Islim, stated that “While we have made significant progress refining our business plans to remedy liquidity issues caused by the recent extraordinary challenges in our industry, including the default of Three Arrows Capital and the bankruptcy of FTX, an in-court restructuring presents the most effective avenue through which to preserve assets and create the best possible outcome for all Genesis stakeholders.”</p><p>According to the filing, Genesis has more than $150 million cash on hand, “which will provide ample liquidity to support its ongoing business operations and facilitate the restructuring process.” <br><br><br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzODM5Njc4ODI5NDM4NDQ4/bitcoin-cold-winter-ice.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mississippi, Missouri Lawmakers Introduce Bills To Protect The Rights To Mine Bitcoin And Run A Node]]></title><description><![CDATA[Committees from both states will soon vote on bills that would provide a variety of protections for Bitcoin mining operations and node runners.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/mississippi-missouri-bills-to-protect-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/mississippi-missouri-bills-to-protect-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bill]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Missouri]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nodes]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mississippi]]></category><category><![CDATA[United States]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 18:10:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Committees from both states will soon vote on bills that would provide a variety of protections for Bitcoin mining operations and node runners.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Lawmakers from the U.S. states of <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2023/pdf/HB/0800-0899/HB0848IN.pdf">Mississippi</a> and <a href="https://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills231/hlrbillspdf/1719H.01I.pdf">Missouri</a> have introduced bills that seek to legally protect their citizens’ rights to run a Bitcoin node and to mine BTC.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bills have been submitted to both the Houses and Senates of the respective states, with Senator Josh Harkins (R) and Representative Jody Steverson (R) leading the movement within Mississippi. Representative Phil Christofanelli (R) of Missouri submitted its respective bill to the House. Both states’ bills utilize language from the <a href="https://www.satoshiaction.io/">Satoshi Action Fund</a>. Amongst the explicit rights for nodes and mining, the bills also have language prohibiting:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Political subdivisions of the state creating requirements which are not in line with other data center requirements, and changing the zoning of bitcoin miners without proper notice.</li><li>Outlawing of discriminatory energy rates directed at bitcoin miners.</li><li>Sound ordinances directed at mining facilities that are not in-line with other sound ordinances within the community.</li><li>Operating nodes or miners being considered the act of money transmitting. </li></ul><p>Just yesterday, a New Hampshire <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/new-hampshire-commission-recommends-bitcoin-mining">commission recommended</a> that the state Department of Energy investigate how bitcoin mining could be integrated into energy grids statewide. In addition to this recommendation, a <a href="https://portal.bcwg.texas.gov/General-Documents/Texas-Work-Group-on-Blockchain-Matters-Report/wbtp-2m5k">report released</a> in November 2022 directed at members of the Texas legislature recommended making bitcoin an authorized investment for the state, while giving tax incentives to local BTC miners.<br><br>“I see an opportunity for states that were left out of the tech boom to have a real shot at taking part in the Bitcoin boom,” Dennis Porter, CEO and founder of the Satoshi Action Fund commented. “Mining facilities often get built in rural parts of America. We hope that Missouri and Mississippi see this potential and begin opening up their states to Bitcoin mining businesses.”</p><p>The reports all signify growing interest from states across America on how they can benefit from adopting bitcoin and utilizing bitcoin mining within their energy networks. Continued political action from the likes of <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/">Bitcoin Policy Institute</a> and Satoshi Action Fund greatly contribute to the education of lawmakers. </p><p>“Now that these bills have been drafted and introduced, we must continue the education process for the elected leaders of the state of Mississippi,” Porter stated.<br><br>In regards to concerns voiced by Bitcoiners about the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/one-fifth-of-global-bitcoin-hash-rate-is-now-controlled-by-listed-companies">consolidation</a> of hash rate in North American jurisdictions, Porter said that, “Consolidation of mining is a concern, but it is much less of a concern than consolidation of nodes. The nodes and the users of the Bitcoin network are the ones in control, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/block-size-war-soldier-freedom">Blocksize Wars</a> proved this. However, extreme consolidation of mining could become a risk. We at Satoshi Action strongly support the growth of hash rate outside the USA and North America.” <br></p><p>Eric Peterson, director of policy at the Satoshi Act Fund has also been working to advise Mississippi. He explains how “Because of its unique characteristics, Bitcoin miners are looking to expand their footprint in the state. Legislators can see the opportunities these miners bring, especially in terms of creating jobs in rural areas.” </p><p>If the bills are enacted, they could contribute to mounting interest from state governments, something that Peterson is seemingly leaning in on. “The most important concept for legislators to understand is that Bitcoin is not going away anytime soon,” he said. “Even if states don't get behind the industry they need to have a working regulatory structure for it and ensure that businesses who operate in this state can do so long term in their state.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MzAwNDQ3MTM2MjYxNDM0/image1.png" height="186" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MzAwNDQ3MTM2MzI2OTcw/image2.png" height="179" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mainstream Bitcoin Exchanges Have Obscured The Value Of Private, P2P Alternatives]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mainstream bitcoin exchanges which collect troves of user data have warped users’ expectations for privacy-preserving, peer-to-peer versions.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-value-of-p2p-bitcoin-exchanges</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-value-of-p2p-bitcoin-exchanges</guid><category><![CDATA[Privacy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Exchanges]]></category><category><![CDATA[P2P]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Okada]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxMzM1OTgwMjU3NTE5MTM3/202207127_better-an-argument-against-kyc-bitcoin-by-heady-wook.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Mainstream bitcoin exchanges which collect troves of user data have warped users’ expectations for privacy-preserving, peer-to-peer versions.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Okada, mechanical engineer and contributor to peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange RoboSats.</em></p><p>Buying your first bitcoin has dramatically changed since the early days of trading on forums or Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Large exchanges sprung up and nowadays, they’ve perfected the art of attracting newbies through demystifying the buying experience with seamless and, quite frankly, mindless user interfaces.</p><p>Over time, regulators pressured exchanges into collecting users’ data to verify their personal credentials. Exchanges such as these — we’ll call them “verification” exchanges (VEXs) — have custody of your funds and have tools at their disposal to track your identity-linked funds on chain. The reader should already be aware of the advantages of self custody, a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-genesis-block-14th-birthday-reflection">topic</a> worthy of its own detailed exploration.</p><p>The convenience of mainstream VEXs such as Coinbase and Binance have effectively perverted end-user expectations of private, peer-to-peer (P2P) alternatives when buying bitcoin. Consequently, they are disinclined to use alternatives despite the immeasurable benefits to be gained.</p><p>To clarify, we are defining exchanges by their requirements for users to supply identifying information, not whether they are centralized or decentralized in nature. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) can operate privately, P2P if they hold no information on their users and do not custody funds.</p><p>Centralization doesn’t have to sacrifice end-user privacy if the exchange only performs the role of a blind matchmaker and, if shut down, can simply be relaunched by cloning its open-source repository. Therefore, the distinctive “VEX” label is more appropriate than incorrectly referring to all CEXs as having poor privacy.</p><p>For full disclosure, the author contributes to the open-source, P2P exchange RoboSats, but this article is not endorsing just one P2P exchange; rather, it is an endorsement for use of <em>any</em> private, P2P exchange.</p><p>Anything is better than using VEXs!</p><p><em>Note: In many jurisdictions, using a P2P service is no different than using eBay or Craigslist. It is your responsibility to know your jurisdiction’s stance.</em></p><h2>The Problem With Verification Exchanges</h2><p>Obviously, the problem with VEXs is the utter lack of privacy. Users are required to submit self-identifying information like a driver’s license or passport that will perpetually link purchased bitcoin to that user.</p><p>To reiterate, a user’s real name is <em>forever</em> associated with that bitcoin and all downstream transactions. If they withdraw that bitcoin from the identifying exchange and use mixing services, the public ledger can make this evident and authorities may associate that action with criminal activity, regardless of the user’s intent.</p><p>On top of leaving a digital paper trail, their email, password, phone number and fiat bank credentials can become exposed as bad actors can access this information through hacking or by disgruntled exchange employees leaking users’ personal information. Or, as evidenced by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-dangers-of-paper-bitcoin">recent exchange collapses like FTX’s</a>, they risk losing their bitcoin since they don’t truly possess the private keys.</p><p>Many buyers and sellers use these privacy-invasive exchanges primarily because they wield vast liquidity in a slew of local currencies and their slick mobile apps make buying and selling bitcoin a trivial task. What’s more, they’ve built addictive casinos aimed at increasing user retention with every confetti-filled, dopamine-inducing trade.</p><p>Unfortunately, many of the owners and operators of VEXs rabidly advocate for “adoption-friendly” regulations by collecting their customers’ data under the guise of protecting honest users, but, the collection of sensitive user data in the first place is ripe for exploitation by cybercriminals. The simple solution is to avoid VEXs altogether.</p><h2>Why Use Private, P2P Alternatives?</h2><p>Consider the second-order effects of using, and thereby supporting, anti-privacy exchanges. How you buy and sell bitcoin will have amplifying effects on those exchanges and the greater Bitcoin network.</p><p>When using a VEX, you are amplifying the practice of invading privacy and giving credence to the normalization of it. Speaking with your wallet has never been more applicable than when you buy bitcoin with your hard-earned fiat.</p><p>If using a P2P exchange, then you are contributing bitcoin or fiat liquidity to that platform and thus amplifying the immediately-available liquidity so that more users can benefit from privacy-oriented exchanges rather than relying on VEXs.</p><p>The result of supporting VEXs will restrict fiat on-ramps and lead to a failure of Bitcoin’s core ideology as a permissionless, P2P, electronic cash system; on the other hand, supporting P2P exchanges will reinforce the permissionless nature of Bitcoin and create a more robust privacy network for anyone to freely use.</p><p>The following sections look into the expectations for a P2P exchange for some of the users who are accustomed to VEXs.</p><h2>Immediately-Available Liquidity</h2><p>In this author’s experience, the biggest “complaint” from users of VEXs regarding P2P exchanges is the lack of immediately-available liquidity for some currencies and fiat payment methods. Every P2P exchange launches with low liquidity and only grows if their user base grows.</p><p>Such is the origin of any P2P exchange; they do not have sudden, vast liquidity at the get go and without anyone bothering to contribute liquidity, P2P exchanges would cease to exist. Without a marketing budget, they can’t really do anything besides bring in more users with word-of-mouth advertising.</p><p>In the case of RoboSats, we have seen that many new users will only check the order book at that specific moment and very often assume weak liquidity, but they do not realize that untaken orders expire in 24 hours and successful trades are not visible. The trade turnover is actually quite high and orders get taken relatively quickly. Interestingly, behind the apparent lack of liquidity is a<a href="https://learn.robosats.com/stats/"> highly-liquid</a> market.</p><p>Thus, the distinction should be made between immediately-available liquidity on VEXs and high turnover liquidity on P2P exchanges. In this same vein, VEXs make classic dollar-cost averaging a breeze while P2P exchanges usually take a little extra elbow grease. Rather fittingly, this could be seen as a comparison between high-time-preference stacking with VEXs and low-time-preference stacking with P2P exchanges.</p><p>In short, P2P exchanges get better with more liquidity and users.</p><h2>Privacy Always Comes At A Premium</h2><p>Buying and selling bitcoin on a private, P2P exchange usually involves a premium. Users who are accustomed to the VEX lifestyle may hesitate paying above the bitcoin-to-fiat market rate for fear of getting fewer satoshis for their fiat. Conversely, users who value<em> </em>privacy take no issue paying extra for their anonymous bitcoin.</p><p>In P2P markets where there are imbalances between supply and demand, premiums are used on buy and sell orders to incentivize anonymous peers to provide liquidity to the marketplace. If you are buying bitcoin in a currency or payment method that is inconvenient for the seller then, by raising your premium, you may attract someone willing to go out of their way for more satoshis. You have to make it worth their time.</p><p>If selling bitcoin, you can gain more fiat in exchange for it when using P2P services versus using VEXs. From the seller’s point of view, the order premium is an opportunity for profitable arbitrage that also incentivizes sellers to part ways with their desirable bitcoin for undesirable fiat.</p><p>From one perspective, the market rate on VEXs could be viewed as a discounted version of bitcoin that will invade your privacy at the “benefit” of more satoshis in your stack, whereas the market rate on P2P exchanges can be seen as the real bitcoin market evaluation that users are paying to truly secure their wealth and protect their personal privacy.</p><p>It should go without saying, but wanting to transact bitcoin privately has absolutely nothing to do with criminal activity, like lawmakers so desperately preach; rather, it is solely to protect yourself from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-millionaire-zaryn-dentzel-beaten-fortune-stolen-masked-robbery-cryptocurrency-1645550">criminal activity</a> against your wealth and, potentially, your life. If you practice <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/multisig-setup-saves-bitcoin-stack-from-home-burglary">multisig</a> because you take the <a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png">$5 wrench attack</a> seriously, then you should also transact bitcoin privately. The idea that your life is in danger by exposing your identity may sound extreme, but it is not some farfetched, radical fantasy.</p><p>Bitcoin bought privately will always carry a premium because the market will forever value it more than bitcoin that is bought with the capability of exposing your personal finances.</p><h2>Small But Effective Customer Service</h2><p>No exchange is perfect and that applies to both VEXs and P2P exchanges. No matter how streamlined or “foolproof” the platform appears to be, users can still run into trouble. When they do encounter issues, there’s nothing more comforting than knowing a real human being is there to help.</p><p>In contrast to your typical customer service employee, the volunteer developers and contributors are often more than willing to go out of their way to resolve problems and issues since they have more ambition and desire to keep users enjoying the platform.</p><p>Moreover, P2P platforms are more likely to provide tailored solutions since problems that occur are more often than not outside of the platform’s control, like issues with a certain third-party wallet or <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/why-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-doesnt-work">Lightning Network limitations</a>.</p><p>In this author’s observation, the response times, positive attitudes and general helpfulness of P2P exchanges far exceeds that of VEXs where users resignedly<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/1089m42/account_closure_but_my_account_is_temporarily/"> gripe</a> about their terrible and incompetent customer service departments.</p><h2>Bringing Proper Expectations To Privacy-Focused Bitcoin Exchanges</h2><p>By exploring some of these warped expectations, hopefully readers will adjust theirs accordingly when using the<a href="https://sovrnbitcoiner.com/15-methods-to-aquire-non-kyc-bitcoin/"> variety</a> of privacy-focused exchanges available. While, ideally, expectations should not need to be adjusted, users need to recognize the plain realities when using smaller, lower-volume exchanges that focus on privacy over profit and operate on a relatively miniscule budget.</p><p>VEXs such as Coinbase and Binance have had many years to establish their brands by building user trust (for now) and with the help of “crypto educators” encouraging newbies to buy their first assortment of tokens and coins on verification exchanges, “because it’s easy” or, more probably, because they were paid to shill those products.</p><p>You likely bought your first bitcoin on a VEX because you were told that it’s easy or were not aware of private alternatives; likewise, you probably didn’t find out about the disastrous implications of linking your real-life identity to your bitcoin stack until far later into your journey down the rabbit hole.</p><p>No need to fret, it is never too late to begin working toward a more secure and private future. Keep your bitcoin bought on VEXs wholly separate from your private bitcoin stack and stop giving VEXs your business.</p><p>Ultimately, P2P exchanges will have to work incredibly hard to compete in the same league as VEXs. Yet, without peers liquefying the order books, there would be no private, P2P exchanges at all. The best we can do is reason with users to value privacy and adjust their expectations when using P2P exchanges in lieu of high-volume, privacy-foregoing, verification exchanges.</p><p>So, spread the word!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Okada.

Both reports conclude that further research into Bitcoin is necessary, and indicate that American states are increasingly considering the benefits of embracing bitcoin. </p><p>Also indicated in the New Hampshire report was the necessity for regulation to protect consumers. “A well regulated cryptocurrency market provides consumer protection, and trust in the market which is a boon to investors, the general public, and businesses alike,” reads appendix B, written by New Hampshire’s Bureau of Securities Regulation. “What has become increasingly clear over the past several years is that cryptocurrency has a role in securities regulation.”<br><br>States like New Hampshire and Texas could end up leading the way for Bitcoin adoption in the U.S. if they decide to follow such recommendations. It is important for Bitcoiners who have ties to state legislature or are in the Bitcoin ecosystem to advocate for continued inquiry into how states can integrate the technology, as states are often much more nimble in their ability to adopt new technologies when compared to the federal government. <br><br><br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTQ3/bitcoin-code.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[CleanSpark Breaks Ground On 50 Megawatt Bitcoin Mining Expansion]]></title><description><![CDATA[The mining firm will nearly double its existing infrastructure, adding up to 50 Megawatts to the 36 Megawatts already in use.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-50-megawatt-bitcoin-mining-expansion</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-50-megawatt-bitcoin-mining-expansion</guid><category><![CDATA[CleanSpark]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMzUxMjcwOTg2MTYzNzc5/mining-pick-axe.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The mining firm will nearly double its existing infrastructure, adding up to 50 Megawatts to the 36 Megawatts already in use.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark has announced the start of construction on a site in Washington, Georgia, set to house 16,000 miners, which could bring the company’s hash rate total to as high as 8.7 EH/s.</p><p>The site, which CleanSpark <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/08/09/2494690/0/en/CleanSpark-Acquires-Plug-in-Ready-Bitcoin-Mining-Facility-Scalable-to-86-Megawatts-or-2-6-EH-s.html">announced the acquisition of</a> in 2022, would contribute to an additional 2.2 EH/s of hash rate for the company.

However, relatively little is known about the black investors who have been attracted to it. Whether you are purchasing bitcoin or not, you can learn important lessons from these black Americans and become a more intelligent investor in any field.</p><p>In the late 2010s, a significant number of black Americans<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/black-investors-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-crash/671750/"> began</a> researching Bitcoin with enthusiasm. They saw the promise of its blockchain technology, a distributed ledger that provides an immutable record of transactions. They watched the price movement of bitcoin hitting record highs, which doubtlessly appealed to them as well.</p><p>Many bitcoin investors started investing in cryptocurrency during that period — a time that later coincided with the distribution of COVID-19 stimulus checks in 2020. Millions of people who had never had much to invest or save suddenly had cash on hand, and many chose to put them into bitcoin.</p><h2>The Crypto Bubble</h2><p>Following this period, in which many black investors found bitcoin, the overall crypto market has started to shrink.</p><p>Black investors were among the thousands of Americans who witnessed their cryptocurrency holdings disappear after these digital currencies entered into a winter market.</p><p>So far, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/23/bitcoin-lost-over-60-percent-of-its-value-in-2022.html#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20crypto%20market%20has,22%2C%20per%20CNBC's%20calculations.">cryptocurrencies have lost more than $2 trillion in value over the last year</a>, which has seen bitcoin plunge from highs of $69,000 reached in November 2021 to the current price of about $20,000 per coin.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MjUxNDY4MTM0MDAwMzU0/bitcoin-price.png" height="273" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The crypto crash hit black Americans as hard or harder than any other demographic community, in part because bitcoin had become so popular in that community. According to data collected by<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/08/13/crypto-seen-path-equity-black-latino-and-lgbtq-investors/5431122001/"> Harris Poll</a>, 23% of black Americans own digital assets, while 11% of white Americans own such assets.</p><p>The crypto market fall has been costly and tragic, but that has not deterred many within the Black community, as they have such a strong desire to discover financial autonomy.</p><h2>Addressing Financial Inclusion</h2><p>Bitcoin naturally holds practical appeal for small-dollar investors from historically marginalized communities who distrust traditional finance. For instance, Black Americans can purchase BTC on digital platforms without a credit check, a step that may hold them back from financial inclusion in other assets.</p><p>Many Black investors have invested funds into bitcoin because they found it hard to build generational wealth in the traditional system. <a href="https://www.moneygeek.com/financial-planning/resources/black-african-american/">Overlooked by investment managers and discriminated against by banks</a>, many Black investors have turned to more sovereign opportunities.</p><p>This long history of discrimination around investments explains why the world now witnesses a wide demography of interest and inclusivity in Bitcoin — because it is new, open and has fewer barriers to entry.</p><p>Another reason why people of color are adopting Bitcoin at a higher rate than others is likely because the cryptocurrency offers a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/strike-launches-instant-african-remittances">cheaper remittance method</a> than sending funds through banks. </p><h2>Surviving In A Bear Market</h2><p>It is true to say that the cryptocurrency market can be a risky place due to its volatility. Profits are made and lost within minutes. But despite this, many black investors have remained bullish on Bitcoin.</p><p>A good example of a successful black cryptocurrency investor can be found in Jefferson Noel, a 27-year-old. Noel<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/47d338e2-3d3c-40ce-8a09-abfa25c16a7f"> gained</a> his first exposure to cryptocurrency in January 2019 when he accidentally invested $5 in bitcoin while using a payment platform called Cash App. By May 2020, the value of his unintentional investment rose to $70. This inspired him and, as a result, he put another $20,000 of his savings into cryptocurrency. Recently, Jefferson said he is buying more altcoins despite persistent losses that have seen more than 20% of his cryptocurrency investment wiped out this year. Clearly, Bitcoin opened his eyes about becoming a more active investor.</p><p>Another can be found in <a href="https://time.com/6106706/bitcoin-black-investors/">Charlene Fadirepo</a>, a banker who used to work at the Federal Reserve’s inspector general’s office, who has become a convicted bitcoin holder.</p><p>“Last year, she and her husband bought $6,000 worth (of bitcoin),” <a href="https://time.com/6106706/bitcoin-black-investors/">Time</a> reported. “No investment has ever generated the kinds of returns for them that Bitcoin has.”</p><h2>In A Nutshell </h2><p>A lot can be learned from Black investors as they demonstrate that having the right mindset and resilience to deal with setbacks is the key to successful Bitcoin investing. Those who want to make money through bitcoin investing should be willing to hold on to their investments through the ups and downs and consider the fact that it can grant a form of financial security that is often barred from the underbanked. For many, this can be much more valuable than any quick gains.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Nicholas Otieno.

Either way, bitcoin holders are celebrating the latest action to start 2023. Bitcoin has shown some significant momentum and has powered through every key short-term price level across daily moving averages and on-chain realized prices. In fact, every major high-beta play in the market is showing the same strength which gives us more caution than confidence in this latest short squeeze highlighted last week in “<a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/bitcoin-price-hits-21k-massive-short-squeeze">Bitcoin Rips To $21,000, Shorts Demolished In Biggest Squeeze Since 2021</a>.” </p><p>As much as we would like to see an independent bitcoin move higher, there’s plenty of signs in the market showing the opposite is likely. We’ve seen a relatively meaningful bounce in the most oversold names of 2022, with a short squeeze and subsequent round of FOMO off the 2022 lows.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>This recent risk rally has seen implied equity market volatility drift to new lows as the U.S. dollar continues to weaken over the short-term, National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) loosens and global M2 money supply contracts at a much slower pace relative to the last few months.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Net liquidity, a model we highlighted in our previous piece, shows a contraction compared to last year but hasn’t changed much over the last few months. If we’re to see a sustained rally continue, we’d like to see growth in net liquidity over the next couple of months to be the main driver accompanying this move. </p><p>In their recent meeting minutes, members of the Federal Reserve expressed concern about the “unwarranted easing in financial conditions” caused by the run-up in risky assets and subsequently hindering their efforts to cool inflation.</p><p>With the Bank of Japan deciding on whether to loosen their monetary policy, this could cause the carry trade to unwind. We view this to be one of the few ways where both the dollar could fall at the same time as global equity markets weaken, with equities repricing due to rising costs of U.S. capital. </p><hr><p><em>Like this content? </em><a href="https://bm.b.tc/3Wlped5"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

Okcoin has also previously <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/okcoin-provides-grant-to-lightning-developer-antoine-riard">provided support</a> for Lightning developer Antoine Riard in a bid to support the second-layer network’s privacy.</p><p>“Falke is one of six people in the world with the ability to approve or deny proposed changes to the code underlying the world’s biggest cryptocurrency,” <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/01/18/2591221/0/en/Okcoin-and-Paradigm-Partner-on-Grant-for-Bitcoin-Core-Maintainer-Marco-Falke.html">the announcement</a> explains. “As a Bitcoin Core maintainer, he reviews proposed additions to the network’s code from contributors, of which there are over 400 currently active. The grant from Okcoin and Paradigm is to provide Falke with a livable income while he devotes 40+ hours per week to Bitcoin Core development — a job without a salary, given Bitcoin’s decentralized structure.”</p><p>The announcement also highlights that many Bitcoin users may not know that the developers and maintainers of Bitcoin are technically volunteers, who, due to the nature of Bitcoin, have no centralized organization to provide funding or support for their efforts. Okcoin had <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoiners-care-funding-bitcoin-development">previously released a survey</a> that showed that 85% of Bitcoiners care about exchanges funding Bitcoin development. </p><p>Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang addressed this, saying that “Paradigm believes it’s our responsibility to help fund independent Bitcoin research and development … We’re pleased to provide a grant to Marco, who continues to move the network forward with his work.”<br><br>This particular contribution brings Okcoin’s total contributions to Bitcoin development funding to $1.5 million. This respectable offering to the Bitcoin network would ideally be replicated by other firms in the industry in order to support development of the technology that allows for their existence.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNzU0OTcxNDk3MTEzMjUx/20220819_best-sidechain-recap---shinobi.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[U.S. Department Of Justice Shuts Down Crypto Exchange Bitzlato, CEO Arrested]]></title><description><![CDATA[The DOJ has charged the exchange with facilitating more than $700 million in illicit transactions tied to Russia, money laundering and criminal activity.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/doj-shuts-down-bitzlato-crypto-exchange</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/doj-shuts-down-bitzlato-crypto-exchange</guid><category><![CDATA[Arrest]]></category><category><![CDATA[Money laundering]]></category><category><![CDATA[Russia]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime]]></category><category><![CDATA[Department of Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[DOJ]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 18:46:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODQ4ODg5MzIxMTU1/bitcoin-trader-sentenced-to-two-year-prison-term.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The DOJ has charged the exchange with facilitating more than $700 million in illicit transactions tied to Russia, money laundering and criminal activity.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced the closure of the Bitzlato cryptocurrency exchange, along with the FBI’s arrest of the exchange’s owner, Anatoly Legkodymov. In a live stream hosted on January 18, representatives from the law enforcement bureau revealed that the Hong Kong-based exchange was allegedly a part of a large illicit cryptocurrency network designed to circumvent sanctions, launder money and conceal crimes.&nbsp;</p><p>“Legkodymov operated Bitzlato as a high-tech financial hub that, in his own words, catered to ‘known crooks,’” the DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-delivers-remarks-founder-and-majority-owner">statement</a> reads. “Bitzlato failed to implement safeguards required by U.S. law – safeguards that enable authorities to detect and investigate financial crimes.”</p><p>In the live stream, officials warned that criminal actors, regardless of their location or residence, must answer to U.S. law enforcement. “Whether you break our laws from China or Europe or abuse our financial system from a tropical island—you can expect to answer for your crimes inside a United States courtroom,” the DOJ claims, in a potential reference to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">embattled FTX’s</a> Bahamas hub. <br><br>Indeed, the announcement regarding Bitzlato comes at a time of increasing scrutiny from law enforcement and regulators. Gemini and Genesis have both been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-with-selling-unregistered-securities.html">charged by the SEC</a> in just the previous week, alongside the aforementioned FTX and all the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sbf-formally-indicted-charged-with-fraud">charges</a> levied <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/22/alameda-chief-caroline-ellison-ftxs-gary-wang-plead-guilty-to-fraud-charges/">against those</a> involved.</p><p>The DOJ alleges that Bitzlato facilitated more than $700 million in transactions involving illicit funds from 2018-2022, but at the time of the live stream, Bitzlatos’ <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1615757494764163072?s=46&amp;t=ubBbqt_QyB6zvGsGfp7Img">tagged wallets only had</a> $11,000 on them, compared to a peak of $6 million. Even at its peak, the volume of money involved in this event is minor when compared to the recent collapse of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-has-entered-liquidation-source-says-2022-06-29/">Three Arrows Capital</a> and other related entities, who many alleged to be scams in their own right.

    </figure><p>“While Bitcoin Chess is pretty self-explanatory, Bitcoin Scratch is an even more approachable concept, where players receive packs of scratch cards, with a chance to earn Bitcoin if the cards hold the right combos on them,” describes the release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of how the company can sustainably provide bitcoin to players who play the game, “Essentially, players receive a revenue share from the game, meaning VIKER splits what they’re earning from the game with the player,” the release said. “This creates a more engaging experience for players, leading to better retention and ultimately makes the game more profitable, despite the revenue share. These are not large amounts of money, though, with players earning a few cents per session, which is what makes the concept sustainable.”</p><p>Dan Beasley, co-founder of VIKER, stated why the company would choose to work with ZEBEDEE and implement their payments platform, saying “Ultimately, implementing rewards with ZEBEDEE’s platform isn’t about players earning money, it’s about creating a more interesting and fun experience. Because earning these tiny rewards simply feels great, regardless of if it’s small amounts that won’t materially impact most people’s lives … But at the same time, it’s real money that you earn just for having fun. So when you can play chess and get Bitcoin for it, why would you play a version without that?”</p><p>Ben Cousens, Chief Strategy Officer at ZEBEDEE explained that they weren’t necessarily trying to focus on Bitcoiners as their sole audience, explaining that “These games have a massive global audience that mostly doesn’t care about Bitcoin. And we’re not asking them to. It is extremely easy to set up a ZEBEDEE account, connect it to VIKER’s games and withdraw Bitcoin to your ZEBEDEE app.”&nbsp;</p><p>According to the release, the two gaming firms are already silently preparing for their next launch, which they promise will be “even more impactful, as they will be adding the first very well-known franchise to their portfolio.” <br><br>Interested users will just have to wait and see — but can get started with Bitcoin Chess and Bitcoin Scratch now by <a href="https://zeb.gg/app-pr">downloading the ZEBEDEE app</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgxOTQwNTQ1MjE4Njg0MDM1/img_5298.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MjM2NzY2NzI5MzgxNjAy/zbd-x-viker-_-games2.jpg" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dear Normie, Don’t Buy Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[Too many people invest in bitcoin the asset without fully appreciating all of the value that Bitcoin the technology can provide.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-buy-bitcoin-until-you-learn-more</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-buy-bitcoin-until-you-learn-more</guid><category><![CDATA[Investing]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin price]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Education]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tim Niemeyer]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjU5NjI0MzI1MTYyMTQ2/big-brain-bitcoin.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Too many people invest in bitcoin the asset without fully appreciating all of the value that Bitcoin the technology can provide.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Tim Niemeyer, co-host of the Lincolnland Bitcoin Meetup.</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>As you might have learned from watching the mainstream news, the bitcoin price has been pumping as of late. If you bought the top and held until now, you may consider taking advice from good ol’ Mr. Goldshill himself, <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1613507494541770752?s=20&amp;t=ylgcUa1_jDScGAtUSqx20Q">Peter Schiff</a>, and use this opportunity to sell. If you’re someone who missed the boat, though, you may reasonably wait for confirmation and buy closer to $70,000. For those thinking to make a quick buck, you might hop on for a ride just to try and cash out near the next all-time high. If you’re a Communist who doesn’t believe we need a noncoercive way to coordinate human action… well, then, I can’t help you.</p><p>Whatever your story or specific situation is, one thing is clear: buying bitcoin is not going to help you. </p><p>Yes, you read that right. The physical act of trading one monetary good for another does next to nothing for you. Sure, you might make a few dollars in the short term (save for <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/crypto-taxes/">as much as 37% on short-term gains taxes</a>). You may even get a girlfriend. Pay for that next vacation? Lambo? Why not?! But none of that matters because the ultimate value of bitcoin is not merely quantitative, but qualitative. And to get the qualitative benefits, you’ll need to prove you’ve done some work…</p><h2>Proof Of Work</h2><figure>

You could spend months to years learning about any of the following: cryptography, computer science, distributed systems, open-source software, network effects, game theory, economics, monetary theory, eleventh grade math, energy production, geopolitics, history, human rights, philosophy, human psychology, personal responsibility, just to name a… few. The good news is that there’s so many rabbit holes down which to go. I’ve been studying Bitcoin since 2018, and I’ve yet to even come close to exhausting the depth and breadth that Bitcoin offers. On top of that, the wisdom derived is rooted in reason and logic; it acts as an anchor in a world where reality is constantly and increasingly manipulated.</p><p>Initially, it’s hard to grapple with the fact that you’ve grown accustomed to living with a relatively short-term mindset, as we all have at some point in our lives. This short-term mindset is what Bitcoiners refer to as “high time preference.” It might take some time, but understanding how the money we choose changes individuals’ incentive structure is the first step to understanding why bitcoin is the best form of money. Inflationary fiat incentivizes its users to make decisions based on the needs of the present, while disinflationary bitcoin incentivizes its users to plan for the future while deprioritizing present consumption. It took me years of intent study to get to a point where I could articulate that point and truly grasp its effect on society. Don’t expect to get there in one conversation, article or podcast. This knowledge can only be spoon fed so much. You have to build a “proof-of-work'' mindset. Unfortunately, many of your friends think they already know what they don’t know…</p><h2>Dunning-Kruger Around And Find Out</h2><figure>

    </figure><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Wikipedia states</a> that the Dunning–Kruger (DK) effect is a cognitive bias whereby people with low ability, expertise or experience regarding a certain type of task or area of knowledge tend to overestimate their ability or knowledge. One main reason that most normies won’t take the time and effort to do their own research, or <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=DYOR">DYOR</a>, is because of hubris. </p><p>The most recent and obvious example of this in regards to Bitcoin came during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJeEFrRm01s">Joe Rogan’s recent interview</a> with geopolitical strategist, speaker and New York Times best-selling author, Peter Zeihan. While this guy is seemingly intelligent and well versed on much of what he writes and speaks about, he completely exposed his utter lack of knowledge and understanding of Bitcoin (and basic monetary theory) in less than a three-minute time span. For a great breakdown of how epically wrong he was about Bitcoin, listen to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/guys-take-62-dear-peter-zeihan/id1359544516?i=1000593359100">Guy Swann’s brilliant “Bitcoin Audible” podcast</a>.</p><p>The point here is not to beat up on Zeihan (too much). The point is that we are all human and are able to easily make incorrect assumptions based on misconceptions and ignorance. To approach Bitcoin, you must begin with a level of humility and intellectual honesty. Unfortunately, too many of us will outsource this to “trusted” media sources filled with people who have yet to do the work themselves. This is a core concept within Bitcoin: <a href="https://thebitcoinmanual.com/btc-culture/glossary/dont-trust-verify/">don’t trust, verify</a>. If you choose to trust those who show bravado but are void of any depth of knowledge, you’ll end up sharing their same misconceptions. You have to do the work yourself and come to your own conclusion. It takes… time (pun indeed intended).</p><h2>It Takes Time…</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>One of the most useful models in tracking the cyclical tops for both the S&amp;P 500 Index and bitcoin since March 2020 has proven to be net liquidity, an original model by <a href="https://twitter.com/42MacroAlerts">42 Macro</a>. Net liquidity tracks the changes in Federal Reserve total assets, the U.S. Treasury general account balance and the reverse repo facility. A lower net liquidity translates to less capital available to deploy in markets. We find it useful as a key macro indicator to assess current liquidity conditions and how bitcoin trades in the market. </p><p>Bitcoin has acted as a liquidity sponge throughout its life and contracting liquidity in all markets has had a significant impact on the bitcoin price and trajectory. Ultimately, that’s one of the main drivers of our core long-term thesis that bitcoin’s growth depends on an environment of perpetual monetary debasement and expanding liquidity to work against current levels of unsustainable sovereign debt and deflationary forces. In the short-term, it’s not clear when overall liquidity will increase again en masse. That’s the trillion dollar question and the topic of conversation on which everyone is speculating. Net liquidity provides a view into that trajectory as a measure that’s updated weekly with fresh data.</p><p>Bitcoin is seeing some of its largest relative strength since January 2021, but it also comes at a time when we’re seeing a significant daily uptick in net liquidity after a period of historically low volatility. The uptick is driven by a much lower reverse repo balance since the start of the year. With the Fed’s position of “higher for longer,” a projected view of Core CPI at 3.5% for 2023 and continued balance sheet runoff, we will likely see net liquidity decline — barring a spontaneous or emergency policy reversal.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Price has broken above the short-term holder realized price. That’s happened only a few times in this bear market and these events were short-lived. As this price reflects the average on-chain cost basis of the more recent buyers, it will be key to see if these market participants are looking to sell here at cost or if they will stay to continue with the momentum.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The 200-day moving average may seem somewhat arbitrary, but the mere fact that many technical traders and momentum- and trend-based investors monitor this level gives it significance. A clean break above could mean continued strength for bitcoin in the coming days and weeks ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>The price action to start the new year has been quite the promising sign for bitcoin bulls. Similarly, over the last week, shorts as a percentage of futures liquidations has reached its highest level in the history of the data. While shorts have been decimated as of late, it’s likely that this immediate upside could be capped.</p><p>While there is a long way to go in terms of surpassing previous bull market heights, the year-to-date performance has been hopeful following a year where the industry practically imploded. </p><p>Overall, this is a promising start to 2023. </p><hr><p><em>Like this content? </em><a href="https://bm.b.tc/3Wlped5"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

Anyone doubting this need only take <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> for a spin and imagine how artificial intelligence will change society in the years to come. Market cycles come and go, but the innovations being built today bring lasting potential for revolutionizing how we go about our lives in the future. </p><p>Yet the underappreciated tragedy of this technological advancement is in those who don’t stand to benefit. <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services#:~:text=Globally%2C%20some%201.4%20billion%20adults,and%20living%20in%20rural%20areas.">Almost 1.5 billion people around the world are unbanked</a> — cut off from the modern financial system. In a time of economic downturn, they face steep odds to improve their standards of living, let alone take advantage of the latest technology that can improve their lives. </p><p>The majority of unbanked people are located in developing countries that have been hit harder by rapid inflation in 2022. This is not going away — the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2022/10/11/world-economic-outlook-october-2022">estimates that</a> inflation in emerging markets and developing economies will be nearly twice that of advanced ones in 2023. </p><p>This past year has produced some scary examples of runaway inflation — in Turkey, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-middle-east-business-turkey-prices-1437b28b07e2bf357d44f9e368dcb3c1#:~:text=ANKARA%2C%20Turkey%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94,living%20crisis%20in%20the%20country.">yearly inflation peaked at 85%</a>. In Lebanon, yearly inflation was <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/lebanon/inflation-cpi">well above 100% throughout 2022</a>. Heavy-handed, interventionist monetary policy sparked political crises, and access to reliable banking services was interrupted. </p><p>It’s clear that systemic risks built into the legacy financial system as well as the policy responses of many governments have failed spectacularly to serve those most vulnerable to economic shocks. </p><p>Bitcoin can help fix this. Nothing is a panacea, but if we stand a chance of bringing more economic equality and financial inclusion to those who need it most, we need a financial revolution led by Bitcoin to be part of the solution. </p><p>I know that Bitcoin can help bring about that revolution. That’s because Bitcoin is:</p><ul><li>Money that doesn’t require intermediaries to be transferred anywhere in the world</li><li>Programmatically designed to be deflationary</li><li>An open, decentralized and permissionless protocol</li></ul><p>However, there is a massive information gap that needs to be filled before Bitcoin can reach its potential. That’s why first, we need to educate people on what Bitcoin is, provide examples of what Bitcoin can do for them, and fight for crypto policy that keeps the unique benefits of the technology intact. This is how we can create the best ecosystem for Bitcoin to be an effective catalyst for change. </p><h2>Increasing Bitcoin Adoption Through Education</h2><p>Currently, the global finance climate looks like a perfect storm for Bitcoin advocates to call for greater adoption of bitcoin as both a store of value and a payment technology.</p><p>However, ask the average person on the street what Bitcoin is, and you likely won’t get a positive answer. We have the bear market, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">Three Arrows Capital implosion</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/ftx-exchange-release-day-one-bankruptcy-filing">FTX debacle</a> to thank for that. These highly-publicized developments have set Bitcoin adoption back by several years and have greatly damaged the reputation of the technology underpinning the asset itself.</p><p>In my capacity as chief marketing officer at OKX, I am focused on seeking platforms that not only market our business but build understanding of Bitcoin among mainstream audiences who could be the next wave of adopters. Through our partnerships with <a href="https://www.mancity.com/news/club/okx-becomes-training-kit-partner-of-manchester-city-63793127#:~:text=OKX%2C%20one%20of%20the%20world's,for%20the%202022%2F2023%20season.&amp;text=The%20agreement%20will%20see%20OKX,men's%20and%20women's%20first%20teams.">Manchester City F.C.</a>, <a href="https://www.mclaren.com/racing/partners/okx/">McLaren Racing</a> and the <a href="https://www.business2community.com/nft-news/tribeca-film-festival-integrates-crypto-exchange-okx-to-offer-vip-passes-as-nfts-02605007">Tribeca Film Festival</a>, it is our hope that a rising tide will lift all boats. </p><p>But awareness is only half of the battle. User adoption happens when people become convinced of the real-world use cases for a technology. Theoretical arguments are nice, but this is a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world. Luckily, the practical arguments for Bitcoin have become very clear after the events of the last year:</p><ul><li><strong>Intermediary-free, fast, low-cost money transfer:</strong> The protocol allows bitcoin transfers anywhere in the world, anytime, with no need for expensive money service providers or cumbersome bank processes</li><li><strong>Censorship avoidance:</strong> No one can prevent anyone else from using the protocol, which has real-world implications for those in need during times of traditional banking outages, conflict or rights movements</li><li><strong>Anti-inflationary store of value: </strong>No central oversight authority means that no one can change the supply of bitcoin or devalue the asset through inflation</li></ul><p>It will take hard work to spread awareness of these benefits and cut through the noise. For every Bitcoin advocate, that hard work starts now. Every journey has setbacks and hardships. But those of us who truly believe in Bitcoin must do all we can to expand access and awareness of this technology so it can realize its revolutionary potential. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Haider Rafique.

You should then have a good idea of the core design of the system at that point, so now let's take a look at likely problems that are going to occur as it grows in adoption. With the platform <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GhEezzto4Y">becoming a popular one for the Bitcoin community</a>, these problems are ones to be aware of.</p><p>As I discussed in the prior article, user public/private key pairs are integral to how Nostr works as a protocol. There are no usernames, or any type of identifiers that a relay server is in control of, to associate to individual users. It is simply those users' keys that are completely under their control. </p><p>This functions as a tight binding between the actual user and how they are identified by others that prevents any relay server from unbinding those two things, i.e., giving someone's identifier to another user. This solves one of the biggest fundamental problems of platforms used for communication between people: the lack of control over users’ own identities. But it also introduces all of the problems of key management that someone possessing a private key runs into. Keys can be lost and keys can be compromised and if such an event were to occur, users have no one to go to for assistance, just like with Bitcoin. There is no customer support to recover anything. You lose it, that's it. </p><p>This is going to inevitably necessitate a scheme for users to rotate from one keypair to another in a way that is verifiable and discoverable for other users that they interact with through the protocol. The entire protocol is based around proving that an event came from a specific user (identity key), so all of those guarantees go out the window once someone's keys are compromised. </p><p>How do you handle that? Just go check their Twitter account? Well, then that's not a very decentralized system, ultimately, if you require using a centralized platform where they are not in control of their identity to verify their Nostr identity. </p><p>Have other users attest to the legitimacy of a new key? That doesn't address situations such as mass key compromises, or not knowing anyone close to them well enough to trust their attestation. </p><p>Nostr needs an actual cryptographic scheme tying the rotation of one key to another. There is a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/issues/103">proposal from developer fiatjaf</a> for a basic scheme that could potentially solve this issue. The basic idea would be to take a long set of addresses derived from a single master seed, and create a set of "tweaked" keys similar to how Taproot trees are committed to a Bitcoin key. Taproot takes the Merkle tree root of the Taproot tree and "adds" it to the public key to create a new public key. This can be replicated by adding that Merkle tree root to the private key in order to attain the matching private key for the new public key. Fiatjaf's idea is to chain commitments going backwards from the end to the beginning so that each tweaked key would actually contain a proof that the next tweaked key was used to create it. </p><p>So, imagine starting with key Z, the last one in the chain. You would tweak this with something, and then go backwards and create a tweaked version of key Y using the tweaked Z key (Z' + Y = Y'). From here you would take Y' and then use it to tweak X (Y' + X = X'). You would do this all the way back to key A, to get A', and from there, begin using that key. When it is compromised, the user can broadcast an event containing the untweaked key A and tweaked key B'. This would contain all of the data needed to show B' was used to generate A', and users could immediately stop following A' and follow B' instead. They would know definitively that B' is that user's next key and to follow that instead. </p><p>This proposal still has some problems though. First, you have to generate all of the keys you would ever use ahead of time and it has no way to rotate to a whole new set of keys. This could be dealt with by committing to a master key in this scheme that could notarize such rotations, or simply generating a very large set of keys from the beginning. Either path would be a valid course to take, but ultimately would require keeping a root key or key material safe and only exposing individual hotkeys to Nostr clients. </p><p>This scheme, however, does nothing to protect users or offer a mechanism for identity recovery in the event that the root key material is lost or is itself compromised. Now, this isn't to say that there is no benefit to fiatjaf's scheme, there absolutely is, but it's important to make the point that no solution solves every problem. </p><p>To pontificate a bit on potential solutions here, imagine instead of a chain of tweaked keys like he proposes, that a key is tweaked with a master cold key that must also be used to sign the event rotating from one key to another. You have key A', which is derived by adding A and M (the master key), and the rotation event would be A, M and B' (generated by adding B and M) with a signature from M. M could be a multisig threshold key — two of three, three of five, etc. This could potentially add redundancy against loss as well as provide a secure mechanism for key rotation. This opens the door as well to using services to aid in recovery, or spreading some of those keys around to trusted friends. It offers all of the same flexibility as multisig does with Bitcoin itself. </p><p><a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/26.md">NIP26</a> is also a proposal that could be very useful in handling this problem. This specifies a protocol extension to events allowing a signature from one key to authorize another key to post events on its behalf. The "token," or signature proof of delegation, would then be included in all events posted by the second public key on the first's behalf. It can even be time limited so that delegation tokens automatically expire and have to be renewed. </p><p>Ultimately, however it is solved, this problem <em>has</em> to be solved for Nostr in the long term. A protocol based entirely on public/private key pairs being used as identities cannot gain traction and adoption if the integrity of those identities cannot be protected and maintained for users. That eventually will boil down to having to constantly use out-of-band and centralized platforms to verify new keys and coordinate people following your new identity when something is lost or compromised, and at that point, those other platforms become a means to sow confusion and engage in censorship. </p><p>Issues of key management and security are big problems with a very large design space full of trade offs and pain points, but they are problems that are going to have to be solved within the context of Nostr for it to work. In my next article, I will summarize some issues that I see cropping up in regards to relay server architecture and scaling issues that Nostr developers will have to confront given the basic data structures that Nostr is built on. </p><p>For anyone reading and wondering why I haven't mentioned decentralized identifiers (DIDs): Yes, that is a potential solution to these problems that, in my opinion, is quite comprehensive. However, Nostr developers seem very hesitant to integrate DIDs into the protocol or clients due to the fact that it would create external dependencies outside of the Nostr protocol. If you are not familiar with how DIDs work on a technical level and are interested, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/dids-built-on-bitcoin-fix-the-web">this article by Level 39</a> is a very well written summarization of how they work. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shinobi.

He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.</em></p><p>Barely a week into 2023, and I’ve seen <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/73loUpT2pwPb6gv7SQg8aB?si=xNfTOEu6R8SrcVL4ukl4mQ">Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano debate Michael Shellenberger</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/406fOiiKMU0ot5AS1AIwve?si=1bffEtx6TUGNa-KSPfRaAg">Joe Rogan interview Peter Zeihan</a>. While these media impressions may seem unrelated, a common thread is sewn between the two: experts in different fields confidently professing uninformed opinions on Bitcoin. </p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/406fOiiKMU0ot5AS1AIwve?si=1bffEtx6TUGNa-KSPfRaAg">Zeihan’s</a> misunderstandings can be heard in the last 20 minutes or so of the interview.

    </figure><p>I think one of the most pertinent questions to consider following these conversations is: How are either of these two gentlemen qualified to make such assessments in the first place?</p><p>How could someone feel so comfortable saying something they so obviously know so little about? If these two are so confident with opinions that are so obviously wrong and uninformed, why should I trust them on anything else? </p><p>While discussing these two interviews in a small group, one of the members said something that inspired the idea behind this article:</p><blockquote><p>“For now they both feel secure in their assertions. In the next bull cycle these clips will haunt them and tarnish their credibility.”</p><p>–<a href="https://twitter.com/AB_Brammer">Alex Brammer</a>, board of directors member for the <a href="https://bitcointodaycoalition.org/about">Bitcoin Today Coalition (BTC)</a></p></blockquote><p>He even turned that sentiment into a tweet, seen below:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/AB_Brammer/status/1612144601015500803"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>A characteristic common to Bitcoiners is their low time preference — the willingness to sacrifice short-term comfort for long-term gains, as opposed to following every whim. </p><p>These individuals are the personification of what the fiat system is doing to people, a symptom of what happens when the money ceases to communicate clear pricing signals. Their time preference has been so skewed that they are willingly sacrificing their long-term credibility for short-term notoriety. They do it thoughtlessly, with little understanding of what they’re even critiquing, let alone the long-term implications of what they’re saying. They do it because they must, lest they be cast out as simpletons, like the rest of us. </p><p>What ever happened to simply saying “I don’t know”? Perhaps more importantly, what happens when all these naysayers are not just proven wrong, but completely, spectacularly and absolutely wrong in every way? </p><p>I predict in the months and years to come, that those who chose to speak carelessly will begin to quickly lose any semblance of the credibility that they once had. </p><h2>The Cure For Gell-Mann Amnesia Is Absurdity</h2><blockquote><p>“Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward — reversing cause and effect. I call these the ‘wet streets cause rain’ stories. Paper’s full of them.</p><p>"In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/gell-mann-amnesia/">Michael Crichton</a></p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin is the orange pill that wakes you up from the matrix, yes, but what if the narrative became too absurd? What if the critiques and the gripes became so obviously wrong that these so-called experts were no longer respected, let alone listened to?</p><p>I was a fan of Zeihan. I found his books interesting and informative. They appeared well thought out and thoroughly researched. But after that interview, I don’t know what to think anymore. After hearing him speak, before even hearing his Bitcoin critique, all I really heard was a quasi-automaton; a character who was well rehearsed at speaking in polished sound bites. His Bitcoin analysis was so smooth, well worded and confident. Man, was he confident. And everything he said was absolutely wrong. </p><p>I see the next few years as the precipice for the dissolution of current day experts. Much like the economist uncle in the dystopian tale “The Mandibles,”<em> </em>these experts will have answers for everything, and yet won’t be able to explain a thing. Slowly but surely, people will realize that the world that these “experts” have created inside their theoretical minds no longer exists. Reality will eventually come crashing down. </p><p>But you don’t have to wait for that. </p><p>Once you understand Bitcoin, you understand that the long-term price is slowly approaching infinity as central banks gradually, then suddenly, add monetary units to the system in order to manipulate the cost of capital as they see fit. </p><p>Saving in bitcoin may be a bumpy road for those who do not yet see the value, but in my eyes, it’s the safest thing that I own. As I sit to reflect during this tumultuous week in the bear market, I feel that I have never been more bullish than I am right now. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

Because I love her, I truly believe that the best gift I can give her is the orange pill.</p><p>It all started with a letter that I wrote for her explaining the gift I was about to give her. Then, I handed her a copy of <a href="https://academy.saifedean.com/thebitcoinstandard/">“The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous</a> and a hardware wallet. However, that was just the beginning of a long process that we had to go through together if I really wanted to orange pill her.</p><p>Of course, I was well aware that her first reaction to my surprise wasn't going to include the typical face of an 18-year-old girl opening her presents on a joyful Christmas morning. At first, she seemed more confused than excited. I have no doubt that she was expecting some nice pair of shoes or a cool gadget. I'm sorry sis, but <a href="https://twitter.com/ApeDurden/status/1607020525926383617?s=20&amp;t=sEUQ4iAByLBC1jLNXxGQ5A">that's how we maximalists roll</a>. </p><p>In the birthday/holiday letter, I pointed out three reasons why I was giving her this specific gift:</p><ol><li>I want to set her on <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/learning-about-bitcoin-is-financial-freedom">the path to financial freedom</a></li><li>I want her to be a sovereign woman in a fiat world where <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-fiat-impacts-relationships-family">dishonest relationships have been normalized</a></li><li>As a high school senior who doesn't know what she wants to study in college, she could benefit from Bitcoin which might give her some ideas for what she wants to do</li></ol><p>The long process of orange pilling my sister began with a quote from the prologue of “The Bitcoin Standard,”<em> </em>which I consider the perfect starting point. I asked her to read this quote over and over again before beginning the orange-pilling journey:</p><blockquote><p>“This book does not offer investment advice, but aims at helping elucidate the economic properties of the network and its operation, to provide readers an informed understanding of bitcoin before deciding whether they want to use it. Only with such an understanding, and only after extensive and thorough research into the practical operational aspects of owning and storing bitcoins, should anyone consider holding value in bitcoin. While bitcoin´s rise in market value may make it appear like a no-brainer as an investment, a closer look at the myriad hacks, attacks, scams, and security failures that have cost people their bitcoins provides a sobering warning to anyone who thinks that owning bitcoins provides a guaranteed profit. Should you come out of reading this book thinking that the bitcoin currency is something worth owning, your first investment should not be in buying bitcoins, but in time spent understanding how to buy, store, and own bitcoins securely. It is the inherent nature of bitcoin that such knowledge cannot be delegated or outsourced. There is no alternative to personal responsibility for anyone interested in using this network, and that is the real investment that needs to be made to get into bitcoin.”</p></blockquote><p>In the letter, I told her that I would help her set up the hardware wallet and I would send her a little bit of bitcoin. To begin, I sent her $10 worth of bitcoin. But then, to make sure that she invested time into acquiring the basic, necessary knowledge and to make her understand the proof-of-work philosophy, I promised that I would send her $100 worth of bitcoin for every chapter of the book that she read. Therefore, I prepared a quiz for each chapter to verify that she really read carefully. </p><p>However, as someone who is deep down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, I knew that making her read the book to stack sats on her hardware wallet wasn't enough. That was nothing, we were just getting started. So, what was next in the orange-pilling journey? Every time that I crossed by any opportunity, I tried to convert that moment into a little Bitcoin lesson. </p><p>For example, there was such an opportunity after my sister was assigned a project in her high school philosophy class. Knowing that I am a big fan of philosophy, she came to ask me for help. The project consisted of having a conversation with one of your family members but using the famous Socratic method for the conversation. If you don't know what that is, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic method</a> (named after Socrates) is “a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions.” </p><p>Obviously, we had a dialogue about Bitcoin and money using the Socratic method.</p><p>Another thing I did in this orange-pilling journey was to show her a rabbit hole inside of the Bitcoin rabbit hole: bitcoin mining and energy. I love bitcoin mining and the energy aspects of Bitcoin. In fact, I love it so much that we have an <a href="https://vienna.earth/plate/bitcoin_academy/Freedom%20Mining%20Journey">ASIC in our garage</a>. It wasn't really hard to make her grasp how passionate I am about home mining. Believe it or not, she had never even seen my ASIC (she had only heard the “brrrrrr”). Consequently, I took her to the garage and she got some hands-on experience. I also have my Bitcoin and Lightning nodes in the garage. That was a lot of fun because with tools like <a href="https://mempool.space/es/">Mempool.Space</a> and <a href="https://lnvisualizer.com/">LnVisualizer</a> I was able to help her see the tangible side of Bitcoin. This is when I really felt that it all began to come together.</p><p>As you all likely know, knowledge about Bitcoin can’t be delegated or outsourced. When it comes to Bitcoin, there is no alternative to personal responsibility. Although I’ve told her that I’d love to help her with anything, I can’t guide her down the rabbit hole forever. You have to go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole by yourself. I guided her for a long time but the moment for her to embark on the journey for herself is here. Like <a href="https://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/nothing-can-be-taught.#:~:text=Quotations%20from%20Oscar%20Wilde%3A,worth%20knowing%20can%20be%20taught.&amp;text=Be%20yourself.,Everyone%20else%20is%20already%20taken.">Oscar Wilde once said</a>: “Education is an admirable thing. But it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.”</p><p>So, I began treating her like any other Bitcoin pleb out there and let her go down the rabbit hole by herself. The only thing I did was to send her a bunch of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_vxwwh7Uo1iA5hMtViNOmmgGghrvvTkLs1dClUPAeo/edit">resources</a> (articles, podcasts, videos, books, etc.) and let her go her own way. At the same time, I realized that I could do this with other kids that are about the same age as my sister. Even better, I realized that my sister could help me with this and introduce her digital-native friends to Bitcoin because, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/onboard-people-to-bitcoin-individually">if you care about Bitcoin, you should onboard people individually</a>. </p><p>Accordingly, I’ve decided to turn our garage into a little <a href="https://vienna.earth/plate/bitcoin_academy/Bitcoin%20Academy">Bitcoin academy</a>. Although my sister was the guinea pig for this experiment (and, as I am writing, she is the only student that has attended Bitcoin academy), I have to give a big shout out to other Bitcoiners around the world who have shared educational content for anyone to use. For example, <a href="https://miprimerbitcoin.io/en/my-first-bitcoin/">Mi Primer Bitcoin</a> (from El Salvador) has an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/MyfirstBitcoin_/status/1570177846600941568?s=20&amp;t=ZK27s3FWsU6-CSEws0N1Dg">Bitcoin diploma workbook</a> that anyone can download for free. I have no doubt that initiatives like theirs or like <a href="https://www.escuelitabitcoin.org/">Escuelita Bitcoin</a> in Uruguay are what we need if we want a future with sovereign individuals. We need to <a href="https://twitter.com/satoshigallery/status/1586394173363478528?s=46&amp;t=C6iDyEgXVB6o_9Xc5mDNZQ">teach the young</a>. </p><p>Hopefully, this inspires other Bitcoiners around the world to introduce their younger siblings to Bitcoin. I was inspired by initiatives like the ones mentioned above and by stories like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/middle-schoolers-learn-bitcoin-lessons">Denver middle schoolers who became Bitcoin entrepreneurs</a>. With a little bit of luck, the next time I write an article for Bitcoin Magazine, it’ll be about Mexico City middle schoolers who became Bitcoin entrepreneurs. For now, stay humble and stack sats my friends. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Santiago Varela.

We analyze seven aspects of what might impact the bitcoin price in 2023.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>The below is an excerpt from a recent year-ahead report written by the Bitcoin Magazine PRO analysts. </em><a href="https://bmpro.bitcoinmagazine.com/"><em>Download the entire report here.</em></a></p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><hr><p>Bitcoin Magazine PRO sees incredibly strong fundamentals in the Bitcoin network and we are laser-focused on its market dynamic in the context of macroeconomic trends. Bitcoin aims to become the world reserve currency, an investment opportunity that cannot be understated.</p><p>In our <a href="https://bmpro.bitcoinmagazine.com/">year-ahead report</a>, we analyzed seven notable factors that we recommend investors pay attention to in the coming months.</p><h2>Convicted Bitcoin Investors</h2><p>We can put investor conviction into perspective by looking at the number of unique Bitcoin addresses holding at least 0.01, 0.1 and 1 bitcoin. This data shows that bitcoin adoption continues to grow with a growing number of unique addresses holding at least these amounts of bitcoin. While it is entirely possible for individual users to hold their bitcoin in multiple addresses, the growth of unique Bitcoin addresses holding at least 0.01, 0.1 and 1 bitcoin indicate that more users than ever before are buying bitcoin and holding it in self-custody.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MTQxNTUxMDYyNTI1NjY2/bitcoin-unique-addresses.png" height="372" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Unique bitcoin addresses continues to grow across the board.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Another promising metric is the amount held by long-term holders, which has increased to almost 14 million bitcoin. Long-term holder supply is calculated using a threshold of a 155-day holding period, after which dormant coins become increasingly unlikely to be spent. As of now, 72.49% of the bitcoin in circulation is not likely to be sold at these prices.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MTQxNTUwNzk0Mjg2Mjc5/bitcoin-annual-long-term-holder-supply.png" height="372" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Long-term holder supply reached 72.52% of the circulating bitcoin supply.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>There is a large subset of bitcoin investors who are accumulating the digital asset no matter the price. In a December 2022 interview on “<a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/the-real-reason-to-buy-bitcoin-in/comments">Going Digital</a>,” Head of Market Research Dylan LeClair said, “You have people all over the world that are acquiring this asset and you have a huge and growing cohort of people that are price-agnostic accumulators.” </p><p>With a growing number of unique addresses holding bitcoin and such a significant amount of bitcoin being held by long-term investors, we are optimistic for bitcoin’s advancement and rate of adoption. There are many variables that demonstrate the potential for asymmetric returns as demand for bitcoin increases and adoption increases worldwide.</p><h2>Total Addressable Market</h2><p>During monetization, a currency goes through three phases in order: store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. Bitcoin is currently in its store-of-value phase as demonstrated by the long-term holder metrics above. Other assets that are frequently used as stores of value are real estate, gold and equities. Bitcoin is a better store of value for many reasons: it is more liquid, easier to access, transport and secure, easier to audit and more finitely scarce than any other asset with its hard-cap limit of 21 million coins. For bitcoin to acquire a larger share of other global stores of value, these properties need to remain intact and prove themselves in the eyes of investors.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Estimations of global stores of wealth.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>As readers can see, bitcoin is a tiny fraction of global wealth. Should bitcoin take even a 1% share from these other stores of value, the market cap would be $5.9 trillion, putting bitcoin at over $300,000 per coin. These are conservative numbers from our viewpoint because we estimate that bitcoin adoption will happen gradually, and then suddenly.</p><h2>Transfer Volume</h2><p>When looking at the amount of value that was cleared on the Bitcoin network throughout its history, there is a clear upward trend in USD terms with a heightened demand for transferring bitcoin this year. In 2022, there was a change-adjusted transfer volume of over 556 million bitcoin settled on the Bitcoin network, up 102% from 2021. In USD terms, the Bitcoin network settled just shy of $15 trillion in value in 2022.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MTQxNTUxMDYyNjU2MTk5/bitcoin-total-transfer-volume.png" height="372" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Bitcoin transfer volume was higher than ever in USD terms.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Bitcoin’s censorship resistance is an extremely valuable feature as the world enters into a period of deglobalization. With a market capitalization of only $324 billion, we believe bitcoin is severely undervalued. Despite the drop in price, the Bitcoin network transferred more value in USD terms than ever before.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTg4OTY2NzE1NzcyNjQyNjc1/bitcoin-magazine-pro-banner.jpg" height="155" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h2>Rare Opportunity In Bitcoin’s Price</h2><p>By looking at certain metrics, we can analyze the unique opportunity investors have to purchase bitcoin at these prices. The bitcoin realized market cap is down 18.8% from all-time highs, which is the second-largest drawdown in its history. While the macroeconomic factors are something to keep in mind, we believe that this is a rare buying opportunity.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MTQxNTUxMDYyNTI1MTI3/bitcoin-realized-cap-drawdown.png" height="372" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>The realized cap drawdown in 2022 was the second largest in bitcoin's history.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Relative to its history, bitcoin is at the phase of the cycle where it’s about as cheap as it gets. Its current market exchange rate is approximately 20% lower than its average cost basis on-chain, which has only happened at or near the local bottom of bitcoin market cycles. </p><p>Current prices of bitcoin are in rare territory for investors looking to get in at a low exchange rate. Historically, purchasing bitcoin during these times has brought tremendous returns in the long term. With that said, readers should consider the reality that 2023 likely brings about bitcoin’s first experience with a prolonged economic recession.</p><h2>Macroeconomic Environment</h2><p>As we move into 2023, it’s necessary to recognize the state of the geopolitical landscape because macro is the driving force behind economic growth. People around the world are experiencing a monetary policy lag effect from last year’s central bank decisions. The U.S. and EU are in recessionary territory, China is proceeding to de-dollarize and the Bank of Japan raised its target rate for yield curve control. All of these have a large influence on capital markets. </p><p>Nothing in financial markets occurs in a vacuum. Bitcoin’s ascent through 2020 and 2021 — while similar to previous crypto-native market cycles — was very much tied to the explosion of liquidity sloshing around the financial system after COVID. While 2020 and 2021 was characterized by the insertion of additional liquidity, 2022 has been characterized by the removal of liquidity.</p><p>Interestingly enough, when denominating bitcoin against U.S. Treasury bonds (which we believe to be bitcoin’s largest theoretical competitor for monetary value over the long term), comparing the drawdown during 2022 was rather benign compared to drawdowns in bitcoin’s history.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MTQxNTUwNzk0MjIwNzQz/bitcoin-denominated-in-long-dated-treasury-bonds.png" height="473" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>As we wrote in “<a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/the-everything-bubble-markets-at">The Everything Bubble: Markets At A Crossroads</a>,” “Despite the recent bounce in stocks and bonds, we aren’t convinced that we have seen the worst of the deflationary pressures from the global liquidity cycle.”</p><p>In “<a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/bank-of-japan-raises-cap-on-yield-curve-control">The Bank of Japan Blinks And Markets Tremble</a>,” we noted, “As we continue to refer to the sovereign debt bubble, readers should understand what this dramatic upward repricing in global yields means for asset prices. As bond yields remain at elevated levels far above recent years, asset valuations based on discounted cash flows fall.” Bitcoin does not rely on cash flows, but it will certainly be impacted by this repricing of global yields. We believe we are currently at the third bullet point of the following playing out:</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bitcoin Mining And Infrastructure</h2><p>While the multitude of negative industry and worrying macroeconomic factors have had a major dampening on bitcoin’s price, looking at the metrics of the Bitcoin network itself tell another story. The hash rate and mining difficulty gives a glimpse into how many ASICs are dedicating hashing power to the network and how competitive it is to mine bitcoin. These numbers move in tandem and both have almost exclusively gone up in 2022, despite the significant drop in price.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MTQxNTUwNzk0MzUxODE1/bitcoin-mining-difficulty.png" height="558" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Bitcoin mining difficulty continues to rise.</figcaption>
    </figure><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MTQxNTUwNzk0NDE3MzUx/bitcoin-mean-hash-rate.png" height="558" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Bitcoin hash rate continues to rise.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>By deploying more machines and investing in expanded infrastructure, bitcoin miners demonstrate that they are more bullish than ever. The last time the bitcoin price was in a similar range in 2017, the network hash rate was one-fifth of current levels. This means that there has been a fivefold increase in bitcoin mining machines being plugged in and efficiency upgrades to the machines themselves, not to mention the major investments in facilities and data centers to house the equipment.</p><p>Because the hash rate increased while the bitcoin price decreased, miner revenue took a beating this year after a euphoric rise in 2021. Public miner stock valuations followed the same path with valuations falling even more than the bitcoin price, all while the Bitcoin network’s hash rate continued to rise. In the “<a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/state-of-the-mining-industry-survival">State Of The Mining Industry: Survival Of The Fittest</a>,” we looked at the total market capitalization of public miners which fell by over 90% since January 2021.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The market cap of all public mining equities has dropped by 9</figcaption>
    </figure><p>We expect more of these companies to face challenging conditions because of the skyrocketing global energy prices and interest rates mentioned above.</p><h2>Increasing Scarcity</h2><p>One way to analyze bitcoin’s scarcity is by looking at the illiquid supply of coins. Liquidity is quantified as the extent to which an entity spends their bitcoin. Someone that never sells has a liquidity value of 0 whereas someone who buys and sells bitcoin all the time has a value of 1. With this quantification, circulating supply can be broken down into three categories: highly liquid, liquid and illiquid supply.</p><p>Illiquid supply is defined as entities that hold over 75% of the bitcoin they deposit to an address. Highly liquid supply is defined as entities that hold less than 25%. Liquid supply is between the two. This <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-liquid-supply/">illiquid supply quantification and analysis</a> was developed by Rafael Schultze-Kraft, co-founder and CTO of Glassnode.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MTQxNTUxMDYyNjU2NzM4/illiquid-bitcoin-supply.png" height="372" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Bitcoin's illiquid supply continues to grow.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>2022 was the year of getting bitcoin off exchanges. Every recent major panic became a catalyst for more individuals and institutions to move coins into their own custody, find custody solutions outside of exchanges or sell off their bitcoin entirely. When centralized institutions and counterparty risks are flashing red, people rush for the exit. We can see some of this behavior through bitcoin outflows from exchanges.</p><p>In 2022, 572,118 bitcoin worth $9.6 billion left exchanges, marking it the largest annual outflow of bitcoin in BTC terms in history. In USD terms, it was second only to 2020, which was driven by the March 2020 COVID crash. 11.68% of bitcoin supply is now estimated to be on exchanges, down from 16.88% back in 2019.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MTQxNTUwNzk0MDg5Njcx/bitcoin-annual-exchange-flows.png" height="372" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Exchanges saw a massive decrease in the bitcoin balances on their platforms.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin balance on exchanges decreased in 2022.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>These metrics of an increasingly illiquid supply paired with historic amounts of bitcoin being withdrawn from exchanges — ostensibly being removed from the market — paint a different picture than what we’re seeing with the factors outside of the Bitcoin network’s purview. While there are unanswered questions from a macroeconomic perspective, bitcoin miners continue to invest in equipment and on-chain data shows that bitcoin holders aren’t planning to relinquish their bitcoin anytime soon.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The varying factors detailed above give a picture for why we are long-term bullish on the bitcoin price going into 2023. The Bitcoin network continues to add another block approximately every 10 minutes, more miners keep investing in infrastructure by plugging in machines and long-term holders are unwavering in their conviction, as shown by on-chain data. </p><p>With bitcoin’s ever-increasing scarcity, the supply side of this equation is fixed, while demand is likely to increase. Bitcoin investors can get ahead of the demand curve by averaging in while the price is low. It’s important for investors to take the time to learn how Bitcoin works to fully understand what it is they are investing in. Bitcoin is the first digitally native and finitely scarce bearer asset. We recommend readers learn about self-custody and withdraw their bitcoin from exchanges. Despite the negative news cycle and drop in bitcoin price, our bullish conviction for bitcoin’s long-term value proposition remains unfazed.</p><hr><p><em><a href="https://bmpro.bitcoinmagazine.com/">For the full report, follow this link to subscribe to Bitcoin Magazine PRO.</a></em></p><figure>

attacks.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Virunga National Park, located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is Africa’s oldest protected space and a testament to the biodiversity and natural beauty of the continent. But the park has faced increasing pressure from local militia groups that have waged violent attacks on its animals and employees, all while various problems, including COVID-19, led to an extended closure of the park to tourists, which it claims represents approximately 40% of its revenue. <br></p><p>A <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/13/1066820/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-mining-congo-virunga-national-park/">report in the MIT Technology Review</a> describes how park director Emmanuel de Merode has turned to bitcoin mining to monetize the park’s abundant natural resources that are otherwise stranded in order to preserve the park’s existence. <br><br>De Merode met with Sébastien Gouspillou, owner of Big Block Green Services, which advised El Salvador on its “Bitcoin City.” Gouspillou described how “[They] used to do mining by buying electricity — it wasn’t efficient. The money maybe goes to oligarchs in Kazakhstan. In Virunga, we see it’s saving the park.”<br></p><p>Gouspillou aided de Merode in setting up the first portions of the operation in 2020, which began mining in September of that year. The site then hired nine full-time workers to staff the facility, who work in rotating shifts within the jungle to operate the miners. It is powered by three hydro plants within the park, a sustainable source of electricity that was already being used to power nearby towns.</p><p>“Today there are 10 containers powered directly by the plant’s four-meter turbines. Each container holds 250 to 500 rigs,” describes the report. Virunga owns three of these 10 containers, while Gouspillou owns the remaining seven. Their arrangement allows him to purchase energy from Virunga, while keeping the bitcoin mined.</p><p>Michael Saylor commented on the project, saying that Bitcoin is “the ideal high-tech industry to put in a nation that has plenty of clean energy but isn’t able to export a product or produce a service with that energy.”</p><p>De Merode described how, despite recent market downturns, he still retains confidence that the project will be successful, saying, “We’re not speculating on its value; we’re generating it. If you buy Bitcoin and it decreases, you lose money. We’re making Bitcoin out of surplus energy and monetizing something that otherwise has no value. That’s a big difference.” </p><p>He also addressed custody of the bitcoin in response to a question about what would happen if he was attacked, an ever-present threat in the jungle. “If I crashed? The digital wallet is managed by our finance team … It’s unlikely we sit on Bitcoin for more than a few weeks anyway, because we need the money to run the park. So if something happened to me or our CFO lost the password, we’d give him a hard time — but it wouldn’t cost us much.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDg4MTA1ODc5ODA3NDkz/africa-bitcoin-technology.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Establishing The Architectural Styles Of Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[Our enduring buildings give stature to our best work, and the architectural style of Bitcoin institutions should reflect its high ideals.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/finding-architectural-style-for-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/finding-architectural-style-for-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Art]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[architecture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin City]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Frances Hogan Steffian]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3NzYwODQ3MDc5MDYz/international-bitcoiners-pitch-in-on-notre-dame-restoration-effort.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Our enduring buildings give stature to our best work, and the architectural style of Bitcoin institutions should reflect its high ideals.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Frances Hogan Steffian, a writer, bitcoin investor and wife of an award-winning architect.</em></p><p>What should be the architectural styles of Bitcoin? In the history of our world, our enduring buildings give stature to our best ideas and enshrine our core beliefs. If Bitcoin realizes its potential to remake the world’s financial system, and as Bitcoin communities spring up around the globe, how should our ideas and ideals about Bitcoin be expressed in these newly-built environments? </p><h2>The Power Of Architecture</h2><p>Do not underestimate the power of architecture. It lives through the ages. It always conveys the worldview of those who built it, whether it is an individual architect or a cultural project built over time. The physical act of walking through a building imprints each visitor with a visceral experience of the ideas that the builders and architect intended. </p><p>Medieval fortresses, for instance, tell the story of the people that they housed and protected. They don’t usually have one single architect or builder, but these structures evolved over time, and so their message can be less controlled and more honest. These ancient fortresses convey our best and worst ideas of security, family, enforcement, control, materialism and triumph over the physical world. </p><p>And what do our best buildings express? Most often, it is the human desire to transcend our daily physical limitations and live on another level of beauty, freedom and connection to the divine. The classically-ordered interior of Rome’s Pantheon is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome">centered by an oculus open to the sky</a>, which is a constant reminder of the vastness of existence, far beyond human understanding. In India, the sublime Taj Mahal can provide the experience of being in a higher dimension that is grounded on a physical foundation. We can walk in heaven now. This is similar to the better reality that the most hopeful Bitcoiners dream about. </p><h2>Expressing Bitcoin’s Ideals In The Built Environment</h2><p>North Korean defector Yeonmi Park <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/yeonmi-park-bitcoin-is-freedom">electrified the Bitcoin 2022 conference</a> with her talk about how private, secure financial independence is critical in the fight against human exploitation. The link to her talk went viral, <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1512179528663187456?s=20&amp;t=ON_V2DhiaQ2XWc0YvHCs3A">even being tweeted by Jack Dorsey</a>. Her personal triumphs over human trafficking demonstrate the greatest hope for Bitcoiners: to break the chains of financial slavery that shackle our planet. Bitcoiners also long for personal wealth that is private and secure. If there is global adoption of Bitcoin, the potential value truly could go to the moon. </p><p>As such, now is the time to think about the messages that the architectural style of Bitcoin will convey and how we want to express these ideas in our built environment. As discussed above, the global community could start with such concepts such as freedom, empowerment, stability, privacy and elegance. </p><p>Yet the architectural style of Bitcoin should not be founded in nor geared to only one earthly civilization. The point of Bitcoin is that it both liberates and unites the world. This means that the architectural style of Bitcoin that is expressed in Asia will differ from the style conveyed in Central America, for instance. Different stories and cultural experiences will be built.</p><p>Now, in this time in the world, Bitcoin communities are emerging all over the globe. The most <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-one-small-step-for-bitcoin">well known are in Central America</a>, yet more constantly emerge all over the globe.</p><p>In El Salvador, there is the built Bitcoin community in El Zonte and an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-59368483">extraordinary city planned for the base of the inactive Conchagua volcano</a>. There is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/guatemala-town-mining-bitcoin-with-used-oil">Lago Bitcoin in Guatemala</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-beach-spawns-offshoot">Bitcoin Jungle in Costa Rica</a>. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ekasi-township-one-year-later">Bitcoin Ekasi</a> has arisen in a South African township, as well as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/2022s-bitcoin-adoption-in-africa">other communities in Africa</a>. Likewise, Bitcoin communities in places all over the world, including <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/thailands-crypto-islands-working-paradise-part-1/">Thailand</a>, are participating in the <a href="https://www.globalbitcoinfest.com/">Global Bitcoin Fest</a>. </p><p>The architectural styles should convey beauty and a desire to live beautifully. This is actually a very practical point. Civilizations tend not to bother to maintain their ugly buildings. Again, we want our visions to have permanence. </p><p>Existing Bitcoin communities already express a sensitivity to their ecological environment. A vision of peace and harmony has already emerged in the eco-friendly designs in proposed new developments, in particular at El Zonte in El Salvador. But do they also express beauty and self confidence? </p><p>Importantly, Bitcoin is decentralized. Everyone who participates in the Bitcoin economy uses Bitcoin in the same capacity as everyone else. It has been called “egalitarian” and “grassroots.” The efforts of some famous modern architects come to mind in their attempts to embody similar ideas in physical form: Le Corbusier, Mies van de Rohe and Walter Gropious, to name a few. These architects are famous for creating spaces that are equally accessible and not elitist. They used everyday material that everyone can access, and their designs focused on elevating everyday life. They created spacial experiences, not ornamented displays of architectural expense. The intention of the modern architects was to employ mundane material to create an extraordinary, uplifting experience that anyone can enjoy. </p><p>What should the Bitcoin architectural styles <em>not</em> be? Let’s start with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccles_Building">Federal Reserve building in Washington, D.C.</a> The building’s giant scale can make visitors feel insignificant. The narrow windows and minimal detail are not welcoming and convey a sense of impenetrability. While the Fed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccles_Building">describes its building’s style as “stripped classicism,”</a> this building that was completed in 1937, exhibits many of the traits of fascist architecture. </p><p>Nearby, Washington D.C.’s outdoor common area known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mall">National Mall</a> was designed to impress upon the visitor the grandeur and size of the American aapital. Intentionally or not, the vast mall swallows up most crowds of people, and conveys the idea that, no matter how big the mass of the crowd, the institution of government will still dwarf the people. The vast scale could make one feel secure in its feeling of unchangeability or, conversely, leave a visitor feeling helpless.</p><p>We also need to be very aware of all possible interpretations of Bitcoin's architectural styles. For example, a Bitcoin cynic may joke that the dangerous volatility of bitcoin was perfectly expressed as a city built on a volcano. To counter that sentiment, now is the time to demonstrate the efficiency, stability, endurance, beauty and serenity of harnessing the geothermal power of an inactive volcano. </p><p>The 20th century saw the ripping apart of local culture all around the planet. We must pick up these frayed edges and connect them into our future. We must reclaim even our smallest achievements. We must be extremely idealistic as we envision the built environment where we want to live in the future. Through Bitcoin’s architectural styles we have the opportunity to reclaim the best of human endeavors and build a carefully considered vision of our future. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Frances Hogan Steffian.

    </figure><p>Although it feels like a lifetime ago, only two months have passed since Genesis announced their need for a $1 billion liquidity injection in the aftermath of the FTX and Alameda fallout. As weeks dragged on without a resolution, details of the story have become more public, building up to fraud allegations against Digital Currency Group (DCG) that were announced by Gemini co-founder and president, Cameron Winklevoss. Gemini is still trying to recover $900 million in assets from Genesis that were used to generate yield for their Earn customers. </p><p>Left unresolved and only growing larger, DCG and Genesis problems weigh heavily on the bitcoin market as there are many answers needed and various possible outcomes that have yet to play out. </p><p>The biggest question of all is what will happen to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and how these issues will potentially impact the bitcoin price. GBTC has been the preferred vehicle for many to obtain regulated bitcoin exposure and it has also been a breeding ground for speculative arbitrage strategies throughout the previous swings going from a premium to a discount to net asset value (NAV). An approved bitcoin spot ETF in the United States would have likely solved these issues, but we’re still far from that happening. </p><p>It’s easiest to start with the GBTC shares on DCG’s balance sheet which are estimated to be around <a href="https://twitter.com/intangiblecoins/status/1611547972684206081?s=20&amp;t=Ljz4E5bVXgIQHjIuufnILg">9.67%</a> of the entire supply. In the event that DCG needs to raise cash or goes down the path of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, selling these shares is potentially an option. Selling into an already illiquid market puts more pressure on the historically low GBTC discount. DCG holds approximately 67 million shares in a market that trades less than 4 million shares a day. However, a more important factor is that by law, DCG can <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1595545242526261248/photo/1">sell no more than 1% of shares outstanding</a> every quarter. It would take them around 2.5 years of constant selling to sell their entire stake. </p><p>Another path — the most likely one — is that the GBTC, along with Grayscale’s other trusts, find their way into the hands of a new sponsor and manager. <a href="https://valkyrieinvest.com/press/opportunities-around-gbtc/">Valkyrie has already proposed</a> to do exactly this:</p><ul><li>Give an option for investors to redeem shares at NAV through a Regulation M filing request (although it’s not clear a Regulation M request would get approved by the SEC). </li><li>Lower fees from 200 basis points to 75.</li><li>Attempt to offer investors redemptions in both cash and spot bitcoin.</li></ul><p>The option for a new manager gives investors an opportunity to get out of investments at NAV.</p><p>The GBTC product is still a cash cow for Grayscale and DCG, raking in 2% management fees — in perpetuity. Across all major trust products, Grayscale is collecting over $300 million this year from management fees alone. Rather than liquidate the entire trust in the worst case scenario, there will be many willing buyers to take on management of the vehicle without a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF available in the market. </p><p>However, liquidation is not a non-zero possibility. In the event of a Grayscale insolvency or bankruptcy, <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1595539503103741952?s=20&amp;t=nPSmdNJgFYCmXEnUnH5hYg">voluntarily liquidation could be pursued</a> unless 50% of shares vote to transfer to a new sponsor. There is upside to DCG liquidating the trust as there’s money to be made from their shares closing to NAV, but that likely results in selling bitcoin on the open market. No one wants to see 632,000 bitcoin — approximately 3.3% of current supply — become selling pressure in the market. In the unlikely scenario where complete liquidation of the trust is undertaken with USD cash being returned to shareholders, one could presume that much of the selling would be absorbed through OTC deals with interested investors. At this point, this is purely hypothetical. </p><p>New information is coming to light that has the potential to change the superstructure in regard to the dynamic between Grayscale and the shareholders of Grayscale products. We will continue to write about developments in the coming weeks.</p><hr><p><em>Like this content? </em><a href="https://bm.b.tc/3Wlped5"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

Hydroelectric power is a clean and renewable energy source that is more reliable and cost-effective than other sources, and will help reduce the carbon footprint of the mining operation. Brothers Eduardo Kopper and Roberto Kopper, who are the current owners, will retain the other 20% ownership and will continue to host the bitcoin mining operation. </p><p>“The Toro Dam is located approximately 25 miles from San Jose between two volcano craters,” states the release. “The site generates all its energy from green resources with a proven 98% run time over the years, and has a full-time staff in place under a new Operating &amp; Maintenance Agreement.”</p><p>The move is an example of firms originally outside of Bitcoin mining entering the industry <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/best-time-for-bitcoin-mining-opportunities">amidst a time of opportunity</a>. With the price of Bitcoin ASICs being so far down, and many mining firms readjusting their strategy, well-capitalized businesses could see a major return on investment given the right decisions. Essential to these returns is low-cost energy, of which this project takes advantage. </p><p>“All of our mining sites under development should generate immediate net cash flow to the company during a period when the bitcoin mining sector is down along with the overall capital markets,” said Gary C. Evans, Chairman and CEO of Evergreen Sustainable Enterprises. “Current mining site locations in development exceed six and include Arkansas, Kentucky, and Costa Rica.”<br><br>Eduardo Kopper, commenting on this new arrangement, stated that, “We are anxious to install 300 brand new bitcoin mining machines over the next few months at the Toro location.” Acknowledging the incredible opportunity at hand, he continued, “When the price of Bitcoin starts its upward trajectory, we will be extremely well positioned."<br></p><p>The original Generation Hemp Inc. firm will become a subsidiary of Evergreen, and it will retain its original operations and staff.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3Nzc1NDUz/green-sustainable-bitcoin-mining.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung Asset Management To Launch Bitcoin ETF In Hong Kong: Report]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF will launch on Jan. 13, giving Hong Kong investors a mainstream avenue for indirect BTC price exposure.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/samsung-launches-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/samsung-launches-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong</guid><category><![CDATA[Hong Kong]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin futures]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin ETF]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Samsung]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Namcios]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 18:23:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODUzMTg2MDU3ODc5/samsung-adds-bitcoin-to-smartphone-wallet-app.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF will launch on Jan. 13, giving Hong Kong investors a mainstream avenue for indirect BTC price exposure.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Samsung Asset Management is launching a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Hong Kong.</p><p>The Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF (3135:HK) seeks to obtain a performance similar to spot BTC by investing in bitcoin futures products listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), according to a report by Fortune Korea. Cointelegraph also reported the news earlier on Thursday.</p><p>"Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF is a competitive product that reflects Samsung Asset Management's long-term futures-based ETF know-how and risk management experience," said Park Seong-jin, head of Samsung Asset Management's Hong Kong branch, per a translated version of the <a href="http://www.fortunekorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=25798">Fortune Korea</a> report. "It is a new option for investors who are highly interested in Bitcoin."</p><p>The latest crypto market rout hasn’t deterred Hong Kong from seeking to become a major hub for the industry. Its financial secretary, Paul Chan, <a href="https://time.com/6245551/hong-kong-crypto-hub/">recently reiterated that commitment</a>, adding that Hong Kong will work to attract new businesses from all over the world. The city’s first BTC-linked ETF, the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amid-crypto-turmoil-hong-kong-debuts-first-crypto-futures-etfs-2022-12-15/">went live last month</a>.</p><p>An ETF offering for an investment represents a significant mainstream adoption milestone. Freed from the complexity behind the asset itself, institutional and retail investors can enjoy price exposure through a simple, regulated avenue. As such, Samsung’s offering in Hong Kong promises to further expand awareness about bitcoin and access to bitcoin exposure in the region.</p><p>But that doesn't come without intrinsic drawbacks. Although investors can get exposure to fiat price fluctuations of the underlying asset through an ETF, they won’t possess that product itself, being that gold or BTC. And that is a subtle but very important difference, especially for bitcoin.

The Bitcoin 2023 conference will be our next chance to do so.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Brandon Green, the chief of staff for BTC Inc and an organizer of the Bitcoin 2023 conference. Bitcoin 2023 and Bitcoin Magazine are both operated by BTC Inc.</em></p><p>If you’re reading this, congratulations, you’ve now experienced a true bitcoin bear market. Yes, the winter is cold, and no it may not warm up for a little while, but it is in these moments, when the freezing air fills your lungs and the ringing in your ears from the noise of the past two years starts to fade, that the entire mission comes back into focus and the signal starts to shine a path in front of you again.</p><p>It is a winter wonderland indeed. And while, somehow, it continues to surprise everyone that winter follows summer, let us not forget that spring is sure to come, too, and it’s best to start preparing for it properly.</p><p>We’ve experienced quite a few of these seasons at Bitcoin Magazine, and it seems like after each cycle, we get a little closer to figuring out how hyperbitcoinization will truly progress, and what we need to do as a community and industry in order to help get us there. Unfortunately, the mechanism by which we figure this out tends to be via pain and harsh lessons.</p><p>In 2013 to 2014, we learned “not your keys, not your coins” as the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/mt-gox-bitcoin-hack-teaches-us-today">largest exchange in all of Bitcoin</a> (by far) collapsed. In 2017 to 2018, we learned how governance should work in a system without defined governance via bitter fork wars. Now, in 2021 to 2023, we’re learning how the introduction of credit and debt cycles affect and distort markets, as well as the various attack vectors introduced by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-dangers-of-paper-bitcoin">paper bitcoin</a> and IOUs, especially in a system with near-instant settlement.</p><p>Indeed, Bitcoin is taking us through a speedy crash course on the past 2,000-plus years of financial innovation. Anyone following Bitcoin’s trajectory closely can rightly consider him or herself an expert in monetary theory, among other things.</p><p>However, it is not enough to merely learn these lessons.</p><p>In the cold of winter, we do not hibernate; we build. It’s time to take these lessons from the past decade and apply them to the future of the global financial system. Many of the companies and projects helping us do that are already here, fine tuning their offerings and building a robust infrastructure for us to utilize. Many more have not even been imagined yet.</p><p>Bitcoin 2019 was founded four years ago, in the heart of the 2018 bear market on the heels of the bitter civil war. The goal was to “<a href="https://medium.com/@BitcoinMagazine/make-bitcoin-fun-again-47c6837788c3">Make Bitcoin Fun Again</a>”, heal wounds and help craft a path forward for this industry.</p><p>The industry surrounding Bitcoin grew tremendously over the proceeding four years, and our conference was designed to be an enabling force in that growth. Many of today’s Bitcoin-focused companies were founded at our events. Startups were pitched and funded. Companies met with and hired key employees. Business partnerships were forged in our meeting rooms. Products and services (and more!) were announced on our stages. You’d be hard pressed to find a company in our space that didn’t change the trajectory of their business by attending or sponsoring our conference.</p><p>In 2019, the community was divided and Bitcoin hadn’t properly been prioritized in the broader discourse. In 2023, the community is stronger than ever, but the industry surrounding Bitcoin has gotten absolutely rekt. The graveyard of companies that became overextended, overleveraged or outright fraudulent is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">huge</a>. There are massive gaps in the products and services those companies created, and massive opportunities to build new products and services with the core tenets of Bitcoin as the focus. We have a unique opportunity to reimagine what a financial system with Bitcoin at its center looks like, and the Bitcoin 2023 conference will be our first chance to come together as a community and do just that.</p><p><a href="https://b.tc/conference">Bitcoin 2023</a> is coming on May 18, 2023. The companies and builders who attend have a chance to be the leaders who shape the future of our industry for years to come. The ideas generated among attendees and speakers can be the underpinnings of the next growth phase of the industry. We will build back with Bitcoin at the core of every product and service on the market. And we will prove to the world that an idea whose time has come cannot be stopped.</p><p>This next epoch will perhaps be the most pivotal to Bitcoin’s success. Bitcoin’s “prove it” moment is upon us, and the whole world is watching. The future of Bitcoin awaits.</p><p>Don’t sit on the sidelines. Enter into the arena.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzODM5Njc4ODI5NDM4NDQ4/bitcoin-cold-winter-ice.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dispatch From Guatemala's Bitcoin Lake, A Bitcoin Community Built On Grassroots Adoption]]></title><description><![CDATA[Just a few hundred miles from El Salvador, Guatemala’s Bitcoin Lake contrasts state-led Bitcoin adoption with a promising grassroots model.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dispatch-from-guatemala-bitcoin-lake</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dispatch-from-guatemala-bitcoin-lake</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Lake]]></category><category><![CDATA[Merchants]]></category><category><![CDATA[Guatemala]]></category><category><![CDATA[Adoption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rikki]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 15:55:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDE3MDQwMjc3MTIwNjg5/bitcoin-tree.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Just a few hundred miles from El Salvador, Guatemala’s Bitcoin Lake contrasts state-led Bitcoin adoption with a promising grassroots model.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Rikki, author and co-host of the “Bitcoin Italia,” and “Stupefatti” podcasts. He is one half of the Bitcoin Explorers, along with </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Lorinaura"><em>Laura</em></a><em>, who chronicle Bitcoin adoption around the world, one country at a time.</em></p><p>Laura and I <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/revisiting-el-salvador-bitcoin-year-later">continue</a> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/lessons-from-adoption-bitcoin-el-salvador">our</a> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-slums-need-bitcoin">adventures</a> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/ups-and-downs-of-bitcoin-in-el-salvador">in Central America</a> with the aim of gaining an in-depth understanding of the peculiar characteristics of Bitcoin adoption in the very different countries there and reporting it without bias on our YouTube channel, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bitcoinexplorers">Bitcoin Explorers</a>.”</p><p>The great curiosity that grips us after spending more than a month in El Salvador, and leaving it behind, is to try to understand what people think about Bitcoin in countries where there has been no government propaganda, no media coverage and no lousy state app like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-fixing-chivo-bitcoin-wallet">Chivo wallet</a> to complicate things. Countries where, therefore, adoption is not happening by decree, but solely through the free initiatives of citizens and through the work of private companies that believe in Bitcoin and build products and services on top of its protocol.</p><p>But the question we would like to try to answer is not the simplest one: Is bottom-up Bitcoin adoption better than the top-down adoption theorized by El Salvador President Nayib Bukele?</p><h2>Exploring Grassroots Bitcoin Adoption In Guatemala</h2><p>To find the answer, our latest destination was Guatemala, a country that is, in some ways, very similar to El Salvador. <a href="https://borgenproject.org/exploring-poverty-rate-in-guatemala/">As of 2017</a>, there were 16.5 million inhabitants there, nearly 60% of whom lived below the poverty line, likely unbanked or underbanked, and 23% lived in extreme poverty. At that point, 0.001% of Guatamalans held more than half of the country's wealth. These are ideal conditions for Bitcoin's intrinsic features to be appreciated.</p><p>Unlike El Salvador, however, Guatemalan government policy is not favorable to cryptocurrencies, in fact, it is quite the contrary. Significant laws and regulations have been passed in an attempt to <a href="https://en.centralamericadata.com/en/article/home/Cryptocurrencies_are_Illegal_in_Guatemala">harness the phenomenon and control it</a>.</p><p>Nonetheless, around Lake Atitlán, one of the country's <a href="https://www.adventurouskate.com/the-towns-of-lake-atitlan-guatemala/">hottest tourist destinations</a>, a small group of pioneers has been <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/guatemala-town-mining-bitcoin-with-used-oil">organizing an alternative economy experiment in Bitcoin for about a year</a>, along the lines of what has already been done in El Zonte by Bitcoin Beach. The name chosen for this experiment is Bitcoin Lake and this was our chosen destination.</p><p>We spent about ten days on the shores of the lake and what we documented surprised us in a positive way, beyond our wildest expectations.</p><p>We found ourselves in a place of rare beauty. A large body of water surrounded by volcanoes and impenetrable jungle — tropical nature in its purest expression.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>On the banks of Atitlán rise several local settlements, some larger towns, such as Panajachel, where there really is everything one could want in order to spend a few weeks of leisure and rest, and other smaller villages, for example San Marcos, totally immersed in nature and definitely more suitable for those who want to relax, meditate or hike. These are very different locations that thus manage to meet the needs of all kinds of tourists. And indeed, the lake thrives on tourism. It is striking how many hotels, bars, restaurants and activities are offered to those who choose to spend their vacations here. </p><p>There is one thing, however, that unites every activity around here: cash. Even in Guatemala, access to electronic payment instruments is very limited and <a href="https://asocialnomad.com/guatemala/atms-in-guatemala/#:~:text=In%20most%20countries%2C%20there%20will,Guatemala%2C%20it's%20around%208%25.">credit card fees are exorbitant</a>. Any tourist would soon realize this, because as they travel here they will see that the few businesses that accept credit cards charge 5% or 10% more on your bill if you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard. This is another ideal condition in Guatemala, then, to build an alternative economy with Bitcoin. </p><p>And this is an opportunity that some local companies are understandably seizing. In addition to the plethora of open-source bitcoin wallets available, there are applications such as Osmo, which, in addition to allowing people to receive and send bitcoin, allows them to instantly convert them into quetzales, the local currency, or even U.S. dollars. There are local payment services such as IBEX that offer merchants a state-of-the-art implementation of the Lightning Network, ideal for larger businesses that also have reporting requirements. These services, thanks to the Bitcoin protocol, really do brilliantly replace a bank account or point-of-sale (PoS) provider. This is perhaps why there is so much enthusiasm on the lake for this technological innovation, and why adoption is growing so strongly. When you consider that the Bitcoin Lake experiment began not even a year ago, it is impressive how many businesses and merchants are already accepting bitcoin: a system that is faster, safer and cheaper than credit cards.</p><h2>What Is It Like To Live On Bitcoin In Bitcoin Lake?</h2><p>But what is it like, then, to live on bitcoin in Bitcoin Lake?</p><p>Super fun!</p><p>There are so many options available to Bitcoin travelers. We ate lunch and dinner at grassroots restaurants, had breakfast tasting the excellent local coffee, danced late into the night drinking great cocktails, even flew paragliders over the lake, rented a boat and took a tuc-tuc: all while paying in bitcoin. There are dozens and dozens of businesses that already accept them, and one is honestly spoiled for choice.</p><section><figure>

Atitlán is a much larger and more organized resort, so the supply in bitcoin will be greater considering such a wider reach for adoption. El Zonte, outside of the ocean and the surf, has little to offer and is a very small village, where at 8:00 at night you struggle to find an open restaurant. But Panajachel, for example, is a resort that manages to entertain well into the night. Here, you can happily come on vacation with your wife or pre-coiner friends while enjoying a wonderful Bitcoin holiday without the fear that they might get bored. </p><p>But how do merchants react when, upon entering their store, you ask if you can pay in bitcoin?</p><p>We were also very impressed by their reactions! They often gave us toothy smiles and said “yes” with a pride and enthusiasm not often encountered with most merchants in El Salvador. When it was time to pay a bill, they took their tablets or smartphones with incredible confidence, opened their wallets and, with four taps, showed us the correct QR codes — amazing awareness and knowledge of the technological tool.</p><section><figure>

    </figure><div><em>View the 2 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dispatch-from-guatemala-bitcoin-lake">original article</a></em></div></section><p>Needless to say, of course, this was not always the case. There were also those who panicked, those who answered us that, right now they could not accept our transactions because the owners were not there and the bitcoin wallet was on their smartphones, those who told us that today "Bitcoin is not working" and therefore, they were sorry, but they could only accept cash.</p><p>In short, there is everything and more in Bitcoin Lake and it is still so early! But the feeling we have is that there is a lot of curiosity in the streets. When we stopped to talk about Bitcoin with locals, we always sensed a keen interest. They often asked us questions, they wanted to know more. </p><p>"Is it true that it's free? Really with the right application, even if you pay in bitcoin, I can receive quetzales or dollars?" </p><p>No testy expressions, huffing faces or politically-aligned answers like, "I don't care about bitcoin because I hate Bukele."</p><p>In Bitcoin Lake, we were only a few hundred miles further north than El Salvador, but a totally different wind seemed to be blowing. We have no doubt that this will soon be a very popular destination among Bitcoiners. After all, for what reason should anyone visiting Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador not spend a few days here as well? There are private buses that directly connect El Tunco, the town right next to El Zonte, with Lake Atitlán. It only takes a few hours of travel time, is an extremely inexpensive transportation option and you will pass through majestic landscapes, traveling along safe roads.</p><p>Our journey in Central America continues but our impression is that this part of the continent is waking up. There is a lot of economic and tourism potential here, and Bitcoin meets real needs. The Bitcoin traveler's horizons, in short, are expanding rapidly and, as we have shown, the number of options is not limited only to El Salvador.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rikki.

In fact, “Bitcoin Twitter” is virtually its own “country” that exists online. </p><p>I’ve had a Twitter account since 2009, but I never use it to tweet. There are several reasons for this (perhaps the subject of a different article) but, suffice to say, I’ve never found it to be a great use of my time. Like many Boomers, I see social media as a huge time and productivity drain. I also see it as perhaps the worst addiction of our age. </p><p><a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-tales-from-the-crypt-31106219/episode/378-building-a-billion-dollar-payments-105433581/">In a recent “TFTC” podcast episode</a>, host Marty Bent and guest Ryan Breslow, the CEO of BOLT, got into the topic of our addiction to technology and, specifically, Twitter. </p><p>Both admitted to having Twitter addictions. It appeared from the conversation that, while Bent admitted to his addiction, he had not done much to break his addiction, while Breslow had. In fact, Breslow described “his toughest personal challenge is managing his time on Twitter.” Breslow used to check it randomly and often everyday, which brought him the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-wise/201209/why-were-all-addicted-to-texts-twitter-and-google">dopamine hit that keeps all of us hooked on the technology</a>.</p><p>How many can say the same? Probably many of you who are reading this.</p><h2>No Silver Bullet</h2><p>Since I’m not on Twitter, it’s easy for me to feel excluded. I may have great ideas to contribute but they won’t be heard, unless I become more active on Twitter. My compromise approach has been to join Telegram, which has been just the right middle ground for me. </p><p>But, as Breslow pointed out, there is no silver bullet approach. Day to day, how are you managing your addiction? It turns out that few of us can resist the appeal of something that’s “always available, one button away.” Breslow adopted this rule for his posts: He checks his Twitter feed once to see how a post did. It’s easy to say and hard to do.</p><p>I’ve been writing about this growing addiction to our devices before the age of smartphones and before Bitcoin. In fact, I wrote about it with the advent of PDAs (which stands for personal digital assistant), in particular Blackberries, which were — during their heyday — sometimes called “crackberries.” I even wrote a chapter in my second book that ironically was titled “Fire Your PDA!” </p><p>I joked back then, that most people did not know that there was an on/off switch on their devices. And for those of you who are too young to remember, Blackberries were highly addictive in the age of email and <em>before</em> social media or texting. </p><p>Well, as anyone reading this article today can attest, the problem has only worsened with Twitter and other social media platforms, but it’s at least 10, or perhaps even 100, times worse. </p><h2>Kicking An Addiction</h2><p>Before I share specific experiments that you might implement in the new year to increase your awareness of this addiction, let me ask you these questions:</p><ol><li>Do you admit that you have a Twitter addiction?</li><li>Has it hindered or interfered with your relationships with a coworker, family member or friend?</li><li>Have you ever tried going a day without it?</li><li>Do you check Twitter (or another social media app) first thing when you wake up?</li><li>Do you keep your phone in your bedroom?</li><li>Do you keep your phone on your nightstand?</li><li>After you post something, do you check it compulsively?</li></ol><p>It’s a safe bet that if a family member or friend has ever asked you to stop reading your Twitter feed when you are with them, you are probably addicted to or misusing the technology. In fact, I’m betting that it’s harder for some of us to give up our addiction to social media than to give up our addiction to certain foods, like sugar. In fact, I’d say our addiction to devices is as damaging to our health as is our addiction to sugar. </p><p>What follows are several actionable “experiments” (from easiest to most challenging) that you can implement <em>today</em> that will be worth trying in 2023:</p><ol><li>Turn off notifications for Twitter for one week</li><li>Turn off notifications for Twitter for one week and check your usage data for the last week. Set a benchmark for the number of minutes you spend on the platform each week. Monitor this on the same day each week. </li><li>Establish a defined number of times per day when you will check the app on your device. Or set a block of time for when you check it. </li><li>Turn off your device for one hour per day. (This is actually a really good way to assess how compulsively you check it.)</li><li>Turn off your device for an entire day. Keep track of the number of times you go to check it and/or turn it back on.</li><li>Turn off your device when meditating or reading spiritual literature. Keep track of the number of times you go to check it and/or turn it back on.</li><li>Turn off your device when you are eating. Keep track of the number of times you go to check it and/or turn it back on.</li><li>Turn off your device when you are writing an article. Keep track of the number of times you go to check it and/or turn it back on.</li><li>Turn off your device when you are working, if possible.</li><li>Turn off your device for an entire weekend. </li><li>Delete Twitter from your phone for a day. </li><li>Delete Twitter from your phone for a week.</li></ol><p>Some of these experiments may be totally unworkable because of life situations, but the overall purpose for them is to assess how addicted you are to the device. The goal of the exercise is for you to gain greater control over Twitter or the social media app that has you in its grip. Ideally, if you spend less time on Twitter and devote more time to your friends and family, it will improve the quality of your life and productivity. Remember: We want the tech to serve us and not have us be addicted to the app or the tech. </p><p>Consider establishing one or more of the above as a possible 2023 New Year’s resolution. Best wishes for an awesome 2023!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mark Maraia.

The goal of the bond issuance would be to invest half of the money into bitcoin, and the other half into infrastructure necessary to build out the bitcoin industry in the Central American country. The bonds, according to the statement at the time, would yield 6.5% and enable a fast-track for investors to acquire citizenship in the country. <br><br>Exactly one year after the announcement of the plan, the bill that was voted on today <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/el-salvador-submits-bitcoin-bond-bill">was introduced</a> by El Salvador’s Minister of the Economy Maria Luisa Hayem Brevé to the country’s legislative assembly as the next step towards this plan. With today’s approval, the country is much closer to making the bitcoin bonds a reality.<br></p><p>El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinofficesv/status/1613274373066051587?s=20&amp;t=jcmdOO7X9TxcF3068ckIbg">released</a> a statement in response to the vote that read in part, “Today El Salvador builds on our first-mover advantage by passing landmark legislation establishing a legal framework for all digital assets that are not bitcoin. The law also paves the way for the volcano bonds which we will soon begin issuing.” <br><br>In a statement to Bitcoin Magazine, Max Keiser, a Bitcoin educator and advocate who has also been a major proponent for El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin since the process began, states that he believes “This is one of the most important milestones yet. Making Bitcoin legal tender in September, 2021 put El Salvador on the global financial map. This new law furthers the mission of President Bukele by establishing a foundation for a new global, digital securities layer built on Bitcoin.” </p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinofficesv/status/1613274510811140096"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5MzY1NjM3NzAzODA0ODk2/img_6320-1-1-1-1.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Luxor’s Hashrate Index 2022 Mining Year In Review Shows Bitcoin’s Resilience]]></title><description><![CDATA[Analysis shows that even though the mining industry saw major pressure this year, the network hashrate still grew immensely.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/hashrate-index-2022-year-in-review-report</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/hashrate-index-2022-year-in-review-report</guid><category><![CDATA[hashrate index]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[hash rate]]></category><category><![CDATA[luxor]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 19:56:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg3NTA4NzY4OTkxNDIyMjIz/from-delivery-to-hashing-in-15-minutes-setting-up-the-futurebit-apollo-node-and-miner.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Analysis shows that even though the mining industry saw major pressure this year, the network hashrate still grew immensely.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Hashrate Index has released its <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/hashrate-index-2022-bitcoin-mining-year-in-review/">2022 Bitcoin Mining Year In Review</a>, an extensive report on the mining industry and markets surrounding it. <br></p><p>2022 was a difficult year for Bitcoin mining, with the bear market leading to a hashprice all-time low, bankruptcies and losses for miners. Despite this, hash rate still grew 41%, and Bitcoin mining still generated nearly double the rewards compared to the previous three years. The report covers all of these topics and more in detail.<br><br>One of the main focuses of the report is the growth of hash rate. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Although the year involved many challenges to the mining industry, from an all-time low hashprice, to several public miner bankruptcies and even an arctic cyclone at the end of the year to top things off, hash rate still climbed, and at a much greater rate than 2021, which was stunted by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/china-still-a-bitcoin-mining-hub-despite-ban">China’s mining ban</a>. <br><br>The report also describes a large decline in hashprice, with the high of the year being recorded on January 1 at $246.86/PH/day and only declining from there. Indeed, the year saw an all-time low in hashprice at $55.94/PH/day. <br></p><figure>

    </figure><p>One factor that played into this, according to the report, is increasing industrial electricity rates across the country. But many states have been insulated from this rise in cost through abundant energy production sources like Washington’s hydropower, or other states’ access to natural gas, leading to certain states retaining viable mining operations. The report also notes that “power strategies can take many forms, but a common theme is that miners exploit the unique low-consequence-interruptibility of the bitcoin mining process by adjusting their electricity consumption based on market signals.” This was on display most recently when Texas miners <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/1-5m-houses-could-be-powered-by-the-energy-texas-miners-returned">turned off their operations</a> in order to return energy supply to the grid, while getting paid nearly as much as they would have had they continued mining. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Hashrate Index also highlighted the increase in hosting costs, which prior to 2022, hovered around $0.05-$0.06/kWh. But now, “Anything below $0.075/kWh is considered “a steal” given market conditions.”</p><p>Suffering public miners were also a focal point in the analysis.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>With the bull market in full swing, public bitcoin miners made big bets with their equipment purchases and expansionary moves. But the bear market hit some larger performers particularly hard, with behemoths like Core Scientific taking losses of nearly 100% — the company is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-bankruptcy">currently undergoing</a> Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedures. These were difficult-to-swallow pills for the market, but public miners did expand in terms of their hash rate dominance, ending the year at 19%. <br><br>Overall, the report signified Bitcoin’s resilience in the face of various major headwinds. Macroeconomic pressures, environmental anomalies and major public mining stocks tumbling more than 90% still couldn’t hamper major growth in network hash rate. Apparently, even such horrendous extraneous conditions as those on display in 2022 cannot temper the growth of the Bitcoin mining industry.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg3NTA4NzY4OTkxNDIyMjIz/from-delivery-to-hashing-in-15-minutes-setting-up-the-futurebit-apollo-node-and-miner.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDkzOTk5MzMyMTA4MDAy/image1.png" height="398" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDkzOTk5MzMyMTczNTM4/image2.png" height="398" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDkzOTk5MzMyMTA3NDYz/image4.png" height="424" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDkzOTk5MzMyMjM5MDc0/image3.png" height="398" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Bitcoin Can Radically Improve The Healthcare System For Patients]]></title><description><![CDATA[If healthcare providers were to adopt bitcoin, patients would see free-market and affordability improvements.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-makes-healthcare-fair-for-patients</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-makes-healthcare-fair-for-patients</guid><category><![CDATA[Healthcare]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning network]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robert Hall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjU5NjI0MzI1MjkzMjE4/bitcoin-healthcare-doctor.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">If healthcare providers were to adopt bitcoin, patients would see free-market and affordability improvements.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner.</em></p><p>Nothing is more critical to long-term health than having access to healthcare when needed. But every jurisdiction around the world implements this process differently. <a href="https://worldpopulace.com/countries-with-universal-health-care/">Many countries socialize the cost of healthcare through the government </a>on a sliding scale from total government control to private market healthcare, with a sprinkle of government-provided health insurance for the poor and the elderly.</p><p>In the United States, we <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-278.html#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20private%20health%20insurance,percent%20and%2035.7%20percent%2C%20respectively.">primarily have a private healthcare system</a>. If you have the money, you can purchase healthcare services from any service provider you like. But the problem in America isn't a lack of healthcare providers; it is how healthcare services are paid for.</p><p>When you see your doctor, you don't know how much you will spend. But if you think about this for a second, it is very odd. Can you think of any other service for which you don't know how much you will spend before your visit? Hell, even some sort of estimate would be nice, right?</p><p>When you arrive at the doctor's office, you typically hand over your health insurance card and pay a copay. Do you know what a copay or coinsurance is and how it functions? Not many people do. All that most people know is that you hand over a card, pay a nominal fee and receive services.</p><p>After services are rendered, your doctor's office will send a claim to your health insurance company to be paid out. Once the claim has been paid out, you must pay the rest if there is a balance. Typically this happens months later, and by this point, you may not have the money to pay the balance.</p><p>How insane is this? Not only are you hit with a surprise bill that has yet to be budgeted for, but healthcare providers are also having difficulty <a href="https://revcycleintelligence.com/news/healthcare-revenue-falling-short-of-2022-goals-for-many-providers">finding qualified staff to process payments</a>. The government also <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2022/11/no-surprises-act-leads-to-thousands-more-disputes-and-delays-than-govt-expected/">passed the No Surprises Act last year</a>, making receiving payments even more cumbersome for healthcare providers<a href="https://medcitynews.com/2022/11/no-surprises-act-leads-to-thousands-more-disputes-and-delays-than-govt-expected/">. </a></p><p>Why do we need third parties to pay medical bills in the first place? Imagine having your car insurance company pay to fill up your gas tank. Weird, right?</p><p>Did you know that in 2021, <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-estimates-88-billion-in-medical-bills-on-credit-reports/">20% of Americans had medical debt, and 58% of bills in collections were for medical debt</a>? </p><p>As you can see, people are struggling with medical debt, which has a cascading effect on healthcare providers. <a href="https://healthywyoming.org/why-you-should-care-about-uncompensated-care/">Healthcare providers are losing revenue when their patients don't pay and have to raise prices to make the difference</a>. Does the healthcare consumer see a rise in prices directly? No, the health insurance companies see the increase in cost to provide services.</p><p>This increase in the price of healthcare goods and services is reflected in the price that is paid for health insurance. <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-the-average-health-insurance-premium-4586358">The typical American family spends $22,221 </a>on health insurance every year. I don't know about you, but this is a lot of money. Imagine what you could do with $22,221 in your pocket.</p><p>The situation becomes troubling when considering the federal government and how much it pays for healthcare.</p><p><a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/medicare-insolvency-still-expected-by-2026-unchanged-by-covid-19-trustees/605877/">Medicare is projected to be insolvent by the year 2026</a>. That is a mere three years from now, yet no one is talking about this in the media, and no one significantly campaigned on this during the election. Medicare provides health coverage for <a href="https://www.fah.org/issues-advocacy/medicare/#:~:text=Created%20in%201965%2C%20Medicare%20serves,to%20approximately%2063%20million%20people.">63 million seniors and disabled Americans</a>.</p><p>What will they do when the government runs out of money to provide healthcare coverage to this population? As of 2021, <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/medicare-insolvency-still-expected-by-2026-unchanged-by-covid-19-trustees/605877/">growth in Medicare spending had averaged 7.6% for the previous five years</a> and will not be slowing down anytime soon. This is a slow-motion train wreck amid an already broken healthcare system.</p><p>The system is broken and needs to change before it implodes and takes everyone down with it. How can we transform the healthcare system to one based on free market principles while helping healthcare service providers grow revenue and lower costs for their patients?</p><h2>Bitcoin To The Rescue</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>Imagine a world where you know how much your medical bills will be before services are rendered. Imagine a world where you could compare the prices of different medical procedures in the same way that you can when you go to the grocery store or shop on Amazon.</p><p>Bitcoin makes this world possible. If the world adopted a Bitcoin standard, the average consumer would have more purchasing power to pay for their medical bills. The deflationary nature of Bitcoin makes this possible.</p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/there-will-never-be-more-than-21-million-bitcoin">There is only 21 million bitcoin that will ever be created</a>. The longer you hold it, the more it will increase in value. The more value it accrues, the more healthcare services it can be used to purchase. The increase in value will entice more healthcare providers to enter the market and offer their services for bitcoin. More competition between healthcare providers means more access to healthcare, better customer service and lower prices for all. Are you seeing how this all works now?</p><p>Healthcare providers would be incentivized to list the prices of their services in bitcoin to attract new patients to their practice.</p><p>Typical health insurance, where the insurance companies pay the bill for simple office visits, would disappear on a Bitcoin standard. There would be no need for it, as consumers would have enough purchasing power to pay their bills at the time of service.</p><h2>Lightning Network: A Boon To Healthcare Providers</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>Running a doctor's office is a business. There are overhead costs that have to be paid to stay in business. Rents must be paid, employees must be paid and supplies must be purchased.</p><p>Medical practices can use the Lightning Network to receive instant settlement from their patients and <a href="https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/medical-bills-cause-confusion-for-almost-40-of-patients">reduce confusion over medical billing.</a> Adopting Lightning payments would boost revenue and improve cash flow. </p><p>This cash flow could be used to invest in the business, buy better equipment and hire more staff. Not only does this benefit the company, but better equipment also leads to better healthcare outcomes, and more staff leads to better customer service. High-quality customer service will increase profitability over the long term. </p><p>According to a recent study, healthcare providers that provide “excellent” customer service<a href="https://www.leadsquared.com/industries/healthcare/customer-service-in-healthcare/"> reported a net margin that was 50% higher</a> than those that provide “average” customer service.</p><p>The Lightning Network will also lower transaction costs for medical practices. Payment processing takes a big chunk of the bottom line for healthcare providers and provides very little utility. <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-credit-card-processing-fees-costs-america/">The average payment processor charges 1.5% to 3.5%, plus they often institute other confusing formulas</a> to bilk companies out of their money<a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-credit-card-processing-fees-costs-america/">.</a></p><p>Healthcare providers could save money on transaction fees if they switched to the Lightning Network. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/lighting-network-makes-bitcoin-scalable">The average fee for sending a Lightning payment is .01%! </a> Plenty of Lightning nodes don't charge a fee to send a payment. Traditional payment processors simply can't compete with this. </p><p>Healthcare providers should switch to a Bitcoin standard and use the Lightning Network as soon as possible, and watch their businesses transform. It will be good for them, their patients and the economy.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Robert Hall.

And it’s also gaining traction as it’s become clear that the Twitter buyout by Elon Musk hasn't fundamentally changed anything about freedom of expression on the platform — users are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23512004/elon-musk-starts-banning-critical-journalists-from-twitter">still being banned</a> for inconsistent and arbitrary reasons, and people are looking for a decentralized alternative that isn't something like Mastodon, where a <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/">server operator</a> still has the ability to control your identity. </p><p>Despite the recent attention, the Nostr protocol and first relay server implementation were actually created at the end of 2020 by developer <a href="https://github.com/fiatjaf">fiatjaf</a>. Before the big burst of attention, it was just a quiet, niche protocol simply trying to be a lightweight solution to the problems of Twitter and Mastodon. On both systems, your identity/username is simply a thing controlled by whoever is running the server. Mastodon being a federated system with multiple different servers all talking to each other doesn't fundamentally change that reality. Whoever's server you use to host an account is in total control of whether you can use it or not. Even running your own server, other server operators can black- or whitelist which servers will be allowed to talk to theirs. This has led to a lot of partitioning in the "Fediverse" of different Mastodon servers and makes the idea of just running your own meaningless. You can still ultimately be censored by other server operators, preventing their users from ever seeing your content in their feed. </p><p>The core differentiator between Nostr and something like Mastodon is that, instead of using a username owned by a server operator, each user utilizes a public/private keypair to handle that function instead. That is something that a server operator cannot simply seize from you or lock you out of. This is one of the core building blocks on top of which the overall Nostr protocol is built. </p><p>The next is "events." This is the basic object/data type used by clients and the relay servers that clients connect to in order to send and retrieve messages. The general idea of the protocol is that clients send events to relay servers, who then in turn store and index them, and other clients can communicate with relay servers to request events they have received and stored. In the original <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md">NIP 01</a>, three different event types are defined:</p><ul><li>0: Sends metadata about a user, such as username, picture, a bio, etc.</li><li>1: Sends text messages and basic content</li><li>2: Recommends relay servers for people following the event creator to connect to</li></ul><p>All events are structured in a specifically-defined way. They include the public key of the creator, a timestamp of when they were created, their type (or kind in the specification), the content payload and a signature from the event creator. They also can have tags referencing other events or users, and have an ID value which is a hash of everything except the creator's signature (similar to a TXID for Bitcoin transactions). This lets you guarantee that a message was actually created by the owner of the public key inside of it by verifying the signature (and the person who owns that key if it isn't compromised), and guarantee that the message wasn't altered after they signed it. Just like you can't alter a Bitcoin transaction after it's signed without voiding it, you can't alter a Nostr event after the creator signed it without it being an obvious fraud. </p><p>The event kind system was expanded quite substantially from that original NIP. There is an event type for encrypted direct messages, establishing a shared key by combining the sender's private key with the receiver's public key, which results in the same key you would get by combining the sender's public key with the receiver's private key (this is how <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0047">BIP 47</a> and Silent Payments work). There are also types for replaceable events and ephemeral events. In the case of a replaceable event (obviously), they are designed so that the original creator of the event can sign a new one to replace the old one. Relay servers following the specification will automatically drop the older event from their storage and begin serving the newer versions to clients upon receipt. Ephemeral events are designed so that they will be broadcast to anyone subscribing to their creator when sent to the relay, but relay servers are not supposed to store them. This creates the possibility of having messages seen only by people when they are online during its broadcast. There is even an event type to signal a reaction (such as likes or emojis) to other people's events. </p><p>Speaking of that last one, events can also contain tags. Currently there are tag types for events (to reference an exact Nostr event), public keys (to tag or reference other users) and subjects (to emulate functionality, such as email subjects). All of these can include pointers to specific relay servers from which the the data can be fetched so that users can actually interact across servers, i.e., a user posting their content to one relay server can interact with and reference content created by another user posting to a different relay server in a way that allows any user to coherently fetch the entire thread of interactions in the proper order and without massive complexity in figuring out where to find the relevant data. </p><p>Inside the original NIP, a specification is given for how clients are to interact with relay servers through a subscription message/data structure that includes filters for what events that client is interested in receiving. Those filters can specify users' public keys, exact events, types of events and even specific timeframes in which they want them based on the prior criteria. You can even submit prefixes of public keys or event IDs, such as "1xjisj…." and receive any event or events from a public key that begin with that short string (this can be useful for hiding from a relay server what you actually wanted to view). </p><p>Overall, the protocol is a very bare bones, generalized scheme for passing messages between users that covers the important things, such as guaranteeing the integrity of messages and who sent them with the use of public key identities, while also facilitating infrastructure on the backend for relay servers that can be extremely centralized or allow a user to run their own personal relay server, all while seamlessly interacting with each other and not causing massive chaos in the event of a user being banned from one relay server. They can move to another one or run their own and their de-platforming from the prior server does not lose them their digital identity or followers because they still maintain control over their private key and users can authenticate that when finding them elsewhere. </p><p>Relay servers can operate however they want as well. They can operate for free, can charge micropayments to post or download messages, and there is <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/13.md">even a NIP</a> for requiring hashcash-style proof of work to submit a message. They can be a single relay server for hosting and serving only your posts to other users, or they can be a server running at massive scale such as Twitter or Reddit (clients can display and organize information however they want, which allows emulating essentially any social media platform that exists today). All of this can interoperate seamlessly and without being able to shut out a user. You can prevent them from posting content to your relay server, but ultimately you can't stop them from viewing content you host on your relay server or stop other users from finding their content on other servers. </p><p>It is a very simplistic protocol with a large, open design space for people to build, guaranteeing users can always interact with each other regardless of what individual relay server operators choose to host or not host. This is simultaneously its greatest strength and greatest weakness. While it guarantees the freedom for developers to build without tight constraints by a complicated protocol, there are also many problems that it will inherently run into that are not handled by the protocol itself. </p><p>In the next piece I write, I will go into some of the issues I see occurring and potential solutions, but for now, I'll just say that in terms of the simplicity of the design and the possibilities that it opens up for people to build, Nostr has done a very good job, considering it is the brainchild of one person and only a handful of people have really contributed to the protocol specification itself so far. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shinobi.

The letter also levies substantial claims of fraud against Barry Silbert and other key personnel at the companies.&nbsp;</p><p>The letter alleges that after Genesis Global Capital LLC, Genesis Trading’s $2.8 billion crypto lending arm, realized losses of at least $1.2 billion in the wake of cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital’s <a href="https://nymag.com/press/2022/08/the-collapse-of-the-crypto-hedge-fund-is-a-strange-tale.html">collapse</a>, instead of taking action to restructure and protect users, the fund tried to defraud others into believing that $1.2 billion of working capital had been injected into the company. <br><br>Instead of doing this, however, the firm allegedly marked a 10-year promissory note down as a current asset, which normally “refers to cash, cash equivalents, or other assets that can be exchanged into cash within one year,” according to the letter. However, Winklevoss writes that, “A promissory note with a principal repayment due in 10 years falls outside the definition of a ‘current asset’ by a country mile.” </p><p>Winklevoss also describes how Genesis was allegedly lending to Three Arrows Capital without regard to the risk of these loans, as the crypto hedge fund was apparently redirecting investment into Grayscale Investments’s GBTC, which limited the growing discount of the Trust. This risk was then passed on to the users of Gemini Earn. <br><br>The letter claims that greed is ultimately what has driven these investment decisions and apparently, the loss of Gemini Earn users’ funds. The letter concludes with a paragraph which reads, “There is no path forward as long as Barry Sibert remains CEO of DCG. He has proven himself unfit to run DCG and unwilling and unable to find a resolution with creditors that is both fair and reasonable. As a result, Gemini, acting on behalf of 340,000 earn users, requests that the Board remove Barry Silbert as CEO effective immediately, and install a new CEO, who will right the wrongs that occurred under Barry’s watch.”<br><br>While bitcoin that is held in custodians can be frozen and stolen, it is worthy of noting that bitcoin which is properly self-custodied in cold storage cannot be, as alleged in this letter. The users of Gemini Earn introduced third-party risk and unnecessary trust when they kept their funds on that platform, which then brazenly lent out said entrusted funds. Bitcoiners should clarify to those who are unaware the differences between these platforms and their risks and proper self-custodial storage of bitcoin. </p><p>In response to the letter, DCG’s Twitter account released an <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1612852131333029893">official statement</a>, embedded below.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1612852131333029893"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1612852233506361356"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMTY0MTc2/legal-justice.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Homesteader Conversations: Feeding Your Family And Building A Bitcoin Community In Southern Portugal]]></title><description><![CDATA[A homesteader in Portugal shares her experiences running a farm, feeding her family and supporting a Bitcoin community through workshops.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-homesteading-in-portugal</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-homesteading-in-portugal</guid><category><![CDATA[farming]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Citadel]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Captain Sidd]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNDI3MzM2NzA3OTQxNjI1/flag-freedom-nation-adventure-innovation.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">A homesteader in Portugal shares her experiences running a farm, feeding her family and supporting a Bitcoin community through workshops.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>In the conversation for this article, Julia joined me from her home in Southern Portugal to chat about her homestead, local community and Bitcoin. I found many parallels between how Julia talks about Bitcoin and homesteading with what I have heard from many homesteaders and farmers in the U.S. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/what-i-discovered-about-bitcoin-culture">during my trip across the country this summer</a>. The work to understand and work on Bitcoin or a farm demand high upfront investment and very low time preference. </p><p>In my conversation with Julia, we touched on her backstory as a German who moved her life to Portugal, the growth of the Bitcoin meetup in her local community and what it takes to operate a homestead that feeds her family. </p><h2>Julia’s Backstory</h2><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> Let’s start with a bit of your backstory. Tell me about how you ended up in Portugal. Why did you move there and why did you stay?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I'm originally from Germany, and coming to Portugal was really just a part of something that happens to you when you're in your late teens or early 20s. I first set foot on Portuguese terrain when I was 19 — I wanted to travel, so I looked around for some jobs. I found an opportunity to work in Portugal for three months, and I thought I would travel on to some other country after. But then, as life happens, I got offered a full-time job and I thought, “Yes, I'm going to resettle here in Portugal.”</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>A view from the land in Portugal which Julia eventually settled on. All images included in this article are courtesy of Julia.</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Since then, my parents moved over together with my brothers shortly after me. I’ve been back to Germany a few times to visit some family, but my close family is here. The last time I went to Germany was maybe 15 years ago! I don't go back regularly. </p><h2>Local Community And Meetups</h2><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>Tell me about the community that you've built there. When I chatted with your friend earlier, she mentioned a local market that began in 2020. </p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> Our community has always been on the alternative side of things, but it was really COVID-19 that kicked this community and networking thing into gear. That's when everybody thought, “It's now or never to build a strong local community and economy.” And that's when the alternative markets started happening. People were looking for their tribe, because it became so apparent that there is a tribe: you're either on this side, or you're on the other side. In a way, COVID-19 has been a real blessing for community building here because it helped us grow into a very strong, little, tight-knit community.</p><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> Tell me about the alternative market. What’s sold there? Who is selling and who is buying? </p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> The market group currently counts over 1,000 members, and is based on private land with expected attendance of several hundred people from the Algarve. The Algarve region in South Portugal spans only 200 kilometers by 50 (kilometers) or so, and comprises the wider community who goes to the market. The local community who are producing and selling most of the goods at the market are within about a half hour drive of the market.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Setting up at the market!</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Most of what is sold at the market are handicrafts, jewelry, homemade products, soaps, cosmetics, natural healing tinctures and so on, with some foods. All homemade items. It’s on private land so fewer regulations apply to what’s sold. </p><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>How many Bitcoiners are there in the community? Is there a Bitcoin meetup? </p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I started to understand Bitcoin only at the beginning of last year. Since then, we’ve had this one individual in the community — I’ll call him Rick — who started educating people on Bitcoin. His girlfriend is also very much into creating networks and running events, so she hosts regular meetups. Before these events started, I didn't know anybody who was into Bitcoin. Now, I see Bitcoiners everywhere because I’m in the group. The same thing happened to me with homeschooling. Before I started homeschooling, I never knew there was a homeschooling community. The moment I started doing it myself, suddenly, it’s everywhere. </p><p>Portugal in general is a great magnet for Bitcoiners as well because the government brings a very relaxed approach to it. At the moment, you don’t have to pay capital gains tax. The government is discussing a possible capital gains tax, but for now it would only apply if you sell less than 12 months after purchasing.</p><h2>Julia’s Interest In Bitcoin</h2><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> So, tell me about your interest in Bitcoin. Where did it come from?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I had been hearing about Bitcoin for years, but it wasn't until a video (which I can’t remember now!) triggered a particular interest that I really started investigating. It was really Rick who helped answer all my questions and foster my interest. Before I had someone to sit down with and ask my questions to, it was all very dodgy. Meeting Rick was my entrance to the Bitcoin rabbit hole. </p><p>I had questions about the energy use, and how bitcoins resist being copied with a click. I also sat down with Rick to talk about what decentralization actually means, and why it matters. When the philosophical stuff kicked in — like what does all of this mean for humanity — I really got hooked. I could see something so different for the future of humanity in this.</p><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> Let’s go back to homesteading. What parallels, if any, do you see between homesteading and Bitcoin? </p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>The ups and down. You have to just flow with the ups and downs, you will have good days and successful times and then it will go downhill again. You have to swallow that as well. It's like when you lose your whole flock of chickens in one night to a predator, that's that. You could then decide to give up and sell, or you just keep going. And I think also, speaking to the aspect of community, Bitcoin-only people are generally a very nice bunch. The same goes for farmers. They're very down-to-earth people, which I like.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDQzNzYzNzg0MDY2Nzg2/pumpkin.jpg" height="464" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>A view from Julia’s land.</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>There’s also a long-term approach to success shared between those two communities. You can't just create a successful farm in half a year. It's almost generational. It takes years until the soil responds and improves. Years of diligent day-to-day work, I would say. No quick-fix solutions. </p><h2>Overview Of The Homestead</h2><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> Tell me about your homestead. What are you producing?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> It's a small homestead, probably a couple of acres. It's really a family home. I bought it as a ruin in 2000, so we’ve been here over 20 years. At first I started by planting a few trees, and had my first successes and failures. Planting trees sounds easy, but with the hot and dry Portuguese summers, it’s not. </p><p>I was immediately confronted with the realities of nature. However, I persevered as I've always been interested in the relationship between health and food. That inevitably brings you to growing your own food, because nothing else you can buy out there is high quality enough to keep you healthy.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Beautiful sundried tomatoes from the garden.&nbsp;</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>It really kicked into gear when I had children. My daughter is almost 10 years old now, so about 10 years ago I got serious: I want my own eggs and my own milk. And that's when I really started more and more homesteading and animal keeping. I’m very focused on animal production, without a lot of vegetable growing. The aim is to supply the family. And finally, after so many years, we’re there. We actually have a constant supply of raw milk and eggs. We also have some fruit trees, but I'm focusing on my chickens and my goats. We recently started with pigs who are great prolific providers. Having a freezer full of your own meat is also a very good feeling.</p><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> Are you at a point now where you’re overproducing and selling or having to store all this food?</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>I can sell some excess now. In springtime during the high season for eggs, I’m very happy to sell eggs as well as a few liters of milk. We are turning the idea of the homestead into an educational one: we're running workshops on homesteading once or twice a month, depending on the season as well.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDQzNzYzNzg0MDAwNzEx/terra-robinia.jpg" height="829" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>Julia puts an educational spin on homesteading by running regular workshops to help the local community sharpen their skills.&nbsp;</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>For example, we did one in September on vegetable fermentation to preserve vegetables from the fall harvest over the winter. We are now integrating Bitcoin education into those workshops as well. We have a bit of a farm shop too, which is just a big shelf in the kitchen where people can buy seeds, the beef jerky I make and other products.</p><h2>Labor, Scaling And Costs</h2><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> What labor is involved now in operating your homestead, and how does that change across the seasons?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I do it alone, and it’s well organized. If you've got your infrastructure nicely set into place, then it's quite easy. However, you're still there twice a day every day for feeding and for moving goats around in the pen. We practice a regenerative, holistic approach so we never keep the animals in one place. Sometimes, I need some help moving big structures, so I will ask somebody in the community to help. I'm usually out for at least an hour in the morning, and then another hour in the evening, just for the daily basics.</p><p>Seasonal works do exist. In the winter it’s wet, and there’s more to do in terms of fixing shelters and fences. The summer is our dormant season here; it’s too hot to do any extra work. Summers are about getting feed, water and shelter for the animals. </p><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>How did you scale up your homestead? What did you start with and what did you add as you went on?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I started with chickens, then pretty quickly expanded the number of chickens and started with goats. As just one person, there is not all that much scaling you can do. What you can do is stack: integrate one thing with another. I couldn't just suddenly run 20 goats, but I could integrate the goats with the pigs because that's not all that much more. That adds just a little bit to my daily chores. My husband still goes to work and I am homeschooling the kids, so I need to keep the labor on the homestead under control.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>One of Julia’s hardy goats.&nbsp;</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>I'm now at a point where I can supply the family with milk and eggs to what we need and have that little bit of extra which pays for the animals’ feed, and that's kind of a sweet spot to be in. I don't see myself growing a lot at the moment. I might be able to buy another piece of land in the future and restructure some stuff. Possibly get a dairy cow instead of the goats, and maybe a beef cow instead of the pigs. We'll see.</p><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>Speaking of the feed, what costs are involved with the homestead that you're running?</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>The cost of feed here over the course of the last 12 months has almost doubled. I do have to buy grain for the animals, even though they are out on pasture and occasionally getting kitchen leftovers. Other than that, we're very lightweight on costs. Structures like small shelters are often self-made with whatever I can find. The only other significant cost is in electric fencing. I have very low vet costs because I keep my animals very clean and healthy. I don't do the whole deworming and all that because I believe a healthy animal doesn't have worms. In that way, we're quite low on costs.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mistakes And Advice</h2><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>What major mistakes have you made on your homesteading journey?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I think I wasted a lot of energy before I got to a true understanding of the land. That true understanding of the land came in 2015 when I did an extensive permaculture course online from Geoff Lawton. His course just put everything into place. Suddenly I knew how to harvest my water and where to put trees so they actually survive. I would recommend anyone starting a homestead to do one of those comprehensive training courses with a good teacher like Geoff or Allan Savory. Allan gave me a great understanding of how animals work in harmony with the ground and vegetation on the land. </p><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>Knowing what you know now, where would you have started with homesteading? Would you have done it the same way that you did it or would you have started differently?</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>I think I took a fairly straightforward approach. There will always be a learning curve with mistakes and losses. I think for somebody just starting out, it's smart to begin with small animals. You can't run a cattle ranch with 100 heads overnight; you really have to grow into it in order to integrate your land and animals effectively. You have to be connected to your land and to your animals and the environment. You need to start small and feel your way. </p><p>Don't try to integrate too many species. It's all very romantic — them hopping around in the same pen — but in reality, it usually doesn’t work. They will either kill each other or eat each other's food. We've made all those mistakes. I thought I could just put some ducks with the chickens, but the ducks killed my chicks. Those are things you don’t know until you try and see for yourself. </p><p>Definitely read books, but really see if what you read in those books makes sense for you. People can get so lost wanting to grow their own food and be self-sustainable, yet having no idea what it takes. Growing your own vegetables is tough! They are so sensitive, they will die on you with any number of tiny mistakes and everything wants to eat them. So make sure you keep enough money in your back pocket to support you, and don't count on your food production.</p><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>Thanks for joining me today and sharing all your knowledge and experiences gained through your homestead.
