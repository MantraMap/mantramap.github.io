<p>Do Kwon, the recently arrested CEO of Terraform Labs, denies that he defrauded investors, and says that SEC allegations are unfounded.</p>
<p>Do Kwon is denying SEC allegations that he defrauded his investors by selling Terra, his blockchain platform. Kwon was recently arrested by US authorities in Montenegro, as he and a colleague were attempting to board a plane to Dubai with false travel documents, and is currently being held without bail.</p>
SEC improperly using its power
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal, Do Kwon&rsquo;s lawyers have asked for the judge to throw out the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuit on the grounds that it had exceeded its authority by failing to prove that US investors had been defrauded.</p>
<p>Taken from what Do Kwon&rsquo;s lawyers have so far said, it would appear that the defence will mainly be based on what the lawyers are saying is a failure by the SEC and the executive branch to agree on exactly what constitutes a security as regards cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The filing by the lawyers asserts:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The SEC&rsquo;s improper assertion of power here by trying to shoehorn all cryptocurrencies into its definition of a &lsquo;security&rsquo; fails,&rdquo;</p>

Fraudulent securities offering
<p>Terra is a platform for creating stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets, like the US dollar. The SEC claims that Kwon, Terraform Labs, and Terraform, raised $25 million through a fraudulent security offering. It is alleged that investors were told that they would get a return from Terra's stablecoin UST.</p>
<p>Kwon is a Korean national and has been detained in an American detention facility since his arrest. His legal team claims that Kwon is not a flight threat and should be freed on bail. US authorities, however, argue that Kwon is a flight threat and could possibly flee. Both the US and South Korea are seeking extradition.</p>
