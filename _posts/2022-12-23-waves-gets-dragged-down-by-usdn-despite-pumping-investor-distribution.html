The crypto exchanges included Kraken, Bybit, Binance, and OKX. Ivanov on a Twitter post said: “They are a breeding ground for FUD and making money off short positions, profitable because of it. I kindly ask all centralized exchanges to disable Waves future markets.” Evidently, the blockchain native currency has nosedived by more than 45% as seen in the past couple of weeks.
