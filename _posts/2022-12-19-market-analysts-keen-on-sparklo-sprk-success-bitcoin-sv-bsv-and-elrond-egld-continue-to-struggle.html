<p>With the year ending, investors are keen to boost their portfolios with cryptocurrencies that would provide immense gains. Due to the market decline, Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Elrond (EGLD) investors must look for alternatives since these tokens are currently struggling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, market analysts predict Sparklo to provide gains for investors in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin SV (BSV): Analysts Unsure Of Gains In The Long Term</p>
<p>The Bitcoin SV (BSV) token was introduced to the open market in November 2018. After it entered the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin SV (BSV) token hit an all-time high of over $200 before dropping to an all-time low of $36.87 on November 23. By 2019, the price fluctuated and traded between $20 to $80. Going further, by January 2020, the price of the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token rose to above $400 before it dipped. But it spent the rest of the year trading around $150 and $200.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021, Bitcoin SV (BSV) token, like most cryptocurrencies, achieved a meteoric price rise. This saw the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token reach an all-time high of $489.75 on April 16, 2021. The Bitcoin SV (BSV) token declined in price after it achieved its all-time high. 2022 hasn't been all sunshine for Bitcoin SV (BSV) token, as the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token struggled to regain its former glory. Currently, this token trades at $39.94, which is a 91.8% price decrease over the past year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin SV (BSV) token currently has a total supply of 21,000,00 and a circulating supply of 19.2 million. Its market cap stands at over $768 million and ranks as the #53 cryptocurrency. Analysts aren't sure if Bitcoin SV (BSV) tokens can provide gains for investors in the short term. They suggest investors look to alternatives like Sparklo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elrond (EGLD) Might Not Provide Profits Anytime Soon</p>
<p>Elrond (EGLD) token had an all-time high of $545.64 on November 23, 2021. Like most cryptocurrencies during the period, the Elrond (EGLD) token amassed enormous gains for investors. But, this gain couldn't continue as the price dropped shortly after. CoinMarketCap data shows that Elrond (EGLD) token lost 26% of its value over the last 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, in the past 14 days, Elrond (EGLD) token tried to make some gains by increasing 1.5% and 0.5% over the past seven days. Elrond (EGLD) token costs $42.65 after a 3.2% price increase over the last 24 hours, but analysts don't think this growth can be sustainable in the long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical data shows that investors in Elrond (EGLD) tokens can only make gains in a short rally. This leads investors to look for alternative investments that can provide short-term and long-term gains, like Spaklo.</p>
