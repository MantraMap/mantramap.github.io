Why are some NFTs expensive and others not?
<p>NFTs are very new to the blockchain ecosystem and are still in their infancy. It is an emerging market meaning there is no historical data or precedence that can assist in determining the value of an NFT. NFT projects that started at the beginning of the market boom have garnered legitimacy purely because they had a first-mover advantage. These &ldquo;established&rdquo; NFT projects have also had the opportunity to improve and learn from the issues that have plagued the NFT market and have, in such a way, made themselves more valuable. When the NFT boom took flight, many people realized profits beyond their wildest dreams, creating a space for opportunists to take advantage of the market growth. While some NFTs can be considered digital art, created by an artist who recognizes the value NFTs can add to the creative space, others have been made purely out of greed and a need to exploit the immense market growth. NFT projects that stem from greed and exploitation often have no value and are ultimately garbage.</p>
