He stressed that the Federal Reserve destroyed the U.S. banking system, citing near-zero interest rates at banks while &#8220;the Fed funds rate is 5.25% and the real inflation rate is much higher.&#8221; Schiff previously warned that the U.S. banking system is on the verge of a &#8220;much bigger collapse than 2008.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Peter Schiff on U.S. Banking Crisis</h2>
<p>Gold bug and economist Peter Schiff is back with more warnings about the U.S. economy. He tweeted Friday that the Federal Reserve destroyed the U.S. banking system, emphasizing that it is insolvent and would collapse without government help. Schiff wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bank of America pays just .05% interest on savings accounts and nothing on checking accounts. But the Fed funds rate is 5.25% and the real inflation rate is much higher. The Fed destroyed the U.S. banking system. It&#8217;s insolvent and would collapse without government backstops.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was not the first time that the economist sounded the alarm about potential issues within the U.S. banking system. In March, he tweeted: &#8220;The U.S. banking system is on the verge of a much bigger collapse than 2008. Banks own long-term paper at extremely low interest rates. They can&#8217;t compete with short-term Treasuries. Mass withdrawals from depositors seeking higher yields will result in a wave of bank failures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The interest-rate issue has been highlighted by numerous individuals, including Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk. The billionaire <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-shares-massive-incentive-to-move-money-out-of-bank-accounts/">explained</a> in May that the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve have created a massive gap between money market accounts (Treasury Bills) with interest rates of about 4.5% and bank accounts with interest rates of less than 1%. “That’s a massive incentive to move money out of bank accounts,” he emphasized.</p>

<p>When the U.S. government <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fdic-creates-bridge-banks-for-failed-silicon-valley-bank-and-signature-bank-clients-to-access-funds/">bailed out</a> failed Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank in March, Schiff warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>To finance the bank bailouts the Fed is creating more inflation. So the banking crisis didn&#8217;t solve the inflation problem, it made it much worse!</p></blockquote>
<p>“Bailing out depositors of failed banks is yet another mistake by the Fed &amp; the U.S. government,&#8221; Schiff further stressed. &#8220;Not only does the moral hazard lead to even greater instability in the banking system and larger future losses, but the inflation created to pay for it unfairly socializes current losses.”</p>
<p>Recently, Schiff issued stark warnings regarding a potential <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-of-us-dollar-crisis-and-catastrophic-end-national-debt-will-spiral-out-of-control/">U.S. dollar crisis</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-says-nobodys-money-is-safe-in-any-bank-warns-of-financial-crises-depressions/">economic depressions</a>, and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-blasts-debt-ceiling-deal-states-national-debt-might-increase-by-4-trillion-in-the-next-two-years/">debt ceiling deal</a> that Congress negotiated in order to prevent a U.S. government default. &#8220;Suspending the debt ceiling yet again means that reckless government spending and borrowing will continue until a sovereign debt and U.S. dollar crisis bring it to a catastrophic end,&#8221; he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-of-us-dollar-crisis-and-catastrophic-end-national-debt-will-spiral-out-of-control/">opined</a>.</p>

Noting that it will be the greatest crash &#8220;ever,&#8221; he stressed that the 2023 crisis will make the Global Financial Crisis &#8220;look like nothing.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>’Greatest Real Estate Crash Ever’</h2>
<p>Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling book Rich Dad Poor Dad, has issued another warning about the real estate market, stating that it is on the verge of the greatest crash “ever.&#8221; Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>The famous author believes that the 2023 crash will be worse than the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and is advising investors to protect themselves by buying gold, silver, and bitcoin. He tweeted Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Greatest real estate crash ever. 2008 was the GFC. 2023 will make 2008 GFC look like nothing. In 2019, office towers in San Francisco were hot. In 2023, same buildings have lost 70% of value … Get gold, silver, bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kiyosaki has cautioned many times in the past regarding the potential crash of the real estate market. In March, for example, he tweeted that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s rate hikes will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-fed-rate-hikes-will-crash-stocks-bonds-real-estate-and-us-dollar/">crash</a> stocks, bonds, real estate, and the U.S. dollar. In September last year, he similarly tweeted that stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and real estate are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-urges-investors-to-get-into-crypto-now-before-biggest-economic-crash-in-world-history/?preview_id=547298">crashing</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-warns-commercial-real-estate-melting-down-fast-predicts-home-values-next/">warned</a> about real estate markets. He tweeted at the end of May that commercial real estate is &#8220;melting down fast,&#8221; predicting that &#8220;home values&#8221; will be next. However, some people disagreed with the billionaire about the residential real estate market, including Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, Shark Tank star Barbara Corcoran, and Glenn Kelman, the CEO of residential real estate brokerage operator Redfin.</p>

<p>Kiyosaki previously explained that he no longer recommends real estate as an investment. &#8220;In my 2022 book Capitalist Manifesto, I stated Marxist took over the U.S. in the 2020 election. Marxists will raise property taxes, impose rent controls, as rising interest rates decrease property values. I recommend gold, silver, bitcoin,&#8221; he tweeted last October.</p>
<p>The renowned author has been recommending gold, silver, and bitcoin for quite some time. He <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-bitcoin-hitting-500k-by-2025-and-gold-soaring-to-5k/">predicted</a> in February that by 2025, the price of gold would reach $5,000, silver would soar to $500, and bitcoin would surge to $500,000. Explaining his prediction, he tweeted: &#8220;Because faith in U.S. dollar, fake money, will be destroyed. Gold &amp; silver God&#8217;s money. Bitcoin people’s $.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Dominance Rises While Ethereum&#x2019;s Dominance Remains Resilient; Many Other Crypto Competitors Have Not Been So Lucky</h2>
<p>As of Saturday, June 10, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> is still the undisputed leader with a market valuation of $496 billion, accounting for <a href="https://archive.ph/D011x#selection-249.0-249.18">47.5%</a> of the entire crypto economy&#x2019;s $1.04 trillion market capitalization. However, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has experienced a slight dip of 3.32% in the past day and 5.79% over the week against the U.S. dollar, according to current data. Interestingly, while <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has weathered the storm relatively well, many other top crypto assets, particularly those in the top 20, have taken a much harder hit in terms of value loss.</p>

<p>The top 20 crypto assets have seen some major losses this week, with a handful of them experiencing double-digit dips. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>, SOL, MATIC, DOGE, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, DOT, AVAX, SHIB, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a> are among the biggest losers. In comparison, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a>, the second leading crypto asset, only lost 8.29%. While <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> did experience a brief surge in dominance to 47.18% on June 5, its current dominance rating is even higher at 47.5%. Interestingly, the last time <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s dominance was this high was almost exactly a year ago on June 11, 2022, when it was hovering at around 47.49%.</p>

<p>While <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is currently dominating the crypto world, ethereum has managed to hold its own with a 20% dominance rating and a market capitalization of $208 billion. Meanwhile, the stablecoin <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT/">tether (USDT)</a> is still going strong with a market valuation of $83.39 billion, accounting for 7.96% of the total $1.04 trillion in value.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has not come close to breaching the 50% and 60% range it saw in 2019, 2020, and early 2021. It hit the 47.37% mark in terms of dominance on July 31, 2021 However, it wasn&#x2019;t until May 2021 that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> last saw its dominance level reach its current high. It remains to be seen whether <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will continue to climb in the dominance arena, drop lower, or plateau at its current level.</p>

We asked six popular AI chatbots the same question: &#x201C;Will bitcoin become a reserve currency and when?&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>AI Experiment Assesses the Likelihood of Bitcoin as a Reserve Currency</h2>
<p>Bitcoin.com News conducted an experiment on June 9, 2023, using some of the most popular AI chatbots currently available. AI has been a trending topic in 2023, with platforms like Chatgpt, Midjourney, Bard, and Claude gaining popularity. Users of this software have noticed varying outcomes when it comes to text and art content. In our test, we simply asked Openai&#x2019;s Chatgpt 3.5 and 4, Google&#x2019;s Bard, Anthropic&#x2019;s Claude Instant and 4, and Bing AI&#x2019;s creative mode the same question in the form of a prompt.</p>
<p>The prompt was:</p>
<blockquote><p>This experiment aims to gauge the likelihood of bitcoin becoming a global reserve asset. As an expert in the field of bitcoin and crypto assets, you will assess the probability of this occurrence and provide an explanation if it were to happen. While it is plausible to argue that it may never come to pass, if you do acknowledge its potential, kindly state the anticipated year of its realization and succinctly summarize the reasons and mechanisms behind its success. Keep your answer short and under a paragraph in length. Will bitcoin become a reserve currency and when?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Chatgpt 3.5 answer:</strong> It is challenging to provide a definitive answer as to whether bitcoin will become a global reserve asset and when. While bitcoin has gained significant attention and adoption in recent years, it still faces numerous challenges and uncertainties. It is important to monitor the ongoing developments and evolution of the cryptocurrency ecosystem to assess the potential for bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to achieve reserve currency status.</p>
<p><strong>Bard answer:</strong> There are a number of factors that could contribute to bitcoin&#x2019;s success, including increased adoption by central banks and financial institutions, increased stability in the price of bitcoin, and improvements in the technology behind bitcoin. If bitcoin is able to overcome these challenges, it could become a global reserve asset within the next decade. However, it is also possible that it will never become a reserve asset, or that it will take much longer to achieve this goal.</p>
<p><strong>Claude 4 answer:</strong> Based on my analysis of bitcoin&#x2019;s properties and the current global financial system, I would assess the probability of bitcoin becoming a reserve currency as low to moderate, potentially within the next 10-15 years.</p>
<p><strong>Claude Instant answer:</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-592703 size-full" title="AI Chatbots Weigh In: Is Bitcoin Poised to Become a Global Reserve Currency?" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/claudom.jpg" alt="AI Chatbots Weigh In: Is Bitcoin Poised to Become a Global Reserve Currency?" width="1280" height="450" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/claudom-300x105.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/claudom-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/claudom-768x270.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/claudom.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p><strong>Chatgpt 4 answer:</strong> While bitcoin has the potential to become a global reserve asset, there are significant challenges and uncertainties that could prevent this from happening. If it were to occur, it might take several years or even decades for this to materialize.</p>
<p><strong>Bing AI answer:</strong> The likelihood of bitcoin becoming a reserve currency is uncertain and depends on various factors, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The adoption and acceptance of bitcoin by mainstream users, investors, and institutions.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The innovation and improvement of bitcoin&#x2019;s technology, scalability, and usability.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The regulation and governance of bitcoin&#x2019;s legal status, taxation, and compliance.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The competition and cooperation of bitcoin with other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each answer had similarities, but there were also notable differences. Only Bard and Claude 4 provided a potential probability and possible timeline. During the study, Chatgpt 3.5 noted that its information was based on data available up until September 2021. Openai&#x2019;s Chatgpt 4 also warned that &#x201C;it cannot predict the future with certainty.&#x201D; Bard provided reasons why bitcoin would not become a global reserve currency, citing &#x201C;government regulation,&#x201D; &#x201C;security risks,&#x201D; and &#x201C;lack of trust.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Chatgpt 4 also provided a second paragraph, despite being asked not to, explaining reasons why bitcoin may not become a global reserve currency. The chatbot cited &#x201C;volatility,&#x201D; &#x201C;regulatory concerns,&#x201D; &#x201C;competition from other cryptocurrencies,&#x201D; and &#x201C;technological risks&#x201D; as its reasons. It&#x2019;s interesting to see how each AI program responded, but it&#x2019;s important to understand that humans programmed this software with what they believe to be facts and opinions.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts on Bitcoin&#x2019;s potential as a global reserve currency? Do you agree with the AI chatbots&#x2019; assessments, or do you have a different perspective? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Dorsey emphasized the importance of safeguarding these clients, expressing concern for their potential vulnerability to scams.</strong></p>
<h2>Despite the Media’s Attempt, FTX Customers&#8217; Identities Will Be Shielded From Public Eye</h2>
<p>Despite media attempts to unveil the identities of those who utilized the now-defunct crypto trading platform FTX, the insolvency judge overseeing the proceedings has opted to keep them concealed, as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ftx-cryptocurrency-bankmanfried-bankruptcy-e3a4c8729d3f3f3c22724247104c337b">reported</a> by the Associated Press. A legal representative for various news organizations contended that both the public and the press should have access to this information prior to Dorsey&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p>The attorney representing media outlets expounded on the far-reaching consequences of this event, stating that it “sent shock waves not just through the cryptocurrency industry, but the entire financial industry.” The lawyer went on to emphasize that it remains unclear which individuals or institutions were most severely affected by these repercussions.</p>
<p>In his determination, Dorsey concluded that redacting this information was in the best interests of FTX clients. He observed that cyber criminals operating on the &#8220;dark web&#8221; could misuse such data. Dorsey underscored customer welfare in his ruling: “It’s the customers that are the most important issue here,” Dorsey emphasized. “I want to make sure that they are protected and they don’t fall victim to any types of scams that might be happening out there.”</p>

<p>This development follows last year&#8217;s Celsius bankruptcy case, in which court proceedings allowed for the unsealing of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bankruptcy-court-publishes-14000-pages-of-celsius-customer-usernames-and-trade-history/">14,500 pages</a> containing both customer names and transaction histories. At that time, only client addresses were redacted upon release. Conversely, alongside revealing more than <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-publishes-creditor-list-owes-millions-to-well-known-institutions-and-government-agencies/">100 pages of creditor names</a> in the FTX case, Dorsey eventually permitted previously concealed creditor data to be publicized.</p>
<p>In Friday&#8217;s verdict, individual customer identities were permanently sealed by Dorsey while institutional client names will remain undisclosed for an additional three-month period. Nonetheless, he consented to expose the names of individual equity holders from the U.K. and European Union, because of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) policy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_FTX#:~:text=The%20liquidation%20of%20Bahamas%2Dbased,had%20over%20one%20million%20users.">Records</a> indicate that FTX had over a million users before its collapse in November 2022.</p>

The downturn has also affected the decentralized finance (defi) sector, with the total value locked in defi today awfully close to dropping below the $40 billion range after shedding 5.65% in value over the last day.</strong></p>
<h2>TVL Nears the $40 Billion Range, Three Tokens Record Heavy Losses</h2>
<p>The total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (defi) has decreased by 8.97% from $47.12 billion on June 5 to <a href="https://defillama.com">$42.89 billion</a> on June 10, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. (ET). This loss amounts to approximately $4.23 billion in five days. The majority of these losses occurred during the last day, as the crypto economy and the top smart contract coin sector have seen a steep drop in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>The total market capitalization of the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform">top smart contract token economy</a> is currently $312 billion, but it has lost 8.6% of its value since yesterday. Three tokens, namely cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>), solana (SOL), and polygon (MATIC) have lost more than 20% of their value since Robinhood <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robinhood-to-delist-cardano-solana-and-polygon-amidst-sec-regulatory-pressure/">announced</a> that it would delist these coins on June 27, 2023. Ethereum accounts for $209 billion of the total market capitalization of $312 billion.</p>
<p>The TVL in defi has not been this low since March 12, 2023, when it was at $42.51 billion. The TVL had been above $40 billion since January 8, but it is now awfully close to falling below that level. All of the top ten defi protocols have seen losses in the last 24 hours and seven days. Only <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/liquid-staking-protocol-lidos-defi-dominance-swells-from-7-to-26-in-12-months/">Lido Finance</a> has recorded gains in the last 30 days, defillama.com&#x2019;s defi <a href="https://defillama.com">statistics</a> detail.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#x2019;s Wrapped Staked Ether protocol <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereum-staked-on-coinbase-sees-massive-redemptions-over-27000-tokens-redeemed-on-june-6/">lost the most</a> this week, with a 10.75% decrease. Instadapp also lost 9.59% in the past seven days. Ethereum&#x2019;s 814 different defi protocols account for <a href="https://defillama.com/chains">55.88%</a> of the market share at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, out of the $42.89 billion locked. Tron is the second largest blockchain in terms of TVL size, with a 12.25% market share. Ethereum and Tron are followed by Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arbitrum, and Polygon.</p>

<p>The three tokens that Robinhood decided to delist have experienced significant losses in terms of TVL over the past seven days. Solana lost the least, shedding 5.99% this week, while Polygon saw a loss of around 14.90%. Cardano&#x2019;s TVL in defi took the biggest hit, losing 32.57% in the last seven days.</p>
<p>If the smart contract token economy continues to lose value, the TVL in defi will follow suit and may fall below the $40 billion mark. However, since the crackdown on centralized crypto exchanges, there has been a significant increase in defi activity and decentralized exchange (dex) trade volumes. The largest dex by trade volume, Uniswap, has benefited the most from the influx of dex trades since the recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a>.</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) dropped markedly on Saturday, as traders continued to react to the token being delisted from the Robinhood platform.</p>
<p>Following a high of $0.3218 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD slipped to a bottom at $0.2304 to start the weekend.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) plunged below a floor at the 30.00 mark, entering oversold territory.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is currently tracking at 17.75.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> is currently trading at $0.2509, down 22% from yesterday&#x2019;s peak.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Additionally, polygon (MATIC) lost a significant amount of its value to start the weekend, nearing a one-year low in the process.</p>
<p>MATIC/USD sank to a bottom at $0.5605 on Saturday, as prices dropped by nearly 30% from yesterday&#x2019;s high.</p>
<p>As a result of this decline, the world&#x2019;s twelfth-largest cryptocurrency moved to its lowest point since last July.</p>

<p>Overall, the token is now down close to 40% in the last seven-days, after breaking out of a support point at $0.75.</p>
<p>This has also led to the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) extending a downwards crossover versus the 25-day (blue) MA.</p>
<p>Price strength is also deeply oversold with a reading of 16.22, which is an all-time low point.</p>

Sentiment in the market once again shifted, as traders liquidated their positions on the back of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x2019;s (SEC) crackdown on crypto. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> dropped below $1,800.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) started the weekend trading below $26,000, as traders continued to react to the fallout of the SEC&#x2019;s cryptocurrency crackdown.</p>
<p>The latest domino to fall came in the form of Robinhood, who moved to delist several altcoins from its platform, including solana and cardano.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to an intraday low of $25,502 in the news, which comes a day after price peaked at $26,770.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the latest downturn came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell towards a floor at 39.00</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking marginally above this point at 40.06.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has extended its downward cross versus its 25-day (blue) counterpart, putting further emphasis on the current bearish sentiment.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Bears were also present in ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), which dropped below the $1,800 level to start the weekend.</p>
<p>After climbing to a peak of $1,861.14 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,721 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move saw ethereum plunge to its weakest point since late April, breaking out of a floor at $1,730 in the process.</p>

<p>As a result of this shift in market momentum, the RSI also tailed off, dropping to its lowest level since March.</p>
<p>The index is currently at a reading below 40.00, which is close to oversold territory, and could act as a slight positive for bulls.</p>
<p>In the event price becomes more oversold, there is a good chance that longer term bulls could move to buy the dip.</p>

Private individuals will be provided access to its proprietary blockchain platform as early as this month, a top executive of the bank announced.</strong></p>
<h2>Sberbank to Open Digital Assets Platform to Private Individuals</h2>
<p>Retail investors will be able to transact with digital financial assets (DFAs) on the distributed ledger platform built by Sberbank by the end of the current quarter, according to the Deputy Chairman of the bank’s Board, Anatoly Popov.</p>
<p>“If we talk about individuals, then in the second quarter, in June, we believe this function will be open,” Popov said, quoted by the Tass news agency. They will have the opportunity to buy digital financial assets, sell them and exchange them for fiat, he detailed.</p>
<p>DFAs are a relatively new financial instrument for Russia which was regulated with the law “On Digital Financial Assets” in 2021. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, they have an issuing entity and represent tokenized traditional assets such as gold, for example.</p>

<p>The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has already authorized several operators of DFA platforms such as the tokenization service <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-token-issued-in-russia-to-facilitate-investments-in-palladium/">Atomyze</a>, the fintech company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-largest-digital-asset-deal-denominated-in-chinese-yuan/">Lighthouse</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-registers-another-digital-asset-issuer/">Masterchain</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-largest-private-bank-launches-digital-asset-platform/">Alfa-Bank</a>. <a href="https://www.sberbank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sberbank</a>, which is Russia’s biggest bank by assets, was added to the regulator’s register in March 2022. Last week, the bank <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/largest-russian-bank-sberbank-opens-developer-access-to-in-house-defi-platform/">opened access</a> to its in-house decentralized finance (defi) platform for developers.</p>
<p>Since it was licensed, Sberbank has issued DFAs for billions of rubles, Popov noted. In May, the CBR said it expects a significant growth in the Russian digital assets market. The forecast came after in a single month, April, seven DFA placements were made for a total of around 1 billion rubles ($13 million).</p>
<p>Russia has been taking steps to develop this regulated market but it’s yet to define the legal status of crypto assets like bitcoin. Several bills aiming to achieve that are now under review in parliament with sanctions pressures working in favor of legalizing crypto payments, at least in cross-border settlements, and regulating certain activities such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-miners-mint-crypto-worth-700-million-a-year-mining-bill-postponed/">crypto mining</a>.</p>

Reed Stark believes that &#8220;crypto trading platforms are high-risk, perilous, and inherently unsafe&#8221; and recommends investors exit all crypto exchanges.</strong></p>
<h2>Former SEC Enforcement Chief Tells Investors to Get Out of Crypto</h2>
<p>John Reed Stark, founder and former chief of the Office of Internet Enforcement of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has recently issued his opinions regarding the legal actions of the institution against <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, two cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>Stark, who has more than 19 years of <a href="https://www.johnreedstark.com/attorneys/john-reed-stark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration</a> with the SEC, stated this might be the start of a cryptocurrency regulatory &#8220;siege&#8221; that could reach other companies in the industry. Stark <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1666780985189433347?t=X2engoXwrtzmPVEuO9vJAA&amp;s=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get out of crypto platforms now, I can&#8217;t say it any plainer. I believe that we now know for certain that crypto trading platforms are under a U.S. regulatory/law enforcement siege which has only just begun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Stark clarified that, in his view, crypto trading platforms are &#8220;high-risk, perilous, and inherently unsafe,&#8221; declaring that the SEC is on the right track with its enforcement actions.</p>

<h2>Lack of SEC Registration</h2>
<p>Stark discussed how the lack of registration of these exchanges with the SEC limits the organization&#8217;s capacity for protecting crypto investors. This lack of registration has allowed crypto markets to operate without much supervision.</p>
<p>Stark detailed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With crypto trading platforms, the SEC lacks any sort of oversight and access — and has scant ability to detect, investigate and deter fraudulent conduct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coinbase and Binance have been charged with operating unregistered trading platforms; however, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong issued an answer to the SEC lawsuit, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-ceo-responds-to-sec-lawsuit-accusing-crypto-exchange-of-securities-law-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denying</a> the company could register its activities after having numerous conversations with the organization. Armstrong recently stated there was no &#8220;path to &#8216;come in and register&#8217; — we tried, repeatedly — so we don&#8217;t list securities.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the same way, lawmakers have also criticized the SEC&#8217;s stance on this issue, accusing it of failing the cryptocurrency industry. Senator Cynthia Lummis <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-cynthia-lummis-blasts-sec-actions-against-coinbase-explains-crypto-industry-is-being-pushed-offshore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that the SEC &#8220;failed to provide a path for digital asset exchanges to register,&#8221; and didn&#8217;t &#8220;provide adequate legal guidance on what differentiates a security from a commodity.&#8221;</p>
