<h2>Indian Government&#8217;s Cryptocurrency Awareness Campaign</h2>
<p>The Indian government is reportedly launching a first-of-its-kind crypto awareness campaign. It will be conducted by the Investor Protection and Education Fund Authority, a government body controlled by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.</p>
<p>A government official was quoted by ET as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The campaign will highlight that cryptocurrencies are not legal in India and there are also deep risks involved in such assets. Any investment where the people are being promised lucrative and assured returns, there is an element of high risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>The government of India has been working on a crypto policy <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-government-crypto-bill-supreme-court-hearing/">since 2019</a> but nothing has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-government-updates-parliament-on-cryptocurrency-bill-and-investigations-of-crypto-exchanges/">finalized</a>. Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government plans to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/india-to-discuss-crypto-during-g20-presidency-to-establish-tech-driven-regulatory-framework-says-finance-minister/">discuss</a> crypto regulations with the G20 members.</p>
<p>The Indian central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has long recommended a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-central-bank-rbi-favors-complete-crypto-ban-partial-ban-wont-work/">complete ban</a> on all cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, warning of their <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-central-bank-rbi-cryptocurrencies-are-a-clear-danger-financial-stability-risks-likely-to-grow/">potential</a> to destabilize the country&#8217;s monetary and fiscal stability. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das recently said the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indias-central-bank-chief-cryptocurrencies-will-cause-next-financial-crisis-if-theyre-not-banned/">next financial crisis</a> will come from cryptocurrencies if they are not prohibited. However, Sitharaman said both banning and regulating require <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-finance-minister-crypto-ban-regulation-effective-only-with-significant-international-collaboration/">international collaboration</a> to be effective.</p>
<p>Rajagopal Menon, vice president at Indian crypto exchange Wazirx, told The Hindu:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency investing can be a complex and risky endeavor as the category is extremely volatile and works round the clock. It is important for potential investors to thoroughly educate themselves before making any decision.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, some are concerned that the Indian government&#8217;s crypto campaign may paint cryptocurrencies in poor light, given that the Investor Protection and Education Fund Authority has conducted awareness campaigns on Ponzi schemes, chit funds, and dubious crowdfunding projects.</p>
<p>Vipul Kharbanda, a non-resident fellow at the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS), was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the government takes a heavy-handed approach and starts saying things like virtual currency is not legal in India, that will not be entirely true. People may presume incorrectly that it is illegal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both the Indian government and the central bank have said that cryptocurrency is<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/india-confirms-not-illegal-to-buy-or-sell-crypto-government-consult-widely-crypto-regulation/"> not illegal in India</a>.</p>
<p>Despite having no regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, the Indian government is taxing crypto income at 30% and has imposed a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on crypto transactions.</p>

He also shared why he became &#x201C;a gold bug&#x201D; and &#x201C;a silver nut.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki&#x2019;s 2023 Gold and Silver Price Predictions</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has shared his prediction on how high he thinks the prices of gold and silver will reach in 2023.</p>
<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Thurday:</p>
<blockquote><p>I predict silver going to $75 and gold to $3,800 in 2023.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained: &#x201C;I became a gold bug in 1972. I was a Marine pilot in Vietnam flying behind enemy lines hoping to buy gold at a discount because the mine was in enemy hands. Found out the price of gold is the same all over the world.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The famous author also shared how he got into silver in another tweet last week: &#x201C;I became a silver nut in 1964. I was looking at a dime and saw a copper tinge around the edge. I was only 17 but I knew we were being screwed via our money. Little did I know then that the U.S. government violated Gresham&#x2019;s Law which states fake money drives out gold and silver.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Last week, he warned investors that it may be the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-last-chance-to-buy-gold-and-silver-at-low-prices-says-stock-market-crash-will-send-them-higher/">last chance</a> for them to buy gold and silver at low prices. He expects the stock market to crash, sending the prices of gold and silver higher. At the time of writing, gold futures are trading at $1,835.30 while silver futures are $24.24.</p>

<p>Kiyosaki has said many times that he does not trust the Biden administration, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and Wall Street.</p>
<p>He expects the stock, bond, and real estate markets to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-stocks-bonds-real-estate-will-crash-as-fed-continues-rate-hikes-advises-buy-bitcoin-before-fed-pivot/">crash</a> as the Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates to fight inflation. He also believes that the U.S. dollar is &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-us-dollar-is-toast-citing-saudi-arabias-request-to-join-brics/">toast</a>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Besides gold and silver, Kiyosaki also recommends bitcoin. He recently said bitcoin investors will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-expects-bitcoin-investors-to-get-richer-when-fed-pivots-prints-trillions-of-dollars/">get richer</a> when the Federal Reserve pivots and prints trillions of &#x201C;fake&#x201D; dollars. The famous author also noted that he is a bitcoin investor, not a trader, so he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-im-a-bitcoin-investor-when-btc-hits-new-bottom-i-get-excited/">gets excited</a> when the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> hits a new bottom. On Saturday, he said he is buying more bitcoin, warning that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-buying-more-bitcoin-warns-sec-regulations-will-crush-most-cryptocurrencies/">crush</a> most other cryptocurrencies with its regulations.</p>

Its top executive explained the agency was obliged to do that by courts in the Islamic Republic, where unlicensed miners have been blamed for power shortages. </strong></p>
<h2>Authorities in Iran Give Confiscated Mining Rigs Back to Their Owners</h2>
<p>Iran’s Organization for Collection and Sale of State-Owned Property (OCSSOP) has started to return to miners some of the mining devices seized in raids on underground crypto farms. It was ordered to do so by Iranian courts, the English-language business daily Financial Tribune reported.</p>
<p>Quoted by the country’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, the head of the organization, Abdolmajid Eshtehadi, detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently, some 150,000 [units of] crypto mining equipment are held by the OCSSOP, a large part of which will be released following judicial rulings. Machines have already been returned.</p></blockquote>
<p>The official further elaborated that the Iran Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution Company (Tavanir) should come forward with proposals on how to make use of the mining hardware without causing damage to the national grid.</p>
<p>Iran legalized cryptocurrency mining in July, 2019, but has since <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-to-shut-down-crypto-mining-farms-amid-record-high-power-demand/">halted</a> authorized coin minting operations on several occasions, citing power shortages during the summer and winter months when electricity consumption spikes. It has also been cracking down on Iranians mining outside the law.</p>
<p>Companies that want to mine legally are required to obtain licenses and import permits from the Ministry of Industries, Mining and Trade. The devices must be approved by the Iran Standard Organization and miners are required to pay for electricity at export rates.</p>
<p>Crypto minting using natural gas or electricity meant for other purposes and consumers, is illegal in Iran. But underground mining installations powered by the cheaper, subsidized energy have been growing in number, avoiding the licensing that would force them to pay the much higher tariffs.</p>

<p>In the past couple of years, the state-run Tavanir has been cutting power supply to any identified illegal mining facilities, confiscating their equipment and fining their operators for damages to the national distribution network.</p>
<p>Since 2020, the utility has found and closed down 7,200 unauthorized crypto mining farms. In July of 2022, it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iranian-power-utility-tavanir-vows-severe-measures-against-unlicensed-crypto-miners/">vowed</a> to take severe measures against unlicensed crypto miners which, according to earlier estimates, had burned 3.84 trillion rials ($16.5 million) in subsidized electricity.</p>
<p>The release of the mining rigs comes despite a ban by the Prosecutor General’s Office on such moves until the Iranian parliament adopts legislation addressing the issue with illegal mining. In August, the government in Tehran <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iranian-government-approves-comprehensive-and-detailed-crypto-regulations/">approved</a> a set of comprehensive crypto regulations and in September started <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-starts-licensing-crypto-miners-under-new-regulatory-framework/">licensing</a> mining companies under the new regulatory framework.</p>

Satoshi&#x2019;s technology allows &#x201C;online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.&#x201D; Since Bitcoin was born it changed the financial system significantly, and it sparked an entire cryptocurrency economy worth more than $800 billion in value.</strong></p>
<h2>The History and Significance of Bitcoin&#x2019;s Genesis Block: 14 Years Later</h2>
<p>Today is the 14th anniversary of the <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transactions?q=block_id(0)">genesis block</a>, otherwise known as block zero, the first <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin</a> block that bootstrapped the network. Block zero is special because there are no ancestral blocks before it, and it was hardcoded into the software so it would have an official starting point and every node can validate the blockchain from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Because block zero is hardcoded, the coinbase reward of 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> stored within the first block can never be spent. The 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is stored in the Bitcoin address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa">1A1zP</a>&#x201D; and during the last 14 years, the address has seen a number of dust transactions sent to the wallet. This means that, at the time of writing, the Bitcoin address 1A1zP has 68.56 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in the wallet that can never be spent.</p>

<p>Another well known fact about block zero is the message <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshi-nakamoto-dropped-from-the-worlds-20th-richest-billionaire-to-the-79th-in-8-months/">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> encoded in the coinbase parameter. This special field can be used to include an arbitrary message in the block. The message said: &#x201C;The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.&#x201D; The message has been interpreted in a myriad of ways but mostly as a reference to the financial crisis and bank bailouts of 2008.</p>
<p>Bitcoin users can confirm the genesis block was the first block because unlike every other block introduced to the system, it does not have a previous block to reference. The hash of where the previous block is supposed to be referenced is encoded with all zeros to indicate it is null. All the blocks that followed block zero contain a hash of the previous block header, which connects the blocks into a chain.</p>
<p>A lot of people do not know that after block zero, Bitcoin block one was not mined until six days later on Jan. 9, 2009, at approximately 9:54 p.m. (ET). Block two was mined a minute later at 9:55 p.m. and block three was mined roughly seven minutes later at 10:02 p.m. that evening. At this time, the following blocks started to have a more consistent block interval or time between each block.</p>
<p>Historical data shows that on Jan. 5, 2009, the network&#x2019;s total hashrate, presumably run by Satoshi alone, was roughly 948,165.4 hashes per second (H/s) or 948.1654 kilohash per second (KH/s). By Jan. 12, 2009, the Bitcoin hash rate was 560,000,000 H/s or 560 megahash per second (MH/s). It is very likely that by Jan. 10, 2009, when computer scientist Hal Finney <a href="https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988?s=20&t=5EC_rpbRmZHLi9qgFk1NWg">said</a> he was &#x201C;running Bitcoin,&#x201D; he likely mined his first block that day, contributing hash rate to the newly launched network.</p>

<p>Bitcoin changed everything because it introduced the first working solution to the Byzantine Generals&#x2019; Problem and it was the first working triple-entry bookkeeping scheme introduced to the world. The technology Satoshi developed cannot be manipulated on a whim like the monies central banks distribute to the lower echelon of banks and the world&#x2019;s policymakers.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a technology that provides uncensored transactions which allow for the free flow of ideas to grow. Amidst widespread deception by leaders and manipulation of currency, the demand for a secure, cryptography-based payment system resistant to censorship persists. The current monetary system has repeatedly been exploited by the global elite, making the need for such a system increasingly relevant.</p>

In the past four months, the value of both coins has dropped by 94.8% to 98.4% in U.S. dollars.</strong></p>
<h2>PoW Ethereum Forks Ethereumpow and Ethereumfair Suffer Significant Value Loss After Launch</h2>
<p>Since their launch in September 2022, the two newly introduced Ethereum forks that use a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm have seen significant value loss. Ethereum itself made the transition from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS) on Sept. 15, 2022, known as &#x201C;The Merge.&#x201D; Since then, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> has dropped 25.62% in value, falling from $1,635 per coin to $1,216.</p>
<p>The two forks that followed Ethereum&#x2019;s transition to PoS have performed poorly, losing 94.8% to 98.4% in value since then. Ethereumpow (ETHW) is currently trading at $3.08 per unit, down from its all-time high of $58.54 on September 3, 2022. ETHW&#x2019;s price was calculated before the chain was live, as some exchanges offered IOU markets before the fork.</p>

<p>In addition to its 94.8% loss in value in U.S. dollars, ETHW has also fallen 19.8% in the past month. However, over the past two weeks, ETHW has seen some improvement, climbing 4.3% in value. As of Jan. 3, 2023, ETHW is ranked 94th among the top 100 tokens in terms of market capitalization, with an overall market valuation of around $326.40 million.</p>
<p>In addition to its price decline over the past four months, the network&#x2019;s hashrate has fallen from 68.17 terahash per second (TH/s) to 16.99 TH/s, a loss of 75.07% since The Merge took place. The top two mining pools for ETHW currently are F2pool and 2miners. Ethereumfair (ETHF) is a lesser-known Ethereum fork, and it is not assigned a rank on coingecko.com.</p>
<p>On Jan. 3, 2023, it was ranked 2,736th among the 22,174 tokens listed on coinmarketcap.com. ETHF has declined 98.4% since its all-time high of $20.59 on September 16, 2022. It has seen $657,438 in global trade volume over the past 24 hours, with Gate.io as the top exchange in terms of ETHF trading volume.</p>

<p>Over the past four months, there has been little mention of these Ethereum forks, and Google Trends data shows a significant decrease in interest since &#x201C;The Merge.&#x201D; The search term &#x201C;Ethereum Fork&#x201D; had a score of 100 the week of Sept. 11-17, 2022, but has now dropped to a four.</p>
<p>The same trend is seen for the search term &#x201C;ETHW,&#x201D; which also hit a 100 during that week, but is now barely holding on to a score of four. Conversations about these forks are also low on Twitter and forums like Reddit. The declining price and lack of interest suggest that these two new proof-of-work <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> forks are slowly losing relevance.</p>

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) was one of the notable gainers on Tuesday, as the token climbed by as much as 8% in the day.</p>
<p>Following a low of $11.05 on Monday, SOL/USD surged to an intraday peak of $12.02 during today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move saw solana rise for a fifth straight day, hitting its highest point since December 23 in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, Tuesday&#x2019;s surge comes as SOL moved beyond a ceiling of $11.80, with the relative strength index (RSI) also nearing a resistance point.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 50.83, which is moving towards a major ceiling at the 53.00 mark.</p>
<p>This level hasn&#x2019;t been hit since November 6, when solana was trading above the $30.00 level.</p>

<h2>Cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a>)</h2>
<p>In addition to solana, cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a>) was also in the green in today&#x2019;s session, with price climbing for a third straight day.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a>/USD raced to a high of $10.22 on Tuesday, which comes less than a day after trading at a low of $9.77.</p>
<p>This surge in price has pushed cosmos to its highest point since December 10, with it now nearing a key resistance level also.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, this ceiling is at the $10.50 level, which was last hit on December 5.</p>
<p>Recent moves in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a> have come as the 10-day (red) moving average, crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>This typically is a sign of current and upcoming bullish sentiment, which could see cosmos bulls attempt to take price above $11.00.</p>

In the letter, Winklevoss claimed that DCG owes $1.675 billion to Genesis. Silbert, however, responded on social media, denying the claim.</strong></p>
<h2>Gemini Co-Founder Publishes Open Letter to DCG Chief Executive Barry Silbert Demanding He Resolves Liquidity Issues by Jan. 8, 2023</h2>
<p>Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1609913051427524608?s=20">shared</a> an open letter on Twitter on Monday in hopes to get Digital Currency Group (DCG) CEO Barry Silbert’s attention. Winklevoss says in the letter that he wrote it on behalf of 340,000 Gemini Earn users. “These users are not just numbers on a spreadsheet, they are real people,” Winklevoss declared. Basically, Gemini offered Earn users as much as 8% interest on specific digital assets and it managed to do so because Genesis Global Capital’s lending arm was a key partner.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Earn Update: An Open Letter to <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BarrySilbert</a> <a href="https://t.co/kouAviTho4">pic.twitter.com/kouAviTho4</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1609913051427524608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, the FTX contagion spread to Genesis, a creditor in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, and the company’s lending unit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-genesis-global-tradings-lending-unit-suspends-withdrawals-and-new-loan-originations/">halted</a> withdrawals and loan originations in mid-Nov. 2022. While Genesis was a key partner for Gemini’s Earn product, it too <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/an-important-message-regarding-gemini-earn">paused withdrawals</a> the same week. Then the Financial Times (FT) published a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-genesis-owes-gemini-customers-900-million-exchange-is-attempting-to-recoup-assets/">report</a> that alleged Genesis owed Gemini Earn users $900 million. Gemini also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-forms-creditors-committee-with-houlihan-lokey-to-resolve-genesis-liquidity-issues/">formed</a> a creditors committee to retrieve the funds from Genesis with Houlihan Lokey as a financial advisor.</p>
<p>Additionally, upset customers are preparing a potential <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-28/gemini-winklevoss-twins-sued-for-fraud-over-interest-accounts">class action lawsuit</a> against Gemini that alleges the exchange of defrauding customers with a bad deal. In the open letter, Winklevoss claims that his team tried to solve the issue with Silbert on multiple occasions and on Dec. 25, 2022. The letter says that the issue is a mess &#8220;entirely of your own making,” as Winklevoss accuses DCG of owing Genesis $1.675 billion.</p>
<p>“Every time we ask you for tangible engagement, you hide behind lawyers, investment bankers, and process,” the Gemini co-founder explained in the letter. Winklevoss further insisted that the funds were used to “fuel greedy share buybacks, illiquid venture investments, and kamikaze Grayscale NAV trades.” The Gemini co-founder further added:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s not lost on us that you’ve been working desperately to try and firewall DCG from the problems that you created at Genesis. You should dispense with this fiction because we all know what you know — that DCG and Genesis are beyond commingled.</p></blockquote>
<p>After Winklevoss published his tweet, the DCG CEO responded to the claims that were made. “DCG did not borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis,” Silbert <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert/status/1609926715454771200?s=20">tweeted</a>. “DCG has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding; next loan maturity is May 2023. DCG delivered to Genesis and your advisors a proposal on December 29th and has not received any response.”</p>

<p>Winklevoss then <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1609944270315868160?s=20">asked</a> the DCG executive if he would “commit to solving this by January 8th in a manner that treats the $1.1 billion promissory note as $1.1 billion.” Silbert did not respond to Winklevoss’ final tweet about committing to a resolution by that day. The open letter to Silbert also demands that the issue gets resolved by Jan. 8, 2022.</p>
<p>The DCG executive’s last tweet on Dec. 19, 2022, <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert/status/1604837519224639488?s=20">shared an article</a> about the DCG subsidiary Grayscale Investments possibly providing investors <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-grayscales-bitcoin-etf-dreams-fail-firm-may-try-a-tender-offer-ceo-says-11671428078?st=6rg38r50crm996b">with a tender offer</a> if the Bitcoin Trust’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) goals failed. In that specific tweet, someone asked Silbert how he was doing, and the DCG CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert/status/1604838646443806720?s=20">responded</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking forward to getting this year behind us.</p></blockquote>

The central bank also warned currency speculators that it will take steps to end activities that undermine the stability of the exchange rate.</strong></p>
<h2>Currency Collapse Worsens the Plight of Syrians</h2>
<p>The Syrian central bank said on Jan. 2 that it has adjusted the official exchange rate from 3,015 pounds for every dollar, to 4,522. Yet, despite the nearly 50% devaluation, the new official exchange rate is reportedly still more than 40% higher than the parallel market rate of 6,500 pounds per dollar, a Reuters report has said.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/syria-weakens-official-exchange-rate-2023-01-02/">report</a>, the collapse of the Syrian pound, which traded at 47 to the U.S. dollar before the 2011 protests against Bashar al-Assad’s government, has seen the prices of goods go up. Rising prices have in turn worsened the plight of Syrian residents who have had to contend with shortages of basics like fuel and electricity.</p>
<p>In addition to the ongoing civil war, Syria continues to reel from the effects of Western sanctions as well as the financial meltdown in neighboring Lebanon. The loss of oil-producing territories located in the country’s northeast has worsened the government&#8217;s financial situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Warning to Speculators and Currency Manipulators</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in a <a href="https://www.cb.gov.sy/index.php?page=show&amp;ex=2&amp;dir=items&amp;lang=1&amp;ser=3&amp;cat_id=1698">statement</a> issued on Jan. 2, the Syrian central bank said it is prepared to take steps that would restore confidence in the local currency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Central Bank of Syria continues to monitor the stability of the exchange rate in the local market, take all possible means and measures to restore balance to the Syrian pound, and follow up and deal with all illegal operations that undermine the stability of the exchange rate,&#8221; a statement on the central bank’s website said.</p>
<p>The bank also promised to intervene by taking steps that would help end speculative activities and the manipulation of foreign exchange markets.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) edged closer to the $17,000 level on Tuesday, as traders turned their attention to Wednesday&#x2019;s FOMC minutes report.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD hit a high of $16,760.45 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $16,666.92.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s activity saw bitcoin near a breakout of a long-term resistance level of $16,800, as market volatility remains high following the New Year&#x2019;s celebration.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, Tuesday&#x2019;s move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) approached a resistance level of its own.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at 47.18, which is marginally below its point of resistance at the 48.00 mark.</p>
<p>This ceiling seems to be the main hurdle stopping price from extending gains, and moving above the $17,000 zone.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) mostly consolidated on Tuesday, with prices continuing to trade above the $1,200 point.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,212.49 to start the year, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit a peak of $1,219.86 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s move, ethereum moved closer to a resistance level of $1,230, which has been in place since December 16.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, ethereum was unable to recapture this ceiling, as the RSI of 14 days failed to break out of a resistance at 49.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 48.90, with bulls remaining close to this point ahead of tomorrow&#x2019;s FOMC report, which could be the trigger to a potential price surge.</p>
<p>After tomorrow&#x2019;s report, attention will turn to Friday&#x2019;s U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP), which could also be a catalyst for market moves.</p>

Certik noted that the combined incidents amounted to $62.2 million “lost to exploits, hacks, and scams.”</strong></p>
<h2>Record Low Cyber Attacks in December 2022 Result in $62.2 Million in Losses</h2>
<p>On Dec. 31, 2022, <a href="https://www.certik.com">Certik </a><a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1609135671679062017?s=20&amp;t=v-XDmSDWvtwyTNzCh0KhVw">tweeted</a> that the last month of the year saw the least amount of exploits, hacks, and scams. All the incidents combined added up to roughly $62.2 million, and Certik noted it was the &#8220;lowest monthly figure&#8221; of the year.</p>
<p>Certik detailed that exit scams accounted for $15.5 million, and flashloan attacks represented $7.6 million. The largest flashloan attack came from the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hacker-steals-6-9-million-from-arbitrum-based-defi-protocol-lodestar-finance/">Lodestar exploit</a>, and the largest exit scam was Defrost Finance.</p>
<p>The following day, on Jan. 1, 2023, Certik <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1609489226596229121?s=20&amp;t=aoqS9zYsZ9JlEokPgruSig">said</a> that the exploits, hacks, and scams from the previous month stemmed from &#8220;23 major attacks.&#8221; The largest incident that occurred was the Helio Protocol and stablecoin attack.</p>

<p>Despite the 23 occurrences that saw $62.2 million lost, the month prior, in Nov. 2022, Certik <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1598315990923747328?s=20&amp;t=jdOzFHusCJRUguyk-WyjMQ">explained</a> that there were &#8220;36 major attacks&#8221; that amounted to $595 million lost. The largest incident in Nov. 2022 was the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-reportedly-hacked-as-telegram-group-admin-comments-on-possible-malware-present-in-apps-irregular-fund-movements-registered-onchain/">FTX hack</a>, which took place the same day the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$477 million was stolen during the FTX hack, and the second-largest incident in Nov. 2022 was Deribit&#8217;s </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-options-giant-deribit-loses-28-million-in-hot-wallet-hack/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loss of $28 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. 2022 saw a record number of hacks, and the slowdown in Dec. 2022 was a welcome relief for many. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to statistics, besides the FTX hack in Nov. 2022, the largest hacks included Binance Smart Chain&#8217;s </span><a href="https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/attack-mints-569-million-worth-of-bnb-tokens-in-bsc-bridge-exploit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">token hub exploit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which saw the loss of $569 million, the </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/axie-infinity-loses-620-million-after-hacker-compromised-ronin-validators/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ronin bridge breach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which saw $540 million drained, and the </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wormhole-networks-cross-chain-bridge-exploited-for-over-250-million-in-ethereum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wormhole exploit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which saw $326 million stolen. </span></p>
<p>On Dec. 15, 2022, Elliptic <a href="https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/top-five-defi-crime-trends-of-2022/">noted</a> that roughly $2.7 billion was siphoned from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Blockchain security firm Peckshield estimated that there was $1.55 billion taken from defi protocols in 2021.</p>
