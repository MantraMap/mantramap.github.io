										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Users of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-to-be-arraigned-jan-3-2023-solanas-founders-battle-to-suppress-ftxs-stain-on-sol-token/">FTX</a> who were caught up in the shocking collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange might finally hear some good news from the Bahamas.</p>
<p>The Bahamas&#8217; Securities Commission (SCB)<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/30/bahamas-regulator-seized-3point5-billion-of-ftx-crypto-assets.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1672404801"> announced</a> on Thursday that it has successfully preserved $3.5 billion in cryptocurrency linked to its local affiliate, FTX Digital Markets (FTXDM), the organization behind Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s international platform.</p>
<p>The Commission <a href="https://www.scb.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCB-seeks-court-direction-Press-Release-29Dec22-Final.pdf">stated</a> that it perceived dangers to the platform&#8217;s surviving digital assets after FTX was subject to cyberattacks before declaring bankruptcy in November. With the aid of infrastructure start-up Fireblocks, it was able to get a court order to protect the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>At the time of the transfer on November 12, market prices were used to determine the worth of the remaining assets. Since then, the cryptocurrency markets have remained largely stable.</p>
<p>The assets will be kept by the Commission until the Supreme Court instructs it to distribute them to creditors. Although its legal authority to do so is still in question, it has now asked for permission to disclose information about the assets in FTX&#8217;s US-based bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>The Bahamas&#8217; Securities Commission (SCB) said it will:</p>
<blockquote><p>“continue to conduct a comprehensive and diligent investigation into the causes of FTX’s failure, act in accordance with directions issued by the Supreme Court of The Bahamas, collaborate with other supervisory authorities, and take such further actions as needed to preserve the assets of FTXDM and to safeguard the interests of customers and creditors of FTXDM.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Per reports, the Department of Justice is investigating the hacking event that resulted in the unauthorized withdrawal of approximately $500 million in cryptocurrency from FTX&#8217;s functioning hot wallets.</p>
<p>According to lawyers, the top 50 FTX companies owe between 100,000 and one million debtors&#8217; money, totaling $3.1 billion. FTX claims that <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-charged-with-eight-criminal-offenses/">Bankman-Fried</a> stole billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency and transferred it to the trading unit Alameda Research, which ultimately lost the money by employing dangerous market tactics.</p>
<p>Last week, Bankman-Fried was extradited from The Bahamas to the US, where he will now be prosecuted on an enormous eight-count indictment that includes fraud and conspiracy allegations. Gary Wang, the chief technical officer of Alameda Research, and Caroline Ellison, the company&#8217;s CEO, have already entered guilty pleas to related crimes.</p>
<p>While he waits for his trial, Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest at his parent&#8217;s house in California. A $250 million bond backed by the mansion was signed, and a US Magistrate Court granted him bail.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/shib-price-analysis-how-will-shib-price-fare-as-2022-ends-19-4-million-shib-burned-at-once-with-burn-rate-up-107/">SHIB/USD</a> initially traded higher the prior day but retreated around $0.00000828. While pulling down, bears emerged as traders focused on levels around $0.00000800. To begin investigating the bearish scenario, a substantial decline below $0.00000790 is required. The pair may continue to fall, with pessimistic traders looking for a goal around $0.00000700.<br /><br />Subsequent growth from $0.00000800 might be viewed as the next phase of growth inside a long-term consolidation trend. Further increases are expected as long as the $0.00000800 support is maintained. Meanwhile, a strong breakout of $0.00000885 would demonstrate that the bounce from $0.00000712 is still on, bringing the bounce back into focus.</p>
<h4>SHIB/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63737 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-30.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-30.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-30-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-30-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-30-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-30-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SHIBUSD-4-Hour-Dec-30-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">SHIB/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The SHIB/USD intraday bias is turning positive as consolidation from $0.00000779 continues. Continuous progress is expected until a minor support level of $0.00000800 is sustained. However, only a rise over the relative strength index (RSI) midline of 50 would reverse the neutral to bearish picture.<br /><br />A break of the minor resistance zone at the 4-hour moving average (MA 50) at $0.00000820 should result in a retest of the upper level of $0.00000950. A sustained breach of the minor support level at $0.00000800, on the other hand, would extend the correction with another drop to $0.00000700.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to Reuters, FTX Cofounder Sam Bankman-Fried is scheduled to enter a plea next week in response to criminal charges that he misled investors and stole billions of dollars in client funds at his bankrupt FTX bitcoin exchange.<br /><br />According to court records, the 30-year-old is scheduled to be arraigned before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan federal court on the afternoon of January 3, 2023.<br /><br />On Tuesday, Kaplan was assigned to the case after the original judge recused herself because her husband&#8217;s law firm counseled FTX prior to its collapse.<br /><br />Bankman-Fried was released on a $250 million bond on December 22 and ordered to live with his parents in Palo Alto, California, where they both teach at Stanford Law School. He is being monitored electronically.<br /><br />On November 11, FTX filed for bankruptcy. On December 13, its new CEO, John Ray, told Congress that the exchange had lost $8 billion in customer funds while being operated by &#8220;grossly incompetent, unsophisticated employees.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Solana’s Founders Fight To Remove FTX’s Stain on SOL Token</h2>
<p>SOL, Solana&#8217;s crypto token, has dropped 96% from its all-time high of $260 in November 2021 to about $10, harmed first by a year-long crypto rout that swept the whole market and then by FTX&#8217;s decline. <br /><br />SOL fell as much as 12% on Wednesday alone, owing to fears that significant holders are selling the token, which serves as the basic cryptocurrency for financial transactions on the blockchain.<br /><br />The token&#8217;s decline can be interpreted as a sign of losing faith in the entire platform, which once had a market value of about $80 billion and is now worth a fraction of that.<br /><br />Solana, the blockchain network originally championed by Sam Bankman-Fried, is attracting a lot of attention as industry watchers question if its former ties to the disgraced crypto billionaire and his now-defunct FTX business will harm its future.Its founders are trying everything possible to break that link.</p>
<p>Prior to FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried&#8217;s arrest in December on several fraud charges, the former crypto kingmaker was a vocal proponent of Solana, a blockchain marketed as a speedier and more efficient alternative to the market-leading Ethereum network.<br /><br />Bankman-Fried has even spoken at conferences and virtual fireside talks alongside Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko.<br /><br />The Solana Foundation stated in its November blog post that it had less than $1 million in cash or cash equivalents on FTX.com as of Nov. 6, when the crypto exchange suspended withdrawals, and that it did not know how FTX and Alameda&#8217;s assets would be settled during bankruptcy proceedings. <br /><br />Still, following FTX’s collapse, some crypto projects are leaving the Solana network, which has also experienced multiple outages in the last year. DeGods and y00ts, two well-known NFT projects on Solana, are switching to Ethereum and Polygon, respectively.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/turkeys-new-economic-roadmap-includes-central-bank-digital-currency/">Turkey&#8217;s central bank</a> announced Thursday that the first payment transactions on the Digital Turkish Lira Network had been completed successfully as part of preliminary research.<br /><br />The Fed will continue to conduct <em>&#8220;limited, closed-circuit pilot tests&#8221;</em> in the first quarter of 2023. As the advanced phases of the pilot project are revealed, it wants to expand the Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform to select banks and financial technology firms.<br /><br />The bank said in a<a href="https://www.tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/EN/TCMB+EN/Main+Menu/Announcements/Press+Releases/2022/ANO2022-55"> statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Will continue to run tests for authentic architectural setups designed in areas such as the use of distributed ledger technologies in payment systems and the integration of these technologies with instant payment systems,&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bank also stated that during 2023, studies on the Digital Turkish Lira&#8217;s economic and legal foundation as well as its technological requirements will be given top priority.<br /><br />India, Kazakhstan, and other nations are also aiming toward central bank digital currencies.<br /><br />Earlier this year, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/us-federal-reserve-board-member-hints-at-dlt-research-with-focus-on-cbdc/">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> released a report outlining the advantages and disadvantages of CBDCs, and the European Central Bank is considering ways to incorporate decentralized ledger technology into current payment settlement systems.</p>

<p>According to a new emergency motion filed in federal court, Coinbase <a href="https://twitter.com/skye_witley/status/1608235756597936128?s=46&amp;t=SohrjdvHf-psfQMCvj9pow">clients</a> are refusing to release their account information, stalling progress toward moving their claim to arbitration.

Coinbase requested a hearing in response to the latest emergency motion.<br /><br />The lawsuit claims that Coinbase failed to secure its users&#8217; accounts, leaving them vulnerable to theft and unlawful transfers. It also accused Coinbase of causing financial harm to users by locking them out of their accounts, either permanently or temporarily, as well as failing to comply with federal requirements by listing securities on its trading platform.<br /><br />The dispute has laid bare previously unknown vulnerabilities with cryptocurrency firms&#8217; inadequate cybersecurity practices. The crypto exchange has previously filed various arbitration cases with the United States Supreme Court.</p>

<li>Expectations abound for a possible crypto recovery in 2023</li>
<li>At the time of writing, Tezos (XTZ) is down 2.00% in 24 hours at $0.740</li>
<li>Binance US has announced that its customers will now be able to stake Tezos (XTZ) and earn up to 7% APY at inception</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/three-catalysts-that-might-propel-shib-in-2023-helium-migrating-to-solana-in-q1-next-year/">year 2022</a> is drawing to a close. Following a bearish year all around, expectations abound for a possible crypto recovery in 2023. At the time of writing, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xtz-price-analysis-striking-rally-holds-back-beneath-4-43-on-xtz-usd-tezos-q2-growth-remains-positive-on-etoro/">Tezos (XTZ)</a> is down 2.00% in 24 hours at $0.740. Binance US, a subsidiary of the Binance crypto exchange, has announced that its customers will now be able to stake Tezos (XTZ) and earn up to 7% APY at inception. Customers would now be able to buy, sell, convert, or stake XTZ in minutes on Binance US, a major staking provider. Also, advanced trading is available on the XTZ/USD, XTZ/BUSD, and XTZ/BTC pairs. XTZ is the native asset of the Tezos network. The token is required to participate in the blockchain’s proof of stake consensus mechanism, pay transaction fees, or participate in governance, and is also used as a unit of exchange across the network. While Tezos has a similar target audience as Ethereum, the network sets itself apart via its consensus mechanism and its self-amendment capabilities, which allow the network to implement major upgrades without the need for a hard fork. Like Ethereum, the Tezos network can be used to create a token, dApps, games, and NFT projects.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $2.00, $1.50, $1.00<br />Support Levels: $0.725, $0.45, $0.30</p>
<h4>XTZ/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63720 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">XTZ/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xtz-price-analysis-amid-crypto-market-slump-xtz-usd-upswings-to-3-07-on-tezos-kalamint-mainnet-launch/">XTZ/USD</a> declined as low as $0.726, suggesting that some selling occurred beneath the consolidative floor of $0.80. The RSI has yet to show any signs of improvement as it approaches 25. In the upcoming sessions, it&#8217;s important to pay special attention to how the moving averages are converging. It will be encouraging for the XTZ/USD pair if the MA 50 bearish stance wanes.<br /><br />However, if the price gains momentum and breaks through the convergent barrier of the MAs at approximately $1.0, early upside restrictions could develop from the $1.15 level before the $1.50 level, which marks the consolidation&#8217;s ceiling. XTZ&#8217;s price could move in the direction of the resistance band of $1.50-$2.00 if this barrier is broken. Otherwise, bears could test sellers’ efforts to steer XTZ&#8217;s price back lower.</p>
<h4>XTZ/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63721 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XTZUSD-Daily-Dec-29-1-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">XTZ/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>XTZ/USD 4-Hour chart might return to the upside on oversold RSI, where the price can try to reach the MA 50 at the $0.785 resistance zone, which if broken would pave the way for the $0.800 level. If investors choose to keep dumping off the asset below the current price at $0.739, support might then move in the direction of the $0.720 range before reaching the $0.700 level.<br /><br />However, near the MA 50, at the $0.785 level, a bullish reversal may find instant support. The $0.800-$0.850 range, marked by the most recent consolidation, could represent the next objective if these bears fail to swing lower. Overall, if positive price activity is unable to sustain an ascent past the moving averages, XTZ&#8217;s consolidation pattern might continue.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/kraken-exchange-ceo-jesse-powell-to-step-down-from-his-official-role/">Kraken</a> will discontinue operations in Japan on January 31, just one month after laying off 30% of its employees. According to a <a href="https://blog.kraken.com/post/16923/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E6%9A%97%E5%8F%B7%E8%B3%87%E7%94%A3%E4%BA%A4%E6%8F%9B%E6%A5%AD%E3%81%AE%E5%BB%83%E6%AD%A2%E3%81%AE%E3%81%8A%E7%9F%A5%E3%82%89%E3%81%9B/">blog post</a> by the firm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Current market conditions in Japan in combination with a weak crypto market globally mean the resources needed to further grow our business in Japan aren’t justified at this time,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The decision is part of Kraken’s efforts to prioritize resources and investments in those areas that align with our strategy and will best position Kraken for long term success.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kraken has decided to leave Japan. The crypto exchange will suspend operations, one month after laying off 30% of its personnel. Kraken stated that it is fully funded and that all concerned clients can withdraw money as soon as possible. Users can withdraw their crypto assets to a third-party wallet or liquidate their funds and move them to a domestic bank account.</p>
<p><em>The firm disclosed:</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Funds currently staked with Kraken can be unstaked and transferred or converted as desired,&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;Kraken will soon be distributing additional info regarding the ETH unstaking process shortly.&#8221;</em><br /><br />From 2014 to 2018, the same subsidiary firm operated in Japan until withdrawing in April 2018 to better focus its resources on expansion in <em>&#8220;other geographical areas.&#8221;</em> Exchange volumes, like <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cryptocurrency-market-recoups-1-trillion-mark-as-btc-surpasses-24000/">cryptocurrency</a> values, have been declining since 2021.<br /><br />The subsidiary decided to relaunch with a headquarters in Tokyo in October 2020, offering spot trading on five key assets with intentions to expand. The second iteration has already concluded, with Kraken promising that all affected clients would be able to withdraw their cash from the exchange by January 31, 2023, at the latest.</p>

This puts their total number of coins held at around 132,500, with a cumulative purchase price of nearly $4 billion and an average cost per coin of around $30,000.<br /><br />Notably, the corporation also sold 704 bitcoins on December 22 at a loss of around $11.8 million to receive a tax benefit. This is the company&#8217;s first Bitcoin transaction and it comes after former CEO Michael Saylor stated earlier this year that <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/microstrategy-posts-3-4-billion-losses-on-btc-holdings-here-is-what-to-know-about-the-progress-of-doge-1-to-the-moon/">MicroStrategy</a> would never sell its stock.<br /><br />In August 2020, MicroStrategy began <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/microstrategy-bitcoin-never-sell-5-bln-crypto-stash-michael-saylor-2022-1">investing</a> in Bitcoin for the first time. MicroStrategy indicated at the time that it sees Bitcoin as a reliable store of value that is more suited to conserving wealth over time than cash and other financial alternatives. <br /><br />Furthermore, they believed that the continued development of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-and-altcoins-j-p-morgan-gives-an-indication-of-what-the-second-half-of-2022-might-hold-for-cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a> could generate larger returns than more traditional investments such as government bonds and stocks.<br /><br />Also regarded as a triumph, MicroStrategy suffered a massive failure with its large Bitcoin bet in 2022. The firm is now sitting on $1 billion in Bitcoin-related paper losses. Saylor, as previously reported, stepped down as CEO of the firm in August. Even though his gamble backfired, he remains a staunch supporter of Bitcoin.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ada-price-analysis-how-high-will-the-new-robinhood-listing-and-upcoming-vasil-fork-take-cardano-ada-price/">Cardano (ADA)</a> trades at $0.252, down 1.61% in the last 24 hours. On-chain analytics firm Messari has issued a study highlighting Cardano&#8217;s accomplishments in 2022. Cardano hosts nearly 8,000 NFT projects and 15 marketplaces, yet its monthly volume is only around $6.8 million. In the third quarter of 2022, JPG.Store attained over 90% of the market share. The top collection in space, SpaceBudz, has done over 40 million ADA in volume. In June 2022, IOG released the Cardano EVM Sidechain in alpha, allowing Solidity developers to quickly transfer apps into the Cardano ecosystem. Despite a late entry into the DeFi space, Cardano&#8217;s TVL is ranked 30th. Cardano&#8217;s expanding ecosystem comprises DEXs, lending and borrowing protocols, decentralized stablecoin providers, and any other necessary DeFi infrastructure. The DeFi ecosystem has Minswap, WingRiders, and SundaeSwap with 52%, 20%, and 19% of market share dominance, respectively. According to Santiment data, Cardano ranks as the foremost blockchain in terms of development activity in the last 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.385, $0.300, $0.275<br />Support Levels: $0.250, $0.200, $0.150</p>
<h4>ADA/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63706 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ADA/USD Daily Chart </span></em></h6>
<p>Following its continuous consolidation along the low of $0.25, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ada-price-analysis-cardano-touts-massive-on-chain-growth-in-2022-whats-next-for-ada-price/">ADA/USD</a> pair has struggled to raise bids above $0.275. The break below the psychological level of $0.30 led buyers to flee, exacerbating pessimistic sentiment. In the event of a rebound, the $0.275 and $0.30 levels have now been designated as new areas of resistance.<br /><br />On the daily chart, a bearish moving average (MA 50) and moving average (MA 200) are forming, implying that the downward acceleration may not recede at the moment. The pair is headed for lows in the $0.20 support area. A rebound may occur as a result of an oversold relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<h4>ADA/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63707 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ADA/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The relative strength index is almost oversold on the 4-hours chart, which may pique the curiosity of buyers. The projected comeback in ADA/USD, on the other hand, may give trend followers opportunities to sell into strength. ADA/USD remains bearish below $0.30, falling below the 4-hour moving average (MA 50).<br /><br />If the bulls want another shot, they must break through the $0.30 barrier. A drop below $0.25 would trigger a new round of selling below the December support level of $0.247. If the pair breaks down, it might continue to fall toward the $0.20 level.</p>
