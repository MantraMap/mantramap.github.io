<p>Discover four cryptos that could help you build an explosive portfolio. Learn about NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Gala (GALA), Curve DAO (CRV), and Uwerx and why they could benefit your portfolio. Don't miss out on investing in these promising cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Crypto enthusiasts are constantly searching for the next digital asset that could deliver explosive returns on investments (ROI) for their portfolio. The best practice is to seek coins that have performed well in the past, like NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Gala (GALA), and Curve DAO (CRV).</p>
<p>However, new cryptos in their presale stage, like Uwerx, could also deliver explosive returns. Heading into the new week, here&rsquo;s why these four tokens could benefit your portfolio.</p>
<p>NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Delivering More Blockchain Scalability Than Ethereum (ETH)</p>
<p>NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is a smart-contract-enabled Layer-1 blockchain ecosystem that allows developers to develop and deploy dApps. Often listed among the rivals to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) aims to provide a faster and cheaper blockchain solution to Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p>However, users, developers, and investors are keener on the network because it promises faster throughput compared to other competitors. NEAR Protocol&rsquo;s (NEAR) throughput can go as high as 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). That is above Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Algorand (ALGO), which have 3,000 TPS, 4,500 TPS, and 6,000 TPS, respectively.</p>
<p>As a result of this keen interest, many analysts believe that the value of NEAR, the native utility token of the NEAR Protocol (NEAR), could hit $2.93 within Q4 2023.</p>
<p>GALA (GALA): Improving Gala Games User Experience</p>
<p>GALA (GALA) is the native utility coin for the Gala Games ecosystem. It is the primary token used to purchase NFT items and also the reward received by Founder&rsquo;s Node operators in exchange for running nodes. In addition, it is the gas token used to pay network fees on the Gala (GALA) network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focusing on GameFi and Web3, the intention of the developers of GALA Games is for GALA (GALA) to offer a viable and secure payment mode and settlement between participants interacting within the Gala Games ecosystem.</p>
<p>As a result, GALA (GALA) has been rising in value amid a wave of optimism thanks to the network's ongoing expansion and development. The ecosystem recently implemented the GALA token burn mechanism used whenever customers make purchases on the GALA (GALA) platform.</p>
<p>As of writing, GALA (GALA) had a daily increase of 3.72%. This data was obtained from CoinMarketCap. Currently trading at $0.035, priceprediction.net predicts the coin to reach $0.065 within Q1 2024.</p>
<p>Curve DAO (CRV): Powering Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</p>
<p>Curve DAO (CRV) is an Ethereum-based crypto that powers Curve Finance, a blockchain-based decentralized exchange (DEX) that leverages an automated market maker (AMM) system. The Curve protocol facilitates the exchange of various ERC-20 tokens while offering swap support for Ethereum-based Bitcoin (BTC) tokens and stablecoins like Dai (DAI). As a decentralized exchange that links users to exchanges with the best pricing, Curve provides low slippage rates and low costs for trading digital coins.</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX): Aiming To Disrupt The Gig Economy</p>
<p>Uwerx will likely be the future of the gig economy and freelancing. By bringing the power of blockchain technology and its unique features to the freelance industry, the InterFi Network and Solidproof audit-approved soon-to-launch project will revolutionize an already innovative industry.</p>
<p>For the presale, the revolutionary crypto project will accept up to 18 different cryptos as payment, improving payment flexibility. At the end of the presale, liquidity tokens of developers will be locked for 25 years to reinforce developers' commitment and investors' funds' security. Plus, the team will forfeit smart contract ownership of the project when taxes hit zero to give investors more assurance about the project and prevent rug pulls.</p>
<p>As a result, we strongly believe that WERX value can reach $1.20 in Q4 2023. So, why sit on the fence? Join the most exciting presale at $0.00995 before the price increase to $0.012 on Satuday and enjoy a 20% purchase bonus whilst your at it! An alpha version of the platform is also due to be unveiled within the current stage.&nbsp;</p>
