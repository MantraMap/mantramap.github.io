<p>As per the official page, the total liquidity for the pool is rapidly approaching $300,000. This development comes on the heels of Aave&#8217;s recent announcement of successfully launching GHO on the Ethereum mainnet. The Aave community initiated a formal governance proposal vote on July 14, approving the launch of the decentralized stablecoin GHO on the main network. The implementation is set to take place within one day.</p>



<p>Once the deployment is complete, users of Aave V3 on the Ethereum network will have the ability to utilize collateral to mint GHO. This integration allows Aave users to explore the benefits and utility of the decentralized stablecoin, expanding the ecosystem and opening up new avenues for lending, borrowing, and other DeFi activities.</p>



<p>The launch of the crvUSD/GHO liquidity pool on <a href="https://coincu.com/199515-convex-finance-review/">Curve</a> amplifies the accessibility and liquidity options for users interested in trading or providing liquidity for GHO. The pool&#8217;s presence within the Curve ecosystem enables users to seamlessly swap between crvUSD and GHO, enhancing efficiency and flexibility in their transactions.</p>

<p>Curve&#8217;s entry into the GHO ecosystem reflects the growing interest and adoption of decentralized stablecoins in the DeFi space. These stablecoins provide stability and security while offering the benefits of programmability and compatibility with other DeFi protocols.</p>



<p>As the integration between Curve and Aave&#8217;s GHO progresses, the DeFi community eagerly anticipates the potential impact and opportunities it will unlock for users. The seamless interaction between these platforms strengthens the overall DeFi ecosystem, paving the way for further innovation and financial empowerment.</p>



<p>In summary, the launch of the crvUSD/GHO liquidity pool on Curve, coupled with Aave&#8217;s successful introduction of GHO, represents a significant milestone in the realm of decentralized stablecoins. This collaboration offers users enhanced trading and liquidity opportunities while expanding the utility and reach of GHO within the DeFi landscape.</p>

<p>DeSantis, a United States presidential candidate, voiced his opposition to the possibility of a digital dollar during an interview with former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson. During the interview, he <a href="https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1680194644301295619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declared</a> CBDCs as a &#8220;threat to American liberty&#8221; and vowed to thwart any attempt by the <a href="https://coincu.com/185134-federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-25bps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Federal Reserve</a> to launch a digital currency.</p>



<p>DeSantis reiterated his stance during a speech at the Family Leadership Summit on July 14, promising to ban CBDCs in the U.S. if elected president. He firmly stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;If I am the president, on day one, we will nix central bank digital currency. Done. Dead. Not happening in this country.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The event, held in Iowa, featured several other Republican candidates and sparked discussions about the future of money, technological advancements, and the role of governments in the financial system.</p>

<p>The governor of Florida has been a vocal opponent of <a href="https://coincu.com/202558-retail-and-wholesale-cbdcs-see-big-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBDCs</a>, previously passing a bill in May that prohibits the use of federal CBDCs as money and bans the use of foreign CBDCs. DeSantis argued that such digital currencies would lead to a &#8220;massive transfer of power from consumers to a central authority.&#8221; His latest remarks reinforce his firm stance against CBDCs and his determination to protect the interests and freedoms of American citizens.</p>



<p>Central bank digital currencies are digital versions of traditional fiat currencies issued and regulated by central banks. They aim to bring the conveniences of digital assets while raising concerns within the crypto community. Opponents of CBDCs argue that they threaten privacy rights and could lead to absolute government control. However, proponents see them as tools to boost adoption and explore blockchain technology&#8217;s global use cases.</p>

<p>While the US Federal Reserve currently has no immediate plans to issue a digital dollar, the topic has gained attention in the lead-up to the 2024 elections. More candidates are discussing crypto-related topics during their early campaigns, reflecting the growing importance of digital currencies and their potential impact on the financial landscape. It remains to be seen how the stance on CBDCs will evolve and whether DeSantis&#8217; pledge to ban them resonates with voters.</p>

<p>At the heart of zkSync lies its innovative zero-knowledge rollup (ZK-rollup) technology. This advanced solution enables faster and more cost-effective transactions, all while maintaining the robust security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. Developed by Matter Labs, the project has continuously evolved to meet the growing needs of the Ethereum ecosystem. It first introduced zkSync 1.0 in June 2020, followed by the launch of the 2.0 in late 2022, with a full mainnet deployment planned for 2023.</p>



<p>zkSync&#8217;s rebranding to <a href="https://coincu.com/176169-zksync-era-mainnet-alpha-launched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zkSync Era</a> in February 2023 brought forth a renewed focus on its zkEVM technology. zkEVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible ZK tech, enabling the implementation of zero-knowledge proof computations for scaling Ethereum smart contracts. With zkEVM, developers gain the flexibility to write ZK-compatible smart contracts using the widely adopted Solidity language while benefiting from the enhanced scalability and privacy offered by the project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Aave launches GHO on Ethereum mainnet, enabling users to mint the decentralized stablecoin.</em></li>



<li><em>GHO is governed by the Aave DAO, ensuring transparency and community-driven decision-making.</em></li>



<li><em>GHO introduces innovative features like collateralized borrowing, productive collateral, and multi-collateral support, revolutionizing the decentralized finance ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant development for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, Aave has <a href="https://aave.mirror.xyz/t7qcU668gSp9teT_SBhJb9_AVcbv8kpzvd0IpP39lBw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the successful launch of GHO on the Ethereum mainnet. This marks a significant milestone for the Aave protocol and its community, as GHO aims to become a decentralized stablecoin that empowers users and fosters a people-powered financial ecosystem.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1040.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1040-1024x512.png" alt="Aave Unleashes GHO, The Groundbreaking Decentralized Stablecoin Redefining DeFi" class="wp-image-203081" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1040-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1040-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1040-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1040-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1040-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1040-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1040.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aave Unleashes GHO, The Revolutionary Decentralized Stablecoin Redefining DeFi 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>The journey towards the creation of GHO began over two years ago when the community recognized the need for an <a href="https://coincu.com/192940-aave-proposes-launching-gho-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aave</a>-native decentralized and overcollateralized stablecoin. The objective was to provide users with a stable and reliable payment layer within the rapidly evolving Web3 landscape. Stablecoins, with their reduced price volatility, offer a promising solution for consumers and merchants seeking to embrace digital currencies for day-to-day transactions.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/201480-aave-dao-to-launch-gho-on-through-v3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GHO</a>, like the Aave protocol itself, is governed by the DAO. The DAO plays a pivotal role in setting the rules and policies that govern GHO, ensuring a transparent and community-driven approach. Community members can propose changes, which are openly discussed within the community before being put to a vote. This democratic governance process allows participants to actively shape the future of GHO.</p>



<p>One of the key features of GHO is its fixed underlying mechanics and policies. Unlike traditional centralized stablecoins, GHO operates through self-executing smart contracts, making it more resistant to arbitrary changes by centralized entities or individuals. Additionally, all GHO transactions are published and auditable directly from the blockchain or through various user interfaces, ensuring transparency and accountability.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1042.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1042-1024x576.png" alt="Aave Unleashes GHO, The Groundbreaking Decentralized Stablecoin Redefining DeFi" class="wp-image-203083" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1042-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1042-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1042-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1042-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1042.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aave Unleashes GHO, The Revolutionary Decentralized Stablecoin Redefining DeFi 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>To facilitate the minting of GHO, the DAO has introduced the concept of facilitators. These facilitators are approved and governed by the Governance, and their role is to mint GHO based on predetermined conditions set by the DAO. The first facilitator is the Aave V3 market on Ethereum, which allows users to mint GHO against collateral held in V3. This market incorporates robust risk mitigation features such as e-mode, isolation mode, and supply caps. Initially, the minting capacity of this facilitator is set at $100 million, with the possibility of updates pending governance approval.</p>



<p>In addition to the Aave V3 market, the Aave DAO has also approved a second facilitator called the Flashminting Facilitator. This facilitator enables the minting of GHO up to a preset cap without encumbering collateral, provided that the borrowing and repayment of GHO occur within the same block on the Ethereum Mainnet. This innovative feature enhances the efficiency and flexibility of GHO minting for users.</p>



<p>GHO is a native stablecoin of the protocol, and it can be minted using a wide range of collateral assets available on the V3 market. This multi-collateral approach ensures that GHO remains diversified and resilient, backed by a multitude of assets. Furthermore, one unique aspect of GHO is that the collateral deposited into the Aave V3 protocol continues to earn yield, effectively reducing the cost of borrowing GHO for users.</p>

<p>In terms of the economic model, the interest paid on GHO borrows will be directed to the Aave DAO Treasury. This provides an additional incentive for users to stake AAVE tokens in the Aave Safety Module, as stakers will be able to mint GHO at a discounted rate. This alignment of interests encourages participation and contributes to the overall stability and sustainability of the Aave ecosystem.</p>



<p>The successful launch of GHO on the Ethereum mainnet represents a significant step forward for Aave and the broader DeFi industry. By providing a decentralized stablecoin and a people-powered financial ecosystem, Aave continues to demonstrate its commitment to transparency, accessibility, and innovation in the world of decentralized finance. As GHO gains traction and adoption, it is expected to play a pivotal role in expanding the use cases of cryptocurrencies and driving the mainstream adoption of DeFi.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Representative Eeon intervenes in the Binance securities lawsuit, claiming inadequate representation for customers.</em></li>



<li><em>Eeon argues for cryptocurrencies to be deemed commodities, not securities, due to personal use.</em></li>



<li><em>Eeon seeks resumption of withdrawals, access to frozen assets, and compensation for withheld funds, accusing Binance and SEC of misconduct.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a surprising development, a representative named &#8220;Eeon&#8221; has come forward to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.90.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intervene</a> in a securities lawsuit involving the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1038.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1038-1024x683.png" alt="Representative Emerges In Binance Lawsuit And Advocating For Customers&#039; Interests" class="wp-image-203075" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1038-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1038-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1038-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1038-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1038-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1038.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Representative Emerges In Binance Lawsuit And Advocating For Customers&#039; Interests 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>Eeon claims to speak on behalf of Binance clients, arguing that their interests were not adequately considered in a recent court decision that labeled them as &#8220;Customers&#8221; in an order issued on June 17, 2023.</p>



<p>According to documents filed with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Eeon asserts that both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance&#8217;s legal representatives have failed to adequately represent the exchange&#8217;s customers. As a result, Eeon seeks to provide representation to safeguard their interests in the ongoing legal proceedings.</p>



<p>Highlighting the court&#8217;s recognition of them as &#8220;Customers,&#8221; Eeon states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We are not ordinary customers; rather, we are stakeholders, investors and owners of cryptocurrency held by Binance and its subsidiaries. We firmly believe that our interests were not adequately considered.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eeon&#8217;s argument revolves around the classification of cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than securities. The representative contends that digital assets are primarily used for personal and household purposes rather than commercial activities, thus warranting a different regulatory approach. Eeon also points out the absence of specific regulations for cryptocurrencies, which limits the <a href="https://coincu.com/203024-us-sec-coinbase-listing-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a>&#8216;s jurisdiction over these assets.</p>



<p>The legal matter at hand stems from the indictments filed against Binance by the SEC on June 5. Eeon&#8217;s intervention specifically relates to the SEC&#8217;s attempt to restrict Binance&#8217;s access to U.S. funds through a consent order issued on June 17. Although the exchange and the SEC have settled the dispute, Eeon intends to appeal the ruling, aiming to address several concerns.</p>

<p>Eeon raises objections to <a href="https://coincu.com/202996-binance-fired-1000-people-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>&#8216;s control over users&#8217; <a href="https://coincu.com/202702-bitcoin-31700-market-excited-ripples-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) keys and the prevention of user withdrawals. Notably, U.S. authorities had imposed restrictions on customer withdrawals of U.S. dollars, which began around June 13.</p>



<p>Eeon&#8217;s objectives, as outlined in the filings, encompass multiple facets. The representative primarily seeks the resumption of routine withdrawals for all Binance customers in the United States unless the SEC can provide evidence to the contrary. Eeon emphasizes the importance of avoiding a wholesale sell-off of assets, which could potentially disrupt the Bitcoin market significantly.</p>



<p>The representative further alleges that Binance exercises control over customers&#8217; crypto assets by blocking access and withdrawals without adequate notice. Moreover, Eeon accuses the SEC of exacerbating the situation for investors instead of safeguarding their interests, including wrongly accusing customers of money laundering activities. Eeon requests a court order granting customers access to their frozen assets on the platforms.</p>



<p>In a counterclaim, Eeon seeks compensation from both Binance and the SEC equivalent to 20% of the daily value of withheld funds per customer, amounting to $1000 per day. Additionally, both Binance and the SEC would be jointly responsible for paying penalties, with $500 assigned to each party.</p>



<p>Eeon&#8217;s intervention and the concerns raised by impacted clients introduce a new layer of complexity to the ongoing legal proceedings. The responses of the exchange, the SEC, and the court to these demands and accusations remain uncertain as the case continues to unfold.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Liquity announces the launch of its V2, offering leverage and lending for ETH holders.</em></li>



<li><em>The V2 introduces a reserve-backed stablecoin model using staked ETH.</em></li>



<li><em>The protocol allows interest-free borrowing with a lower collateral ratio than other platforms.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Liquity, the decentralized lending platform, has <a href="https://twitter.com/LiquityProtocol/status/1680129816668807170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> an exciting announcement regarding the upcoming launch of Liquity V2. This new version of the platform is set to provide Ethereum (ETH) holders with attractive leverage and lending products, further expanding on the existing offerings of the protocol.</strong></h5>

<p>The release of Liquity V2 is scheduled for public availability in 2024 and introduces a novel reserve-backed stablecoin model that utilizes staked ETH.</p>



<p>As a borrowing protocol, Liquity enables users to participate in interest-free lending. Through the protocol, users can borrow LUSD stablecoin by locking their Ethereum with a minimum collateral ratio of 110%. One notable feature of the platform is its requirement of a lower collateral rate compared to similar platforms like Maker, which often demand collateral rates of up to 150%. This aspect makes Liquity an appealing option for users seeking efficient and accessible lending solutions.</p>



<p>Liquity operates on the concept of collateralized debt positions (CDPs) known as &#8220;Troves.&#8221; Each Trove is mandated to maintain a minimum collateral rate of 110%, ensuring the safety and stability of the protocol. In the event that the collateral ratio of certain assets falls below 100%, liquidation becomes necessary to cover the outstanding debt.</p>



<p>The platform implements instant liquidation through a dual token mechanism involving LQTY and LUSD, combined with a Stability Pool. These measures aim to safeguard the protocol and its users during periods of strong market dumps, mitigating risks and enhancing overall security.</p>



<p>A key aspect of Liquity&#8217;s strategy is to ensure platform stability and foster a collaborative ecosystem. Similar to the approach taken by Serum Dex, the platform allows other parties to host the Liquity Graphical User Interface (GUI). In return, these hosts receive incentives based on the number of user accounts they attract. This approach encourages partnerships and promotes wider adoption of the protocol.</p>



<p>In recent news, Liquity&#8217;s native token, LQTY, experienced a significant surge of over 115% following <a href="https://coincu.com/202599-ripple-wins-against-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple&#8217;s initial victory</a> in its legal battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development has drawn considerable attention within the crypto community, highlighting Liquity&#8217;s growing prominence and the increasing interest in its innovative lending protocol. As the platform prepares for the launch of V2, it continues to garner momentum and position itself as a leading decentralized lending solution within the blockchain ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Aave tests Linea mainnet deployment for potential collaboration and expansion.</em></li>



<li><em>Benefits for Aave include access to a large user base and enhanced user experience through ConsenSys&#8217; product suite.</em></li>



<li><em>Collaboration aims to drive Aave&#8217;s growth, increase adoption, and strengthen its position in the DeFi market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant development for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, Aave, a prominent lending protocol, has put forth a <a href="https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-v3-deployment-on-linea-mainnet/14010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposal</a> to establish a formal line of communication regarding a potential deployment on the Linea mainnet.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-1024x573.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-1024x573.png" alt="Aave Wants To Launch V3 On Linea For Mainnet Deployment" class="wp-image-203060" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-1024x573.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-300x168.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-768x430.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-1536x859.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-750x419.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-1140x638.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033.png 1788w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aave Wants To Launch V3 On Linea For Mainnet Deployment 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>The proposal aims to gather community feedback and insights as Aave explores the possibility of an &#8220;MVP&#8221; (Minimum Viable Product) mainnet deployment following a successful testnet deployment on Linea.</p>



<p>The collaboration between Aave and Linea, a scalable Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum&#8217;s zkEVM technology incubated by ConsenSys, holds immense potential for both projects. Linea, with over 5 years of internal cryptography advancement and 20 months of dedicated research and development, aims to extend Ethereum&#8217;s capabilities while prioritizing user experience and on-chain resources. It has forged strong relationships with industry leaders such as MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle, enabling seamless integration and accessibility.</p>



<p>The motivation behind the protocol&#8217;s exploration of a mainnet deployment on Linea stems from Linea&#8217;s ability to leverage the distribution channels created by ConsenSys&#8217; product suite. By tapping into MetaMask&#8217;s extensive community of 30+ million monthly active users, Linea offers Aave v3 a unique opportunity to reach a broader audience and enhance user convenience. The proposed integration encompasses various product offerings, including on/off ramps, MetaBridge, MetaMask Swaps, the Portfolio dApp, and the MetaMask SDK, providing numerous avenues for incorporating the protocol.</p>



<p>Several key benefits await the protocol with a potential mainnet deployment on Linea. Firstly, the establishment of <a href="https://coincu.com/201480-aave-dao-to-launch-gho-on-through-v3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aave v3</a> markets and the integration of GHO (Aave&#8217;s governance token) on Linea would open up a vast and well-established user base of over 30 million users across the ConsenSys product suite. This strategic alignment would facilitate smoother distribution and adoption of the protocol&#8217;s markets and $GHO, ultimately contributing to the protocol&#8217;s growth and visibility. Furthermore, Aave would have the distinction of being a Linea launch partner, gaining access to ConsenSys&#8217; extensive marketing initiatives, partner highlights, and increased presence throughout the year.</p>

<p>To ensure transparency and community involvement, the Linea team is actively exploring options for incentives, such as contributions to Aave&#8217;s Safety module and sequencer rebates for the protocol. While specific details are yet to be finalized, the Linea community can expect updates on these incentives as the proposal develops further in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this proposal is not final and will be updated as technical implementation strategies and recommendations become available. The protocol intends to develop the proposal transparently, allowing for insights and recommendations gained from ongoing testnet deployments to shape the final plan. While no fixed timeline has been announced, the team anticipates progressing discussions to subsequent stages of governance by mid-to-late August.</p>

<p>As the Aave community and Linea collaborate on this exciting initiative, the proposal holds immense potential for the expansion and solidification as a leading DeFi protocol. The integration with Linea&#8217;s scalable Layer 2 solution, coupled with ConsenSys&#8217; distribution channels and Linea&#8217;s commitment to decentralization, opens new avenues for growth, user engagement, and market share capture.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a notable move, Ark Invest, the investment management firm led by prominent Bitcoin advocate Cathie Wood, has <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/07/33238734/cathie-wood-amasses-25-4m-worth-of-social-media-giant-meta-but-dumps-this-crypto-li" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> strategic decisions regarding its holdings in Coinbase (COIN), Meta Platforms (META), and Robinhood Markets (HOOD).

<p>According to data, Ark Invest sold 478,000 shares of Coinbase on July 14, amounting to approximately $53 million. This sale comes as Coinbase&#8217;s stock price reached a year-to-date high of $114.43. The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) sold 263,000 shares, the Ark Internet ETF (ARKW) sold 93,000 shares, and the Ark FinTech ETF (ARKF) sold 36,000 shares. This marks the second time this week that Ark Invest has offloaded its Coinbase holdings, having previously sold 135,000 shares on July 11.</p>

<p>Despite the recent sale, Coinbase&#8217;s stock has demonstrated substantial gains, surging 33% during the week and reaching a remarkable 213% increase year-to-date. However, on Friday, the stock closed at $105.31, experiencing a slight decline of 1.58% as investors opted to book profits. The surge in price was influenced by positive developments in the ongoing US SEC v. Ripple lawsuit, which had a positive impact on various crypto-related stocks.</p>



<p>On a different note, Ark Invest&#8217;s funds have been actively involved in other investments. The firm purchased shares of Meta Platforms and Robinhood. Notably, Ark Invest started acquiring Meta Platforms shares in June after the company announced the launch of its Twitter-like social media app called &#8220;Threads.&#8221; The ARK Innovation ETF acquired 69,793 shares of META, while the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF purchased 111,843 shares of Robinhood. The ARK Next Generation Internet ETF added 12,559 shares of META and 169,116 shares of Robinhood to its portfolio.</p>



<p>The closing price of META shares on Friday stood at $308.87, representing a nearly 5% increase for the week. On the other hand, Robinhood&#8217;s stock price witnessed a 13% surge during the week, closing at $12.38 on Friday.</p>



<p>Ark previously <a href="https://coincu.com/201934-cathie-woods-ark-invest-cuts-coinbase-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced</a> its holdings in Coinbase on a day when the stock rose 9.8% following a Chicago Board Options Exchange filing, fueled speculation about the likely US approval of a Bitcoin ETF. Although remaining a significant shareholder, Wood&#8217;s fund&#8217;s reduction in holdings may convey to other investors the possibility of profiting from the share&#8217;s climb this year.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://coincu.com/198667-ark-invest-blackrock-locked-in-showdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ark Invest</a> has been accumulating Coinbase shares during periods of market volatility and regulatory challenges in the crypto industry, its recent decision to sell some of its holdings could signal an opportunity for investors to secure profits following the stock&#8217;s substantial rally this year. Despite regulatory scrutiny and legal battles faced by Coinbase, its stock has shown impressive growth, appreciating by over 150% year-to-date. Likewise, Ark Invest&#8217;s flagship fund has performed well, boasting a 51% gain in 2022, surpassing the gains of the Nasdaq 100 Index and the S&amp;P 500. It is worth noting that the Ark Innovation ETF experienced a significant decline of 67% in 2021.</p>



<p>Ark Invest&#8217;s investment decisions, particularly regarding <a href="https://coincu.com/203024-us-sec-coinbase-listing-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>, Meta Platforms, and Robinhood, reflect the firm&#8217;s active management approach and its strategy to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of the digital asset market. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, investors and market participants eagerly await further moves and insights from Cathie Wood and Ark Invest.</p>

<p>By minting a profile in NFT form, following other users, and collecting publications, users can build their social presence. The project, funded by FTX Ventures, aims to provide users with greater control over their profiles and how they monetize them.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/193278-lens-protocol-raises-15-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lens Protocol</a> is currently testing an invitation system within its ecosystem. Early joiners have been granted the right to invite new users, and if the test results are positive, the invitation system will be expanded to allow more community members to invite friends to join. This approach aims to foster community growth and engagement within the Lens social ecology.</p>



<p>In the past seven days, the floor price of Lens Protocol Profiles NFT has <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/lens-protocol-profiles/analytics?tab=items" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experienced</a> a significant drop of over 60%, possibly due to the recent launch of the test invitation system. Some users may have sold their NFTs out of concern or anticipation of changes within the ecosystem.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/176251-coinbase-wallet-review-great-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase Wallet</a>, one of the leading self-custody crypto wallets, is also making strides in enhancing user interaction. It is launching a direct messaging feature that enables users to communicate with each other through the platform.</p>



<p>Initially, this messaging capability will be available to the Lens protocol community, and users can gain access through the QR codes of active users. Each inbox is linked to a single wallet address, allowing users with multiple crypto wallet addresses to have multiple inboxes on Coinbase Wallet.</p>



<p>The integration of direct messaging within crypto wallets holds great potential for the crypto ecosystem. It eliminates the need for third-party messaging platforms and streamlines communication between users. This development marks a significant step towards enhancing user experience and convenience within the crypto space.</p>

<p>Despite recent fears about the demise of NFTs, a remarkable transaction involving Bored Ape #1734 garnered immense attention. The NFT sold for a staggering 600 ETH, equivalent to over $1.2 million, on July 13. This significant sale has sparked hope that NFTs are making a comeback.</p>



<p>The BAYC collection experienced an impressive 8% increase in floor price, climbing up daily rankings. Just weeks ago, the collection faced a significant drop in floor prices, leading many to question the future of NFTs. However, the recent surge in price indicates a potential resurgence.</p>



<p>While the floor price surge is encouraging, the <a href="https://coincu.com/202762-bayc-announces-apefest-in-hong-kong-nov-3-5/">BAYC</a> collection has experienced a decline in volume and sales. Both indicators dropped by a substantial 91% and 92%, respectively, suggesting a more subdued market for the collection in recent times.</p>

<p>However, data from DappRadar reveals positive signs for the BAYC collection. It has emerged as a frontrunner among NFT collections based on daily metrics. The average price has surged by an impressive 80%, indicating increased value. Market capitalization has risen by nearly 5%, reflecting growing investor interest. Transaction volume has also experienced significant growth, with a rate of over 82%.</p>



<p>The recent sale of Bored Ape #1734 stands out as the highest recorded sale in the past 30 days across all NFT collections, generating anticipation for a potential positive trend in the BAYC collection and the wider NFT space.</p>



<p>As the market continues to unfold, the coming weeks will shed light on whether this record-breaking sale will ignite a sustained upward trajectory for the BAYC collection and serve as a catalyst for the revival of the NFT market as a whole.</p>
