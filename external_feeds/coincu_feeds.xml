<p>900 people are working for the Ethereum studio in New York City.

<p>With U.S. exchange Coinbase announcing cutbacks of 20% of its personnel, or<strong> approximately 950 positions</strong>, on Tuesday, it&#8217;s compounding what has already been a horrible week for crypto employment. Since April of last year, the industry has shed, according to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/10/ethereum-software-firm-consensys-to-cut-upwards-of-100-staff-as-crypto-bear-market-takes-another-casualty/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/10/ethereum-software-firm-consensys-to-cut-upwards-of-100-staff-as-crypto-bear-market-takes-another-casualty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk, </a><strong>close to 27,000 employees.</strong></p>

While it is always painful to part ways with our fellow colleagues, there was no way to reduce our expenses significantly enough, without considering changes to headcount.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The exact number of employees that could be laid off is not precise, as the reductions have yet to be finalized, the source told CoinDesk.</p>

<p>Users will have until January 31 to withdraw or swap USDT for any other money, according to the statement. All USDT balances will automatically convert to Circle&#8217;s USDC stablecoin if this is not done.</p>



<p>It has been reported by<strong> Reddit user zoomercoomer9000</strong> that Canadian regulators issued a statement in late December prohibiting cryptocurrency exchanges from enabling Canadian consumers to trade cryptocurrencies that &#8220;are itself a security and derivative.&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“As a result of this ongoing work, the CSA is of the view that stablecoins, or stablecoin arrangements, may constitute securities and/or derivatives. Crypto trading platforms that are registered or that have entered into a pre-registration undertaking are reminded that they are prohibited from permitting Canadian clients to trade, or obtain exposure to, any crypto asset that is itself a security and/or a derivative.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The delisting of USDT in Canada was viewed by many users as a preview of what might occur internationally if officials in other nations decide to fight cryptocurrencies with stricter laws.</p>



<p>Others countered that the delisting was due to<strong> Crypto.com positive Com&#8217;s relationship with Circle, the company that issued USDC, and that the whole thing was a &#8220;business transaction&#8221; to stifle competition. </strong>Precisely the same as what Binance did to USDC.</p>



<p>Tether has a somewhat murky background, according to user zoomercoomer9000, who also added that they previously lied about their 1:1 peg to the US dollar and withheld their affiliation with Bitfinex until it was revealed in the Paradise Papers.</p>

<p>Other commenters claimed that Canadians now have fewer options for earning interest on their money, which makes the delisting of USDT &#8220;a significant problem for Canadians.&#8221;</p>



<p>While most individuals disapproved of Crypto.com&#8217;s conduct, <strong>some said that restrictions are necessary for cryptocurrency spread and for significant firms to enter the ecosystem.</strong></p>



<p>Although Crypto.Com has not yet released a formal statement on the subject, it has told other media outlets about the move. Additionally, they did not specify whether this prohibition was in effect temporarily or permanently. Therefore, it must be regarded as in force until further notice.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Huobi Global, a cryptocurrency exchange with its headquarters in Seychelles, has been having issues for a while, which has resulted in it losing a sizable portion of the market. </em></li>



<li><em>Huobi was the most significant loser of the crypto bear market, according to the most recent report by data source Kaiko, as its market share dropped from 22% in 2020 to a meager 4% by 2022&#8217;s end.</em></li>

<h5><strong>Huobi Global, a cryptocurrency exchange with its headquarters in Seychelles, has been having issues for a while, which has resulted in it losing a sizable portion of the market. </strong></h5>

<p>The business has drawn criticism for, among other things, purportedly closing off internal communication and feedback channels and withdrawing several employee benefits. Competing businesses are also a threat to its market share.</p>



<p>Huobi was the most significant loser of the crypto bear market, according to the most recent report by data source Kaiko, as its market share <strong>dropped from 22% in 2020 to a meager 4% by 2022&#8217;s end.</strong> Additionally, Huobi&#8217;s quarterly earnings decreased by about 98% since 2021 Q2.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The FTX empire&#8217;s dramatic collapse left the crypto sector in disarray, and the community is on guard against other negative occurrences involving other prominent players. Huobi is the most recent company to experience a confidence issue.</p>



<p>It saw token outflows of more than<strong> $100 million in the past week alone amid insolvency worries.</strong> To increase confidence, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron and a significant shareholder in the cryptocurrency exchange, shifted USDC and USDT worth about $100 million from Binance to Huobi.</p>

<p>To put things in perspective, USDD, which was released by the Tron DAO Reserve, intends to control the value of stablecoins that are printed on the TRX blockchain.</p>



<p>The depeg was triggered by the FTX collapse, and since then, it has continued to hover below the $1 mark.</p>



<p>Despite <strong>USDD being claimed to be backed with a collateral ratio of over 200% in combination with Tron, Bitcoin, USDC, and USDT, it has failed to regain its peg. </strong>At the time of writing, USDD was trading around $0.97.</p>



<p>Kaiko’s research stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“When looking at USDD-USDT order books, which is the highest volume trading pair, we can observe that market depth on the bid and ask side has been persistently imbalanced since early December.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Additionally, <strong>it was discovered that the ratio of bids to asks had been below 1 for the majority of the previous month, a pattern that indicated intense selling pressure that was bringing the price down. </strong>Since the beginning of the year, the ratio has somewhat improved, and the bid/ask ratio has risen over 1, indicating that more bids have been placed on order books.</p>



<p>Only in the event of a change in order book structure will the existing sentiment change. USDD can still reclaim its peg, according to Kaiko&#8217;s research. Huobi, on the other hand, continues to confront an <strong>&#8220;uphill challenge in regaining market share,&#8221;</strong> therefore, this isn&#8217;t the case for them.</p>

<p><strong>BitDAO</strong> created the optimistic rollup known as <strong>Mantle</strong>. It employs a modular structure, where the essential operations of a blockchain are carried out on specialized levels, with the goal of lowering costs and improving overall performance. With <strong>37,000 developers</strong> already signed up for the launch, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/158898-bitdao-second-largest-crypto-treasury/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitDAO</a> has opened the testnet.</p>



<p>Before the mainnet launch, which is slated for later in the year, <strong>Mantle</strong> will be able to test and build new features for the chain on the <strong>&#8220;Wadsley&#8221; testnet</strong>. The public can access the testnet, and developers are encouraged to sign up to test their applications on the network.</p>

<p><strong>BitDAO</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147809-bitdaos-layer-2-network-mantle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> Mantle in November as a <strong>modular</strong> <strong>Ethereum Layer 2 networ</strong>k. For handling network operations like a consensus, transaction execution, and settlement, modular networks contain different layers. They are a more recent iteration of the blockchain architecture, as opposed to earlier monolithic chains when all network operations took place on the same base layer.</p>



<p>The<strong> </strong>DAO reaffirmed that <strong>Mantle would provide quicker finality at lower transaction costs</strong>. The announcement also stated that<strong> multi-party computation</strong> would be used by the network. Nodes that are specifically intended to handle off-chain transactions are used in this form of processing.</p>



<p>One way Layer 2 networks function to reduce the risk associated with transactions carried out outside the base layer of a blockchain network is through multi-party computation.</p>

<p>In particular, the derivatives and&nbsp;margin trading crypto platform&nbsp;offer&nbsp;<strong>Leveraged ETFs&nbsp;(exchange-traded funds) focused on cryptocurrencies for 1,000+ assets</strong>, MX-DeFi for mining rewards from retained tokens, and a staking platform. In short, MEXC has one of the most feature-packed services. However, <strong>this list of services mainly targets professional users familiar with the crypto space and its offerings. </strong>As for beginners, the expansive list of trading products could be overwhelming.</p>



<h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" id="copy-trade-cryptocurrencies">Copy-Trade Cryptocurrencies</h3>



<p>Like the best social network and&nbsp;copy-trader platforms for crypto, MEXC has joined suit and enabled this service for its users. Individuals can find and&nbsp;<strong>copy the most profitable crypto traders</strong>&nbsp;on the MEXC platform and replicate their trades. The top traders can be filtered by their total PNL, win rate, total equity, or number of followers. While it is not as popular compared to eToro, which boasts a large number of social traders, it&#8217;s a helpful feature on MEXC for beginners. Although, the quality of the traders on the social platform is questionable, with data missing for some featured traders.</p>

<h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" id="leveraged-and-index-etfs">Leveraged and Index ETFs</h3>



<p>Another unique platform feature is the Leveraged ETFs service – an ETF trading targeted at cryptocurrencies. MEXC customers can trade over 1,000 digital currencies with up to&nbsp;<strong>5X leverage</strong>. This increases a user’s purchasing power and could also boost potential profit on a correct market prediction. Its Index ETFs allow investors to diversify their portfolios by investing in multiple assets. This includes the Grayscale Index, Major Crypto Index, and DSA Index, among others.</p>

<h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" id="demo-trading">Demo Trading</h3>



<p>MEXC has recently launched a testnet for its users to demo trade cryptocurrencies and experience the platform before funding an account with real funds. The practice account can be loaded with up to&nbsp;<strong>$50,000 USDT in virtual funds.</strong>&nbsp;The user interface mimics that live platform with real-time crypto prices and the ability to place orders and execute positions like normal. The demo mode can be toggled within the same platform, unlike other tenets for crypto, which require a separate login. To see how the MEXC demo account compares, read this article on the&nbsp;best free crypto demo accounts.</p>

<h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" id="0-trading-fees">0% Trading Fees</h3>



<p>Investors consider the trading fees charged by cryptocurrency exchanges before signing up.<strong> Naturally, traders seek platforms that provide excellent services and charge affordable fees so that profits can be maximized. </strong>Given this, most crypto exchanges charge incredibly low fees to attract investors.</p>



<p>MEXC differentiates itself from its competitors by offering&nbsp;<strong>no fees on the spot market.</strong>&nbsp;This is a promotion that applies to all spot trading pairs on MEXC. For instance, an individual can order to&nbsp;buy Bitcoin&nbsp;without paying any fees.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Its futures derivative trading also starts at a minimal transaction cost of only 0.02% and 0.06% for makers and takers, respectively, which is good value for money. For a list of other&nbsp;crypto exchanges that charge no fees, read this article next.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">MEXC Alternatives &amp; Comparisons</h2>



<p>MEXC has low trading fees, impressive crypto support, and wide investing options targeted at beginners and pro traders alike. <strong>While MEXC shows a substantial lineup of crypto assets, the platform has an average rating of 3 out of 5 on the third-party review platform TrustPilot. </strong>This is understandable, considering the issues that plague MEXC. The platform is not available to US traders, its basic trade option (the Quick Buy/Sell) is limited, and it lacks direct fiat withdrawals.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>2. Token of Crypto Exchange</strong></h2>



<p>As per MEXC exchange reviews, the platform is currently compatible solely with fiat currency via the P2P and Credit Trading (instant purchase) features. In general, the P2P function is compatible with a broad array of fiat currencies, viz. USD, CNY, EUR, GBP, etc.</p>



<h5>Supported Cryptocurrencies</h5>



<p><strong>Taking cryptocurrencies into account, MEXC is attuned to many cryptocurrencies:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>MX Token (MX)</li>



<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>



<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>



<li>Eos (EOS)</li>



<li>Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</li>



<li>Litecoin (LTC)</li>



<li>Ontology (ONT)</li>



<li>Tron (TRX)</li>



<li>Ripple (XRP)</li>



<li>Bitcoin SV (BSV)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Ethereum Classic (ETC)</li>



<li>Dogecoin (DOGE)</li>



<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>



<li>Dash (DASH)</li>



<li>Neo (NEO)</li>



<li>Chainlink (LINK)</li>



<li>Quantum (QTUM)</li>



<li>Polkadot (DOT)</li>



<li>VeChain (VET)</li>



<li>Stellar (XLM)</li>
</ul>



<p>MEXC trading has won spurs as the first centralized asset service provider supporting the most recent coins and tokens. As per this MEXC exchange review, MEXC Exchange is the ticket for those looking to bypass costly synthesized exchanges and gas fees.</p>



<p><strong>Taking into account the countries MEXC supports, it includes people from all over the world, with the exception of:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>North Korea</li>



<li>Cuba</li>



<li>Sudan</li>



<li>Syria</li>



<li>Iran</li>



<li>Yemen</li>



<li>Zimbabwe</li>



<li>Belarus</li>



<li>Iraq</li>



<li>Crimea</li>



<li>Congo</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Myanmar</li>



<li>Lebanon</li>



<li>Libya</li>



<li>Bolivia</li>



<li>Ecuador</li>



<li>&nbsp;Bangladesh</li>



<li>Somalia</li>



<li>The central African Republic</li>



<li>Kyrgyzstan</li>



<li>The United States</li>



<li>and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>3. Trade on Crypto Exchange</strong></h2>



<p>Much like most of the&nbsp;best trading apps for crypto, <strong>MEXC has a standalone mobile app. This is convenient for investors who are constantly moving and prefer trading from their mobile devices on a 24/7 basis.</strong> The MEXC is available for download on Android and iOS devices. The app offers the same trading experience as the web-based platform to&nbsp;seamlessly buy and sell crypto assets&nbsp;and&nbsp;monitor a portfolio&nbsp;with minimal effort. Mobile users also use in-app support to reach out to customer service for guidance which is a valuable feature.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>4. Pros and Cons of Crypto Exchange</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table has-medium-font-size"><table class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Second-to-none trading experience and platform.</td><td>&nbsp;Trading without margin.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Compatible with a broad array of cryptocurrencies.</td><td>&nbsp;Incompatible with fiat currencies.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Affordable trading fees.</td><td>&nbsp;Occurrences of user complaints.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Availability of a mobile app.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Cutting-edge security features.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Multiple payment methods.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>5. Competitors</strong></h2>



<p>MEXC takes the security of users’ funds quite seriously. New accounts are required to complete KYC and enable 2FA using the Google App authenticator. Once this is done, an anti-phishing code is set up alongside a withdrawal whitelist. Withdrawals are only permitted once the 2FA requirements are met.</p>



<p>Mobile&nbsp;number and email verification are also set up to improve the platform&#8217;s security. Alongside this, the platform&nbsp;<strong>s</strong>tores most of the crypto assets in a cold storage wallet, which is currently the safest means of securing crypto assets from cyberattacks.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>MEXC Exchange is the ideal platform for selling popular coins and tokens. As the first centralized exchange supporting the assets, it has achieved success in the market. Due to its comprehensive features, the platform is ideal for all types of traders.</p>



<p>The website&#8217;s poor English translation feature, which makes it challenging for English-speaking users to access the site, is one of its worrying aspects. The majority of customer support is provided by email, which is, by and large, a responsive, efficient, and convenient service to use. The site has been deemed safe in numerous reviews. Before making any kind of investment, this MEXC exchange review advises traders to read additional reviews about the site.</p>

<p><strong>A Genesis official issued a statement that the company &#8220;does not agree with all of Gemini&#8217;s claims&#8221;</strong> and expressed disappointment that Gemini is &#8220;conducting a public media campaign despite ongoing beneficial private dialogue between the parties.&#8221; The statement said, &#8220;We are dedicated to moving as quickly as possible, but this is a very complex process that will take additional time.</p>



<p>Following the bankruptcy of FTX, the loan division of cryptocurrency broker Genesis ceased customer withdrawals in November. It was locked up with customer money from Gemini Earn. Gemini Earn billed as an interest-earning account for bitcoin deposits, was introduced in February 2021, and genesis provided the yield investors in Gemini Earn got.</p>



<p>Gemini&#8217;s termination took effect on January 8. <strong>The firm had earlier given CEO Barry Silbert of DCG, Genesis&#8217; parent company, a deadline of January 2 in a public letter</strong>. Additionally, Silbert was charged in the letter with &#8220;engaging in bad faith stall tactics&#8221; during discussions.</p>



<p>As was updated in a previous Coincu News article, on January 10, <strong>Gemini co-founder Winklevoss wrote another public letter calling for the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159312-gemini-ceo-requests-fire-barry-silbert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decision to resign from Silbert</a> </strong>and accusing DCG and Genesis of committing crimes of accounting fraud. The fraud allegation resurfaced in a lawsuit Gemini filed in court that same day in response to a class action lawsuit brought by Gemini Earn customers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-629.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="636" height="382" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-629.png" alt="Gemini Has Ended Its Earn Program And Asks Genesis To Refund All Locked Assets" class="wp-image-159412" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-629.png 636w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-629-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" title="Gemini Has Ended Its Earn Program And Asks Genesis To Refund All Locked Assets 28"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Immediately after the resignation request was made, Silbert also wrote a letter to his shareholders to clarify the situation of DCG and Genesis. Still, <strong>there needed to be a mention of offering a solution to the increased debt of up to $900 million for Gemini.</strong></p>



<p>Customers had agreed to &#8220;arbitrate any claims related to the Gemini Earn program&#8221; and that plaintiffs&#8217; claims and causes of action &#8220;should not be tried in any venue Genesis is joined,&#8221; so Gemini further stated all claims in the lawsuit.</p>

<p>The decision was made in the midst of a national security investigation into Binance. Th<strong>e US that Voyager is attempting to accelerate</strong>.</p>



<p>Judge Michael Wiles permitted Voyager to sign the asset acquisition agreement and request creditor approval on January 10 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, but the sale won&#8217;t be complete until a subsequent court hearing, according to a Jan. 11 Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/voyager-seeks-expedite-national-security-review-binance-deal-2023-01-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>.</p>



<p>It happens when Voyager is trying to hasten the review of its request to sell assets to Binance. US, which can cause the agreement to be delayed or blocked.</p>



<p>During the court hearing, <strong>Voyager&#8217;s attorney Joshua Sussberg stated that the company has been responding to inquiries from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)</strong> and will address any issues the committee may have that could lead it to oppose the deal.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We are coordinating with Binance and their attorneys to not only deal with that inquiry, but to voluntarily submit an application to move this process along,&#8221; Sussberg said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>CFIUS is an interagency organization that assesses foreign investments in or acquisitions of American businesses for potential threats to national security.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">CFIUS finds that the transaction raises legitimate national security concerns</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="419" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1.jpeg" alt="Voyager Digital And Binance.US Acquisition Received Preliminary Approval Amidst National Security Investigation" class="wp-image-159405" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1.jpeg 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1-300x157.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1-768x402.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Voyager-And-Binance.US-Acquisition-Received-Preliminary-Approval-Amidst-National-Security-Investigation-1-750x393.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Voyager Digital And Binance.US Acquisition Received Preliminary Approval Amidst National Security Investigation 32"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>If CFIUS finds that the transaction raises legitimate national security concerns, it may prohibit or reverse the transaction or order the parties to make changes to allay the concerns.</p>



<p>On December 30, CFIUS notified the court that <strong>&#8220;one or more transactions anticipated&#8221; </strong>by Voyager may be the subject of a review, which might lead to delays or blockages.</p>



<p>The U.S. attorney&#8217;s office is apparently looking into Binance&#8217;s global operation amid allegations of money laundering, but Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, the CEO, has denied any wrongdoing. <strong>US has its main office in California and bills itself as &#8220;totally independent.</strong>&#8220;</p>



<p>Zhao is a Chinese-born citizen of Canada, and CFIUS is empowered to examine any transactions that potentially give a foreign person equity interest in or control over a U.S. company.</p>



<p>The <strong>Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors</strong>, which represents creditors without security interests in Voyager, supported the deal in its current form, pointing out that it would yield more significant recoveries for creditors than if Voyager liquidated its holdings itself, as would happen if CFIUS rejects the deal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5/ There will not be a single substantial transfer of crypto from Voyager to <a href="https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW" target="_blank">https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW</a> on the closing date that would be at risk in a <a href="https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW" target="_blank">https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW</a> insolvency.</p>&mdash; Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (@VoyagerUCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/VoyagerUCC/status/1612824160610156546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The bankrupt lender had already refuted <strong>Jan. 8 objections to the acquisition proposal from Alameda Research, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), four US states, and the US trustee.</strong></p>



<p>It stated that the deal serves the interests of its creditors to the greatest extent possible and that the objections &#8220;fail to put up any factual or legal evidence&#8221; for their claims. Voyager announced their agreement with Binance on December 19.</p>



<p>US&#8217;s offer to purchase its assets in the $1.022 billion transaction following the prior $1.4 billion agreement with FTX. After the collapse of the crypto exchange, the US failed.</p>

<p>It is known that the relationship between the two founders of DCG and Gemini broke down after Genesis announced to stop withdrawing money in November 2022. This locked the funds belonging to investors in the Earning product and Gemini&#8217;s money, leaving Gemini struggling to find a way to get its customers&#8217; money back.</p>



<p>Currently, <strong>Gemini Earn program has also stopped working</strong>, and <strong>Gemini&#8217;s side has issued a request to return all locked assets</strong> to Gemini.</p>



<p>In the body of the letter, DCG CEO Barry Silbert introduced more details about Genesis Capital&#8217;s lending division in a letter to investors. He noted that <strong>DCG has laid off employees and closed its crypto asset management headquarters.</strong></p>



<p>He also asserted that <strong>funds had never been mixed between DCG subsidiaries</strong> and that its relationship with <strong>Three Arrows Capital was limited to a loan and transaction agreement</strong>, which the company further invested in some products of Grayscale.</p>

<p>During the Q&amp;A session, Silbert addressed the controversy surrounding Genesis and its client Gemini. He said DCG borrowed from Genesis Capital, but <strong>&#8220;these loans are made on a free basis and are priced at prevailing market rates.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p><strong>DCG and Genesis Capital have a $1.1 billion promissory note maturing in 2032</strong>, and DCG currently owes Genesis $447.5 million and 4,550 bitcoins, worth about $78 million.</p>



<p>Regarding DCG&#8217;s role in the restructuring of Genesis Capital, Silbert said that due to the debts and promissory notes that DCG owes Genesis Capital, DCG executives, including those on the Genesis board of directors, <strong>do not have decision-making power regarding the restructuring of Genesis Capital.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Because of the outstanding loans and the promissory note that DCG owes to Genesis Capital, DCG executives, including those on the Genesis board, have no decision-making authority related to any restructuring of Genesis Capital.&#8221;</p>
<cite>He said.</cite></blockquote>

<p>The permissionless vaults are a component of a larger V3 strategy, which seeks to completely decentralize the user-facing services and products provided by Yearn in the future.</p>



<p>Users have only been able to access vaults made by the project developers and contributors thus far. Anyone can now develop their own strategies and market them on Yearn, where other interested users can deposit their own tokens and receive dividends, thanks to the advent of the permissionless vault factory.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://cryptofees.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a>, over <strong>$100,000 in fees</strong> were earned on Curve in the last 24 hours and distributed to users and liquidity providers.</p>

<p>Over time, this might expand Yearn&#8217;s user base and draw additional liquidity to the well-liked DeFi application. When Yearn charges a fraction of the rewards as fees for its yield-aggregation service, it generates revenue based on customer liquidity.</p>



<p>Last October, <strong>yearn.finance</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/131900-yearnfinance-launches-vaults-on-optimism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it launched opportunities for Yearn vaults on <strong>Optimism</strong>, which provides farming for some vaults such as DAI, WBTC, WETH, USDC, and <strong>sUSD</strong>. Furthermore, with strategies that farm on several <strong>DeFi</strong> mainstays like <strong>Aave, Velo, Uniswap, Curve, Stargate</strong>, and <strong>Ironbank</strong> &#8211; Optimism fans may now receive the same Yearn unbreakable risk management framework with increased earnings.</p>
