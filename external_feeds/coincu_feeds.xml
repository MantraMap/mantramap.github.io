<p>On Thursday, the New York Stock Exchange announced delisting proceedings for Silvergate stock, citing delayed financial reports.</p>



<p>The failed bank said in March that it would be shutting down after being hit by the downturn in the crypto industry, which is also cutting around 230 jobs, effective today.</p>



<p>Not stopping there, at least three more layoffs are expected, on June 30, August 30, and November 30 &#8220;or later,&#8221; the filing states. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182697-3-silvergate-investor-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silvergate</a> estimates the cost of layoffs will be around $13.6 million with severance, retention and bonus payments, and job referral programs.</p>



<p>Silvergate Bank&#8217;s parent company said in a securities filing that the approximately 80 remaining officers and employees at the company would focus on carrying out the bank&#8217;s liquidation, preserving the residual value of its assets while handling inquiries and investigations.</p>



<p>On March 9, the day Silvergate Capital said it was shutting down, shares fell 42% to $2.84. According to FactSet, the stock closed Wednesday at $1.25.</p>

<p>In addition, in a separate SEC filing dated May 11, the bank also said it was unable to file the legally required financial statements for the fiscal year 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 and &#8220;did not expect to be able&#8221; to file any similar reports in the future. It determines that it is in the &#8220;best interests&#8221; of stakeholders to &#8220;minimize costs and expenses&#8221; to preserve value. The company added that some of the staff cuts included were &#8220;critical&#8221; in the preparation of these filings.</p>

<li><em>CZ has been trying to sell his stake in the company since last summer.</em></li>

<p>Executives at the US branch have considered accelerating CZ&#8217;s share reduction in recent weeks, ever since the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued international crypto firm Binance and CZ for accused of violating US derivatives laws, which could help improve the company&#8217;s position in the eyes of US regulators.</p>



<p>The company is worried it may not be able to obtain some of the regulatory licenses it wants in the US while Zhao remains in a critical position, the report added.</p>



<p>In March, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://news.coincu.com/176792-breaking-binance-and-cz-sued-by-cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> Binance and its CEO Zhao for operating what the regulator alleged was an &#8220;illegal&#8221; exchange and a &#8220;fake&#8221; compliance program.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it has filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois charging Changpeng Zhao and three entities that operate the Binance platform with numerous violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations. The complaint also charges Samuel Lim, Binance’s former chief compliance officer, with aiding and abetting Binance’s violations.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the course of ongoing litigation against the defendants, the agency seeks discord, civil fines, permanent registration, and trading bans, and permanent injunctions for further violations of the laws regulations of the CEA and CFTC, as charged.</p>



<p>Binance said the lawsuit was &#8220;unexpected and disappointing,&#8221; adding that it had made &#8220;substantial investments&#8221; over the past two years to ensure that US investors are not active on this platform.</p>



<p>The crypto industry is going through a tough time as tight regulatory constraints threaten the survival of industry service companies. Regulatory actions continued to erupt in early March after the industry lost two of its most significant connections to the mainstream financial world &#8211; Silvergate and Signature Bank.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BlockFi, the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender, was granted permission by a court on Thursday to restore $297 million to customers with non-interest-bearing accounts without compensating consumers who attempted to transfer cash into such accounts at the last minute, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-11/blockfi-crypto-customers-lose-fight-over-disputed-coin-transfers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em> report.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-483.png"><img decoding="async" width="4000" height="3000" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-483.png" alt="BlockFi Customer Will Lose $375 Million In Interest Account" class="wp-image-186873" title="BlockFi Customer Will Lose $375 Million In Interest Account 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan decided against returning a further $375 million in cash that customers attempted to take from BlockFi&#8217;s interest-bearing accounts, known as BIA, after the business froze assets last year, as ripples from FTX&#8217;s demise swept across the crypto community.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The court finds that all digital assets held by the debtors in custodial omnibus wallets are indeed client property, and not property of the bankruptcy estates, subject, of course, to possible avoidance and clawback rights,” Kaplan said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Customers who owned custodial wallets, on the other hand, did not give up the same ownership rights.</p>



<p>Wallet transfers from interest-bearing accounts to custodial wallets did not occur after 8:15 p.m. EST on Nov. 10, according to Kaplan.</p>



<p>Customers who still had crypto in interest-bearing accounts &#8211; roughly $375 million in total &#8211; no longer had access to those assets, despite getting email and in-app confirmation from BlockFi.</p>



<p>BlockFi, situated in Jersey City, declared bankruptcy in November, intending to sell or restructure the firm to satisfy creditors. The decision is comparable to those reached in previous crypto-company bankruptcy proceedings. Celsius Network now controls the coins that users deposit in interest-bearing accounts, according to a federal court in New York.</p>



<p>BlockFi suspended transactions in early November of last year and declared bankruptcy on November 28. It rapidly followed FTX after the defunct exchange&#8217;s demise.</p>

<p>According to court documents, around $292 million in assets were stranded on the platform when users attempted to relocate them after the Nov. 10 suspension. Kaplan determined that the business may now terminate such transactions.</p>



<p>BlockFi was allowed further time in April to outline its bankruptcy plan. It has until May 15 to submit its departure strategy. Kaplan apparently granted the extension in the hopes of smoothing the case&#8217;s progression.</p>



<p>In an earlier court hearing, BlockFi attorney Michael Slade argued that allowing the $375 million in transfers would severely dilute the recovery for Wallet customers and could prevent BlockFi from returning any customer funds due to the practical difficulty of determining how to pay the additional Wallet claims from a fixed pool of assets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, apologized for Pepecoin&#8217;s inaccurate reports.</em></li>



<li><em>Earlier, the trading platform had released reports revealing the memecoin originated from an Internet meme and was seen as a symbol of right-wing hate, causing a storm of criticism on Twitter with the hashtag #deletecoinbase.</em></li>



<li><em>This has caused the PEPE token to drop more than 21% in the past 24 hours and Coinbase stock to drop more than 4%.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, tweeted that they misrepresented PEPE and apologized to the community.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-481.png"><img decoding="async" width="889" height="500" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-481.png" alt="Coinbase Legal Director Apologizes For Controversial PEPE Reports" class="wp-image-186868" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-481.png 889w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-481-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-481-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-481-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" title="Coinbase Legal Director Apologizes For Controversial PEPE Reports 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to the Coinbase <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186732-coinbase-sparks-controversy-with-pepecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newsletter</a>, the trading volume on the meme coin surpassed $2.3 billion last week, six times higher than the previous week and the highest level since May 2021. The rise of PEPE as the leading driving force behind the coin mania is an ongoing meme. PEPE has grown by nearly 55,000% since its release in mid-April, resulting in a market capitalization of $1.8 billion in less than three weeks, making it one of the fastest-growing tokens ever.</p>



<p>But the Cryptocurrency Exchange caused a stir by depicting the Pepe the Frog meme as originating from an Internet meme and seen as a symbol of right-wing hate. This led to a flurry of confusion on Twitter, with the hashtag #deletecoinbase trending on Twitter in the early hours of Thursday.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The token is based on the Pepe the Frog meme, which first surfaced on the internet nearly 20 years ago as a comic-strip character,(…). Over time it has been co-opted as a hate symbol by alt-right groups, according to the Anti-Defamation League.&#8221;</p>
<cite>The Coinbase newsletter stated.</cite></blockquote>



<p>This prompted the exchange&#8217;s chief legal officer to post a tweet apologizing to the community for sharing a false introduction to PEPE, which did not accurately reflect the big picture, and Coinbase responded very sorry community. After receiving heavy criticism from the community, the report was immediately <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/bytes/archive/behind-the-memecoin-frenzy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edited</a>.</p>



<p>According to CoinMarketCap, PEPE has dropped more than 21% in the past 24 hours, and Coinbase stock has fallen more than 4%.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Do Kwon has entered a not-guilty plea in a Montenegro court.</em></li>



<li><em>Branko Andjelic, his defense counsel, sought a bond of $437,240.</em></li>



<li><em>Interpol sought crypto creator and former Terra executive Han Chang-Joon was apprehended.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do Kwon&#8217;s attorneys have recommended that he be released on supervised bail while facing accusations in Montenegro for trying to travel using fake papers.</strong></h5>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/186478-do-kwon-obtained-176m-from-terra-luna/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do Kwon</a>, the founder of TerraUSD, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to allegations of travel document falsification brought by Montenegrin authorities following his detention.</p>



<p>Not only did Kwon reject the allegations against him, but his attorneys also argued for supervised bail and his release. The defense counsel, Branko Andjelic, recommended that the Terra brothers be released on bail of 400,000 euros, or $437,240 apiece.</p>



<p>The defendants denied committing a crime and presented their defense in Podgorica, the country&#8217;s capital, on Thursday. According to a <a href="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/aL9R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notification</a> of the hearing&#8217;s conclusion:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Instead of detention, the defendant&#8217;s lawyer suggested that bail and supervision measures be imposed, prohibiting them from leaving the apartment and periodically reporting to a certain state authority.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kwon and Terra CEO Han Chang-Joon were detained in March by Montenegrin police and accused of document falsification by local prosecutors.</p>



<p>Kwon was detained in Podgorica, the country&#8217;s capital, while attempting to board a private jet heading for Dubai. The sought crypto creator was apprehended with Han Chang-joon, another former Terra executive.</p>



<p>Following the TerraUSD stablecoin crisis, which wiped out about $45 billion from the cryptocurrency market and prompted a chain reaction of company closures and bankruptcies, their status as international fugitives ended with this arrest.</p>



<p>Kwon and Han were also discovered holding passports from Belgium and Costa Rica in addition to their South Korean passports. The Belgian and Costa Rican passports, according to Interpol and Montenegro, were faked, an allegation both men contested in court.</p>



<p>Kwon&#8217;s legal problems go beyond the limits of Montenegro. US authorities have accused him of organizing a multi-year crypto scam that cost at least $40 billion in market value. Prosecutors in South Korea have made similar claims.</p>



<p>Both the United States and South Korea have requested Kwon&#8217;s extradition, but Montenegrin judicial authorities have emphasized that such considerations would be made only when local criminal processes are completed.</p>



<p>The next hearing is on June 16. Kwon faces up to five years in jail if convicted of using forged papers under Montenegrin law.</p>

<p>Hut 8 Mining&#8217;s first-quarter sales fell 64% year on year to C$19 million, exceeding expectations, as the firm was forced to switch off several pieces of equipment owing to a disagreement with its energy source.</p>



<p>Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We also reached an all-time operational high of 1.72 EH/s at our Medicine Hat facility and announced a merger of equals with USBTC, and since then have made progress on key regulatory files required to complete the transaction.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sales declined 13% from the previous quarter, below analyst forecasts of C$21.2 million. The Toronto-based firm posted profits per share (EPS) of C$0.47, compared to FactSet&#8217;s prediction of a loss of C$0.15.</p>



<p>The firm had problems at the Drumheller location, mostly because of excessive energy input levels, which caused miners to fail. This has substantially decreased operations, which are now at around 15% of the installed hash rate at the location.</p>



<p>Remediation started in March and gained speed in April when the team deployed new custom software across all miner models to reduce the maximum output voltage of the power supply, ensuring our equipment functions within safe boundaries.</p>



<p>The company has a total self-mined, unencumbered, and custodied Bitcoin balance of 9,133 with a market value of $352.0 million as of March 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2023, 475 Bitcoin were mined, and 428 Bitcoin were sold, netting the company $14.5 million.</p>



<p>While the crypto mining industry is emerging from a brutal crypto winter that saw major names like <a href="https://news.coincu.com/167816-compute-north-plan-approved-by-court/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compute North</a> and Core Scientific file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Hut 8 was forced to turn off approximately 8,000 machines in its Ontario facility in mid-November due to a dispute with its energy provider. Since then, it has managed to get just approximately 1,000 back online.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Justin Sun said he would begin trading memecoins and promising ventures through his public wallet address.</em></li>



<li><em>Sun&#8217;s wallet will now be actively monitored by cryptocurrency traders and experts for indications of movement.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, has spoken out about the recent return of the memecoins wave, causing the trading volume and emerging coins like PEPE and LADYS to create hype.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-474.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-474-1024x683.png" alt="Justin Sun Is Also Joining the Excitement Wave of Memecoin" class="wp-image-186847" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-474-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-474-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-474-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-474-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-474-1140x760.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-474.png 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Justin Sun Is Also Joining the Excitement Wave Of Memecoin 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>Sun also said that from now on, he would actively participate in trading memecoins through a public address. The profits he makes will be donated to charity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve decided to begin actively trading meme coins and promising projects through my public address. Please note, I will personally bear all potential losses from these trades, and any profits made will be donated entirely to charity.</p>&mdash; H.E. Justin Sun 孙宇晨 (@justinsuntron) <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1656598894158159872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 11, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Furthermore, both <a href="https://twitter.com/gate_io/status/1656569918039400448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gate.io</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/HuobiGlobal/status/1656561689029115909" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huobi</a> have announced that they will list the memecoin LADYS of Milady. Trade on Gate.io will begin on May 11 at 9 a.m. UTC, while Huobi said that LADYS/USDT spot trading would begin when deposit volume reaches market demand.</p>



<p>DWF Labs announced earlier today that it would transfer 600 billion LADYS to the Huobi wallet for market-making purposes.</p>



<p>No Meme Token, created in wake of a tweet by <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186623-elon-musk-creates-excitement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk</a> on Wednesday that featured a picture of a Milady Maker NFT and a caption saying “there is no meme,” saw an explosive start to life.</p>



<p>It is safe to say that the meme coin craze was not welcomed in the Bitcoin (BTC) community. To be more specific, the unprecedented trading activity in PEPE and other meme-inspired coins was one of the factors driving Bitcoin transaction fees to a new record high.</p>



<p>While there are no indications that Sun has started investing in meme coins or new projects using his wallet just yet, the tantalizing prospect that one of crypto’s largest whales is waiting on the sidelines could well keep the ongoing meme coin craze of the last few weeks alive.</p>



<p>New wave meme coins like Pepe coin have seen explosive gains in recent weeks, pushing network fees on blockchains like Ethereum to sky highs levels.</p>



<p>PEPE, a meme coin inspired by the popular internet meme “Pepe the Frog,” was launched in April. Over the past few weeks, PEPE saw a meteoric rise of a whopping 5,000,000%. It is now the third-biggest meme coin by market cap, trailing DOGE and SHIB.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Peter Brandt warns about potential Bitcoin collapse due to &#8220;head and shoulders&#8221; pattern.</em></li>



<li><em>Bitcoin&#8217;s price stands at $27,434.88 with 24-hour trading volume of over $22 billion.</em></li>



<li><em>Completion of pattern indicates potential significant downturn in price trends.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Peter Brandt, a well-known trader and respected personality in the world of cryptocurrency, recently raised concerns about the possibility of a Bitcoin (BTC) collapse.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bitcoin.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bitcoin-1024x683.jpeg" alt="Bitcoin" class="wp-image-186843" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bitcoin-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bitcoin-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bitcoin-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bitcoin-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bitcoin-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bitcoin.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Is Bitcoin Doomed? Legendary Trader Issues Dire Warning! 27"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In a tweet that he posted recently, Brandt highlighted a &#8220;head and shoulders&#8221; pattern on BTC&#8217;s price chart. This pattern is a technical analysis charting pattern that signals a potential reversal in price trends. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A head and shoulders should be taken seriously if it is completed <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$BTC</a> <a href="https://t.co/n5ZiLasmUC" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/n5ZiLasmUC</a></p>&mdash; Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1656562853308923906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 11, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It consists of a peak (shoulder), followed by a higher peak (head) and then another lower peak (shoulder). If this pattern is completed, it could spell trouble for BTC, which is currently trading at $27,434.88 according to data from CoinGecko, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $22 billion.</p>



<p>Brandt suggests that Bitcoin is approaching the completion of the &#8220;head and shoulders&#8221; pattern, which often indicates that a security&#8217;s price is set to fall. This implies that Bitcoin could be on the verge of a significant downturn. If this happens, it could have negative implications for the entire cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Bitcoin&#8217;s price saw a spike after the latest CPI report, suggesting an easing of inflation rates. The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $28,883 on May 10, only to erase some of its gains later in the day. However, BTC briefly fell below $27,000 amid concerns about market liquidity. Bloomberg attributed the drop to declining participation from institutional market makers.</p>



<p>It is important to note that the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and price movements are often difficult to predict. While the completion of the &#8220;head and shoulders&#8221; pattern could indicate a potential downturn for Bitcoin, it is also possible that the cryptocurrency could bounce back and continue its upward trajectory. Only time will tell how the market will react to this potential threat and what the future holds for BTC and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<p>The most recent incident involves a well-known crypto influencer named DannyCrypt, who is accused of deceiving his followers. According to reports, DannyCrypt received 2% of a token&#8217;s supply for marketing purposes but then proceeded to dump the majority of these tokens on his unsuspecting followers. The scam resulted in a profit of $57K (31 ETH) for DannyCrypt.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another day another influencer <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrypt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@DannyCrypt</a> dumping on their followers undisclosed<br><br>He received 2% of the supply to assist with marketing but within 15 minutes of receiving the tokens market dumped the majority of them for $57k (31 ETH)<br><br>Meanwhile he tweeted “hodling my HODL coin” <a href="https://t.co/XVrMh3HVDZ" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/XVrMh3HVDZ</a></p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1656375551819497478?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The incident is a stark reminder of the need for caution when investing in cryptocurrency projects, especially those that are endorsed by influencers. Investors should conduct thorough research before committing funds to any project and avoid blindly following the advice of social media influencers. Skepticism is key when evaluating unrealistic promises or guarantees. Additionally, it is recommended that investors avoid investing all of their funds into meme coins and volatile digital assets. The meme coin space is rapidly growing but remains full of uncertainty, and scams like the one involving DannyCrypt are not uncommon.</p>



<p>To minimize the risk of falling victim to cryptocurrency scams, investors should consider the following recommendations. First, conduct thorough research into any project before investing. This includes reading the project&#8217;s white paper, reviewing the team&#8217;s credentials, and researching the history of the project. Second, remain skeptical of any promises or guarantees that seem too good to be true. Third, avoid investing all of your funds into a single project or asset. Diversification is key to minimizing risk in any investment portfolio. Finally, never blindly follow the advice of influencers or social media personalities. Instead, use their insights as a starting point for conducting your own research and making informed investment decisions.</p>



<p>The incident involving DannyCrypt serves as a warning to all investors that the cryptocurrency market remains relatively unregulated and full of risk. However, by conducting thorough research, remaining skeptical, and diversifying your investments, you can help minimize your risk and avoid falling victim to scams like the one involving DannyCrypt and his followers.</p>

<p>The company <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1313/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-first-quarter-2023-results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> a narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss per share, thanks to a rising Bitcoin (BTC) price and increased production, which helped the Florida-based company return to profitability.</p>



<p>Fred Thiel, Marathon&#8217;s chairman and CEO, <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1313/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-first-quarter-2023-results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“After weathering a tumultuous 2022 that tested the resilience of our entire industry, this year is off to a strong start as we grew our hash rate, reduced our cost to mine, and improved our balance sheet during the first quarter.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to FactSet statistics, Marathon reported a net loss of $0.05 per share, compared to an average forecast of $0.08. According to a Wednesday filing, the loss was $3.14 in the previous quarter and $0.12 in the same period in 2022.</p>



<p>Marathon reported $51.1 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2023, down from $51.7 million in the first quarter of 2022. This quarter, the firm reported a net loss of $7.2 million, compared to a net loss of $12.9 million the previous year. In Q1, the firm generated 2,195 BTC, a 74% increase over Q1 2022 and a 41% increase over Q4 2022. The company’s hash rate climbed 69% to 15.4 EH/s from 9.1 EH/s in Q4 2022.</p>



<p>Marathon also said that it made $17.6 million from the sale of Bitcoin. Previous rumors said that the company would sell Bitcoin to cover operational expenses. On March 31, it had $124.9 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 11.446 Bitcoin worth $326.5 million.</p>



<p>The company also <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186763-montana-data-center-probe-puts-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that it got another subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is investigating related-party transactions that may have violated federal securities law, among other things.</p>



<p>The Commission took similar action in November 2021 and again last month. The SEC&#8217;s move today emphasizes the wave of rigorous regulation that crypto firms in the United States are facing. Marathon said it is registered with the inquiry.</p>



<p>The company published its monthly results and announced plans to launch a joint mining operation with Zero Two in Abu Dhabi.</p>
