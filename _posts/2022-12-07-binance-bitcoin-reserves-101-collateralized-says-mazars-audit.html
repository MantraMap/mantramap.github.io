Mazars reported that Binance&#8217;s BTC reserves were fully collateralized at a 101% ratio. The global auditor verified both proof-of-reserves and proof-of-liabilities following a snapshot taken on November 22.  An audit on Binance’s Bitcoin (BTC) reserves confirmed that the crypto exchange held fully collateralized assets. Mazars, a global financial advisory firm, conducted the audit after taking a snapshot of the exchange’s BTC holdings [&#8230;]
