<ul><li>OpenSea is set to disable the royalty enforcement function on its platform starting next month.&nbsp;</li><li>The NFT marketplace will remove its Operator Filter, making royalties optional for new collections.</li><li>Royalties will be enforced for collections that enable the Operator Filter before August 31, 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>NFT creators online have expressed frustration with the policy change.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>OpenSea has reversed its policy on royalties for NFT artists by making creator fees optional, citing competition from rival marketplaces, including Blur, LooksRare, and Dew. The leading <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/polygon-suku-launch-nft-minted-on-twitter/">NFT</a> marketplace announced earlier today that the changes would go into effect on August 31, 2023. Post this date, NFT artists who sell digital art on the platform will receive royalties on secondary sales only if the buyer chooses to pay it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>OpenSea Operator Filter To Be Disabled&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to making royalties optional, the OpenSea Operator Filter will also be shut down, the NFT marketplace stated in a <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/articles/creator-fees-update" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>. Operator Filter, which was launched in November last year, is a tool used by NFT artists to restrict the sale of their collections to marketplaces that don&#8217;t enforce creator fees in secondary sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objective of the Operator Filter was to empower NFT creators by giving them control over their artwork and web3 business models. But OpenSea claimed that the tool required the participation of everyone in the web3 ecosystem, which did not happen, prompting the change in the royalty policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to OpenSea, the option creator fees would be more in line with the choice and ownership in the DeFi space. Starting August 31, the Operator Filter will not block any web3 marketplaces, making it easier for potential NFT buyers to identify secondary listings. This would include the creator’s preferred fees, as well as the option for buyers to modify the creator fees payment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, for NFT creators who enable the OpenSea Operator Filter for their collection before August 31, the NFT marketplace will enforce the creator’s preferred royalty on all secondary sales till February 29, 2024. This option will also be extended to existing collections on all non-Ethereum blockchains.</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase is set to suspend trading of USDT, DAI, and RAI in Canada at the end of the month.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange stated that the decision was based on recent reviews and internal listing standards.&nbsp;</li><li>Users will be able to deposit and withdraw the discontinued stablecoins following the suspension.&nbsp;</li><li>Crypto.com withdrew support for USDT in Canada earlier this year at the direction of the local securities regulator.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase is set to suspend the trading of three popular stable assets in Canada, including the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, Tether USD (USDT), at the end of this month. The other stablecoins include DAI and the Rai Reflex Index (RAI), a non-pegged Ether-backed stable asset commonly used on decentralized finance protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Will Allow Access To Suspended Stablecoins</strong></h2>



<p>In an email to its users earlier today, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-approval-crypto-futures-stock-5/">Coinbase</a> announced that it would suspend trading in Canada for USDT, DAI, and RAI on August 31, 2023. According to the crypto exchange, the decision was made based on recent reviews, which indicated that the stable assets did not meet the platform’s listing standards, which all assets are regularly monitored for. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="919" height="675" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225.png" alt="Coinbase Set To Suspend USDT Trading In Canada This Month 5" class="wp-image-583712" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225.png 919w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225-300x220.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225-770x566.png 770w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225-269x198.png 269w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225-746x548.png 746w" sizes="(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px" title="Coinbase Set To Suspend USDT Trading In Canada This Month 5"></figure>



<p>Coinbase clarified that the trading suspension will not affect Canadian customers’ access to USDT, DAI, and RAI and that the users will be able to deposit and withdraw the stable assets from their wallets following the suspension. None of the stable assets had a considerable change in their prices following the announcement of the suspension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase’s announcement comes less than a week after it officially launched its services in Canada’s crypto market. The move came after months of collaboration between the California-based crypto exchange and Canadian regulators and policymakers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, fellow crypto exchange Crypto.com ended support for USDT after it was directed to do so by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). In December 2022, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) stated that value-pegged crypto assets, including Tether, qualified as securities in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ironically, Tether <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-makes-strategic-transition-to-meet-community-demands-and-foster-innovation/" rel="nofollow noopener">withdrew</a> support for Bitcoin Cash SLP, Omni Layer, and Kusama. The decision was reportedly part of a strategic transition based on the crypto industry’s demands. </p>

<p>A Thursday ruling <a href="https://twitter.com/eleanorterrett/status/1692229671725723998?s=46&amp;t=TMI07H21nqgKjjcESnhqEQ" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/eleanorterrett/status/1692229671725723998?s=46&amp;t=TMI07H21nqgKjjcESnhqEQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">granted</a> the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission permission to file an interlocutory appeal in its case against XRP issuer and blockchain company, Ripple Labs. The SEC has until August 18th to file its motion.</p>



<p>This approval comes a day after Ripple Labs and co-defendants Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ripple-opposes-sec-interlocutory-appeal/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ripple-opposes-sec-interlocutory-appeal/" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposed</a> the SEC’s request for an interlocutory appeal, per court documents seen on August 16. </p>



<p>The co-defendants argued that the SEC failed to meet the burden of proof to support classifying programmatic sales of XRP as securities.</p>



<p>After the SEC files its motion on Friday, the digital asset company is expected to submit opposition arguments by September 1.  Thursday&#8217;s ruling allows the SEC to file a motion to appeal, not to be mistaken for Judge Torres&#8217;s approval of the appeal itself.</p>

<h2>SEC vs Ripple Headed To Trial</h2>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s interlocutory motion seeks to appeal a specific ruling from Judge Torres. Previously, Judge Torres issued a summary judgment in partial favor of Ripple Labs. The verdict said programmatic sales of XRP did not qualify as securities considering the Howey test. </p>



<p>However, XRP sales to institutional investors met the Howey standard for classifying securities. SEC vs Ripple Labs et all is scheduled for trial in the Southern District of New York by Q2 2024. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a deadline of December 4, 2023 for all parties to submit any filings and motions to exclude evidence from a jury, per court documents. </p>



<p>Garlinghouse and Larsen, Ripple co-founders, also face charges of aiding and abetting violations of U.S. securities laws. </p>

<ul><li>FTX’s stranded customers have expressed disappointment over the recent bankruptcy claim settlement.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt exchange recently reached a $175 million deal to settle bankruptcy claims with Genesis.&nbsp;</li><li>The deal was significantly lower than the original claim amount of nearly $4 billion.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange’s CEO John Ray III endorsed the settlement in the interest of concluding the Chapter 11 proceedings.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-ryan-salame-plea-deal-prosecutors/">FTX</a> has settled its bankruptcy claims against fellow bankrupt crypto Genesis. The agreement will allow the defunct crypto exchange’s sister firm Alameda Research to claim $175 million from the bankruptcy estate of Genesis. However, the claim amount is significantly less than the original claim of nearly $4 billion, which has caused considerable outrage among FTX’s stranded customers. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX CEO John Ray Supports Settlement With Genesis</strong></h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/genesis/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MjQ2MTUwMg==&amp;id2=-1" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> earlier today, Genesis’ lawyers requested Judge Sean Lane of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York to approve the proposed settlement. Genesis stated in the filing that the settlement would help speed up its Chapter 11 proceedings, which begin in early 2023. </p>



<p>In addition to paying $175 million to FTX’s bankruptcy estate, the proposed settlement would also waive Genesis’ claims of more than $226 million against the bankrupt crypto exchange. Genesis Global Capital previously revealed that the Bahamas-based exchange was its largest unsecured creditor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX made a parallel <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MjQ2MTQ0MA==&amp;id2=-1" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> where it’s current CEO John Ray III endorsed the latest deal with Genesis. Ray added that the settlement agreement saved both parties from a long and expensive legal process that would be harmful to their respective stakeholders. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It is my view that the Settlement Agreement is the result of these good faith arm’s-length negotiations between the Parties and that such negotiations were free of any collusion.”</p><cite>John Ray, CEO of FTX</cite></blockquote>



<p>FTX’s stranded customers took issue with the deal, given that it was significantly less than the original $3.9 billion claim. FTX 2.0 Coalition, a community of the exchange’s users working to restart the platform, described it as “the worst deal to date.” Other users alleged collusion between John Ray and Genesis’ executives and urged the Unsecured Creditors Committee to oppose the said deal. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>News of the $175 million settlement comes less than a month after both parties reached an in-principle agreement to resolve the claims they made amid their ongoing dispute. On July 28, legal representatives of FTX and Genesis informed Judge Lane that they had found common ground regarding a settlement and intended to proceed with documentation shortly.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the aftermath of Curve’s reentrancy exploit of July 30, 3pool, one of the decentralized exchange&#8217;s (DEX) prominent liquidity pools, continue to experience capital flight, research firm Kaiko noted in a recent </span><a href="https://research.kaiko.com/insights/curve-3pool-sees-175m-outflows" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Kaiko, Curve’s 3pool represents one of its “most important sources of liquidity for DAI, USDC, and USDT” and has seen $175 million since the hack.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">USDC has seen the most outflows of all the three stablecoins that make up the currency reserves in the pool. Since the exploit, liquidity providers have removed USDC coins worth $125 million from 3pool. DAI comes in second place with outflows that totaled $60 million, “$25mn of which came in just three transactions on July 31,” the report stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regarding Tether’s USDT, Kaiko found that it has remained roughly even in the Curve 3pool, despite the increased removal of the other stablecoins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Kaiko, this suggests that investors are becoming more skittish about USDT. This is because USDT makes up a disproportionate amount of the pool, so a run on USDT could cause the pool to depeg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that users are incentivized to remove USDT from the Curve 3pool is a sign that they are worried about the stability of USDT. This could lead to further outflows from the pool, which could put downward pressure on the price of USDT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The total currency reserves in Curve&#8217;s 3pool at press time was $3 million. USDT accounted for the largest share of the reserves, with $1.43 million, or 48.20%. USDC was the second-largest reserve, with $423,654, or 14.25%. DAI was the third-largest reserve, with $1.11 million, or 38%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amid the fear of a complete liquidation of Michael Egorov’s collateral on Aave following the hack, the count of transactions involving CRV has dropped since 30 July. According to Santiment, the count of daily active addresses that trade CRV has declined by 94% since the hack.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likewise, CRV has failed to draw in new demand as people continue to close their trading positions.

<ul><li>Ripple has filed a response in anticipation of an interlocutory appeal by the SEC.&nbsp;</li><li>The securities regulator is likely to request Judge Torres and the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals for an interlocutory appeal.&nbsp;</li><li>Ripple and its executives have opposed the anticipated appeal citing the failure of such an appeal to satisfy the prerequisites.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-appeal-ripple-ruling-xrp-do-kwon/">Ripple</a> has filed a response ahead of an interlocutory appeal expected from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its legal battle against the crypto giant. Ripple’s opposition to the securities regulator’s anticipated interlocutory appeal comes a month after it was handed a partial victory following the summary judgment on July 13, 2023. </p>



<h2><strong>Ripple: Immediate Appeal Won’t Terminate The Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>The law firm representing Ripple sent a <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/kihuQOR/latest-file-3-pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">letter</a> to Judge Analisa Torres, who is overseeing the lawsuit, to oppose the SEC’s anticipated motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal for the court’s July 13 order which granted the crypto firm’s summary judgment. </p>



<p>An interlocutory appeal is filed to appeal a ruling by a trial court amid ongoing proceedings for other aspects of the case. In other words, an interlocutory appeal is sought to appeal a certain ruling before a final judgment is passed by the court. </p>



<p>James Murphy, a popular crypto lawyer on X (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1683817505100374016" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> last month that an interlocutory appeal from the SEC was likely. According to Murphy, the mounting political pressure on SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the summary judgment’s potential impact on the SEC’s ongoing high-profile lawsuits against crypto giants Binance and Coinbase could prompt the securities regulator to make such a move. </p>



<p>However, the SEC would need the permission of Judge Torres, as well as the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, to proceed with an interlocutory appeal. This would require the regulator to demonstrate three things: First, the court’s previous ruling involves a controlling question of law. Second, there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion on that question, and lastly, an immediate appeal may advance the termination of the litigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ripple, along with Chief Executive Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen, opposed the anticipated appeal on the grounds that none of the above-mentioned prerequisites would be satisfied in the SEC’s anticipated interlocutory appeal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-justice-token-fatmanterra-ox/">Open Exchange</a> has been hit with a $2.7 million fine by Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). The fine was issued in early May but remains unpaid, which prompted a public notice of fines against OPNX from VARA. The digital assets regulator also fined Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, the disgraced founders of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) who launched Open Exchange earlier this year. </p>



<h2><strong>OPNX May Face Litigation Over Outstanding Fines</strong></h2>



<p>As per an enforcement <a href="https://www.vara.ae/en/regulations/regulatory-notices/vara-notice-of-fines-opnx-exchange/" rel="nofollow noopener">notice</a> circulated by VARA earlier today, OPNX was hit with an AED 10,000,000 fine on May 2, 2023, for a market offense of the Virtual Assets and Related Activities Regulations that were unveiled by the regulator earlier this year. The regulator stated that the fine remained unpaid at the time of publication of the notice. </p>



<p>Additionally, VARA slapped fines of AED 200,000 ($54,450) against each of OPNX’s founders, namely Su Zhu, Kyle Davies, Mark Lamb, and the crypto platform’s Chief Executive Leslie Lamb. The founders were fined for violation of an administrative order related to the regulation of crypto advertising and marketing in the emirate. The fines have been paid in full.&nbsp;</p>



<p>VARA stated that it was mulling over further fines and penalties against OPNX due to failure to pay the fines imposed over three months ago. The digital asset regulator added that it would take any action necessary to recover the fine, including referring the matter to law enforcement agencies or even resorting to litigation&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open Exchange Token (OX), the native token of the derivatives and bankruptcy claims trading platform, lost more than 8% of its value following the news of the fines and potential enforcement action. At the time of writing, OX was trading at $0.065.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase has gained approval from the National Futures Association to offer crypto futures trading.&nbsp;</li><li>The regulatory approval comes nearly two years after the crypto exchange initially submitted an application to the NFA.&nbsp;</li><li>The latest development promoted the company’s share price to hike 5% in pre-market trading.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, has gained regulatory approval to offer crypto futures trading in the country. The approval was granted by the National Futures Association (NFA), a self-regulatory organization overseen by the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), nearly two years after the California-based crypto exchange initially filed an application with it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Taps Into $2.9 Trillion Crypto Derivatives Market</strong></h2>



<p>The regulatory approval from the National Futures Association has made <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-decentralized-l2-network-base/">Coinbase</a> a regulated Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) in the United States. It will be the first crypto-native platform to directly offer spot crypto trading alongside leveraged crypto futures to its users. </p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-financial-markets-inc-secures-fcm-approval-to-bring-regulated" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>, Coinbase described the regulatory approval from the NFA as a critical milestone that reaffirmed its commitment to operate a regulated and compliant business in the country. The exchange had reportedly been working with regulators over the past two years to ensure that its FCM business complied with the CFTC’s consumer protection standards. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Approval for US customers to access regulated crypto derivatives will allow more people to access the crypto economy in the United States in a safe way that helps keep the US at the center of digital innovation.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase’s registration as an FCM paves the way for its debut in the crypto derivatives market, which clocked a whopping $2.95 trillion in March this year. Earlier this year, CCData reported that the market share of crypto derivatives trading rose to an all-time high of 77.6% in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crypto exchange previously identified this market as a critical trader access point, which prompted the acquisition of FairX in 2022, which was later rebranded as Coinbase Derivatives Exchange. This subsidiary has since offered nano BTC and ETH futures contracts for retail investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>News of the regulatory approval to offer crypto futures trading led to a hike of more than 5% in Coinbase’s share price in pre-market trading. The stock soared as high as $84.20.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Federal prosecutors plan to use Caroline Ellison’s personal documents in the lawsuit against Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</li><li>Caroline’s personal documents reportedly prove that the FTX founder misappropriated customer funds.&nbsp;</li><li>The Department of Justice plans to use similar documents from former FTX executives Nishad Signh and Gary Wang.&nbsp;</li><li>The DOJ’s latest filing showed that Ryan Salame will not testify against his former boss SBF.</li></ul>



<p>Federal prosecutors involved with the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Sam Bankman-Fried plan to use the personal documents of Caroline Ellison against the disgraced FTX founder. Ellison served as the chief executive of FTX’s sister firm Alameda Research and was a member of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle aside from being romantically involved with him.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>“Things Sam is Freaking Out About”</strong></h2>



<p>A filing made by federal prosecutors on Monday revealed that among the evidence they planned to use against Sam Bankman-Fried were personal documents from Caroline Ellison which would prove fraud and misappropriation charges leveled against the FTX founder, <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/08/15/caroline-ellison-memo-doj-prosecutors-sam-bankman-fried-ftx/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fortune</a> reported earlier today. </p>



<p>Monday’s filing, which sought to establish the evidence that would be permissible in the trial, showed that prosecutors planned to use certain to-do lists and personal notes to strengthen their case against Bankman-Fried. Among the personal notes, is an entry titled “Things Sam Is Freaking Out About,” which reportedly proves that the former FTX CEO illegally used the funds of FTX customers to fill a multi-billion dollar hole in Alameda’s balance sheet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF’s concerns laid out in Ellison’s personal documents included the negative media attention that FTX’s relationship with Alameda Research drew. Federal prosecutors have also secured a covert recording from Ellison that predates the dramatic implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire. The recording is from an all-hands meeting that was held on November 9, where Ellison can be heard stating that Alameda had been borrowing funds from FTX on Bankman-Fried’s directions.</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors are reportedly planning to use similar personal documents from former FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh. Ellison, Singh, and Wang have all pled guilty to charges stemming from FTX’s collapse and are set to testify against their former boss. However, former CEO of FTX Digital Markets, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-ryan-salame-plea-deal-prosecutors/">Ryan Salame</a>, is planning to invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, meaning that he will not be testifying against SBF. </p>
