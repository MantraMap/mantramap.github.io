					<description><![CDATA[Chainlink (LINK) has recently announced its new tie-up with Blueberry, which is set to automate and enhance the build and LP strategies of the network. With this collaboration, Blueberry is developed to provide incentives and network fees. LINK price down 0.85% Partnership with Blueberry bolsters buyer confidence Crypto experts expect LINK to go bullish before the year ends According to data by Coingecko, LINK price has plunged by 7.5% in the last seven days, and trading at $5.55 as of this writing. Technical indicators demonstrate that the coin has lost its grip at the $6 level, which could hint at a bearish signal. If the bulls fail to shoot over $6, it could be a bigger challenge for Chainlink. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Past This Key Barrier Could Spell 10% Spike For DOGE LINK Bulls Push To Get Price Past $6 On the brighter side, the LINK bulls are always quick to make a comeback whenever the price crashes. When prices dip below critical level, buyers immediately move to save the day. In this scenario, a breach of the $6 level would be a big achievement, especially in ushering the new year. But, LINK is expected to shoot up higher. Michaël Van De Poppe, a crypto expert, expects LINK to move into the bullish territory by 2023. In detail, he expects the crypto to hit $17 if the bulls reach a resistance level of $7.80. On the other hand, the crypto analyst says that Chainlink can drop and warm up below $5 before it pumps up in price. Chart: TradingView As of press time, LINK has been consolidating between $6 and $8. Considering this, any breach below this range could pull LINK further down. Predictably, bulls will take over once the digital asset breaches this low range.

The bear pressure mounts each time the crypto drops, as it is expected to slide further below the consolidation range. Whale interest has increased for Chainlink. In fact, LINK is said to be one of the top 10 most purchased crypto in the past 24 hours. This is surprising because LINK did not accumulate any major gains over the past week, but investor and buyer confidence did. Understandably, the whales were excited with LINK because the technical indicators suggested a price rally in the coming days or before the year ends. Despite the decline in Chainlink developmental activity, the positive sentiment for the coin has mounted significantly. &#8211; Featured Image: Mapping It Out]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Algorand price has been downward for quite a few months now. The coin has fallen by 1.8% over the last 24 hours. The coin has lost over 4.7% of its market value in the past week. Algorand had been consolidating on its chart over the last few weeks, but the consistent lateral trading has pushed the bulls out of the market. The technical outlook has sided with the bears, with no clear indication of the price turning around in the coming trading sessions. Ever since ALGO lost the $0.28 price level, the coin has been unable to stop its downtrend. The aforementioned price floor acted as a crucial level for the altcoin. The Algorand price has also remained unaffected by positive changes in major market movers&#8217; prices. Since the altcoin was rangebound for a while, buyers lost interest and rushed to sell the altcoin. Algorand has lost over 30% in the month of December itself. At the time of writing, the ALGO price is 96% below its all-time high from 2021. The market capitalization of Algorand has witnessed a considerable decline, indicating that sellers have completely taken over the market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Has To Remain Above These Levels For Price To Turn Around Algorand Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ALGO was auctioned for $0.166 at press time. The immediate resistance for the altcoin was at $0.172. The coin has attempted to test the overhead price ceiling, but the bearish strength has taken over the market. Since demand for Algorand has fallen substantially, the altcoin can fall to $0.163 before the price reverses itself. This could present traders with a shorting opportunity. Two crucial resistance levels were at $0.177 and then at $0.181. Moving above the $0.181 mark will help the coin target the $0.20 price. On the flip side, a fall from the present price level will bring the Algorand price to the $0.15 zone. The amount of ALGO traded in the last session was red, indicating a high selling volume at the time of writing. Technical Analysis The altcoin has depicted a death cross at the end of November, which is an extremely bearish signal. A death cross occurs when the long-term moving average moves above the short-term moving average. In the case of the Algorand price, the 50-Simple Moving Average (SMA) had crossed over the 20-SMA line. Ever since the death cross, ALGO has been under the grasp of sellers. The Relative Strength Index stood on the 30-line, a sign of the asset being oversold and undervalued. Similarly, the Algorand price was below the 20-SMA line as sellers continued to drive the price momentum in the market. Although all indicators pointed toward bearish strength, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displayed green signal bars. MACD indicates price momentum and reversals; the green signal bar was tied to buy signals. This could mean buyers can re-enter the market now as ALGO could reverse its price. However, it is completely uncertain if ALGO will recover soon. The Parabolic SAR suggests the price direction. The indicator formed dotted lines above the candlesticks, which meant a continued downtrend for the asset.

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin has once again emerged as one of the best performers for the year when it comes to the top 10 cryptocurrencies. The meme coin which enjoyed massive popularity in 2021 continues to hold on to gains even better than larger counterparts such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Dogecoin Performs Exceptionally Well In a year where there were numerous implosions that tanked the crypto market further, dogecoin has come forward as a force to be reckoned with. It has held on to its value ahead of some of the largest cryptocurrencies in the space.  Related Reading: Prolonged Crypto Winter Pushes Kraken Exchange Out Of Japan Naturally, most cryptocurrencies have lost a significant chunk of their value but where dogecoin has lost only about 58% of its value in 2022, others such as bitcoin and ethereum have recorded yearly losses of 65% and 67%, respectively. This already puts the meme coin ahead of the two largest cryptocurrencies in the market. It also outperformed the likes of Cardano and Polygon, both of which are the ninth and tenth largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Cardano’s value is down more than 80% while Polygon has recorded declines of approximately 69% this year. DOGE holding above $0.07 &#124; Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com The meme coin was only surpassed by Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP. Where BNB is down 53%, XRP is down 57%. This makes BNB the best performer out of the top 10, XRP is the second-best performer, and dogecoin is a close third. Other Metrics For Top 10 Cryptos Dogecoin has also done a good job in its rise from its cycle low. After touching $0.05 in June, it has managed to rise over 42% since then to be sitting at $0.07 at the time of this writing. However, it is still not the most accomplished in this regard. That title goes to XRP. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Another Bull Rally If This Happens XRP’s cycle low of $0.11 and its current price of $0.35 means that the digital asset is up almost 207% in the last 10 months. Another asset that saw triple-digit recoveries from the cycle low is Polygon which is up 142% from its June cycle low of $0.32. Others in the top 10 have not performed as well. Bitcoin is down around 6% from its cycle low of $17,664, and Cardano is seeing 38% losses from its cycle low of $0.4. Meanwhile, Ethereum and BNB are seeing much better headwinds with 33.65% and 32.41% increases, respectively. Nevertheless, this makes dogecoin the third-best performer once more using this metric. An impressive run for a meme coin mainly driven by hype. Featured image from Coinbase, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows Bitcoin has now been below its realized price for 163 days in this bear market; here&#8217;s how this compares with previous cycles. Bitcoin Realized Price Is Currently Valued At Around $19,900 According to CryptoQuant&#8217;s year-end dashboard release, the bear market would be over if BTC reclaims this level. To understand what the &#8220;realized price&#8221; is, the &#8220;realized cap&#8221; must be looked at first. The realized cap is a capitalization model for Bitcoin that aims to provide a sort of &#8220;real value&#8221; for the crypto. Unlike the usual market cap, which simply values each coin in circulation using the current BTC price, the realized cap prices each token at the same price it was last moved. For example, if 1 BTC was bought at $20,000, but the price has now changed to $16,000, the market cap will consider it valued at $16,000. The realized cap, however, will say its true value is $20,000. Now, if the total realized cap of Bitcoin is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, a &#8220;realized price&#8221; is obtained. This price signifies the cost-basis of the average coin in the market (that is, the price at which investors acquired the average coin at). Here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC realized price over the entire history of the asset: The BTC price seems to have been below this metric in recent months &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph displays, the normal price of Bitcoin has been below the realized price for a while now. Historically, BTC has spent very little time in this region, as only the worst phases of a bear market usually pull the coin below the level. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that In the 2011-2012 bear market, BTC spent 158 days under the realized price. Then, in 2014-2015, the coin spent a whopping 276 days in this zone.

The 2018-2019 bear saw the shortest amount of time in the region, as the price took 134 days to pull itself above the level. Finally, Bitcoin has been trapped under the realized price for 163 days in the current cycle. This means that BTC has spent more time in this region in the current bear market than in any other before, except for 2014-2015. If the current bear is comparable to 2014-2015, then it would mean there is still more than 100 days to go before Bitcoin can exit the zone.

					<description><![CDATA[The Dogecoin price had recently faced intense selling pressure; however, over the last 48 hours, DOGE showed signs of recovery. At the moment, however, the meme coin was consolidating on its daily chart. In the past week, the Dogecoin price has slipped almost 4%. As Bitcoin depicted positive price action in the last 24 hours, many other altcoins also moved up on their respective charts. The technical outlook of the meme-coin pointed towards circumstances changing for sellers. Buyers made an entrance, DOGE is, however still under the control of the bears. If demand continues to accelerate, the price of the coin is expected to move upward. The coin must remain above its current support line for that to happen. Currently, DOGE is trading at a level that has acted as support and has also been retested twice recently. Traders can expect to find long trade positions if the coin remains above two critical price levels. DOGE now trades at a 90% discount to its all-time high, which it secured last year. Related Reading: Solana Suffers Double-Digit Losses, Is There An End In Sight? Dogecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOGE was trading at $0.071 at the time of writing. The coin has just moved up the $0.069 support line in the past two days, which is now a crucial price floor. The Dogecoin price has to remain above $0.069 and the $0.070 mark for the coin to propel higher. The coin might experience a pullback at the $0.072 level, which is why Dogecoin must sustain itself above the $0.069 level. If the coin trades above the $0.072 mark, then the Dogecoin price can rally and reach the $0.077 price ceiling. The amount of Dogecoin traded in the last session was green, which indicated a rise in buying strength. Technical Analysis The meme-coin recovered from the oversold region as accumulation showed up on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index noted an uptick, which signified that the coin registered an increase in buyers. The indicator was, however, still in the seller&#8217;s territory. On the same note, the Dogecoin price traveled below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which meant that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. The indicator also depicted that there was a chance for DOGE to rally as a slight push from buyers will make the price rise above the 200-Simple Moving Average line (green), which is an extremely bullish signal for the coin. Traders could attempt to short at this level as a technical indicator depicts a sell signal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence signal bar indicates price momentum and trend reversal. This red signal bar is linked to the sell signal, which could imply that the value of the meme-coin will fall slightly before attempting to break through the immediate resistance mark. The Bollinger Bands portray price fluctuation and volatility; the bands had widened, indicating chances of a price increase. The upper band was at $0.078, which also meant that there was strong resistance at that price level.

					<description><![CDATA[Solana has been on a depressing downtrend ever since the FTX crypto exchange imploded. The asset has already lost a massive chunk of its all-time high value but the onslaught looks to be far from over. In the last seven days, the losses for the digital asset have ramped up, dragging its price down into single-digit territory. Solana Posts More Than 20% Losses According to crypto data aggregator Coinmarketcap, the price of Solana is down more than 20% in the last 7 days alone. These losses align with the general bear market trend being experienced in the crypto sector but the decline in faith in the digital asset brought about by the collapse of FTX, Solana’s biggest support, puts added pressure on it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Another Bull Rally If This Happens Sam Bankman-Fried, through FTX and Alameda Research, had funneled massive amounts of funds into the Solana ecosystem, which in hindsight reveals why the network had grown so much in such a short period of time. However, with all of that money gone, the network has had a hard time keeping up. Also, as James Spediacci notes on Twitter, a lot of the dev activity on the network was actually faked. It alleges that SOL stablecoin exchange Saber and DeFi protocol Sunny had made up about 70% of the total value locked on the Solana blockchain at its peak were operated by the Macalinao brothers, citing a report from CoinDesk. With all of these gone and no new money being injected into the ecosystem by Bankman-Fried, Solana is now in a freefall of its own making. Additionally, Matrixport announced that it would be delisting all Solana products on Dec. 30, dealing another blow to the already struggling network.

This week, the price of SOL dropped below the $10 level for the first time in almost two years. It is now sitting at its lowest point since February 2021, which was the last time that Solana had seen single-digit prices before the bull market took over. However, even with the digital asset dropping so low, it is unlikely that the decline is over.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse is about to see a trend reversal, here&#8217;s what it may mean for the crypto&#8217;s price. Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse Is Crossing Over Its 90-Day MA As per CryptoQuant&#8217;s on-chain year-end dashboard release, the trend shifts in this metric have historically occurred with phase changes in the market. The &#8220;Interexchange Flow Pulse&#8221; is an indicator that measures the 1-year cumulative net flows between Coinbase and derivative exchanges. When the value of this metric rises, it means investors are transferring more coins from spot to derivative exchanges right now, and are hence willing to take up more risk. On the other hand, low values suggest not much capital is flowing into the derivative exchanges at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse, as well as its 90-day moving average (MA), over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric may be beginning to turn around &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, a pattern seems to have historically followed with the Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse during bull-bear trends in the price of the crypto. Whenever the coin has observed a bullish period, the indicator has seen a constant climb and has stayed above its 90-day MA. Related Reading: Litecoin Bullish Signal: Shark And Whale Addresses Hit 2-Year High The reason behind this is that investors are generally willing to take more risk during bull markets, and hence send increasingly large amounts to derivative exchanges for setting up leverage positions. However, whenever the metric has reversed its direction and crossed below the 90-day MA, a top formation has taken place in the price of BTC, and the bullish trend has ended. In the bear markets that have followed such periods, the Interexchange Flow Pulse has usually continued to go down and has remained below its 3-month average. Once again, why this happens is simple; bear markets are when the average holder is unwilling to take any risks, and hence capital flow into derivatives dries up. This trend in the indicator continues until the turning point once again takes place, where the price forms its bottom and the metric starts moving back up the opposite way (crossing above its 90-day MA in the process).

Most recently, however, the decline seems to have stopped, and now the indicator is retesting its long-term average. If the historical pattern is anything to go by, a successful crossover and reversal in the Interexchange Flow Pulse&#8217;s trajectory here would mean the bear bottom is in for the current cycle, and a slow transition towards a bull market could follow. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin&#8217;s price floats around $16,600, down 1% in the last week.

<h2>Bitcoin Interexchange Flow Pulse Is Crossing Over Its 90-Day MA</h2>
<p>As per CryptoQuant&#8217;s on-chain <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/dashboard/63a9569e2fce6a57fce789dd?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=sns&amp;utm_campaign=dashboard&amp;utm_content=marketingdashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">year-end dashboard</a> release, the trend shifts in this metric have historically occurred with phase changes in the market.

<p>When the value of this metric rises, it means investors are transferring more coins from spot to derivative exchanges right now, and are hence willing to take up more risk. On the other hand, low values suggest not much capital is flowing into the derivative exchanges at the moment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Gabriel Shapiro, the legal counsel at crypto company Delphi Labs and a US attorney with more than a decade of experience, has made his predictions for the coming year 2023. However, contrary to the crypto tradition of predicting the most lucrative altcoins, Shapiro is making his predictions in terms of US crypto law. The year 2022 was undoubtedly one of the most turbulent years for the crypto industry, which had to cope with the collapse of numerous fraudulent and overleveraged companies. The collapse of FTX and its entanglements in U.S. politics, at the latest, should give U.S. lawmakers ample reasons to regulate the crypto industry more tightly in the year ahead. In this regard, Shapiro predicts that a money laundering issue will be uncovered on a national level related to cryptocurrencies. For example, &#8220;FTX could be revealed to be connected with Iran-Contra style arms smuggling to Ukraine.&#8221; (1) at least one major crypto project will register its existing token or smart contract system as a security with the SEC as part of a comprehensive pre-trial settlement &#8212; _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) December 28, 2022 Regarding centralized exchanges, Shapiro suspects that a CEX bankruptcy will expose a major mistake by a prestigious law firm. Under regulatory pressure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the lawyer says, &#8220;at least one major crypto project will register its existing token or smart contract system as a security with the SEC as part of a comprehensive pre-litigation settlement.&#8221; Related Reading: Institutional Crypto Predictions For 2023: Ethereum, BTC, L2s, NFTs Shapiro also predicts that one to three new crypto projects will seek registration with the SEC as securities. Moreover, legislative pressure may not stop at the DeFi sector. In terms of anti-money laundering and KYC guidelines, Shapiro says at least one project will bow to the pressure and introduce CEX-style customer verification. Given the tremendous growth in popularity of stablecoins and the increasingly debated introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), Shapiro&#8217;s sixth prediction should come as a surprise to few. The attorney believes that a &#8220;meaningless stablecoin law will be passed for stablecoins in custody,&#8221; leaving it up to the Treasury Department to shape the rules. This could &#8220;pave the way for Circle to receive permanent structural advantages,&#8221; Shapiro said. Crypto Law Predictions For DeFi, NFTs, And Ethereum Shapiro also expects more regulatory pressure for DAOs, which could face a wave of lawsuits from the CFTC and SEC. The attorney also expects a lawsuit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which &#8220;could file a serious claim&#8221; against a DeFi team for &#8220;misrepresentations&#8221; about how it operates. The DeFi space is also concerned with the next prediction: The CFTC publishes direct or indirect guidance on DeFi that indicates fully overcollateralized MakerDAO style vaults will not be viewed as leveraged transactions, but that everything else in DeFi is covered by CFTC regs; most fancy DeFi applications block the U.S. Flying under the radar for another year, on the other hand, could be MEV, GameFi, bridges, L2s, and zk-proofs, according to Shapiro. Major IP problems are expected by Delphi Labs&#8217; legal counsel for existing NFT-PFP projects, which are &#8220;declining dramatically in value amidst numerous lawsuits and investigations; other uses for NFT with better legal engineering emerge.&#8221; Related Reading: Litecoin Price Prediction: This Resistance Could Trigger New Rally U.S. regulators, meanwhile, could focus on Ethereum ecosystem infrastructure providers. &#8220;At least one major U.S.-based Ethereum ecosystem infrastructure provider will add KYC/AML or other previously unthinkable compliance features to the base layer,&#8221; Shapiro continued. ICOs, Binance, USDT, And Coinbase The lawyer&#8217;s penultimate prediction relates to ICOs, which could make a comeback under the MiCA framework in the EU. &#8220;[T]his combined with a higher-interest-rate environment will mark a new cycle where VCs are less powerful in crypto.&#8221; In the end, Shapiro holds an optimistic prediction for Binance, Bitfinex, and Tether, which he says will enter lightweight regulatory arrangements outside the U.S. and gain a surprising degree of international legitimacy. In contrast, he predicts that Coinbase will merge with U.S. investment banks and become a &#8220;U.S.-favored juggernaut.&#8221; At press time, the Coinbase (COIN) share price was trading at $32.53, down 90.5% from its all-time high.

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the meme coins that is often underestimated, primarily because of its extremely high volatility and low utility value. DOGE has trimmed off 8% of its value Dogecoin bulls aim to trigger price rally DOGE among most searched crypto DOGE has sloughed roughly 8% off the coin’s value in the last week, which plunged from $0.07751 to $0.06932. On the brighter side, bulls could trigger a price rally towards $0.07752. According to data by Coingecko, DOGE price has nosedived by 0.5% in the last 24 hours, and trading at $0.0706 as of this writing. Related Reading: Why ALGO Has Been Stagnant In Last 10 Days And Still At The Mercy Of Bears DOGE To Breach Below Key Support Level DOGE is seen to breach below the key support line of $0.07109, which presents a buying opportunity with the discounted price.  The key support line has been retested several times from November to December. However, can key support hold it enough to roll out a price rally? If this price can attract more buyers, then this could precipitate a price rally. During the following few trading days, the bulls may also attempt to break past the current barrier located at $0.07749, before they could gain 10%. DOGE is seen to have intensified further in terms of developmental activity, which also influenced the price increase but has dwindled in terms of investor interest. Despite DOGE being dubbed an underdog, the coin has outpaced other crypto assets in the market. In terms of price movement, Dogecoin is among the best performing memecoins in the 2022 bear market. Chart: TradingView.com DOGE’s Negative Sentiment Could Hinder Price Reversal DOGE&#8217;s MFI showing an uptick confirms the possibility of a price reversal. More so, RSI has also faced rejection each time it reaches the 30-level. Rejection of the trend by the RSI at this level may indicate a price reversal if the trend is sustained. Once it does, the DOGE bulls intensify, which could ultimately bolster a price turnaround. In the meantime, these levels can be treated as long-entry positions.

In the event that this support is breached, it will suggest that bears now have leverage, and it will invalidate the prognosis presented above. Meanwhile, many are generally concerned about whether or not the price of Dogecoin will ever reach $1 because it is currently trading at a consistently low level. The general opinion is that Dogecoin will almost certainly fare far better in the longer term in comparison to 2022. According to forecasts regarding the value of Dogecoin, its price is expected to reach $0.30 by the end of the current year, $0.77 by 2025, and $1 by 2030. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that has been searched the most this year, based on this report. &#8211; Featured image: The Motley Fool]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ALGO, an altcoin by the Algorand blockchain with a market cap of $1.18 billion, continues to feel the effects of the intense selling pressure that caused its price to crash last month. After trading within a narrow region from May to November that saw it establish $0.28 as its range low, the cryptocurrency devalued by 34% in December and found itself going all the way down to $0.163 – a marker that ended up being the asset’s current support zone. ALGO, which has not made any significant increase in price in the last 10 days, is at the mercy of bears that are in control right now, threatening to push the digital coin’s value to $0.15 or even lower. Technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI) and On-Balance Volume (OBV) are also currently favoring sellers, indicating that Algorand is headed into another bearish trajectory.
