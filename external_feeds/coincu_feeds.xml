<p>In response, ZachXBT announced the establishment of a donation address to defend freedom of speech, which has already received over $400,000 in contributions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Itâ€™s unfortunate I have to make this thread but I am being sued by MachiBigBrother for an article I published in June 2022.<br><br>Today Machi filed the defamation lawsuit.

</div></figure>



<p>The controversy began when ZachXBT published an article on social media platform Twitter, claiming that Jeffrey Huang had allegedly misappropriated 22,000 ETH from Formosa Financial in 2018. The article further accused Huang of launching multiple unsuccessful initial coin offering (ICO) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects subsequent to the company&#8217;s collapse.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ZachXBT-3.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="540" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ZachXBT-3-1024x540.jpeg" alt="ZachXBT 3" class="wp-image-195796" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ZachXBT-3-1024x540.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ZachXBT-3-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ZachXBT-3-768x405.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ZachXBT-3-1536x810.jpeg 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ZachXBT-3-750x396.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ZachXBT-3-1140x601.jpeg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ZachXBT-3.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Breaking News: ZachXBT Faces Legal Action As Jeffrey Huang&#039;s Supporters Rally 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In light of these serious allegations, Jeffrey Huang has taken legal action, filing a defamation lawsuit against ZachXBT. The lawsuit seeks to address the reputational damage caused by the claims made in the article and seeks appropriate legal remedies. Huang vehemently denies all the accusations made against him and intends to fight for his reputation in court.</p>



<p>ZachXBT, known for his investigative work in the cryptocurrency space, responded to the lawsuit by announcing the creation of a donation address. According to his Twitter post, the donations received thus far have exceeded $400,000. ZachXBT claims that these funds will be utilized to support the cause of freedom of speech and enable him to defend himself in the legal battle with Huang.</p>

<p>The situation has attracted significant attention, with supporters and critics expressing their opinions on social media. Some have applauded ZXBT&#8217;s efforts to safeguard freedom of speech, considering it crucial for investigative journalism. Others, however, have raised concerns about the potential misuse of funds and the need for responsible reporting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Tether issued $11.6 billion in mortgage loans between June 2019 and May 2021.</em></li>



<li><em>The documents also show that Tether repaid an $8 billion loan during the period.</em></li>



<li><em>The stablecoin issuer says it will reduce collateralized and over-collateralized loans in its reserves to zero in 2023.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to The Block, the New York Attorney General <a href="https://tether.to/en/Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-What-We-Shared-With-NYAG/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released </a>legal settlement documents this week, and stablecoin issuer Tether issued $11.6 billion worth of mortgage loans from June 2019 to May 2021.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-1024x576.png" alt="Tether Generated $11.6 Billion In Mortgage Loans Over The Last Two Years" class="wp-image-195789" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Tether Generated $11.6 Billion In Mortgage Loans Over The Last Two Years 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to the document, of the 694 loans, 89% have Bitcoin as collateral and 9% have Ethereum as collateral. The remaining 2% is collateralized with Tether Gold (XAUT) and other securities. The USDT issuer received a total of 450,000 Bitcoin and 1.1 million Ethereum as collateral. The documents also show that Tether repaid an $8 billion loan during the period.</p>



<p>In December 2022, the stablecoin issuer announced that it would reduce its collateralized and over-collateralized loans in its reserves to zero in 2023. Previously, crypto firms Bitfinex and Tether settled with the New York Attorney General&#8217;s Office (NYAG), ending a legal dispute that began in mid-2019.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, USDT fulfilled its reporting obligations to the New York Attorney General&#8217;s Office under the terms of the 2021 settlement. That agreement requires reporting on Tether&#8217;s reserves every quarter for two years.</p>

<p>That settlement is related to the April 2019 event that the NYAG&#8217;s office alleged that Bitfinex used Tether funds to covertly cover $850 million lost to payment processor Crypto Capital. The lost funds are believed to have caused withdrawal problems for Bitfinex customers in late 2018.</p>



<p>The documents were obtained by the NYAG during its investigation into Tether, which resulted in a settlement in February 2021 and a $18.5 million fine. They were released after a freedom of information request was made by crypto publication CoinDesk, and the Attorney General&#8217;s office provided them to The Block.</p>



<p>The stablecoin issuer <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195550-tether-calls-out-coindesk-not-to-disclose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has urged</a> CoinDesk not to disclose information about its past and current customers. This initiated procedures to prevent the public dissemination of confidential customer data and prevent the use of commercially sensitive information that could be exploited by malicious actors.</p>

<p>The on-chain sleuth has been sued by NFT trader MachiBigBrother, also known as Jeffrey Huang, for defamation. The lawsuit alleges that ZachXBT falsely <a href="https://medium.com/@investigationsbyzachxbt/22-000-eth-embezzled-and-over-ten-projects-failed-the-story-of-machi-big-brother-jeff-huang-a1ad073fcfa8" data-type="URL" data-id="https://medium.com/@investigationsbyzachxbt/22-000-eth-embezzled-and-over-ten-projects-failed-the-story-of-machi-big-brother-jeff-huang-a1ad073fcfa8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused </a>Huang of embezzling tens of millions of dollars worth of crypto, causing reputational and monetary harm to Huang.

</div></figure>



<p>The detective gained prominence in the crypto community by publishing original blockchain data analyses exposing the misdeeds of bad actors in decentralized finance and Web3 spaces. His investigations have led to real-world arrests and earned him a spot on Consensus Magazine&#8217;s Most Influential 2022 list. However, his recent allegations against Huang have sparked controversy, with Huang&#8217;s lawyer claiming that ZachXBT did not consider the ruinous effect that public allegations of criminal conduct could have on the accused individual.</p>

<p>Zach responded to the lawsuit on Twitter, calling it a &#8220;David and Goliath story&#8221; and claiming that Huang is using his wealth to silence him. </p>



<p>He lamented that fighting the lawsuit could cost him more than $1 million and asked his followers to donate crypto to a wallet dedicated to his legal costs. As of publication time, the wallet has received almost $95,000 worth of crypto donations.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>French authorities are investigating Binance for an &#8220;illegal&#8221; supply of digital asset services and aggravated money laundering.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance is accused of soliciting French clients via its local branch in violation of French law until 2022.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange recently announced its departure from the Netherlands after failing to get an AML license.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Paris prosecutor&#8217;s office stated to it that Binance is being investigated by local authorities for &#8220;illegally&#8221; providing digital asset services and serious money laundering.</strong></h5>

<p>The information <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/06/16/binance-principale-plate-forme-mondiale-d-echange-de-cryptomonnaies-visee-par-une-enquete-en-france_6177876_4408996.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> to <em>Le Monde</em> by the Paris public prosecutor&#8217;s office, an investigation relates to acts of illegal exercise of the function of digital asset service provider (PSAN) on the one hand and acts of aggravated money laundering by participating in investment operations, concealment, and conversion on the other, the latter being carried out by perpetrators of offenses that generated profits.</p>



<p>According to the Paris prosecutor&#8217;s office, an in-depth examination of papers and computer parts seized during the search is now required.</p>

<p>Binance, which is being sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to register as a trading platform and selling unregistered securities, is also suspected of violating French law governing crypto-asset platforms, which has made a wide range of activities conditional on obtaining the status of digital asset service provider since 2019.</p>



<p>This registration with the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) is especially important if you want to market to prospective French consumers. Nevertheless, Binance, which has been delivering its services in France since 2020, is accused of having purchased ads to boost its presence in the nation prior to registering with the AMF in May 2022. Binance spokesperson explained to <em>Le Monde</em>:</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;In France, control visits by regulators and inspectors are part of the legal obligations to which all financial institutions are subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>The exchange is accused of failing to meet its duties under &#8220;know your customer&#8221; (KYC) procedures, which cover all of the checks that financial firms must do to prevent their platforms from being used for money laundering, according to <em>Le Monde.</em></p>



<p>Binance <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195731-binance-is-leaving-the-netherlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its departure from the Netherlands market earlier today, and local customers will no longer be able to trade on the site as of July 17.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>ApeCoin saw a severe drop in the past week, with almost 30% of its value lost.</em></li>



<li><em>The cause of the decline stemmed from the internal DAO management.</em></li>



<li><em>APE trading volume has decreased significantly, so it is not appropriate to buy altcoins at this time.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ApeCoin (APE) continues to stutter under pressure, the booming cryptocurrency regulated by ApeCoin DAO is sailing in choppy seas with a 28% loss in value over the previous week, with the alarming salary disclosures of the DAO&#8217;s leadership causing a ruckus among the community.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="500" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259.png" alt="ApeCoin Loses Almost 30% Of Its Value In A Week, Is Now A Good Time To Buy?" class="wp-image-195763" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259-300x167.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259-768x427.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="ApeCoin Loses Almost 30% Of Its Value In A Week, Is Now A Good Time To Buy? 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>The ApeCoin DAO is not completely decentralized, and many roles within its organizational structure have been established to enable a smooth governance process. According to the ApeCoin website, the Ape Foundation assists the ApeCoin DAO&#8217;s governance process and is in charge of day-to-day administration, accountancy, project management, and other activities.</p>



<p>On June 10, the ApeCoin DAO secretary, known as &#8220;Vulkan,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/PbarNYC/status/1667895998474076165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> an organizational chart on Twitter outlining the DAO&#8217;s top pay. This revealed monthly incomes ranging from $7,000 to $75,000, which shocked some community members and prompted a flood of inquiries from others.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1261-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1261-1024x576.png" alt="ApeCoin Loses Almost 30% Of Its Value In A Week, Is Now A Good Time To Buy?" class="wp-image-195765" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1261-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1261-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1261-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1261-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1261-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1261.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ApeCoin Loses Almost 30% Of Its Value In A Week, Is Now A Good Time To Buy? 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>Users expressed particular worry over the six-figure yearly salaries paid to Special Council members.</p>



<p>In the middle of the debate, APE&#8217;s value has dropped by 28% in the last week, trading at $2.08 as of June 16. This drop is most likely a reflection of investor attitude about the continuing saga.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="624" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-1024x624.png" alt="ApeCoin Loses Almost 30% Of Its Value In A Week, Is Now A Good Time To Buy?" class="wp-image-195760" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-1024x624.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-300x183.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-768x468.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-1536x936.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-2048x1248.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-750x457.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-1140x695.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ApeCoin Loses Almost 30% Of Its Value In A Week, Is Now A Good Time To Buy? 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">APE price chart. <em>Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to the technical indications offered, APE&#8217;s negative momentum is unquestionably significant. The turmoil seems to have been caused by internal market factors rather than foreign market pressures.</p>



<p>If APE fails to rise and closes below the Fib 23.6 level, traders could expect this level to become immediate resistance. The price area we need to watch here is $2.7.</p>



<p>Also, the trading volume of APE has decreased significantly, with volumes plummeting by more than 43% to a measly $83 million. Therefore, investors should note that buying at this time has many disadvantages.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Haru Invest and Delio investors are planning to file class action lawsuits against the crypto companies as a consequence of the freezing of crypto valued at billions.</em></li>



<li><em>Approximately 400 Haru investors and 150 Delio investors joined in a KakaoTalk group conversation to prepare for litigation.</em></li>



<li><em>Investors are likely to sue cryptocurrency companies for a variety of allegations, including fraud, via the legal firm LKB &amp; Partners.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2023/06/816_353102.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local media source</a> on June 16, cryptocurrency companies <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195308-haru-invest-hiding-transferring-moneyftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Haru Invest</a> and Delio investors are planning class-action lawsuits after they abruptly froze consumer deposits and withdrawals.</strong></h5>

<p>410 Haru Invest investors and 120 Delio investors formed a Kakao group conversation on Friday to plan for a lawsuit. They are likely to sue the platforms over suspected &#8220;fraud.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1256.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="740" height="493" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1256.png" alt="Haru Invest, Delio Alleged Scam By Investors Action Lawsuits" class="wp-image-195752" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1256.png 740w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1256-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" title="Haru Invest, Delio Alleged Scam By Investors Action Lawsuits 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>Both platforms have provided &#8220;deposit&#8221; services, in which clients may earn interest on their virtual assets if they deposit a particular amount for a defined period of time. Haru Invest and Delio have respectively provided maximum annual interest rates of 12% and 10%.</p>



<p>Haru Invest banned deposits and withdrawals on Tuesday, citing inaccurate information given by its consignment operator, B&amp;S Holdings. Moreover, Haru Invest has filed a criminal complaint against B&amp;S Holdings.</p>



<p>Delio suspended withdrawals owing to market volatility, while Haru Invest suspended deposits and withdrawals. Delio is said to have placed a particular quantity of cryptocurrency at Haru Invest. If the situation worsens, the company intends to host an investor meeting on Saturday.</p>



<p>As the situation worsens, Delio intends to conduct an investors&#8217; meeting on Saturday morning at its offices in Seoul&#8217;s Gangnam District.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;I sincerely apologize to the investors who believed in us and used our service. We will report our current situation to investors and discuss feasible ways to recoup investments,&#8221; said Delio CEO Jung Sang-ho.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that Haru Invest might have exposure to the troubled cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Haru Invest, according to OXT Research, uses FTX. If the claim is correct, the corporation has been keeping its investors in the dark for about a year.</p>

<p>South Korea is one of the biggest crypto marketplaces, with billions of dollars transacted every day on the country&#8217;s many crypto platforms. Following the demise of Luna last year, the country has tightened its crypto regulations.</p>



<p>As Coincu reported, Delio formally <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195643-delio-holds-press-conference-on-june-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declared</a> that it would conduct a news conference on June 17 to explain the withdrawal halt to investors. The news conference was called to apologize to shareholders and explain the company&#8217;s present issues.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced its departure from the Netherlands.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance is departing the Netherlands after failing to get a VASP license from the Dutch regulator.</em></li>



<li><em>Dutch citizens will only be permitted to withdraw monies from the exchange as of July 17.</em></li>



<li><em>The company said that it has engaged in a complete registration application procedure with the authorities as a virtual asset service provider.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/notice-on-changes-of-services-in-the-netherlands-b5a647be31cf469b87fc3337fd461ced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its departure from the Netherlands.</strong></h5>

<p>Binance has announced its exit from the Netherlands market. New users from the Netherlands will not be permitted. Existing Netherlands resident users will only be allowed to withdraw assets from the Binance platform beginning July 17 at 00:00 UTC.</p>



<p>The exchange made the decision after failing to convince the Dutch regulator to grant it a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license, which certifies that it follows anti-money laundering (AML) requirements.</p>



<p>The exchange was previously fined â‚¬3,325,000 by the Dutch National Bank (DNB) in April 2022 for offering crypto services in the Netherlands without the legally necessary registration with the DNB.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="665" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251.png" alt="Binance Is Leaving The Netherlands From July 17 After Legal Difficulties" class="wp-image-195741" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251-768x511.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251-750x499.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Binance Is Leaving The Netherlands From July 17 After Legal Difficulties 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>However, Binance insists it is still compliant with crypto regulations in the EU region. The exchange said that it has been in a complete registration application process with the regulator as a virtual asset service provider and that it would continue to cooperate with Dutch authorities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Binance is already compliant with EU standards on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism as evidenced by its registrations in other EU countries, including France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden and Lithuania. Binance continues to be committed to working collaboratively with regulators around the world and are additionally focused on getting our business ready to be fully compliant with the new EU rules on crypto-assets (MiCAR),&#8221; the exchange said in the blog post.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Current Dutch resident users will get an email with detailed information on what this implies for their accounts and any assets they presently hold on the Binance platform, as well as any actions they must take.</p>



<p>After legal difficulties with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Binance is struggling in the US along with the Coinbase exchange.</p>

<p>The SEC sued the company and its US affiliate for mishandling consumer money and misleading authorities last week. It also attempted to freeze the company&#8217;s assets in the United States, which the exchange said would compel it to shut operations in the country.</p>



<p>Binance.US was also <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195587-binanceus-fires-50-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> to have laid off employees following the crackdown from the SEC, as Coincu previously reported.</p>

<p>Binance has announced that it will exchange 1.25 billion USDT-TRX for USDT-ETH directly with the Tether team to address stablecoin liquidity concerns. The move comes after USDT&#8217;s slight de-pegging yesterday, causing traders to worry about the potential risks associated with this cryptocurrency.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Moreover, CoinDesk has obtained USDT&#8217;s client information that Tether did not want to disclose. This development has added fuel to the already burning fire of controversy surrounding Tether, which has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny in recent months. The New York Attorney General&#8217;s Office provided responsive documents to CoinDesk relating to Tether&#8217;s case, and CoinDesk reported an attack on USDT via DeFi and CEX on the same day the documents were released. Tether has asked CoinDesk not to disclose any information about their past or current customers.</p>



<p>However, according to the report, these materials should debunk all the unfounded FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) that has been circulating in the crypto community. The materials are outdated and may not accurately reflect Tether&#8217;s current state of reserves nor account for the transformative changes in their ecosystem.</p>

<p>Binance&#8217;s decision to secure stablecoin liquidity through direct swaps with Tether is a smart move for traders who want to avoid the potential risks associated with USDT&#8217;s de-pegging. Despite regulatory scrutiny, this move also signals confidence in Tether&#8217;s ability to maintain stablecoin liquidity.</p>



<p>Traders need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and developments in the cryptocurrency market to make informed decisions. While Tether&#8217;s recent actions have raised concerns, it is vital to remember that the materials obtained by CoinDesk are outdated and may not accurately reflect the current state of Tether&#8217;s reserves. Thus, it is crucial to evaluate all available information and make informed decisions based on the latest developments in the market.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[DAI has taken BUSD's place to become the 3rd largest stablecoin by market capitalization at the moment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DAI has taken BUSD&#8217;s place to become the 3rd largest stablecoin by market capitalization at the moment.</em></li>



<li><em>BUSD has dropped by around 74% from $16.57 billion at the start of the year, while DAI has dropped by 13% from $5.06 billion at the start of the year.</em></li>



<li><em>BUSD has had a rough February, while the MakerDAO stablecoin is gaining support.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stablecoins have recently had a position change when BUSD is no longer a stablecoin that has no place for itself. Instead, DAI is currently one of the stablecoins gradually taking over BUSD&#8217;s market share.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1244-1024x689.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="689" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1244-1024x689.png" alt="Data: DAI Surpasses BUSD, Becoming The Third-largest Stable Currency" class="wp-image-195723" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1244-1024x689.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1244-300x202.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1244-768x517.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1244-750x505.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1244-1140x768.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1244.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="DAI Surpasses BUSD, Becoming The Third-largest Stable Currency 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/view/stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinMarketCap</a> data, the current market value of the stable currency BUSD is $4.342 billion, which is somewhat lower than the market value of DAI, which is $4.595 billion.</p>



<p>After USDC, DAI is currently the third biggest stablecoin. Moreover, the market value of BUSD has fallen by about 74% from $16.57 billion at the start of the year, while the market value of DAI has fallen by 13% from $5.06 billion at the start of the year.</p>



<p>More than 2.4 billion stablecoins were redeemed in 30 days, from May 15 to June 16, 2022. Three of the top stablecoins had a 4% to 19% decrease in supply over this time period, compared to the previous month.</p>



<p>The decreasing supply of different tokens in stablecoin projects has become a continuous trend, with large redemptions for USDC, BUSD, and DAI during the previous month.</p>



<p>USDC, the second biggest stablecoin, had its supply shrink by 5.7%, while BUSD saw nearly 19% of its tokens redeemed. Similarly, Makerdao&#8217;s DAI stablecoin has dropped 4% since May 15, 2023. Among these variations, two stablecoins stood out by increasing their supply over the previous 30 days: Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD (TUSD).</p>



<p>Binance USD, often known as BUSD, is a dollar-backed stablecoin produced by the blockchain infrastructure platform Paxos Trust Corporation. It is the third biggest stablecoin after USDT and USDC.</p>



<p>Paxos has previously said that the BUSD is completely guaranteed by reserves held in either fiat currency or US Treasury notes. The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) purportedly approved and regulated BUSD.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1246.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="810" height="524" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1246.png" alt="Data: DAI Surpasses BUSD, Becoming The Third-largest Stable Currency" class="wp-image-195725" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1246.png 810w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1246-300x194.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1246-768x497.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1246-750x485.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" title="DAI Surpasses BUSD, Becoming The Third-largest Stable Currency 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>Paxos teamed with cryptocurrency exchange Binance in 2019 to develop the stablecoin, which was approved by the NYDFS. According to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, the exchange leased the Binance name to Paxos, and BUSD is &#8220;wholly owned and managed by Paxos.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells notice to Paxos in February &#8211; a letter used by the regulator to notify corporations of future enforcement action. According to the notification, BUSD is unregistered security. Because of investor concern with BUSD, its market value has declined since this event.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1247.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="534" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1247.png" alt="Data: DAI Surpasses BUSD, Becoming The Third-largest Stable Currency" class="wp-image-195726" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1247.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1247-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1247-768x513.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1247-750x501.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="DAI Surpasses BUSD, Becoming The Third-largest Stable Currency 23"></a></figure></div>


<p>However, DAI, the stablecoin backed by MakerDAO, the current largest DeFi entity, is the exact opposite.</p>



<p>The MakerDAO community has agreed to increase the DAI savings rate (DSR) from 1% to 3.49%, encouraging investors to hold and lend this stablecoin.</p>



<p>The application of the new interest rate will take effect from June 19. With this change, the cost of collateral to borrow DAI will also increase.</p>



<p>The proposal comes as MakerDAO is revising its DAI stockpile of assets, including adding an additional $1.25 billion to buy US bonds &#8211; which are real-world assets and highly secure &#8211; during efforts to reduce dependence on traditional stablecoins like USDC or <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195228-makerdao-promotes-removal-gusd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemini&#8217;s GUSD</a>.</p>
