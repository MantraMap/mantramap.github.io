					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin had been trending over $31,000 for the better part of Friday after reclaiming this support level from the bears. However, this did not last long as the digital asset saw a flash crash that sent its price spiraling toward the $29,000 level. SEC Says ETF Filings Are Inadequate On Friday, the Wall Street Journal released a report that negatively impacted the market. The report revealed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission thought that the recent barrage of Bitcoin ETH filings that it had received was inadequate in their filings.

Following the news of the filings, the price of Bitcoin rallied tremendously, crossing $31,000 for the first time in over one month. However, with the news of the SEC saying that the filings are inadequate, it has quickly eroded investor sentiment. The price of BTC fell to $29,200 on Friday afternoon, before recovering quickly. Although the damage was already done and BTC bulls are now struggling to maintain support at $30,000. Bitcoin In Freefall Bitcoin had been able to establish a reasonably bullish trend over the last couple of weeks. But that did not last long as the SEC came to burst the bubble for investors. As a result, Bitcoin seems to be in freefall with no reasonable support to keep the price from falling lower. BTC struggles to hold $30,000 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com In a matter of hours, the digital asset has lost about $1,000 of its value, turning a previously good day into a bloody day for investors. This rapid decline has shoved the cryptocurrency below its 5-day moving average, which could see BTC become bearish over the weekend. However, in the mid and long-term, the digital asset remains as bullish as ever, ranging above both its 50-day and 100-day moving averages. Both of these levels signal that while bears may have gained temporary control of the price, bulls remain largely in control. And as long as sell pressure remains low, then BTC could recover back above $31,000 over the next couple of days.

					<description><![CDATA[Compound (COMP) has recently surged with a staggering 113% rise in just two weeks, and the reason behind the rally has been the talk of the crypto community. DeFi Ignas, a decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher, has analyzed the recent developments surrounding Compound and provided insights into the potential factors contributing to the surge. Compound Takes The Lead With Triple-Digit Growth In June This remarkable growth has been fueled by a range of factors, including the recent announcement of the launch of Superstate Funds by Compound&#8217;s founder, which aims to bridge traditional markets with blockchain ecosystems. One of the major challenges facing DeFi is the lack of integration with traditional financial markets. While the DeFi space has grown rapidly over the past few years, it is still relatively small compared to the traditional financial system.  Related Reading: XRP Dips After SEC’s ETF Blow But A Rebound Looks Likely By bridging these two worlds, Superstate could help to bring more institutional investors into the DeFi space and increase the overall liquidity and stability of DeFi protocols. Furthermore, Superstate&#8217;s focus on creating regulated financial products could help address some of the regulatory concerns raised about DeFi. While DeFi protocols are decentralized and operate on blockchain networks, they still fall under the jurisdiction of various regulatory bodies.  By creating regulated financial products that comply with existing regulations, Superstate could help to mitigate some of the risks associated with DeFi and pave the way for more widespread adoption of these protocols. Superstate aims to bridge traditional markets with blockchain ecosystems by buying short-term government debt and tokenizing it on blockchains. While it is unclear whether the tokenization will include COMP holders or lead to an airdrop, this announcement has generated excitement and speculation among the crypto community. Jump Crypto Whale Responsible For COMP Rally? While new governance proposals have been introduced, none have been significant enough to account for the sudden price increase. However, there has been a significant balance change among various Jump Crypto wallets. Jump Crypto wallets are a group of cryptocurrency wallets associated with Jump Trading, a Chicago-based trading firm specializing in high-frequency trading strategies. The wallets have been identified as significant players in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in the DeFi space, where they have been involved in market making and liquidity provision. These wallets have emerged as major players in the COMP market. One of these wallets holds many COMP tokens and has been involved in significant balance changes, including the recent withdrawal of 170,000 COMP tokens from Binance. This withdrawal amounts to $9.7 million and represents 1.7% of the total supply of COMP. Related Reading: OKX Liquid Marketplace Records Over $3 Billion In Institutional Trade Volume The actions of this particular wallet appear to be the primary reason for the recent surge in the COMP price. The withdrawal of such a large amount of tokens from Binance has significantly increased demand for COMP, driving up its price. As a result, this wallet now ranks as the ninth-largest holder of COMP tokens. Compound&#8217;s native token, COMP, is trading at $58, following its uptrend that began on June 16th. In the last 24 hours, COMP has continued to soar with a 14% gain and is currently attempting to break through the $60 level to surpass its yearly high of $64 achieved in February.

					<description><![CDATA[The recent surge in Litecoin (LTC) price propelled it to reach a significant psychological level of $100. This upward movement has provided a bullish boost and allowed the altcoin to register gains in recent trading sessions. However, despite this bullishness, the price of LTC remains within bearish territory, indicating ongoing downward pressure. Reclaiming the $100 price mark is crucial for sustaining a bullish trend. Related Reading: XRP Dips After SEC’s ETF Blow But A Rebound Looks Likely In the past 24 hours, LTC has experienced a rally of nearly 17%. On the weekly chart, the altcoin has maintained double-digit gains, reflecting its positive performance over a longer period. It&#8217;s worth noting that Litecoin&#8217;s halving event is just a little over a month away. Historically, the price of the asset tends to increase before this event. However, due to the fluctuating nature of Bitcoin, which often influences major altcoins, LTC might experience slight depreciation. Significant depreciation is less likely as long as LTC maintains its price above the local support level. A sustained increase in demand for the altcoin is necessary to ensure continued gains on the daily chart. The market capitalization of LTC has also increased, indicating bullish momentum in the market. Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart When writing, Litecoin (LTC) was trading at $97.81. After reaching the $100 mark, LTC has been steadily gaining in price. However, despite the bullish momentum, Litecoin remains within a crucial zone that is bearish and could potentially reverse the gains. This bearish zone, indicated in red, extends from $94 to $103. In previous trading sessions, LTC has retraced when attempting to revisit the $103 level. The $94 mark has also been a reversal point over the past few months. Moreover, Litecoin entered the excess selling zone the maximum number of times, where the price fluctuated between the two (upper and lower) bands of the bearish region. The overhead resistance levels are $100 and $103. In case of a decline from these levels, the price could drop to $94 initially, followed by a potential further decline to $90. Technical Analysis Regarding demand, Litecoin (LTC) was approaching overbought conditions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the 60 mark, indicating buyers had gained market control. This suggests a higher demand for LTC compared to selling pressure. The increased demand was also reflected in the price, as it climbed above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line. This signifies that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market, pushing it higher. As long as Litecoin (LTC) maintains its price above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicated by the red line on the chart, specifically around the $87 level, the bullish sentiment is expected to persist. Litecoin (LTC) formed a strong buy signal in line with increased demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a green histogram, indicating a fresh buy signal. This suggests a strong bullish momentum and strength in the LTC market. Related Reading: Litecoin Up 18% In Past 24 Hours, Is Halving Rally Here? Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator displayed capital inflows outweighing outflows. The indicator was above the half-line, indicating more capital inflows than outflows at the given time. Featured image from UnSplash, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly told exchanges Nasdaq and Cboe that recent filings for spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from asset managers including BlackRock and Fidelity were not “clear and comprehensive” enough. Bitcoin ETFs In Jeopardy? The SEC has rejected several Bitcoin ETF filings in recent years due to concerns over potential fraudulent and manipulative practices associated with the cryptocurrency market.  The agency has stated that the filings do not meet the standards designed to protect investors and the public interest. In particular, the SEC has expressed concerns about the lack of regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency market, which could make it easier for bad actors to manipulate the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Related Reading: Litecoin Up 18% In Past 24 Hours, Is Halving Rally Here? The SEC has also expressed concerns about custody and liquidity issues related to cryptocurrency. While some asset managers have attempted to address these concerns in their filings, the SEC has continued to reject them as inadequate. However, Several proposed solutions have been put forward to address the SEC&#8217;s concerns around Bitcoin ETFs.  One potential solution is the use of regulated custodians to hold the Bitcoin backing the ETF, which would provide greater oversight and security for investors. Some asset managers have also proposed using futures contracts to track the price of Bitcoin, rather than holding the actual cryptocurrency, which could help address liquidity concerns.  In addition, some have suggested that the SEC could work with industry participants to establish best practices and guidelines for the cryptocurrency market, which could help mitigate risks associated with fraudulent and manipulative practices.  Despite these proposals, the SEC has continued to scrutinize Bitcoin ETF filings, indicating that more work may need to be done to address the agency&#8217;s concerns. The SEC declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report, while Nasdaq and Cboe were not available for immediate comment. The decision is a blow to asset managers&#8217; attempts to launch Bitcoin ETFs, which have been repeatedly blocked by regulators in the US. BTC’s Price Tumbles, Signaling The End Of The Bull Run?  The latest criticism by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on filings for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has caused BTC’s price to drop from over $31,000 to $29,800.  Although Bitcoin is currently trading above the $30,000 line, there is uncertainty around the ETF filings by BlackRock and other major financial players, which could lead to another downtrend and a test of lower support. If this were to happen, Bitcoin bulls must hold the $29,500 line, which is the next support below $30,000. Additionally, Bitcoin&#8217;s 50-day moving average (MA) on the daily chart could provide strong support for the cryptocurrency, currently placed at $28,100.

The ADX is a technical indicator that measures the strength of a trend and is used by traders to identify potential price movements. Bitcoin&#8217;s ADX is already spiking down, which suggests a potential shift in trend. Additionally, the squeeze momentum indicator also reflects the downtrend that Bitcoin could be poised to experience in the coming week and a half. Overall, the recent criticism by the US SEC of the filings for spot BTC ETFs by BlackRock and Fidelity adds to the uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future price movements. If the asset managers cannot find common ground with the SEC&#8217;s expectations, their ETF applications could be in jeopardy.

					<description><![CDATA[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised concerns about the recent filings for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stating that they are insufficient. This comes after asset management giants BlackRock and Fidelity submitted their applications to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? The Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC shared its perspective on the filings with Nasdaq and Cboe. Specifically, the agency expressed that the filings lacked clarity and comprehensiveness. Following the release of this news, Bitcoin experienced a drop of nearly 2% in its value. Similarly, other altcoins, including XRP, also saw a decline in their respective charts. Over the past 24 hours, XRP witnessed a decrease of approximately 1%, while on the weekly chart, it recorded a loss of more than 4%. As a result, the technical outlook turned bearish, leading to a decrease in investor interest. The charts reflected a decline in both demand and accumulation. Currently, XRP is hovering around a crucial support level, and a breach of this level may potentially trigger an upward movement for XRP. The market capitalization of XRP decreased, indicating that sellers had a stronger grip on the market. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, the altcoin XRP was trading at $0.46. Currently, XRP has reached its lowest level since the end of May. This level has historically acted as a significant support level for the coin. This level is often referred to as a bullish order block, and it has the potential to drive price recovery. Looking ahead, the first hurdle for XRP would be the resistance at $0.48, followed by a potential move above the $0.50 mark. However, if XRP faces another rejection at $0.50, it could lead to a return to trading at $0.46 and possibly even a further decline to $0.43. Technical Analysis Due to low demand, there has been a decline in buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the half-line and close to the 40-mark, suggesting that buyers have lost their influence and sellers have gained control. Similarly, XRP has dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line. This indicates a weakening demand and implies that sellers are currently driving the price momentum in the market As demand for the altcoin decreased, the altcoin generated sell signals, although these signals were diminishing in size. This indicates that the bearish momentum might be subsiding. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed red histograms associated with the sell signals, but their size was decreasing. This suggests that while bearish sentiment still existed, the price could potentially experience a rebound in the near future.

					<description><![CDATA[Institutional trade volume on the OKX Liquid Marketplace has surpassed $3 billion, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume announced on Friday. The Liquid Marketplace is an on-demand liquidity network for professional and institutional traders. This platform allows traders to send requests for quotes (RFQs) to market makers for large digital asset transactions.  OKX Liquid Marketplace Experiences Rapid Growth In Q2 In a press release on Friday, OKX announced that its Liquid Marketplace has now exceeded $3 billion. “This milestone is a testament to the Liquid Marketplace&#8217;s success in providing institutional traders with deep liquidity and reliable execution,” the press statement read. Related Reading: Whales Dive Into XRP, Accumulating $170 Million Worth: What’s Their Game Plan? In April 2023, OKX revealed that the institutional Liquid Marketplace recorded over $1 billion in trading volume in the first quarter of 2023. As of now &#8211; the end of June and 2023 Q2, this figure has more than tripled, surpassing the $3 billion mark. Furthermore, the Liquid Marketplace has been advancing in innovation and product development lately. A few days ago, OKX disclosed the launch of the “Nitro Spreads” feature on the institutional trading platform. Nitro Spreads allows professional and institutional traders to make complex basis trades in a single click. Basis trading refers to trading the difference between an asset’s price on two distinct markets, such as spot vs futures, to generate profits.  This type of trading can be cumbersome, as it usually requires both legs of the trade to be executed simultaneously. However, Nitro Spreads automates this process by executing the two legs of the trade via a central orderbook. On the Liquid Marketplace, traders can use the feature across any combination of the spot, perpetual, and futures markets. OKB Price Slows Down, Makes No Significant Movement In The Past Week While the OKX ecosystem has been surrounded by positivity in recent days, this has not been reflected in the price of OKB, the exchange’s native token. The coin has not registered any loss or gain in the past seven days, according to CoinGecko data. That said, the OKB token appears to be losing the momentum that pushed its price by nearly 13% in the previous week. The cryptocurrency has also not made any significant price movement since then.

Price data reveals that OKB has been in a ranging market in the past few months, trading between the $55 and $40 price points. Since reaching a yearly high of $57.98, the cryptocurrency’s price has decreased by roughly 23%. As of this writing, the OKB token changes hands at $44.53, representing a 2.6% price increase in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the coin has a 24-hour trading volume of more than $6 million, with a 33.7% increase in the last day.

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin has observed a sharp increase of around 18% during the past day as the much-anticipated halving is just over a month away now. Litecoin Outperforms Market With A Strong 18% Surge Like most of the wider cryptocurrency market, LTC had enjoyed a sharp rally a week or so back, which had taken its price above the $90 mark. Unlike coins like Bitcoin, however, the asset had failed to maintain at these post-surge levels, as it slid off during the days that followed, until eventually bottoming out at the low $80 level. In the past day, however, tides seem to have rapidly shifted for Litecoin, as the asset is now trading above $101 after registering a sharp growth of 18% during the last 24 hours. The below chart shows how the cryptocurrency has performed recently. Looks like the coin has observed a sharp uptrend today &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView As you can see in the graph, Litecoin was around the $81 level only a couple of days back. This latest turnaround for the asset has meant that it has now surpassed the high registered around the start of the month. In terms of daily returns, LTC has outperformed almost all the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap; Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the only exception with its whopping 26% gains in the same period. Related Reading: Stablecoin Cap Shows Early Sign Of Reversal, Why This Could Benefit Bitcoin As analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; pointed out on Twitter, Litecoin formed a golden cross just before this surge, as its 50-day moving average (MA) has crossed over its 200-day MA. 2020 it is#Litecoin has golden crossed, days after a death cross Does the rest of history repeat? https://t.co/sGlMhgKE0R pic.twitter.com/CRSaqHSbGt — Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; (@tonythebullBTC) June 30, 2023 Interestingly, only a few days ago, the same MAs had also formed a cross of the opposite type: the death cross. The bullish cross canceling this bearish one out merely days later is a pattern similar to the one seen back in 2020, which preceded the bull run. LTC Only Has 34 Days To Go For The Next Halving Litecoin also has a strong bullish narrative coming up in the form of its halving. The &#8220;halving&#8221; is an event where the block rewards of the cryptocurrency are permanently cut in half. As the block rewards are the only way to introduce new LTC into the circulating supply, the halving tightens up its production rate. This increased scarcity is why the event has historically been hyped up as a bullish one. Related Reading: Altcoin Whales Show Highly Active Day, Volatility Incoming? Halvings take place roughly every four years, and the next one is estimated to place on August 3, 2023, which is just 34 days away. It now remains to be seen whether the current price surge will be an extended rally that leads to the halving, or if this is another attempt that would run out of steam before long.

					<description><![CDATA[The Ethereum network is currently witnessing a surge in interest following the recent Shanghai upgrade, which has expanded the options for holders of Ethereum (ETH). This has resulted in an uptick in the number of people staking their ETH in beacon deposit contracts, an indication of the growing confidence in the Ethereum blockchain since the upgrade. Since the Shanghai upgrade, the quantity of staked ETH has been increasing at a swift pace. This growth recently hit a peak, breaking previous records and suggesting that Ethereum&#8217;s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) has been received positively by the market. New Era For Ethereum The amount of Ethereum staked has now hit an all-time high (ATH), surpassing 25.8 million ETH, equivalent to a value of over $48 billion, according to the latest data shared by blockchain and crypto industry analytics platform, CryptoRank. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH This development has caused quite a stir in the crypto community and provides insight into the evolving dynamics of the Ethereum blockchain. Just a month earlier, in late May, the Ethereum deposit contract balance had crossed the $40 billion mark. This upward movement underscores the effectiveness of the new features introduced during Ethereum’s transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the PoS consensus mechanism after the Merge upgrade. Furthermore, the impact of the Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum ecosystem has been profound. The surge in the Ethereum staking ratio since the upgrade is indicative of growing interest and faith in the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s potential.  This, in turn, reflects on the success of the Shanghai upgrade and the Merge in aligning ETH with market expectations and needs. While the influx of staked ETH steadily rises, Ethereum&#8217;s creator, Vitalik Buterin, has recently expressed concerns regarding the potential strain this could put on the network&#8217;s consensus. In a recent blog post, he urged caution, stating, &#8220;Don’t overload Ethereum’s consensus.&#8221; Buterin went on to emphasize that utilizing Ethereum&#8217;s consensus for diverse functions could introduce elevated systemic threats to the ecosystem and should be actively discouraged. Despite this cautionary advice, there has been no decrease in ETH staking activity, only a consistent increase.

The second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization has surged from trading below $1,700 earlier this month to trading as high as $1,890, at the time of writing. Notably, the asset tapped and traded above $1,900 earlier today before slightly retracing to a 24-low of $1,843. Meanwhile, ETH has recorded more than $20 billion added to its market cap over the past two weeks. ETH trading volume has also surged over the same period indicating a rising trading activity.

<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w" dir="ltr">Buterin went on to emphasize that utilizing Ethereum&#8217;s consensus for diverse functions could introduce elevated systemic threats to the ecosystem and should be actively discouraged. Despite this cautionary advice, there has been no decrease in ETH staking activity, only a consistent increase.</p>
