<p>The Ethereum merge in mid-September has been over for almost three months. In conclusion, traders are unsure of how to evaluate the second-largest crypto asset by market cap. On the one hand, the important whale accumulation is showing promise. However, the utility and real on-chain activity continue to be underwhelming.<br /><br />Whether the potential for a price rebound&#8230; Onchain metrics forecast what to expect in terms of ETH pricing, including whether sub-$1,000 ETH might once again be a possibility.</p>
<h2>Here Is What Onchain Metrics Suggest</h2>
<p>The major shark and whale addresses for Ethereum are reportedly creating an intriguing picture, according to onchain analytics company Santiment. Millionaire addresses have primarily lost a sizable portion of their supply during the previous year, much like Bitcoin when things appeared bleak.<br /><br />However, huge ETH addresses started to change their tune for the first time in a while one month ago. Since November 7th, Ethereum addresses holding 100 to 1 million coins have amassed 1.36% of the total supply and 2.09% more total ETH (than they had previously) in their bags. This surge in large address interest in ETH again makes this measure an optimistic one.<br /><br />Like other assets, the amount of conversation about Ethereum has also decreased as time has passed since its record-breaking peak in November 2021. This is a natural evolution of weak hands leaving crypto in general, so it&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />However, what is interesting is seeing Ethereum talked about so little relative to other top assets. Since December 2020, the amount of discourse about ETH in relation to the top 100 crypto assets has dropped to its lowest level in late October. This suggests that the second-ranked cryptocurrency asset is currently flying somewhat under the radar.<br /><br />This indicator is optimistic since the lack of interest after the merge suggests that whales, as previously noted, might drive prices up with little pushback.<br /><br />Third, there is still a lot of pain, as indicated by the long-term (365d) addresses&#8217; average return over the past year. Prior to a sharp drop in value 13 months ago, Ethereum prices were just shy of $5,000. Many folks still have percentage losses of -50% or higher on their ETH investments.<br /><br />As long as the 365-day trading returns are at -25% or more (and it&#8217;s currently at -30%), then there is a cap on how much further downside there can be, based on seven years of ETH history.<br /><br />On the other hand, mid-term traders could still see prices moving either way. Late November is when prices bottomed out, and the asset is actually +17% since November 22nd. To many, it certainly doesn&#8217;t feel this way, however. <br /><br />Because of the long-term upside indicated by MVRV, this metric points to bullishness. At the time of publication, ETH was changing hands at $1264, down 1.69% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>FTT, the native cryptocurrency of the collapsed FTX crypto exchange, soared on Friday after Sam Bankman-Fried, the platform&#8217;s founder, expressed support for a plan to revive the exchange put up by crypto influencer Ran Neuner.<br /><br />In response to Neuner&#8217;s suggestion to restart FTX by releasing a new FTT token and giving it to creditors and depositors, Bankman-Fried tweeted, &#8220;I continue to think that this would be a productive path for parties to investigate! I *hope* that the teams in place will do so.&#8221;<br /><br />Neuner, the host of CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Crypto Trader&#8221; show, which debuted in 2020, suggested giving token holders 100% of profits, saying that the suggestion would restore FTX&#8217;s dominance and make users whole.<br /><br />Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset management company Blofin, claimed that Neuner&#8217;s approach &#8220;is the same as a debt restructuring plan.&#8221; &#8220;Sam&#8217;s backing for the same appears to have rekindled investor optimism about getting their money back.&#8221;<br /><br />Not everyone supports this decision with some saying it was another leg of the scam technique. Following the tweet, the FTT token increased by as much as 47% to $1.97, its highest level since November 16. <br /><br />At the time of publication, FTX was up 19% at $1.63. Trading volume for the FTT token also spiked as much as 1090%.</p>
<h2>FTX Collapse</h2>
<p>Early last month when reports surfaced that FTX&#8217;s sister company Alameda Research was holding a significant quantity of the illiquid FTT tokens, indicating an unusually close bond between the two businesses. This is when FTX&#8217;s problems started.<br /><br />Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance responded by announcing the sale of its FTT token holdings, which forced FTX to freeze customer withdrawals and cause a situation akin to a bank run. FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 11.<br /><br />In November, FTT plunged 94% to $1.31, wiping off billions of dollars in investor value.<br /><br />The collapse of FTX, dubbed by many as cryptocurrency&#8217;s Lehman moment, has eliminated several titans of the sector, including the lender BlockFi.</p>

At the time of publication, HBAR was marginally up in the last 24 hours at $0.047. Investment company abrdn has joined the Hedera Governing Council as the first buy-side finance and asset management company on the Council. abrdn plc is a global investment company with £508 billion in assets under management and administration and over 5,000 employees located globally. abrdn believes that distributed ledger technology (DLT) has the potential to transform structural inefficiencies that exist in the fund management industry. It sees Hedera as the technology of choice for this shift due to its interest in strong governance, operational efficiency, and the environmental sustainability of Hedera’s best-in-class energy efficiency. abrdn is currently examining prospects for the tokenization of investment funds, using Hedera, to list these on a digital exchange.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.0674, $0.0553, $0.0500<br />Support Levels: $0.0456, $0.0400, $0.0350</p>

Upticks should stay capped by a falling daily MA of 200 ($0.0650) to keep bears intact.<br /><br />On the daily chart, the technical structure remains bearish as negative momentum accelerates and the moving averages form a full bearish setup with a bull trap, further pressuring near-term action. Fresh bears might find a temporary foothold at $0.0456 support, with signs of extended consolidation while the price holds above this level.</p>
<h4>HBAR/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63459 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">HBAR/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></h6>
<p>HBAR/USD recovery might continue higher on a close above the 4-hour MA 50 at $0.0480, showing that the path of least resistance remains up. More traders may look to buy into strength as the pair claws back gains. <br /><br />The RSI’s consolidation condition may cause a limited recovery. Selling could be expected around the resistance level of $0.0500, which is a major cap that is likely to keep the price under. A new round of selling would send the price to a 12-month low and at the psychological level of $0.0400.</p>

<p>In response to the recent market chaos, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/sample-letter-companies-regarding-crypto-asset-markets#_ftnref2">released</a> new rules for firms making financial disclosures that require them to provide a more thorough record of their exposure to the crypto industry.<br /><br />The regulations, which are listed in a sample letter, cover more than just the quantity of cryptocurrencies listed on the balance sheet.<br /><br />Guidelines are also provided in the letter regarding exposure to third-party <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-market-crippled-in-afghanistan-by-taliban-study-claims/">crypto market</a> participants, liquidity risks for firms, financing risks for firms, and risks associated with &#8220;legal proceedings, investigations, or regulatory impacts&#8221; within the crypto markets.<br /><br />The regulator cited Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 and Securities Act Rule 408 when describing the most recent guidelines. Companies may be required to provide additional disclosures  “as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading” according to these rules.<br /><br />Firms were also urged to talk about the &#8220;downstream effect&#8221; of how their company, as well as their partners and customers, have been impacted by the bankruptcy of some third-party companies.<br /><br />In a broader sense, the letter prompted firms to reveal any &#8220;reputational harm&#8221; that might result from recent market disruption.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2022, who doesn&#8217;t know about Bitcoin? Bitcoin development has jumped by more than 200% since 2021.</p>

<h3>2. Referral program: Earn bonuses by referring friends</h3>
<p>You can earn money through various bitcoin <a href="https://bytebus.com/referralprogram?kryptomoney">referral program</a> by directing customers to their website or app. Referral program membership is free. After making an account, you will be given a unique URL. Spreading the URL on websites, blogs, forums, and social media is up to you.

Furthermore, money would keep coming in for days, weeks, months, and even years after you put in all that effort.

<h3>3. Airdrops</h3>
<p>What are Airdrops? In short, crypto airdrops allow a cryptocurrency company to share its crypto for free to increase the company&#8217;s name. Airdrops are part of their marketing.</p>
<p>Here, We will share a trick to get airdrops that are easy to sell.</p>
<p>Usually, to get free crypto from a company that does airdrops, you will have to do a few things. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liked Facebook page</li>
<li>Liked Youtube page</li>
<li>Liked Twitter page</li>
<li>Liked Instagram page</li>
<li>Follow the Telegram channel</li>
</ul>
<p>However, people participating in airdrops cannot immediately or instantly get these tokens. Usually, the company will distribute its tokens within two months or so for the vesting period (vesting period ).</p>
<p>These tokens usually cannot be sold immediately because no well-known exchanges register the crypto coin. Tokens are very rare to be directly listed on a crypto exchange.</p>
<h3>4. Coinmarketcap</h3>
<p>Who would have thought this site also gave free crypto? No responsibility; you sign in and immediately get crypto as a diamond.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are several steps you have to take to get free money.</p>
<p>The diamond cannot be sold or exchanged for Bitcoin or another crypto. However, you can still get free Bitcoins.</p>
<p>Check this link to see what items can be exchanged for Coinmarketcap Free Diamonds.</p>
<p>If you have seen, Diamond from Coinmarketcap can give you NFT that can be sold for thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Not only giving away free Bitcoins, but CoinMarketCap is also giving away free money and another crypto with the Learn-to-Earn feature, and you can earn money.</p>
<h3>5. Staking</h3>
<p>What is Staking?</p>
<p>Staking can be likened to a deposit in a bank. You save, and you will earn the crypto.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>If you are staking BTC, you will also be rewarded with BTC.</p>
<p>The best platform for staking right now is Binance. But, unfortunately, other brokers lost far from the number 1 crypto broker.</p>
<p>The results of Staking cannot be underestimated. For example: Currently, Binance is providing 40% APY Staking for $CAKE tokens (pancakeswap).</p>
<p>Imagine if you have 1000 CAKE, you can make 400 $ CAKE, which can be sold for the equivalent of US $ 1600.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Staking also has a drawback, namely price. You must have the capital to get a lot of cryptos.</p>
<p>Another drawback is the price when selling. For example, the cost of $CAKE is selling at $20 in 2021; if you stake and don&#8217;t sell, you will lose because in 2022, in September, the price of $cake is only $4.</p>
<p>Considering you are reading this, you are a beginner. If you&#8217;ve signed up on Binance, no matter how small your coins are and you can stake them, do it immediately.</p>
<h3>6. Bounty</h3>
<p>Bounties are rewards when you do something at a cryptocurrency company.</p>
<p>Usually, you will be rewarded with crypto if you write or promote the company&#8217;s token.</p>
<p>The easiest thing as an Indonesian is to promote the crypto company in your telegram group or translate their White-Paper into Indonesian.</p>
<p>The bounty rewards are also quite large; some can give you $200 worth of their tokens.</p>
<h3>7. Admin Telegram</h3>
<p>Working is one way of getting free Bitcoins in the crypto world. How come? Almost all crypto companies are overseas; with cryptocurrency payments, they can save on transaction fees as well as costs.</p>
<p>Almost all big companies need their admin on Telegram because the platform is a gathering place for the crypto world.</p>
<p>Admins on Telegram are usually paid using company tokens to save their fees.</p>

<p>At the time of publication, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-matic-up-8-amid-positive-news-polygon-sees-major-integration-with-the-graph-network/">MATIC</a> was changing hands at $0.92, up 3.94% in the last 24 hours. Banque SYZ (Bank Syz), a prominent Swiss private bank with $30 billion in AuM, has announced the introduction of its &#8220;Syz Crypto&#8221; product, via which the Geneva-based company will provide its Swiss and foreign clients with digital asset services, including as trading and custody.

<h4>MATIC/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63440 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-Dec-8-Daily.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-Dec-8-Daily.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-Dec-8-Daily-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-Dec-8-Daily-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-Dec-8-Daily-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-Dec-8-Daily-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-Dec-8-Daily-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD Daily Chart</span></h6>
<p><br />The MATIC price has been in a broadly sideways range since late July. On November 8, the price dropped to a low of $0.076, initiating a downside consolidation. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-here-are-key-levels-to-watch-nike-to-mint-nft-apparel-on-polygon-after-web3-platform-launch/">MATIC/USD</a> price is currently in a battle with the MA 50 barrier at $0.925 following a day-high. <br /><br />The price could rise to $1.113 after the MA 50. MATIC&#8217;s successful move above the MA 200 ($0.795) and prior&#8217;s days&#8217; high of $0.919 lends support to an upside move for the pair.</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63441 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></h6>
<p>On the 4-hour time frame, the MA 50 and 200 intersection at $0.925 could halt bullish movements in this region. However, a move higher might enable MATIC&#8217;s price to surpass the $1.00 psychological zone set. <br /><br />Meanwhile, selling interest below current levels may find support around the $0.800 level, which was taken from the most recent low before falling lower. The RSI indicator has risen past the neutral 50 level, which points to potential consolidation.</p>

<p>A US court has instructed the bankrupt cryptocurrency company <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/former-celsius-executive-hired-by-jpmorgan/">Celsius</a> to refund its customers $44 million in crypto assets.<br /><br />The crypto lender, which declared bankruptcy in July 2022, has been ordered by Chief Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn to return millions of dollars in cryptocurrency to its customers. The company has been ordered to refund its users $44 in crypto assets in September.<br /><br />Judge Glenn reportedly stated during the ruling, <em>&#8220;I want this case to move forward.&#8221; &#8221; I want creditors to recover as much as they possibly can as soon as they possibly can.&#8221;</em> <br /><br />In other news, the company has successfully petitioned the court to extend its exclusivity period until February 15, 2023, giving it the exclusive right to submit company reorganization plans under Chapter 11 guidelines.<br /><br />The Celsius team announced its liabilities were between $1 billion and $10 billion at the time of bankruptcy filing, with over 100,000 creditors.<br /><br />According to one report, Celsius had over $200 million in escrow. However, the majority of these funds (approximately $200,000) were reportedly transferred from interest-bearing to escrow accounts shortly before the bankruptcy filing. This could have given them the option to claim ownership of the funds in the custody accounts under the preferential transfer rules.<br /><br />However, the court order now requires that funds held in escrow accounts be returned to customers, even if they did not enter the company&#8217;s interest-bearing accounts. Celsius advisors and stakeholders determined that the funds held in the custody accounts belonged to the customers, not Celsius, and obtained the court order.<br /><br />Even after Celsius declared bankruptcy, there has been considerable uncertainty about the funds held by the company. Several high-level executives have been accused of focusing on themselves rather than the community. These allegations have primarily targeted ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky. He withdrew $10 million from the platform, according to reports in early October. Celsius immediately froze all user accounts and transactions while claiming that user funds were safe. A few days after this news broke, two other top executives were accused of stealing user funds.<br /><br />Former CSO Daniel Leon and CTO Nuke Goldstein allegedly withdrew $56 million with Mashinsky shortly before the company declared bankruptcy. The fact that all three top executives put their interests ahead of the community has been a source of contention for the community, leading to a general feeling of ill will, particularly toward the disgraced former CEO himself.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-developers-target-march-2023-153950997.html"> next hard fork</a>, dubbed <em>&#8220;Shanghai,&#8221;</em> will allow users to withdraw ether staked with network validators in March 2023, according to Ethereum developers.<br /><br />In a session held, core developers established a rough timeline for when the Shanghai upgrade should be completed. Shanghai, also known as<em> &#8220;Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895,&#8221;</em> is a planned upgrade that will enable validator staking withdrawals, which are currently unavailable on the network.<br /><br />Users cannot withdraw staked funds from the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-blockchain-developer-announces-new-smart-contract-language-called-fe/">Ethereum blockchain</a> at this time. Shanghai would address this issue while also providing greater flexibility and convenience to those who staked ether on the network before The Merge, the last upgrade in which Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake consensus.<br /><br />Due to potential technical difficulties or other unforeseen issues, there is no guarantee that the proposed timeline will be met.</p>
<p>Pooja Ranjan, a project manager at Ethereum Cat Herders who was present at the meeting said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Withdrawals will be enabled with Shanghai currently planned in March on the mainnet, if everything goes as planned.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developers also discussed a second hard fork, scheduled for sometime after Shanghai in the third quarter of 2023, which will introduce <em>&#8220;proto-danksharding,&#8221;</em> or EIP 4844, an upgrade that will increase the network&#8217;s capacity to handle more transactions.<br /><br />EIP 4844 will introduce a new type of transaction format to Ethereum called <em>&#8220;shard blob transactions,&#8221;</em> which will allow Ethereum nodes to temporarily store and access off-chain data to address the scaling needs of blockchain apps.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/12/06/dev-0139-launches-targeted-attacks-against-the-cryptocurrency-industry/">Microsoft&#8217;s</a> security division has investigated an attack in which a malicious actor targeted various cryptocurrency investment firms.</p>
<p>The threat actor, identified as DEV-013, was able to infiltrate chat groups on the popular messaging app Telegram and pose as a representative of a cryptocurrency investment firm. They pretended to talk about trading fees with VIP clients of major exchanges. The hacker had extensive knowledge of the subject, which made it easier for them to gain the trust of their victim.<br /><br />They intended to dupe <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/us-treasury-prohibits-tornado-cash-mixer-for-crypto-funds-laundering/">cryptocurrency investment</a> funds into downloading an Excel file. While the document contains accurate information about the fee structures of major cryptocurrency exchanges, it also contains a malicious macro that executes another Excel sheet in the background. This allows the bad actor to gain remote access to the infected system of the victim.<br /><br />Microsoft&#8217;s findings also imply that there may be other campaigns targeting crypto companies that use the same techniques. According to the tech titan, the cryptocurrency industry is &#8220;a field of interest&#8221; for cybercriminals. They can target both large and small businesses. Microsoft advises taking additional precautionary measures to avoid such attacks.<br /><br />This August, cybersecurity company Check Point Software Technologies discovered a cryptocurrency mining malware campaign that had infected over 111,000 users. Microsoft and the world&#8217;s largest chipmaker Intel announced a partnership last April to prevent malicious crypto mining.</p>
