<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-price-crosses-0-5-milestone-as-trading-volume-explodes-a-ripple-win-in-sec-case-imminent/">XRP Network</a> experienced a significant increase in address activity for two consecutive days, marking a historic milestone, as reported by the blockchain analysis platform, <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1663349921205088257?t=b15mJpgi45JSK_OJYoDUJA&amp;s=19">Santiment</a>.</p>



<p>The growing activity in addresses suggests the possibility of a rally for XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, as it has previously experienced a notable increase following a similar rise in address activity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="641" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-1024x641.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81689" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-1024x641.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-300x188.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-768x481.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-1536x962.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-increased-address-activity-suggests-a-potential-45-price-rise-for-xrp"><strong>Increased address activity suggests a potential 45%+ price rise for XRP</strong></h2>



<p>XRP&#8217;s price has risen by about 15% in the past week, from $0.4434 to $0.5053, which it currently maintains at the time of writing.</p>



<p>The price increase is in line with the increase in network address activity. Therefore, as Santiment suggests, it is possible that the price of XRP could increase by over 40%, similar to what happened in March when address activity saw a similar rise.</p>



<p>Similarly, there appears to be a slight disconnect between XRP and the rest of the crypto market, as XRP&#8217;s price is rising while many other coins are not. This could be an indication of a potentially more decisive trend change.</p>



<p>Currently, XRP is in a psychological price zone ($0.50), where bulls and bears are battling to determine the victor. Unless the price of XRP breaks strongly out of this zone, it is challenging to continue with a significant bullish movement.</p>



<p>Currently, several indicators such as moving averages, the squeeze momentum indicator, VPVP, and ADX suggest continuing a bullish movement on daily timeframes, which could lead XRP to reach or even surpass the previous high of $0.6 achieved in late March 2023.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2-1024x614.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81688" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2-1024x614.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2-300x180.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2-768x461.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2.png 1145w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ripple&#8217;s potential legal win may boost XRP&#8217;s bullish trend</strong></h2>



<p>The spikes in address activity on the XRP network occur at a time when many enthusiasts suggest that Ripple could <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-army-shower-confidence-on-a-ripple-win-in-sec-case-as-whales-load-up-heavily/">win the lawsuit</a> brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the classification of XRP as a security.</p>



<p>Even Ripple&#8217;s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-expects-final-decision-in-weeks/">given optimistic signals</a> pointing to the case being resolved in a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-boss-confident-groundbreaking-verdict-is-coming-in-weeks-after-hinman-speech-docs-win/">few weeks</a>, which would help boost XRP&#8217;s price prospects by eliminating regulatory uncertainties.</p>



<p>Therefore, in the short term and according to several indicators, it is highly likely that XRP will experience a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/fomo-will-kick-into-high-gear-when-xrp-price-roars-past-2-predicts-pro-ripple-attorney">bullish movement</a>. Who knows, it may finally manage to emerge from the abyss created by U.S. regulatory pressure.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin has slipped below $27,000 to end May in the red zone as wider market factors stifle the expectations of bullish investors.</li>



<li>Loretta Mester, a Federal Reserve official, shares her opinion on potentially negative job and inflation data.</li>



<li>Observers suggest that investors should brace for a slight downturn in the market outlook as the Feds will resume tightening liquidity if the debt ceiling is raised.</li>
</ul>



<p>The digital asset market recorded slight gains last week but faces a huge test following macroeconomic factors, including inflation concerns, and reduced liquidity following the lifting of the debt ceiling.</p>



<p>May is officially Bitcoin’s (BTC) worst-performing month since the collapse of FTX in Nov 2022, putting investors in a risky position. BTC plunged by 7.3% in the last 30 days while the wider crypto market declined 5%, although some positives were recorded in altcoins. </p>



<p>Adding to the woes of BTC, a job report set to be released this week may wipe off little gains in the market. Loretta Mester, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, stated in an interview with Financial Times that there is not enough evidence to pause the hikes in interest rates.</p>



<p>“<em>I don’t see a compelling reason to pause, meaning wait until you get more evidence to decide what to do.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Stressing that the Feds must do more to tackle inflation, her comments rattled traders dragging the market leader below $27,000. Furthermore, a report from the Jobs Opening and Labour Turnover (JOLTS) showed an increase in openings from 9.3 million to 10.01 million, justifying Mester&#8217;s arguments of a tight labour market.</p>



<p>There have been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bulls-set-eyes-above-30000-as-gold-taps-new-all-time-high/">reports</a> that the Feds could eventually pause the hike in interest rates with inflation cooling after ten previous hikes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-market-leaders-not-fazed-by-price-drop"><strong>Market leaders not fazed by price drop</strong></h2>



<p>The recent negatives recorded by BTC and other top assets have rattled traders, but several industry executives suggest that the major <a href="https://zycrypto.com/key-bitcoin-metrics-signal-potential-bull-run-despite-price-drop/">drivers</a> of BTC are waxing strong. Michael Silberberg of Alt Tab Capital noted that institutional investors are still attracted to the volatility in Bitcoin.</p>



<p><em>“This is a highly volatile market, which is one of the traits that attract institutional investors in the first place.”</em></p>



<p>Similarly, Mikkel Morch, an executive at Ark36, is not perturbed by the current macroeconomic effects on the market, adding that institutional interest and adoption point higher.</p>



<p>“<em>While short-term volatility persists due to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s tightening measures and ongoing global economic uncertainties, our stance at ARK36 remains bullish on Bitcoin for the long term,” </em>he explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap <a href="https://zycrypto.com/demand-for-usdt-erupts-in-lebanon-as-rising-inflation-kicks-in/">USDT</a>, has achieved a remarkable feat by surpassing its previous all-time high market cap of $83.2 billion, which was achieved earlier last month.</p>



<p>In a Thursday, June 1st, blogpost, Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Tether, highlighted this notable accomplishment emphasizing its importance and describing it as a manifestation of people&#8217;s desire for financial independence.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Today&#8217;s numbers demonstrate that people want access to financial freedom, and when given that access, they will make use of it. Tether tokens offer a safe harbor for the unbanked and enable individuals in emerging markets to preserve their purchasing power, even when their national currency is experiencing devaluation,”</em> <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-usdt-reaches-all-time-high-surpasses-previous-market-cap-high-of-832b/">said</a> Ardoino.</p>



<p>As per the blog, Tether’s market cap was partially catapulted by its exceptional performance in the first quarter, where it reported a net profit of $1.48 billion. Currently, the company’s reserves enjoy an impressive allocation of approximately 85% of investments in cash, cash equivalents, and other short-term deposits. Furthermore, with a 20% increase in token supply each quarter, Tether currently holds an extra $2.5 billion in reserves, exceeding the required minimum of 100%.</p>



<p>The firm has also been expanding its global reach, further underscoring the growing adoption of its stablecoin USDT, which is now the most traded cryptocurrency globally. Notably, in recent weeks, the stablecoin has surpassed the combined volume of all competing offerings, including USDC.</p>



<p>On May 31st, the firm announced its expansion in the republic of Georgia through a strategic investment in CityPay, a payment processing company that operates in various locations across the country, spanning over 600 establishments. The latest announcement brings Tether’s operations to over 120 countries worldwide with limited functionality in around 7 countries only.</p>



<p>Tether has also been expanding its endeavours beyond stablecoins, particularly emphasising <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tether-to-invest-15-of-its-net-monthly-profits-in-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, communication networks, and renewable energy ecosystems. Earlier this week, the firm revealed plans to commence sustainable Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay, a move that is aimed at stimulating the adoption of cryptocurrencies and the creation of employment opportunities for the local communities.</p>



<p>That said, Tether&#8217;s remarkable achievement of surpassing the $83.2 billion market cap milestone, compared to just $66.2 billion at the beginning of the year, highlights the increasing adoption of stablecoins and the growing demand for defi transactions. With its continued expansion, particularly in emerging markets, it will be interesting to see whether it will maintain its leadership position within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu, the popular meme-based cryptocurrency, has been gaining significant attention lately as the highly-anticipated launch of Shibarium approaches. Network activity surrounding Shiba Inu has witnessed an impressive surge, with a staggering 2,538 new SHIB addresses created in a single day, marking the highest increase in three months. This surge in network activity indicates growing interest and excitement as the community eagerly awaits the launch of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-triggers-explosive-momentum-for-0-001-shib-price-following-burn-portal-reveal/">Shibarium</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rising-network-activity-signals-enthusiasm"><strong>Rising Network Activity Signals Enthusiasm</strong></h2>



<p>The recent network data highlights the remarkable surge in Shiba Inu network activity.</p>



<p>The creation of 2,538 new SHIB addresses in a single day speaks volumes about SHIB&#8217;s enthusiasm and engagement. The Shiba Inu community is actively participating in the network, potentially paving the way for new opportunities and developments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="695" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1024x695.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81666" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1024x695.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-300x203.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-768x521.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1536x1042.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2048x1389.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One cannot overlook the significance of the highly-anticipated Shibarium launch in relation to the surge in network activity. Shibarium is an upcoming layer-2 blockchain network being developed within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, aiming to provide users with a secure and efficient blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>Shibarium is poised to revolutionize the Shiba Inu ecosystem by providing a dedicated platform for trading SHIB and exploring the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The decentralized exchange component of Shibarium will allow users to trade SHIB tokens with ease, fostering liquidity and enabling seamless transactions within the Shiba Inu community. Additionally, the NFT marketplace will enable creators and collectors to engage in the vibrant world of digital art and collectibles, further expanding the utility and appeal of Shiba Inu.</p>



<p>The increasing network activity and the upcoming Shibarium launch have fueled a sense of anticipation and investor confidence within the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-community-heightens-token-burns-as-shibarium-renews-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib/">Shiba Inu community</a>. The surge in new SHIB addresses indicates that more investors are seeking to participate in the ecosystem and potentially benefit from the forthcoming developments. This growing confidence is further reflected in the rising trading volumes and market capitalization of SHIB.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community Excitement and Future Prospects</strong></h2>



<p>The escalating network activity and growing investor sentiment surrounding Shiba Inu indicate a thriving community that eagerly anticipates the launch of Shibarium. With increased SHIB addresses being created, it is evident that SHIB enthusiasts are positioning themselves to take advantage of the forthcoming platform&#8217;s potential. The excitement stems from the belief that Shibarium could potentially elevate the Shiba Inu project to new heights in terms of utility and market capitalization and further boost SHIB&#8217;s price to the highly-coveted $0.001 price point.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81667" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SHIBUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SHIBUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Furthermore, the launch of Shibarium is expected to attract attention from crypto enthusiasts beyond the existing Shiba Inu community. The dedicated exchange and NFT marketplace offer unique opportunities for traders and collectors, potentially drawing new users to the ecosystem. This influx of participants has the potential to contribute to increased liquidity and trading volume, bolstering the overall health and growth of the Shiba Inu network.</p>

<p>On May 27, the municipal government of Beijing announced the release of a whitepaper providing information on Web3 innovation and development in China. It focuses on innovative research areas such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-confluence-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-blockchain-technology/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, XR interactive terminals, and content production tools.</p>



<p>The Municipal Commission of Science and Technology of Beijing presented the whitepaper during the Zhongguancun Forum. Despite existing restrictions on cryptocurrencies, Beijing is showing interest in Web3 and plans to allocate 100 million yuan (approximately $14 million) annually until 2025 to drive various related initiatives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-china-s-whitepaper-highlights-web3-industry-focus-areas"><strong>China&#8217;s whitepaper highlights Web3 industry focus areas</strong></h2>



<p>China&#8217;s whitepaper emphasizes key technologies like blockchain, VR, and AI for their industrial application in Web3. Additionally, it underscores the government&#8217;s intention to provide all necessary political support to accelerate technological advancements and foster rapid growth in the Web3 industry.</p>



<p>The whitepaper also mentions emerging applications, such as digital verifications and NFT collections, which have experienced rapid growth and development. It highlights the active involvement of social organizations related to Web3 and the gradual rationalization of the global capital market.</p>



<p>Moreover, Beijing aims to establish a leadership position in the country in terms of development policies and innovative companies by implementing comprehensive measures to accelerate the construction of an internationally competitive <a href="https://zycrypto.com/web3-lawyer-backs-ripple-amid-discovery-of-conversation-between-sec-staff-prior-to-the-hinman-speech/">Web3</a>. The city proposes to strengthen political support and organizational guarantees to achieve its objectives of standing out as an innovative city.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Will Hong Kong open its doors to cryptocurrencies?</strong></h2>



<p>Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1662334590332153868">commented</a> on the whitepaper release, noting that it is interesting that it coincides closely with June 1, the day on which new updates are expected regarding the regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The idea of Hong Kong legalizing cryptocurrencies may not be so far-fetched, considering that earlier this year, Paul Chan, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, announced the completion of the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Despite cryptocurrency volatility, he emphasized the government&#8217;s commitment to becoming a crypto hub.</p>



<p>Furthermore, during an April press conference, the secretary stated that for Web3 to continue its innovative development path, the government must adopt a strategy that &#8220;emphasizes both proper regulation and development promotion.&#8221;</p>



<p>This means that, unlike other countries like the United States, where regulations or the lack of clear regulations on the crypto ecosystem have led to the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-in-shock-as-bittrex-exchange-shuts-down-u-s-operations/">closure</a> of several cryptocurrency exchanges, Hong Kong plans to be less restrictive and more friendly to crypto companies.</p>

<ul>
<li>In four European countries, Binance will pause trading services for a dozen privacy coins, including Monero and Zcash.</li>



<li>The exchange cited regulatory compliance as the key reason for this development, with the EU pushing through with MiCA.</li>



<li>Users mull over the effect of delisting privacy coins which have gained traction in recent years following harsh regulations.</li>
</ul>



<p>Privacy coins like Monero and Zcash shield user identities and transactions from regulators but have been criticized for aiding money laundering and other illegal activities.</p>



<p>Binance has announced its decision to delist twelve privacy coins in France, Spain, Italy and Poland in the wake of new cryptocurrency regulations. The leading digital asset exchange will halt trading services for users in a dozen privacy coins from June 26.</p>



<p>The affected privacy coins include Monero (XMR), Verge (XVG), MobileCoin (MOB), Firo (FIRO), BEAM, Zcash (ZEC), Horizon (ZEN), Navcoin (NAV), PIVX, Secret (SCRT), Decred (DCR) and Dash (DASH).</p>



<p>The announcement comes when the European Union (EU) authorities have begun <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-as-eus-mica-regulation-gets-another-green-light/">enforcing</a> several aspects of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework. MiCA is opposed to privacy coins unless such a company can verify the identity of its users. This is quite a stretch, as many have argued that it may defeat the purpose of privacy coins.</p>



<p>Some regulators within the EU have criticized cryptocurrencies for acting as a catalyst to boost money laundering operations and other illicit transactions worldwide. Binance stated that its decision to delist the assets was based on regulatory compliance, as the exchange aims to observe all laws in the financial market.</p>



<p><em>“As part of Binance’s ongoing compliance processes, we have reached out to affected users to notify them that they will no longer be able to purchase or trade privacy tokens on our platform,&#8221;​ </em>the statement reads. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harsh-reactions-trail-binance-s-decision"><strong>Harsh reactions trail Binance’s decision</strong></h2>



<p>Although bad actors could use privacy coins for illegal transactions, users have argued that an outright ban is a reach for even the EU. Both digital asset users and the industry executives have criticized the move, with some calling it an “<em>attempt by regulators to undermine the sector one coin at a time.”</em></p>



<p>Despite expressing his disappointment, Guy Zyskind, Secret&#8217;s CEO noted that Secret is not essentially a privacy coin and should not be included in the ban.</p>



<p>“<em>Secret is not a privacy coin. We reached out to Binance to clarify this. Secret’s transactions are public, it’s data in smart contracts that remain confidential. In fact, Secret is much more appropriate for GDPR-type applications in the blockchain setting,” </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twitter users have lashed out at the development, lamenting the huge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-usd-stablecoin-gets-booted-off-coinbase-amid-mounting-regulatory-pressure/">pressure</a> mounted on digital asset exchanges by regulators. </p>

<p>Staking baskets have revolutionized how ADA holders can delegate their tokens to various stake pools, a key step for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/hoskinson-cardano-to-achieve-unrivaled-decentralization-in-crypto-after-major-project-developments/">Cardano&#8217;s decentralized environment</a>. With this novel strategy, users can diversify their bets and maximize returns while also simplifying the staking process. Let&#8217;s examine how staking baskets change the staking environment for Cardano’s ADA.</p>



<p>Staking baskets, a concept gaining popularity in the blockchain industry, let users split their stakes among several properly chosen stake pools. Staking baskets allow for diversification, lowering the risks associated with relying on the performance of a single pool, in contrast to traditional staking, which mandates that investors select a single pool to delegate their tokens.</p>



<p>Holders of ADA can benefit from more constant returns and reduce the impact of underperforming pools by spreading their stakes through staking baskets. By utilizing the various performance and fee structures of several pools, this strategy maximizes the possibility of receiving staking rewards.</p>



<p>Due to variety and bigger payouts, assigning ADA to numerous pools generally seems more appealing. Diversification allows ADA stakers to avoid investing their stake size in pools that do not support block validation. In addition to &#8220;standard&#8221; ADA awards, developers provide bonuses in the protocol&#8217;s native tokens. The creators of the customised staking pool series can reward their delegators with different tokens in addition to ADA.</p>



<p>The addition of an easy-to-use staking tool for Cardano improves the stake experience even further. With the help of this tool, ADA owners may easily distribute their tokens across up to 50 different stake pools. The tool simplifies the procedure for experienced investors and those new to the cryptocurrency market thanks to its user-friendly layout.</p>



<p>Users of the staking tool can quickly examine and contrast different stake pools based on performance indicators, costs, and other important considerations. Because of the transparency, users can choose the pools that best suit their reward expectations and risk tolerance. The straightforward delegation procedure guarantees that ADA holders can stake their assets successfully and without hassles.</p>



<p>The introduction of staking baskets and user-friendly staking tools has various advantages for the Cardano ecosystem. Staking baskets assist in fostering diversification, which leads to a more robust and resilient network. Additionally, the user-friendly staking tool makes staking accessible to a larger audience, luring both seasoned investors and those just entering the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Decentralization within the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-network-roars-back-to-life-as-developers-fix-brief-node-outage-in-minutes/">Cardano network</a> is facilitated by the greater usability and accessibility provided by staking baskets and the ADA staking tool. The network becomes more secure and resistant to centralization concerns as more users engage in staking and assign their tokens to multiple stake pools.</p>



<p>The future of staking ADA appears bright with the ongoing developments in staking technology. Staking bins and user-friendly tools represent a commitment to enhancing usability and accessibility within the Cardano ecosystem. Innovations like staking baskets are advancing Cardano as a premier blockchain platform as defi gains rage.</p>

<p>The Solana network has been on a tear this month, experiencing a substantial increase in its user base, leading to the successful breach of the critical $20 price resistance level for its native cryptocurrency SOL.</p>



<p>Despite being generally in the red this month, Solana&#8217;s price has been on an upward trajectory since last Thursday, surging roughly 10%. Over the past 24 hours, the tenth largest crypto asset by market cap has increased by about 1.2% and was trading at $20.72 at press time on Monday.</p>



<p>SOL’s growth can be attributed to several factors, key among them the impressive surge in the number of active users on the Solana network. According to data from Dune Analytics, the number of active Solana users on May 1 skyrocketed to roughly 3.5 million, marking an astonishing 146% surge compared to April 1. This surge brings the total number of unique active users on Solana&#8217;s network to an all-time high of 39.75 million.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="596" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-35-1024x596.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81649" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-35-1024x596.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-35-300x175.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-35-768x447.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-35.png 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>According to experts, the surge in Solana&#8217;s user base can be attributed to the high transaction fees on <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-surpasses-ethereum-in-most-on-chain-active-addresses/">Ethereum</a> and other networks, particularly those involving NFTs, which have prompted users to explore alternative Layer 1 networks, with a considerable number migrating to Solana.</p>



<p>On Sunday, May 28, Tom Dunleavy, a former analyst at onchain analysis firm Messari highlighted Solana&#8217;s exponential growth in user numbers noting that Solana has experienced a massive spike in active users this month, making it difficult for Ethereum maximalists to ignore the platform.</p>



<p><em>“Even if you are an Eth maxi hard to not have a small allocation here with so users, devs and call options not priced in (ie mobile, neon, things eth can&#8217;t do (ie order book, xnfts)”</em> tweeted Dunleavy.</p>



<p>Solana’s popularity has also been fueled by the network’s expansion into AI with a new Chat GPT plugin. The plug-in, which Solana Labs had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sol-jumps-over-8-as-solana-makes-groundbreaking-entry-into-ai-with-chatgpt-plugin/">hinted at</a> in late April, was eventually integrated into the network last week and is aimed at facilitating user onboarding into the web3 space. Among many other uses, the plug-in allows users to perform various tasks such as buying and listing NFTs, token transfers, transaction tracking and discovering NFT collections based on their floor prices.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, despite Solana’s explosion in the network activity, its total volume locked (TVL) had dropped slightly from about 280 million at the start of April to 270 million at press time, <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana?tvl=true">according</a> to DefiLlama.</p>



<p>That said, despite the slowdown in TVL, Solana’s surging user base and positive price momentum have relieved investors who are still contending with the post-FTX debacle losses. As users seek alternatives to high-fee networks, Solana&#8217;s performance and increasing adoption could help get SOL’s price out of the woods.</p>

<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility persisted on the final day of May as prices continued to drop amidst a broader pullback in the crypto market.</p>



<p>Last Sunday, Bitcoin showed signs of recovery with a 4% surge, reaching $28,400. However, the gains were short-lived, and over the past three days, the price retraced, wiping out more than half of the previous gains and potentially setting the trend for June.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the sharp price drop, several key metrics within the Bitcoin market indicate the potential for a bullish trend. On Tuesday, pseudonymous analyst “Cryptohell” from onchain analytics firm Cryptoquant highlighted the declining supply of BTC circulating on exchanges, a key indicator of a potential bull run.</p>



<p>In a post on the firm’s website, the pundit noted that since May 1, 2023, the exchange reserve metric had experienced a substantial decline, indicating a reduction in the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges.</p>



<p><em>“At least the amount of Bitcoin circulating on exchanges has decreased in the past month. Specifically, if we calculate based on the Exchange Reserve USD metric, it indicates that exchanges have lost approximately $7 billion worth of Bitcoin,” </em>he wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="645" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-33-1024x645.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81629" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-33-1024x645.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-33-300x189.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-33-768x484.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-33.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Furthermore, the pundit highlighted the deposit trend, which also exhibited a decline throughout the past month. He also analyzed historical transaction data from July 2019, concluding that it revealed a similar decrease in deposit transactions preceding a BTC price increase that preceded the May 2020 halving event. Based on these findings and considering the upcoming halving, Cryptohell concluded that these findings suggest a potentially positive market trend.</p>



<p>Another analyst from the same company, known as &#8220;onchain&#8221;, pointed out the UTXO Value Bands indicator, a tool to measure how much Bitcoin large investors are <a href="https://zycrypto.com/long-term-bitcoin-holders-defy-market-uncertainty-setting-the-stage-for-further-growth/">accumulating</a>. This indicator looks at the different values of Bitcoin being held and helps identify trends in the overall Bitcoin supply. When there is an increase in the percentage of Bitcoin held in the +10K BTC band, it means that significant investors are accumulating more Bitcoin. The pundit shared a chart showing that the number of Bitcoins held in this band has increased from 1,742,300 BTC to 1,774,200 BTC, suggesting a potential increase in demand and a subsequent price rise.</p>



<p>Echoing the sentiment of cautious accumulation, onchain analytics firm Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1663295838565838848">tweeted</a> on May 30 that addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoins have accumulated a combined total of 93,000 BTC during the price fluctuations witnessed between $26,000 and $30,000 over the past month.</p>



<p>That said, despite the decline in price and the numerous fluctuations in the market, these crucial metrics indicate the possibility of a bullish trend for Bitcoin. Investors are thus likely to consider these indicators alongside their other price analysis tools to gain valuable insights into the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory.</p>

<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $27,068, down 3% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Blockchain gaming boasts a $4.6 billion market capitalization with an expected growth of 70% to hit $60 billion by 2027, according to a MarketsandMarkets Analysis.</p>



<p>Sandeep Nailwal, a co-founder of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-whale-moves-millions-in-matic-as-the-networks-exchange-supply-jumps-to-5-week-high/">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/13qngw0/hi_rindia_i_am_sandeep_nailwal_cofounder_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">believes</a> the once-bubbling blockchain gaming industry can make a comeback and drive the next mass adoption of crypto. Addressing the community on Reddit, he was asked about real-life uses of cryptocurrencies apart from payments. </p>



<p>He responded by tipping blockchain games as the future of the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>I think gaming is the largest scale opportunity for crypto. There are some top games launching in Web3 in the next 6-18 months and it would be very interesting to see if some of them are able to crack the crypto code. Last year itself there was $2 billion+ in funding for Web3 games,”</em> he said.</p>



<p><em>Polygon combined with its ecosystem players like IMX [Immutable X], got the lion&#8217;s share in terms of those funded games. Fingers crossed for some of them to go big,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>The community also sought clarity why digital assets have become too speculative. Nailwal did not deny the speculative nature of crypto but stated that it has become the “<em>boon and band of crypto.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Boon because it attracts top talent towards the industry, bane because obviously, a large number of users and applications are speculative in nature. But one could argue that any potential big industry invites a lot of speculation early on. It was the same with the Gold rush area and it was also the same for the Dot com boom,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-users-question-centralization"><strong>Users question centralization</strong></h2>



<p>Concluding the session with the community, users questioned the centralization of most web3 firms despite their decentralization claims. Nailwal noted that only Bitcoin and Ethereum have achieved better decentralization, as the rest are still playing catch up. </p>



<p>“<em>Crypto is still in its nascent stage. I don’t believe that any blockchain ecosystem, except Bitcoin and Ethereum, is fully decentralized yet. It’s not necessarily important that networks are fully decentralized from the get-go,” </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, Polygon’s Nakamoto Coefficient was described as being too low by users. Nakamoto&#8217;s Coefficient rating measures a network’s level of decentralization. Polygon has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/13qngw0/hi_rindia_i_am_sandeep_nailwal_cofounder_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">rating</a> of four according to NakaFlow, indicating that four nodes control a third of Polygon. </p>



<p>Nailwal explained that the network has two chains with the Polygon POS and not the Polygon zkEVM having a low Nakamoto Coefficient. He, however noted that the Polygon POS will become more decentralized.</p>



<p>“<em>Eventually we expect all public (non-app-specific) chains to have large decentralization factors, and we are working on some really big releases in the coming days. The eventual goal is to take the Polygon ecosystem to have 1000s of validators.” </em></p>

<p>XRP, a digital coin often used to make international payments, has stolen the crypto market spotlight once again after hitting the key $0.5 resistance mark— a potential signal of how investors feel regarding an ongoing legal battle<a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/217017/ripple-industry-wait-to-see-if-xrp-case-will-be-a-small-splash-or-a-tsunami-for-crypto"> </a>brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against associated blockchain payments firm Ripple.</p>



<p>XRP posted as much as 5 percent in gains over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.511 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko data. The upward price action was accompanied by an impressive 82.37% spike in trading volume during the same timeframe.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-making-waves"><strong>XRP Making Waves</strong></h2>



<p>XRP has been on a roll in recent days following reports the SEC’s landmark case against Ripple was tilting in favour of the San Francisco-based firm. Today, a sudden spike in trading volume hurled the XRP price above the important $0.5 level.</p>



<p>XRP currently has a $26 billion market cap, which translates into a 24-hour increase of 4.68 percent. Perhaps even more notably, XRP is the top gainer among major tokens as it is now up 13.46 percent over the past seven days.</p>



<p>On-chain analytics firm Santiment recently<a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1663349921205088257"> pointed out</a> that XRP has enjoyed the second and third-largest surges in address activity in history in the last 2 days. Compared to a similar occurrence on March 18, expecting further price appreciation for XRP is reasonable. Should history repeat itself, the token’s price could jump 45% in the space of 10 days following the latest increase in activity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Next For XRP Price?</strong></h2>



<p>There does not appear to have been a clear catalyst for today’s XRP upsurge. However, it could be an indication that the bulls anticipate some truly good news about XRP and its ecosystem in the near future. For one, some insiders believe the SEC v. Ripple case is about to come to an end. Finally.</p>



<p>Notably, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">dismissed </a>the SEC&#8217;s motion to seal the Commission’s internal communications that occurred before a speech by its former director, Willian Hinman, in June 2018. In that speech, Hinman posited that the Ether token is not a security asset.</p>



<p>The unsealing of these documents could push Ripple toward a critical legal victory, given its ability to prove that XRP is also not a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-boss-confident-groundbreaking-verdict-is-coming-in-weeks-after-hinman-speech-docs-win/">expressed confidence</a> that a final verdict in the lawsuit could be coming “in weeks”. Ripple’s win will undoubtedly set off a mega-bullish impulse for XRP as well as bring cheer to the broader crypto market, but a defeat could rekindle risk aversion.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin trades at a huge discount on Binance Australia if paid for using the Australian Dollar as the fiat deadline nears.</li>



<li>Traders looking to cash in on the discounted BTC were stunned by the inability to deposit Australian dollars in wallets and other conversion obstacles.</li>



<li>Binance continues to experience difficulties in Australia as its derivatives license was rescinded by regulators last month.</li>
</ul>



<p>Binance announced on May 18 that it would shut its Australian dollar services due to a decision from its third-party agent in the country. A move that may have triggered chaos.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) is trading for about $22,000 on Binance Australia, a massive 21% drop when traded against the Australian dollar. The massive discount comes as the deadline for local bank withdrawals in Australian dollars nears.</p>



<p>At press time, one BTC exchanges hands globally for $26,953 but trades in Binance Australia at roughly  $21,998. Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance_aus/status/1659018600496373760?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">informed</a> users that funds left in AUD will be converted to USD Tether but even that has failed to stop the panic in the markets.</p>



<p>The panic and rush to cash out have led to the price being largely discounted at a 21% rate. A Binance spokesperson has confirmed the position adding that the platform will look for an alternative soon.</p>



<p>“<em>Due to the recent removal of fiat on-ramp services by our payment processor’s banking partner, some Australian users have been withdrawing their AUD holdings from the platform in advance of the off-ramp closure on 1 June. As a result, AUD pairs have experienced less liquidity which has impacted their pricing. We will be delisting the remaining AUD pairs in line with the closure of fiat off-ramp services. We remain focused on securing additional fiat relationships to serve our users.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-no-room-for-arbitrage-gains"><strong>No room for arbitrage gains</strong></h2>



<p>A 21% discount on the price of Bitcoin is a good arbitrage opportunity with many tweeting on plans for a huge gain. However, traders now face certain hurdles as the platform has halted deposits in Australian dollars coupled with the popular asset conversion now becoming a Herculean task due to the premium placed on it.</p>



<p>Furthermore, while the company has announced a search for an alternative local payment provider, it will delist several trading pairs on the AUD on June 1 telling users to <em>“pay attention to the risks when trading.”</em></p>



<p>The exchange is under fire for that decision as analysts have described it as compounding the woes of users in a short period. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, is under regulatory <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-prepares-to-pay-fines-to-settle-outstanding-u-s-regulatory-probes/">pressure</a> from many jurisdictions including Australia.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/Solana/">Solana</a>, a blockchain platform renowned for its quick and inexpensive transactions, is competing to become the &#8220;next Apple&#8221; of the cryptocurrency realm. Despite repeated outages that have prompted questions about its stability and grandiose plans, Solana is adamant about capturing the crypto crown.</p>



<p>The fundamental objective of Solana is to provide a blockchain infrastructure that can facilitate the widespread adoption of dApps and promote innovation across multiple industries. Solana Co-founder Raj Gokal spoke about this in a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/29/solanas-crypto-raj-gokal-interview/">interview</a> with Techcrunch+ and underlined the value of performance and scalability in realizing this vision, which has been Solana&#8217;s main area of concentration.</p>



<p>But repeated <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-over-10-network-outages-solana-proposes-a-genius-solution-to-solve-debacle/">Solana outages</a> have prompted questions about the blockchain&#8217;s capacity to keep its promises. The platform experienced two big issues the previous month that caused network disruption and a transaction halt. Critics questioned the dependability of Solana&#8217;s infrastructure as a result of the dissatisfied users.</p>



<p>In response to these worries, Gokal admitted the outages and blamed them on the platform&#8217;s quick expansion. He reassured users that the team was actively working to address the fundamental problems and enhance the system&#8217;s stability. Gokal stressed the significance of taking lessons from these occurrences and putting them into practice to minimize similar disruptions in the future.</p>



<p>Analysts and investors have been paying attention to Solana despite the losses. According to InvestAnswers, a well-known provider of investing research, the value of SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, should be at least three times higher than it is right now. The outfit attributed its projection to Solana&#8217;s technological breakthroughs and scaling possibilities.</p>



<p>Solana is determined to overcome its obstacles because it wants to be the next Apple in the cryptocurrency industry. The platform is now a real competitor for the crypto throne because of its solid technological capabilities and rising popularity. Even if recent outages have put Solana&#8217;s resilience to the test, the enterprise is steadfast in its resolve to resolve these problems and fulfil its commitments.</p>



<p>However, it first needs to address the serious concerns about network outages. All eyes will be on Solana as the cryptocurrency market develops to see if it can keep its speed and become the disruptive force it aims to be. Solana&#8217;s future will likely be shaped by the upcoming months, which will decide if it can maintain its position as a pioneer in the blockchain sector and possibly realize its goal of becoming the Apple of Crypto.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden announced in a May 28, 2023 Tweet that a budget agreement on raising the US debt limit had been reached in principle, and he strongly urged the House of Representatives and the Senate to pass the deal right away.</p>



<p>This follows days of uncertainty over when an agreement on the U.S. debt ceiling would be reached, raising fears of a potential debt default in early June.</p>



<p>On May 26, 2023, the Secretary of the Treasury, Janet L. Yellen, sent another letter to all members of Congressional leadership highlighting the risk that the Treasury would be unable to satisfy its obligations if Congress did not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.</p>



<p>In a Tweet, Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, also confirmed that a tentative agreement had been reached. Details of the debt ceiling agreement will be shared by McCarthy shortly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-analysts-are-divided-over-the-impact-the-debt-ceiling-crisis-would-have-on-the-crypto-markets">Analysts are divided over the impact the debt ceiling crisis would have on the crypto markets</h2>



<p>Some analysts have argued that problems in the traditional finance market have tended to increase investor interest in cryptocurrency. Raising the debt ceiling would prompt more money printing and boost capital inflows into the crypto industry.</p>



<p>Other analysts are of the view that problems in the traditional finance market can prove bearish for crypto in the long term.</p>



<p>Still, some other analysts believe that a U.S. debt default could see stablecoins lose their investment appeal since some stablecoins hold reserves in short-term U.S. government bonds and cash (in U.S. dollars).</p>



<p>In the 24 hours preceding the debt ceiling tentative agreement, Bitcoin and Ether were trading under US$27,000 and US$1,840, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. In the 24 hours following the announcement of the tentative debt ceiling agreement, Bitcoin and Ether traded over US$ 27,000 and US$ 1,850, respectively.</p>



<p>In a statement, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commended the tentative deal to prevent the debt Limit Crisis. The U.S. Chamber President and CEO, Suzanne P. Clark, said the U.S. is a step closer to averting an economic crisis.</p>



<p>The US Chamber of Commerce said that the agreement would see the U.S. confronting a future debt limit drama and lower the national debt. The Chamber of Commerce called for Republicans and Democrats to work together to secure the nation’s economic future and competitiveness.</p>



<p>The details of the debt ceiling agreement, its approval through Congress in the coming days, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for June 13-14 will likely provide further direction to the crypto and other financial markets.</p>
