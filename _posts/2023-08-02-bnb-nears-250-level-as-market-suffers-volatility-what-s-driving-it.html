Binance’s utility coin BNB has posted significant gains, surprising investors as the broader crypto market slumps. Bitcoin and Ethereum, including most altcoins, have gone on recess while BNB surges amid rapid expansion plans on the Binance ecosystem. BNB’s spike on Tuesday, August 1, hinged on Binance&#8217;s announcement about the asset&#8217;s debut in the Japanese market through its newly launched subsidiary, Binance Japan. BNB jumped dramatically from $236.8555 to $246.0655, a nearly 4% increase, immediately after the news circulated the market.  BNB Price Bullish Amid Japanese Debut It is noteworthy that BNB is launching on Binance Japan for the first time since the history of Binance. Moreover, Binance Japan is the only Japanese exchange offering the token on its platform. Therefore, venturing into a new market is like achieving a major milestone for BNB and could guarantee a wider user base and increased daily transactions for the token. Alongside the announcement for the launch of Binance Japan, Binance is offering spot and leverage crypto trading on 34 cryptocurrencies. This vast list potentially entails more transactions on Binance, leading to more BNB spending as the platform&#8217;s utility token. Related Reading: Sell The News?

CoinMarketCap data shows BNB recorded over $1 billion in trading volume toward the close of Monday’s trading session.  The token saw an over 253% surge in trading volume on July 31, which didn&#8217;t reflect its nearly 1% price decline during the same period. After the sudden surge in trading activity and price, BNB&#8217;s movement has stalled as 24-hour trading volume stands at $734 million, with a 0.6% price increase in the last 24 hours. As of the time of writing, BNB trades at $242.9, inching closer to the $250 level as traders accumulate the token in anticipation of major rallies as it trades live on Binance Japan in the coming days.  BNB Vies For More Rallies As It Prepares To Conquer Key Resistance Levels Binance Coin (BNB) trades above three key support levels: $240.4, $242.0, and $243.3. The bulls found strength at $242.0 and $243.3 price levels, facilitating the sharp spike to $246.065 in the early hours of August 1. The chart demonstrates heated strife between the bulls and the bears as they struggle to prevail over the market. However, the stiff resistance at the $246.5 price level allowed the sellers to trigger a trend reversal. The bears have formed bearish candle sticks above the $243.3 price level and are striving to press the token further below.

A break above the $246.5 level will facilitate more rallies. Conversely, if the bulls relent, BNB could retrace to the $241.3 level, allowing the bears an opportunity to soar.
