CZ took to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1671295082920591366?s=20">Twitter</a>, sharing a screenshot of a Wall Street Journal article about the exchange and commenting on its impeccable timing.</p>
<h2>CZ Binance Supports New Crypto Exchange</h2>
<p>Binance CEO CZ tweeted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Impeccable timing. But the more the merrier.</p></blockquote>
<p>Applauding developments in times of regulatory scrutinies, he believes more competition in the crypto space is a positive thing. Clearly as a crypto exchange CEO, he is not threatened by emerging players due to its broader vision.</p>
<p>Though CZ Binance has <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-ceo-says-he-is-pleased-the-sec-disagreement-is-over/">expressed</a> relief over SEC disagreement settlement, SEC is still wary of crypto developments in the US. New Exchange EDX, a &#8220;noncustodial&#8221; platform. is set to offer trading exclusively in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) initially.</p>
<p>The company plans to launch a clearing house later this year to settle trades. According to the Wall Street Journal, even after the clearing house is operational, EDX intends to rely on third-party banks and a crypto custodian to hold customer assets.</p>
<h3>Timing Matters In Crypto World</h3>
<p>This move comes as both Binance, including CZ Binance and <a href="https://coingape.com/sec-sues-coinbase-exchange-day-after-binance-lawsuit/">Coinbase</a> face legal action from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulatory scrutiny surrounding crypto exchanges has been primarily driven by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler&#8217;s assertion that most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities falling under the agency&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/binance-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read More About SEC v. Binance Lawsuit</a></strong></p>
<p>Recently, SEC Chair spoke about the need to protect investors, saying the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto markets</a> should not be allowed to harm them.</p>
<p>In addition to the backing from prominent US firms Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments, EDX recently concluded a funding round with investors such as Miami International Holdings, DV Crypto, GTS, GSR Markets LTD, and HRT Technology.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, June 20, the share price of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: GBTC) shot up by a staggering 11.40% ending the trading at $16.85. The surge in the GBTC share price came as it recorded the highest trading volume of $10.24 million, since November 22 last year.</p>
<p>Citing data from CryptoQuant, popular crypto journalist Colin Wu <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1671328483493154816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>: &#8220;GBTC has rallied more than 25% since BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin ETF like GBTC application. CryptoQuant shows that the current GBTC premium is -34.19%, the second highest point this year&#8221;.</p>
<p>The recent activity surge in GBTC comes as some of the top financial players have been applying for a spot-Bitcoin ETF. As we know, Grayscale has been one of the forerunners in the race of bringing a spot Bitcoin ETF to the market.</p>
<p>BlackRock submitted their application at the same time that Grayscale Investments is having a legal dispute with the SEC to change the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF backed by physical assets. The discount between the trust&#8217;s value and its net asset value has significantly reduced, as there is speculation that BlackRock&#8217;s action might strengthen Grayscale&#8217;s argument.</p>
<h3>Will BlackRock&#8217;s Market Entry Impact Grayscale?</h3>
<p>Grayscale is one of the world&#8217;s largest digital asset managers, however, the entry of giants like BlackRock could possibly threaten its stronghold in the market. Asset manager Grayscale has been suing the US SEC in order to upgrade its trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles to Grayscale could be the hefty fee that it charges to traders. According to data from The Block Research, the company generated over $230 million from its main GBTC and ETHE products since the start of the year. However, the annual fees of 2.0% and 2.5% that the company charges for managing those assets may decrease if BlackRock is able to launch a competing product successfully, as suggested by James Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence.</p>

The largest cryptocurrency’s Tuesday climb seemed unstoppable as it blasted through the next resistance at $28,000.</p>
<p>The price breached a subsequent hurdle at $29,000 but has retreated to trade at $28,743 as investors usher in the European session. Prominent analysts like Michaël van de Poppe have attributed the sudden bullish outlook to Blackrock’s intended debut into the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Blackrock, a global behemoth spanning many industries, filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> shows some interesting structures.</p>
<p>Held above the 200-Week EMA and bounced firmly from that area.</p>
<p>Secondly, previous resistance becomes support, through which a new rally can start.</p>
<p>Coming weeks we&#8217;ll see, but another rally to $38K is on the cards. <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://t.co/q0RxP20wbl">pic.twitter.com/q0RxP20wbl</a></p>
<p>— Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1671256355217477632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Optimism has been building around this particular application, despite the SEC having rejected many similar proposals in the past. The move also serves as validation of the crypto market to institutional investors, many of whom have since the application expressed interest in the market.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Approaches $30,000 As Fidelity-Backed EDX Markets Begins Operations</h2>
<p>In an interesting turn of events, <a href="https://coingape.com/edx-markets-backed-by-fidelity-citadel-schwab-starts-crypto-exchange-services/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fidelity Investments in collaboration with Citadel Securities</a>, has launched a cryptocurrency exchange dubbed EDX Markets.</p>
<p>Although the time of this launch is suspect, just after Blackrock’s ETF announcement, it hopes to serve brokers and investors piquing interest in the crypto market but wish to stay clear of troubles that whisked FTX out of business in November.</p>
<p>According to a related report by the Wall Street Journal, EDX Markets started carrying out transactions in the past few weeks – in a rather subtle manner. The project announced nine months ago, finally confirmed its official launch through a statement issued on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This initiation indicates that a segment of Wall Street institutions still maintains their crypto interest. This holds despite the substantial regulatory pressure exerted by the SEC and a crypto market that has seen a significant slowdown in the past year and a half.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-shoots-7-as-wisdom-tree-files-bitcoin-etf/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price reacted positively to the news</a>, confirming the breakout discussed in our previous analysis. Long positions in BTC, triggered slightly above the bullish pennant pattern, or the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around $27,000, immediately turned profitable as the largest crypto closed the gap to $29,000.</p>
<figure id="attachment_152352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152352" style="width: 1145px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/21101531/BTCUSD_2023-06-21_07-32-17.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-152352" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/21101531/BTCUSD_2023-06-21_07-32-17.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Confirms Breakout to $30,000 – Is This The Start of The Bull Market?" width="1145" height="595" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-152352" class="wp-caption-text">BTC/USD daily chart | Tradingview</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Is This The Beginning of a Bull Market?</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market has been stuck in a downward spiral for more than one and a half years. While there have been many recovery attempts, like the aggressive <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price</a> rally to highs marginally above $31,000 in April, market conditions have generally remained depressed.</p>
<p>However, with the upswing to $29,000, Bitcoin price may finally shun the downtrend and usher in a bullish era with gains above $30,000. Notably, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has validated a buy signal on the same daily chart.</p>
<p>For now, it would be prudent to wait for the Bitcoin price to confirm support at $28,000 or a breakout above $29,000 before triggering new long positions. This will help avoid sudden pullbacks which may culminate in losses.</p>
<p>If support at $28,000 is lost, investors may start acclimating to a sharp drop to the next support at $27,000. However, it is not advisable to strongly short Bitcoin, considering <a href="https://coingape.com/wisdomtree-files-for-bitcoin-etf/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the emergence of institutional investors</a> like Blackrock, Fidelity Investments, and Citadel Securities.</p>

As of press time, Bitcoin is trading 6.74% up at a price of $28,721 and a market cap of $557 billion.</p>
<p>Despite the strong SEC crackdown earlier this week, institutional players particularly from traditional finance have shown great interest in stepping into the crypto game. Last week, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager BlackRock <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-to-be-reality-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">applied for a spot-Bitcoin ETF</a> with the SEC. Other financial giants such as <a href="https://coingape.com/fidelity-investments-reportedly-filing-blackrock-type-spot-bitcoin-etf-acquire-grayscale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fidelity Investments</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/wisdomtree-files-for-bitcoin-etf/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WisdomTree</a> are also making similar moves.</p>
<p>On the other hand, crypto exchange EDX Markets, backed by Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets and Charles Schwab Corp. is looking to start operations soon in the country.</p>
<p>With traditional financial players throwing their weight behind Bitcoin, investor sentiment has improved to a great extent. Hayden Hughes, co-founder of social-trading platform Alpha Impact told Bloomberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The rally is backed by institutional demand. The BlackRock announcement on a Bitcoin ETF, plus EDX Markets, gave Bitcoin a boost on hopes that traditional institutions will add depth to the crypto market.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>SEC A Hurdle To spot-Bitcoin ETF</h3>
<p>Over the past few years, the crypto industry players have been pushing hard enough to bring a spot-Bitcoin ETF to the market. However, the SEC has denied dozens of applications in the past citing insufficient consumer protection measures and other risks.</p>
<p>But now with the world&#8217;s biggest financial giants throwing their weight behind this, things could be different this time. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bitcoin-hits-a-six-week-high-as-financial-titans-step-up-crypto-initiatives-1.1935819" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>: “The BlackRock filing changed everything, that reignited the race&#8221;.</p>
<p>BlackRock recently submitted an application while Grayscale Investments is in a legal fight with the SEC to convert their Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The value difference of the trust has decreased, and some believe that BlackRock&#8217;s move could help Grayscale&#8217;s case.</p>
<p>Traders are also interested in knowing more about the economic stimulus plans in China, as the central bank has recently reduced borrowing costs.</p>

The company filed an application for ‘WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust’, an exchange traded fund, with the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC).

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackrock will continue its partnership with Coinbase, by using its custody service and spot market data for its ETF product.

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it is looking to gain exposure to the price of Bitcoin with its Bitcoin Trust while maintaining low expenses. The Trust will hold Bitcoin to achieve this goal, the company said in its SEC filing on Tuesday.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Markedly, the zkEVM Validium protocol is a first-of-its-kind decentralized L2 secured by zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. The upgrade is targeted towards keeping up with the future by aligning the current Polygon PoS with the vision of Polygon 2.0. If accepted and approved, the upgrade would be rolled out on the mainnet by Q1 2024.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">3/ The chain would continue to be operated by the existing <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MATIC</a>-staked validators, who would then be running a first-of-its-kind, decentralized sequencer, and data availability network.</p>
<p>If the proposal is accepted, the upgrade could go live on mainnet by the end of Q1 2024.</p>
<p>&mdash; Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1671208782620241926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><b>Polygon Awaits Approval of Upgrade Proposal</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Polygon 2.0 was </span><a href="https://coingape.com/polygon-2-0-released-as-the-value-layer-of-the-internet-matic-price-up-2-5/"><span style="font-weight: 400">introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> about a week ago as a vision for unlimited scalability and unified liquidity. Hence, this comes off as a significant milestone for the protocol seeing that Polygon PoS would evolve to become more secure, and also perform better. Specifically, Polygon 2.0 plans to utilize Polygon’s in-house zkEVM to enhance the sidechain’s security, and performance while also keeping fees low and maintaining scalability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, &#8220;If the proposal passes, Polygon PoS and its $2B in assets, millions of users, and thousands of apps would seamlessly migrate to this bleeding-edge technology,&#8221; Polygon tweeted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the Polygon blog post, it was also highlighted that &#8220;If accepted by the community, this upgrade will mark an incredible technical achievement — the first time that an existing chain (especially of this size and importance) adds ZK proofs to become an L2.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><b>Aligning Polygon PoS to Polygon 2.0 Vision</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noteworthy, this is not the same as the zkEVM which Polygon Labs </span><a href="https://coingape.com/polygon-bridge-for-polygon-zkevm-goes-live-allows-withdrawals-from-ethereum/"><span style="font-weight: 400">launched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the mainnet a few months ago. At the same time, Polygon envisages that both the upgraded Polygon PoS and the already existing zkEVM would coexist successfully in the same ecosystem. Moving forward, the chain will still be operated by existing MATIC staking validators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Polygon PoS has a strong ecosystem and is widely accepted by all, it is not secured by any ZK Proofs but by its validators, hence the need for an upgrade which is equivalent to unification with other ecosystems. Polygon PoS will enjoy interoperability with other chains in the broader crypto ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From its design, it will fit perfectly into the Polygon 2.0 vision without any alterations for users and developers.</span></p>

However, the buyers made a robust comeback from the $0.00000555 support and recovered half of the day’s loss. The long-wick rejection showcased in the daily chart reflects the intense demand pressure at the aforementioned support. Can this support recuperate the bullish momentum and surge price higher or there’s in the current downtrend?</span></p>

<h2><b>Shiba Inu Price Daily Chart: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.0000055 stands as a high accumulation zone for buyers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout above the downsloping trendline is needed to trigger a significant recovery</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $94.5 Million, showing a 22% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9uSBzQZv.png" alt="Shiba Inu Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent reflected rally in the crypto market, the Shiba Inu price experienced a significant recovery from mid-June. From the June 15th low of $0.0000065, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> surged 12% to reach the nearest resistance of $0.00000742-$0.00000777.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this recovery is more likely triggered by a surge in buying pressure generated by bulls accumulating at discounted prices. Anyhow, a sudden recovery as such is less probable, and therefore, the SHIB price could revert lower to replenish the bullish momentum.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the coin price shows a higher price rejection at $0.00000742 indicating the overhead supply pressure is still intact.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Shiba Inu&#8217;s Price Rally to $0.000008?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the increasing uncertainty in the crypto market, the Shiba Inu price can witness a sideways trend in the coming days. Amid this consolidation, the prices are poised to hit the downsloping resistance trendline. This dynamic resistance is carrying the current downfall in SHIB price and therefore interested traders must wait for its breakout before entering a long position.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and the signal(orange) line could boast buying momentum and assist buyers to retest the overhead trendline </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-and-50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a> act as excellent dynamic resistance against buyers</span></li>

<h2><b>Recalling the Origin of the Crypto Winter</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just around this time last year, the industry’s first algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) </span><a href="https://coingape.com/luna-crash-south-korea-toughens-up-investigations-over-terra-luna-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400">depegged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> following what was tagged an attack by unidentified actors at the time. The deep correlation between UST and Terra (LUNA) caused the digital currency to lose 99.9% of its value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This event impacted many crypto venture capital firms and hedge funds who have deep exposure to the two tokens as well as the parent company Terraform Labs. One of the first firms to be impacted includes Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Celsius Network and Voyager Digital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) that was present in the market following the bankruptcies of these firms became overwhelming for investors who largely went on hibernation from investing in crypto. The impact of these conservative investment strategies saw digital currencies losing their value from their previous multi-year highs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The aftermath of the Terraform Labs collapse was further compounded by the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/"><span style="font-weight: 400">implosion of FTX Derivatives Exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. While many digital currencies are yet to recover from the impact of these market uncertainties, Dan Morehead believes the worst is now over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bitcoin’s year-over-year return bottomed at -76% amidst the FTX debacle last November. It recently flipped positive and is now at 31%. We believe it’s been enough time that we can rally now,” he said in the tweet he shared.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Bitcoin’s year-over-year return bottomed at -76% amidst the FTX debacle last November.</p>
<p>It recently flipped positive and is now at 31%.</p>
<p>We believe it’s been enough time, that we can rally now. <a href="https://t.co/9OYgStmz00">pic.twitter.com/9OYgStmz00</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><b>Positive Sentiments are Emerging</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a backing to Dan’s predictions as the world’s largest investment manager, BlackRock has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/blackrock-stirs-bullish-momentum-with-spot-btc-etf-28000-bitcoin-price-on-the-horizon/"><span style="font-weight: 400">filed an application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While no such product has been approved by the market regulator to date, the industry is optimistic that with BlackRock’s stellar success rates in its previous ETF applications, the chances it will get approval is high. Should these projections play out as expected, the Bitcoin market is bound to expand significantly with new flow of funds flowing into the ecosystem.</span></p>

Amid this downfall, the crypto coins plunged to their respective monthly support offering a great opportunity to buy the dip. In this article we have listed out some of the well-established altcoins interested traders can accumulate.</span></p>

<h2><b>XRP (XRP) Price Analysis: Pullback Opportunity</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EnqqKnRE.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source: Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent correction phase, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a> plunged to the monthly low of $0.4558 and retested a long-coming support trendline. This trendline has been carrying a significant recovery over the past 100 days and offers occasional dip opportunities to buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the XRP price is trading at $0.48 with an intraday loss of 2.7%. With sustained selling the price could revisit the aforementioned support trendline. This retest would likely recuperate the bullish momentum and trigger a bullish reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential recovery could push the XRP price back to a multi-month barrier of $0.55.</span></p>
<h2><b>Polygon(MATIC) Price Analysis: Coiling Before Explosive Move?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/x/XzJ78qta.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source: Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The falling <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/">MATIC price</a> has turned sideways after hitting the $0.52 support. Amid the growing uncertainty in the crypto market, the consolidation phase continues in a narrow price spread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the Polygon coin trades at $0.6 and witnesses demand pressure from the $0.52 support. If the bullish momentum persists, the buyers trigger a bullish reversal and challenge the falling trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the resistance trendline will be the key signal for trend reversal and surge the price back to the $1 mark.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Cardano(ADA) Price Analysis: At Crucial Support</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/z/ZqlEgpIS.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source: Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over a week, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/cardano/">ADA price</a> has been moving nearly sideways trying to obtain suitable support at $0.24. The long-lower price rejection tails showcased in the daily candles reflect the rising buying pressure and active accumulation from traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the bullish momentum rises, a potential reversal from this support could surge the price back to the $0.3 psychological barrier. However, to obtain an established recovery rally, the buyers to breach pierced the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This anticipated breakout will offer buyers a solid launch pad to surge the ADA price above $0.35.</span></p>

The focus will be on the question of regulating the AI space. The move comes several months after many tech leaders, including billionaire Elon Musk, called for the need to enforce slowdown in AI development. Recently, OpenAI’s Sam Altman also spoke about the need for regulating the AI industry.</p>

<p>Congressmen Ted W. Lieu, Ken Buck and Congresswoman Anna Eshoo introduced the National AI Commission Act, bipartisan and bicameral legislation to create a national commission on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) space. The objective is to develop a framework for AI regulation.</p>
<h2>Comprehensive Framework for AI regulation</h2>
<p>The Act appears to be more focused towards preventing harm from the technology. Congressman Lieu warned that AI can also cause significant harm if left unchecked and unregulated. Hence, the commission will unite experts, government, industry, labor to make recommendations on the best ways to move forward on AI regulation, a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://lieu.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-lieu-buck-eshoo-and-sen-schatz-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-bill" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement</a> from the lawmakers said.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission will review the United States’ current approach to AI regulation, make recommendations on any new office or governmental structure that may be necessary, and develop a risk-based framework for AI.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, AI based crypto tokens Render (RNDR) and SingularityNET (AGIX) reacted positively to the news of the US AI Commission proposal.</p>

The daily candle has showcased price rejection on both sides indicating the indecisiveness among market participants.

<h2><b>LUNC Price Daily Chart:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The range within the triangle pattern can be represented as a no-trading zone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A triangle breakout could trigger a directional move in the LUNC price </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the LUNC coin is $30.8 million, indicating a 23.5% gain. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/3/3O3IzPuH.png" alt="Terra Classic Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />(Source: Tradingview)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/terra-luna-classic/">LUNC price</a> trades at $0.000088 with an intraday loss of 2.23%. With today’s drop, the coin price shows a breakdown attempt from the support trendline of the triangle pattern. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chart pattern carried the ongoing consolidation in Terra classic coin price for over two weeks. Thus, a breakdown from the support trendline with a 4-hour candle closing will boost supply pressure and could plunge the prices 25% down to hit the lower trendline of the channel pattern near $0.000065.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the in-between $0.000082 level stands a strong accumulation zone that could obstruct the potential downfall and offer buyers an opportunity to counterattack. </span></p>
<h2><b>Will the LUNC Price Reclaim the $0.0001 Mark?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A less likely yet possible breakout from the resistance trendline of the triangle pattern could offer buyers a strong footing to rise higher. However, the upward trajectory could be capped till the overhead resistance trendline of the channel pattern is located near $0.0001. Therefore, a breakout above this barrier is also needed to trigger sustained growth.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Moving Average Convergence/Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential bearish crossover between the signal(orange) and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) line will project a sell sign of interested traders.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bollinger Bands:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The band of <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger band indicators</a> squeezed, accentuates the uncertainty in market sentiment and the need for a breakout to determine future movement.</span></li>

<h2><b>Giancarlo Agrees on SEC’s Crackdown Being Boring</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Giancarlo echoed insights from </span><a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-is-not-a-security-ex-cftc-chairman/"><span style="font-weight: 400">crypto advocate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Jim Harper who <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/the-securities-and-exchange-commission-cryptocurrency-and-meta-meta-commentary-that-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that while the enforcement action of the market regulator is important, the approach is &#8216;boring&#8217;. In buttressing this stance, Harper highlighted how old Bitcoiners do not necessarily need an exchange in the long term especially when transactional opportunities are factored into the utilities for which they are holding the asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a former CFTC Chairman, Giancarlo has always been pro-crypto innovation and his advocacy post-office has earned him the moniker ‘Crypto Dad’. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While not commenting directly on whether the SEC will come out triumphant in the lawsuits it is filing against these exchanges it is going after, the belief is that the crackdown, if successful, will only change the timeline for which &#8216;blockchain and cryptocurrency dominate the administration of value&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The odds of the SEC succeeding against Coinbase and Binance is currently up for debate in the community with many experts believing the regulator’s crackdown is an overstep to its regulatory powers. The platforms are willing to defend their claims in court, trailing after Ripple Labs Inc which has been battling the SEC for more than 2 and a half years.</span></p>
<h2><b>Pursuit of Regulatory Clarity </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The United States is judged to be behind its contemporaries when it comes to the issuance of regulatory clarity to guide the emerging industry. Industry leaders have requested for a separate or customized guideline for the industry in a bid to help foster innovation that can drive growth across the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some members of the US Congress have recognized this deep demand for regulatory clarity and are </span><a href="https://coingape.com/us-house-expedites-hearings-crypto-regulations-banking-failures/"><span style="font-weight: 400">already making targeted moves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> through the attempt to first restructure the SEC under Gary Gensler. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The digital currency ecosystem has come of age with a combined market capitalization of about $1.1 trillion. Experts have argued that a positive regulatory system remains the catalyst to propel the market forward.</span></p>

<p>As revealed earlier by the developer group, the L1TF team will work with the RedlineDrifter-led USTC repeg team after the v2.1.1 parity upgrade to bring attention to USTC stablecoin.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic L1 Team To Work On USTC Repeg</h2>
<p>Joint L1 Task Force project manager LuncBurnArmy in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/luncburnarmy/status/1670809015037698048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of tweets</a> on June 20 confirmed that the L1TF will work with the newly formed Quant team. He also expresses support for any tasks that pass governance voting by the Terra Luna Classic community.</p>
<p>After a minor dispute in the development team, RedlineDrifter and LuncBurnArmy had a productive discussion on work related to USTC repeg. The L1TF will remove the &#8216;reserve architecture/design&#8217;, and other USTC items, except the market module that requires intense testing on testnet.</p>
<p>The quant team should seek alternative funding methods for the reserve if CEX does not support the divergence tax proposal. Thus, the architecture/design of the reserve is suggested to be included in the quant team proposal. Whereas, L1TF will be working on testing the market module during Q3.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would include the proposed assets for the reserve, how the reserve would be managed, and how it may be possible to automate the defense of the peg using the reserve assets, added LuncBurnArmy. The quant team could spend 60-70% of their time on the divergence tax, but look for ways to fund the reserve that are not dependent on CEXs.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price to Recover 50% After Parity</h2>
<p>The Terra Classic developer group Joint L1 Task Force successfully completed the <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-biggest-v2-1-1-parity-upgrade-goes-live-lunc-price-rally-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest v2.1.1 parity upgrade</a> on June 14. It makes the chain attain parity with Terra 2.0 and other Cosmos chains, bringing back utility back to the chain.</p>
<p>The community estimated at least a 40% jump in LUNC price to $0.00014 after the parity upgrade, but market volatility impacted the broader market. However, despite the market volatility, the LUNCprice has not violated the levels of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/falling-wedge-pattern-what-to-do-if-it-appears-on-a-crypto-chart/#:~:text=By%20Coingape%20Staff&amp;text=A%20falling%20wedge%20pattern%20is,in%20a%20falling%20wedge%20pattern.">falling wedge pattern</a>, suggesting that the Terra Luna Classic price is primed for significant growth.</p>
<p>LUNC price currently trades at $0.000088, down 2% in the past 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high are $0.0000883 and $0.0000906, respectively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, USTC price is trading at $0.011, up 1% in the past 24 hours.</p>

However, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes revealed the impact is not as critical as expected and risk assets like Bitcoin price will start to rally soon.</p>
<h2>Arthur Hayes Bullish On Bitcoin Rally</h2>
<p>BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes on June 20 <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1670998836188438529" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> the <strong>Treasury General Account (TGA)</strong> refill is not impacting risk markets as the US dollar net liquidity stands at $77 billion. He believes the TGA refill by the US Treasury Dept is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Arthur Hayes plans to buy crypto as the net liquidity index remains &#8220;positive.&#8221; If the index goes &#8220;negative,&#8221; he will slow down or stop his purchases. He predicts that US Treasury will slow down T-bills or debt issuance once the TGA balance is more than $450 billion.</p>
<p>TGA balance during the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/debt-ceiling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debt ceiling deal</a> was below $40 billion, now it is <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/daily-treasury-statement/operating-cash-balance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">$250 billion</a>. The US Treasury is building its account balance without impacting financial markets and US dollar liquidity.</p>
<p>He has created a custom US dollar liquidity index to track how TGA refill will affect the US dollar liquidity. &#8220;I look at values of RRP and TGA as of their last print before the debt ceiling bill was signed on June 3rd. If RRP is falling that is +ve for $ liq, if TGA is rising that is -ve for $ liq. I look at the net of the two.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Crypto Market Rebound Is Clear</h2>
<p>The crypto market continued upside momentum after the uncertainty surrounding US SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase eased.</p>
<p>Bitcoin continues to move upside after rebounding from the expected $24,800 support level. Bitcoin price jumped above $27,000 today as a result of fresh buying from whales. <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price</a> currently trades at $26,796, up 2% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH price</a> remains stable near $1750, up 0.50%.

The daily candles show short bodies and rejection wicks on either side, indicating no clear dominance from buyers or sellers. However, a closer look at the lower time frame chart shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a>. Amid the time of uncertainty, this pattern could give better clarity for a potential rally.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATIC Price 4-Hour Chart</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the resistance trendline is needed to trigger a significant recovery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.52 level stands as a strong demand zone for MATIC buyers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC is $226.5 Million, indicating a 4.57% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/4/4lMzBIJq.png" alt="MATIC Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current uncertainty reflected in <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/">MATIC price</a> is likely the conflict between the overall downtrend and buying pressure arising from discounted market value. As a result, the coin price has been moving sideways for over a week now. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this consolidation is restricted to two converging trendlines of a symmetrical triangle pattern. As of now, the polygon coin trades at $0.604 with an intraday loss of 1.5%. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This triangle pattern is known as a continuation pattern, and therefore, the prices are more likely to break the lower trendline to resume the prior downfall. A 4-hour candle closing below the trendline will replenish the selling pressure and may plunge 13% down to revisit $0.52 support.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will MATIC Price Reclaim $0.8 Mark?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a lesser possibility, the MATIC price can still break the resistance trendline of the triangle pattern and triggers a bullish upswing. This breakout could push the altcoin 22.5% higher before hitting the crucial resistance of the downsloping trend near $0.75. This trendline has been carrying the current downtrend in MATIC price, and therefore a breakout above it is needed to initiate a significant recovery above $0.8</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bands of <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger Band</a> squeeze accentuated the current indecisiveness in the market and therefore the need for a significant breakout to trigger a direction rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relative strength index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> reflects the increase in bullish momentum and the possibility of a bullish recovery.</span></li>

The two key developments are likely to bring a major boost to the Cardano ecosystem and push the ADA price for upside momentum. The community also committed to improving the Cardano network despite the US SEC crackdown.</p>
<h2>Cardano Releases Node 8.1.1 Mainnet and Lace 1.2 Wallet Upgrade</h2>
<p>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson on June 20 <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1670926703378702336" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> the release of Cardano Node 8.1.1 mainnet, commenting &#8220;moving the chains.&#8221; Hoskinson also noted the Lace 1.2 wallet is pushed to production.</p>
<p>The Cardano Node 8.1.1 is mainnet ready and has significant improvements at the epoch transitions. Developers strongly urged all stake pool operators (SPOs) to update to Node 8.1.1. The mainnet upgrade fixes issued related to peer-to-peer network communications and the Cardano-based domain name system.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Moreover, the Lace 1.2 wallet upgrade has <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1670917023541469185" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">introduced</a> several features including NFTs organizing in folders, wallet balance hiding, better wallet balance calculation, and DApp connector. It also has performance improvements for token information requests.</p>
<h2>ADA Price Eyes Recovery</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/cardano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADA price</a> fell from $0.38 to $0.23 after the US SEC referred Cardano (ADA) as security in lawsuits against crypto exchanges <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/binance-vs-sec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/coinbase-vs-sec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>. ADA price can likely recover to the resistance level at $0.35 amid key developments from Cardano developers.</p>
<p>ADA price fell 0.50% in the past 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.258. The 24-hour low and high are $0.257 and $0.264, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased by 30% in the past 24 hours, indicating interest among traders.</p>

<h2>Andrew Tate Bitcoin Holdings</h2>
<p>Social media influencer, Andrew Tate was taken into custody in December following allegations of human trafficking and sexual assault. After an extensive investigation by DIICOT, he has been placed under house arrest since March.</p>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.diicot.ro/mass-media/4082-comunicat-de-presa-2-20-06-2023" rel="nofollow">latest press release</a>, Tate, along with three other defendants, has been ordered to face trial under house arrest. The charges leveled against them include constituting an organized criminal group, human trafficking, rape, illegal access to computer systems, and instigation of violence.</p>

<p>Despite inaccurate reporting by the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65959097" rel="nofollow">BBC</a>, it has been clarified that Andrew Tate did not have $300 million worth of Bitcoin seized, but around 21 bitcoins, that is <strong>bitcoin worth over $560,000</strong>. The false information was a result of a Google Translate error.</p>
<p>The dissemination of inaccurate information due to a Google translate error has led to widespread confusion surrounding Andrew Tate&#8217;s alleged involvement and his crypto holdings specifically.</p>
<p>The BBC reported that the trial is expected to last several years, and a Romanian judge has 60 days to view all the evidence before then.  Tate&#8217;s spokesperson told the BBC: &#8220;We embrace the opportunity it presents to demonstrate their innocence.&#8221;</p>

<h2>EDX Markets Start Crypto Exchange Operations</h2>
<p>EDX Markets-backed by market leaders including Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, Paradigm, Sequoia Capital, and Virtu Financial silently started executing trades in recent weeks.</p>
<p>While EDX Markets seeks business from brokers and investors interested in crypto assets, but it remains concerned regarding heightened scrutiny from regulators in the US after troubles in FTX and Binance. However, Wall Street firms are still interested in crypto despite regulatory crackdowns led by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>It is a first-of-its-kind exchange that will address latent demand for digital asset trading by enabling safe and compliant trading of digital assets through trusted intermediaries. It differs from how crypto exchanges typically operate as it is a “noncustodial” exchange, which doesn’t handle its customers’ digital assets directly.</p>
<p>EDX Markets will offer only Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin trading services. It also plans to launch a clearinghouse to facilitate the process of settling trades.</p>
<p>Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are committed to bringing the best of traditional finance to cryptocurrency markets, with an infrastructure built by market experts to embed key institutional best practices. With the endorsement of our new and growing list of investors and customers, we’re proud to launch trading and look forward to further enhancements to our offering.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, EDX Markets <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230620110605/en/Digital-Asset-Platform-EDX-Markets-Begins-Trading-and-Completes-New-Funding-Round" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completed</a> a second funding round with investors including options-exchange operator Miami International Holdings and affiliates of proprietary trading firms DV Trading, GTS, GSR, and Hudson River Trading.</p>

<h2>Crypto Market Reacted to Crypto Exchange Launch</h2>
<p>EDX Markets launch gets mixed reactions from the crypto community. While some praised the move by traditional financial firms to enter the crypto market, others pointed out these firms taking over the crypto market.</p>
<p>Crypto prices continue to trade mostly sideways, with altcoins under pressure as Bitcoin market dominance hits 50%. <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price</a> trades above $26,800, up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<h2><b>Ethereum Price Daily Chart</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher price rejection candles at $1775-$1765 reflect the sellers are actively defending this level</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown below the support trendline could trigger a massive correction in the Ethereum price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.7 Billion, indicating a 57.5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/n/nfst8lBz.png" alt="Ethereum Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past four days, the Ethereum price has been moving sideways below the $1775-$1765 resistance. The daily candle projected short-bodied candles and relatively longer rejection wicks on the upside indicating the prices are witnessing overhead supply pressure.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This overhead resistance continues to pressurize buyers and may trigger a temporary sideways trend. However, amid the potential consolidation, a retest to the lower trendline may attract more buyers interested in discounted prices.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, for buyers to obtain a sustained recovery rally, the buyers need to breach $1775 and the downsloping trendline. This breakout could signal a resurgence of bullish momentum and offer traders a long opportunity with a potential target of $1926, $2020, and $2130.</span></p>
<h2><b>Is ETH Price Ready for Recovery?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a resistance trendline(red), the Ethereum price is still under a correction phase. With the current uncertainty in the market, the coin price may go sideways below the $1775 level before making an attempt to rise higher. However, a breakout above the trendline could project a signal of significant recovery.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Directional Movement Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DI+ and DI- slope gradually closing in for a positive crossover project losing bearish momentum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a>(20, 50, and 100) wavering near the $1775 barrier created a high supply zone for traders.</span></li>
