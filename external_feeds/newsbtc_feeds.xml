					<description><![CDATA[The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Ethereum and Bitcoin, slowed down on their rally. Following a surge above critical resistance, the cryptocurrencies could retrace and return to critical support levels. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? As of this writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $1,840 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, ETH has recorded a 2% loss except for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), the crypto top 10 by market cap trades in the red. Trouble Ahead For Ethereum? Earlier today, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced the launch of a new product. The platform will roll out an Ethereum (ETH/USD) to Bitcoin (BTC/USD) ratio futures contract. The financial product will follow the price of these cryptocurrencies and their correlation. In that way, traders can gain exposure to both cryptocurrencies by holding a single futures contract. According to an official announcement, The product aims to create more opportunities for traders in the nascent industry. However, in the short term, the CME launch hints at a potential downside for the two largest assets in the crypto market. CME Product Could Trigger This Effect In the past, whenever the CME rolled out a Bitcoin or Ethereum-based contract, the price of either asset trended to the downside.

<h2>Trouble Ahead For Ethereum?</h2>
<p>Earlier today, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19384891-cme-group-to-launch-ether-bitcoin-ratio-futures-on-july-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> the launch of a new product. The platform will roll out an Ethereum (ETH/USD) to Bitcoin (BTC/USD) ratio futures contract.</p>
<p>The financial product will follow the price of these cryptocurrencies and their correlation. In that way, traders can gain exposure to both cryptocurrencies by holding a single futures contract.</p>
<p>According to an official announcement, The product aims to create more opportunities for traders in the nascent industry. However, in the short term, the CME launch hints at a potential downside for the two largest assets in the crypto market.</p>
CME Product Could Trigger This Effect
<p>In the past, whenever the CME rolled out a Bitcoin or Ethereum-based contract, the price of either asset trended to the downside. A pseudonym analyst forecasted issues for ETH and BTC, probably driven by a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect.</p>
<p>Via Twitter, the analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/DaanCrypto/status/1674463455720484884" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a>, reacting to the news:</p>
<blockquote><p>If this has an effect similar to the $BTC &amp; $ETH futures back in the day then the release of this instrument could form a pivot for the ETH/BTC pair. Maybe more down into the release and then a reversal around the end of July? Let&#8217;s see.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to the forecast, another analyst stated that a “buy the rumor, sell the news effect” will cause ETH’s price to rally into the event. Therefore, ETH could profit as the CME prepares to roll out their new contracts and anticipation around the spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) applications continues.</p>

<p>The analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/silver_bits/status/1674464475397738496" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a>:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin (LTC) has been one of the most bullish coins for the year 2023 with anticipation around its forthcoming halving event. This has propelled the digital asset toward price increases higher than the market average. And now, once again, the bull case for the digital asset is even stronger as its hashrate has risen rapidly to a new peak. Litecoin Hashrate Touches New All-Time High As the halving event draws closer, more attention is being paid to the Litecoin network. This has led to an increase in the hashrate of the network as more miners are joining the network. Most of the month of June has seen large spikes in hashrate following the rise in the mining difficulty. Related Reading: The Blessing Of July: Can Bitcoin Climb To $36,000 In The Coming Month? The rise in mining difficulty means that it is harder to find a block and as such, miners have to bring more machines online to increase their chances, leading to a spike in the hashrate. And as more miners are brought online, the Litecoin hashrate has touched its highest level yet. According to data from CoinWarz, the Litecoin hashrate reached 958.36 terahashes per second (TH/s), on Wednesday, June 28, 2023. This is a new all-time high for the network whose previous all-time high had data just above 800 TH/s. Litecoin hashrate reaches new all-time high &#124; Source: CoinWarz The hashrate has seen a decline and is now sitting at 735.71 TH/s for the global hashrate. However, the spike points toward a more positive development for its network and its native token LTC. LTC Could Surge Upon Halving Event The Litecoin halving which will cut block rewards down from 12.5 LTC per mined block to 6.25 LTC per mined block is now less than two months away. As halving events have been known to impose a level of scarcity on a digital asset, a surge in the price of LTC is expected as the event draws closer. LTC price sitting above $85 support &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com This scarcity would see supply reduce and if demand continues to rise, then LTC is poised to break $100 by the time the halving is done. If this happens, it could also trigger a reasonable rally in the crypto market as positive sentiment and profits from LTC spills over into the rest of the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Suggests BTC Rally Is Far From Over Litecoin’s rise in hashrate already shows that miners are preparing for the halving, indicating renewed fate in the digital asset. As the next few weeks leading up to the event roll by, investors can expect LTC to trade in the green despite market bearishness. At the time of writing, LTC is trading at a price of $85.40 per coin, down 3.08% in the past week. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Still recording some green on small timeframes, the price of Bitcoin has remained above $30,400. Despite the recent selling pressure across the sector, the support around this level held, providing bulls a chance to fight back. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Battle Against Miners’ $128 Million Move: Is The Bull Run In Danger? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $30,458 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. The previous week, the number one crypto by market cap recorded similar price action while other cryptocurrencies experienced losses. Bitcoin About To Explode? Data from crypto options platform Deribit, shared by analyst Tom Dunleavy, shows that over $7 billion in these contracts will expire today, Friday 29th. In other words, today, option holders can exercise their right or obligation to buy/sell BTC and other assets at a specific price, depending on their contract. Over $5 billion of the options contracts are based on Bitcoin, while the rest are based on Ethereum, as seen in the chart below. However, option holders could choose to “roll over” their contracts to a later date. As a result, according to Dunleavy, spot prices could see a spike in buying pressure as major option players hedge their positions. This increased buying pressure could see BTC soaring above the $31,000 mark. Via Twitter, the analyst stated: Big options expiration date for both ETH and BTC tomorrow ETH: ~$2B notional BTC: ~$5B notional If these are rolled into more calls we should see spot buying from dealers to hedge their books; puts opposite story. Either way expect some vol (volatility). As Dunleavy claims, the crypto market is poised for volatility, whichever direction. The chart above shows the Max Pain price for BTC options, which is $26,500. Max Pain is the price Bitcoin must trade to deny most options traders from booking profits. In that sense, the BTC price will likely turn to the downside with a spike in volatility. Beyond $31,000, What’s Next For BTC? Analysis and crypto education firm Blofin recently posted a report on BTC&#8217;s short- and long-term risks and scenarios. The firm claims the recent rally was driven by a “hunger for positive news” and a “rebalancing” of internal liquidity. In other words, crypto investors got bullish and took money from altcoins into BTC. However, there is still a liquidity issue within the sector that could limit any rally, but there is a silver lining in this scenario. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? Blofin stated: The decline in the price of BTC will be more limited, with a relatively small probability of falling below $28k, while the upward space is relatively large, and there is even hope for a rebound to $35k and above.

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) has shown signs of recovery in recent trading sessions, although its price continues to linger near a significant resistance level. In the past 24 hours, ADA witnessed a modest 2% increase, but weekly gains have been erased, resulting in a 7% depreciation on the weekly chart. Related Reading: Slovakian Lawmakers Pass Amendment Lowering Cryptocurrency Taxation The technical outlook has yet to present bullish signals, with both demand and accumulation remaining relatively low. Bitcoin dominance increased while trading within the $30,000 price range. Major altcoins also experienced minor gains in the past few days. Although Bitcoin displayed a bullish trend, its price fluctuated, and other altcoins followed similar patterns. For the Cardano price to experience upward movement, Bitcoin must exhibit another surge from its current price level. If ADA manages to sustain above the current support line with the support of BTC, the altcoin may soon attempt to break through immediate price resistance. The decrease in ADA&#8217;s market capitalization indicates the continued influence of bearish sentiment in the market. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ADA was observed to be trading at $0.27, a significant resistance point for the altcoin. Previous price action has indicated that the bulls have faced rejection at this level in the past. Additionally, consolidation has been observed around this price mark. If ADA continues its upward movement, it may attempt to trade near or even surpass the $0.30 level. However, in the case of extended consolidation, ADA could experience a dip towards its support line at $0.26. Notably, the $0.26 level has acted as a bullish order block for the coin, indicating a price reversal and subsequent upward movement after reaching this level. This observation suggests the possibility of incoming bullishness for ADA. Technical Analysis Despite an increase in buying strength, the overall demand for ADA has remained low. This is evident from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) failing to move above the half-line, indicating that sellers have maintained a strong presence in the market. However, there is an expectation for a potential resurgence in demand if the price manages to surpass the $0.27 zone. Similarly, the price falling below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line indicates that sellers have been driving the price momentum in the market. ADA has exhibited buy signals that suggest a potential price reversal in the near future. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has formed green histograms, which are tied to buy signals for the coin. This indicates positive momentum for ADA and suggests a potential upward movement in price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Downward Pressure – Will DOGE Bulls Avert A Further Slide? Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which provide insights into price volatility and fluctuation, have constricted. This tightening of the bands indicates that the trading range has become tight. Therefore, there is a possibility of a price breakout. Featured image from UnSplash, charts from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>At the time of writing, ADA was observed to be trading at $0.27, a significant resistance point for the altcoin. Previous price action has indicated that the bulls have faced rejection at this level in the past. Additionally, consolidation has been observed around this price mark.</p>
<p>If ADA continues its upward movement, it may attempt to trade near or even surpass the $0.30 level. However, in the case of extended consolidation, ADA could experience a dip towards its support line at $0.26.</p>
<p>Notably, the $0.26 level has acted as a bullish order block for the coin, indicating a price reversal and subsequent upward movement after reaching this level. This observation suggests the possibility of incoming bullishness for ADA.</p>

<p>Despite an increase in buying strength, the overall demand for ADA has remained low. This is evident from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) failing to move above the half-line, indicating that sellers have maintained a strong presence in the market.</p>
<p>However, there is an expectation for a potential resurgence in demand if the price manages to surpass the $0.27 zone. Similarly, the price falling below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line indicates that sellers have been driving the price momentum in the market.</p>

<p>ADA has exhibited buy signals that suggest a potential price reversal in the near future. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has formed green histograms, which are tied to buy signals for the coin. This indicates positive momentum for ADA and suggests a potential upward movement in price.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which provide insights into price volatility and fluctuation, have constricted. This tightening of the bands indicates that the trading range has become tight. Therefore, there is a possibility of a price breakout.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Lawmakers in Slovakia have approved new legislation, with a resounding 112-2 vote in favor, aimed at reducing taxes associated with the sale of crypto or digital assets. In addition to the aforementioned tax-cutting law, members of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, the country&#8217;s parliament, have further endorsed additional measures that impact cryptocurrency holders. The National Council of the Slovak Republic passed the amendment that will result in a reduction of personal income tax on profits derived from the sale of cryptocurrencies. This tax reduction specifically applies to individuals who have held the cryptocurrencies for a minimum period of one year. The recent vote marked the third reading of the bill in the National Council. According to reports, the Ministry of Finance in Slovakia has projected that the amendment, once implemented, will have a financial impact of approximately 30 million euros per year.

This amendment specifically codifies the right of citizens to utilize cash as a recognized payment method. This action comes in response to discussions surrounding the potential introduction of a digital euro. The government aims to ensure that citizens retain the freedom to choose their preferred form of payment. Citizens will be able to choose cash payment after it has been implemented within the constitution. Drastic Reduction In Crypto Tax Rates Under the new legislation, the tax rate on profits gained from the sale of cryptocurrencies will be reduced to 7%. This marks a significant decrease compared to the current sliding scale tax rates of 19% or 25%. Moreover, the bill includes a provision that exempts payments received in cryptocurrencies up to 2,400 euros ($2,600) from taxation. Furthermore, the bill also addresses the issue of health insurance contributions. It specifically excludes income derived from cryptocurrencies from being subject to a health insurance contribution of 14%. As a member state of the European Union, Slovakia, like other EU countries, has the freedom to establish its own tax regulations and policies concerning cryptocurrencies.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) recent performance has been a source of concern for its investors, as the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency struggles to maintain its upward trajectory. While the currency recently recorded a 12-month high slightly above $31,000, it is now facing potential profit-taking as miners signal a massive $128 Million move. Bitcoin Bulls Brace For Impact According to Yan Allemann, co-founder of Glassnode, the miner&#8217;s transfer could lead to significant sell-off pressure in the market. This could cause friction in the current bull run, which has already seen Bitcoin struggle to hold steady at the crucial $30,000 support line. Adding to the uncertainty is that Bollinger Bands, a technical analysis tool used to measure volatility, remains tight despite the low volatility. This has been shown to lead to abrupt market moves in the past, which could cause further complications for Bitcoin bulls. Related Reading: Altcoin Whales Show Highly Active Day, Volatility Incoming? The support at $30,000 is crucial for the revival of the uptrend, and investors are now anxiously watching to see how the market reacts to the miner&#8217;s move. While Bitcoin has faced similar challenges in the past and managed to overcome them, the current situation is causing some concern among market observers. Furthermore, Bitcoin&#8217;s current price stagnation is reflected in its Average Directional Index (ADX) on the daily chart, which is set to spike downward.  This ADX movement suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s trend for the next 10 days could be to the downside. This development raises the possibility that Bitcoin might either consolidate for the next week-and-a-half, revisit the $29,600 support line, or even drop further to the $28,300 level if the downside movement persists. Either way, it has been a common price action for Bitcoin for the majority of the year to experience periods of correction or consolidation before taking another uptrend. The current ADX movement and potential downside trend are no exception to this pattern, as seen in the chart above. As Bitcoin corrects or consolidates, the liquidity of late-long positions taken from these levels is likely to be absorbed. This is a natural part of market cycles, and it is not unusual for Bitcoin to experience this type of price action. Once the correction or consolidation phase passes and the late longs liquidity is taken from these levels, Bitcoin may be poised to begin another uptrend. This could potentially result in a 6,000-point uptrend, which has been seen in previous cycles. BTC Faces Further Decline Yan Allemann also pointed out other technical indicators that suggest a short-term reversal in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) peaked at 72.92 over the weekend, which is within the limit of overbought territory. The RSI has since remained in the upper and lower levels, which indicates a possible decrease in buying pressure. Furthermore, the double-top pattern and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also suggest that a short-term reversal in Bitcoin&#8217;s price may be imminent. The MACD being overbought, along with the RSI at the top level, adds to this likelihood.

The funding rates remain positive, reflecting bullish sentiment among investors. Additionally, Bitcoin mining stocks have been moving higher, suggesting the potential catalyst for the next major move in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. As of now, BTC trades at $30,500, slightly up by 0.5% in the last 24 hours but failing to conquer the $31,000 mark.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto community is currently in a state of constant speculation as renowned analyst Willy Woo sets forth a prediction suggesting Bitcoin could potentially scale up to a price of $310,000 under a specific set of circumstances. Woo&#8217;s hypothesis, which has sparked a flurry of discussions in the crypto community, is hinged on an assumption that notable institutional players might decide to designate a fraction of their assets under management (AUM) to the largest digital currency, Bitcoin. The Theoretical Path To $310,000 Bitcoin Woo breaks down his perspective, detailing that a significant augmentation in Bitcoin&#8217;s market cap, coupled with a corresponding increase in its realized cap, could set the stage for this quantum leap in price. However, he underscores that the timing of these potential institutional inflows would significantly determine the trajectory of Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts: Bitcoin (BTC) To Reach $69,000 And Above In 2023 Woo noted: It [BTC potential to $310,000] would really depend on whether they [institutional players] deploy in a bearish or bullish phase of the market but the range would be between $128,000 &#8211; $398,000. Right now it&#8217;s $310,000. According to Woo, if such investment decisions take place during a bearish market phase, Bitcoin may dip to around $128,000. On the flip side, a bullish market condition could propel BTC to $400,000.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto community is currently in a state of constant speculation as renowned analyst Willy Woo sets forth a <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1674010721225691136?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">prediction</a> suggesting Bitcoin could potentially scale up to a price of $310,000 under a specific set of circumstances. </p>
<p>Woo&#8217;s hypothesis, which has sparked a flurry of discussions in the crypto community, is hinged on an assumption that notable institutional players might decide to designate a fraction of their assets under management (AUM) to the largest digital currency, Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>The Theoretical Path To $310,000 Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Woo breaks down his perspective, detailing that a significant augmentation in Bitcoin&#8217;s market cap, coupled with a corresponding increase in its realized cap, could set the stage for this quantum leap in price. However, he underscores that the timing of these potential institutional inflows would significantly determine the trajectory of Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>Woo noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>It [BTC potential to $310,000] would really depend on whether they [institutional players] deploy in a bearish or bullish phase of the market but the range would be between $128,000 &#8211; $398,000. Right now it&#8217;s $310,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Woo, if such investment decisions take place during a bearish market phase, Bitcoin may dip to around $128,000. On the flip side, a bullish market condition could <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/crypto-analyst-predicts-bitcoin-to-reach-above-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">propel BTC to $400,000</a>.</p>
<p>Woo’s projections, albeit well-reasoned, were met with a fair share of skepticism, particularly concerning the assumption of institutional asset reallocation towards <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-on-shaky-ground-market-analysts-warn-potential-fall/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Bitcoin</a>.

<h2>Investor Decisions VS Wealth Manager Discretion</h2>
<p>Splitting wealth management into two distinct categories &#8211; investor-driven decisions and wealth manager discretion &#8211; Woo explained that any large-scale movement toward Bitcoin would likely necessitate the approval of the individual investors represented by these institutions.</p>
<p>Tweeting about his analysis, Woo stated that If these institutions &#8220;allocated 5% of AUM into BTC,&#8221; his calculations project above $300,000 per coin and could vary significantly to below it.

<p>This surge comes amid BlackRock and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/btc-uptrend-fidelity-to-submit-bitcoin-spot-etf-filing/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">other financial giants&#8217; recent filing of a Bitcoin Exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> and the launch of EDX Markets, a digital-asset exchange supported by esteemed traditional finance giants such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab Corp.</p>
