                        <![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">BTC/USD Back to 26034 Level:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 22 August 2023</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bitcoin (BTC/USD) moderated early in the Asian session as the pair encountered expanded volatility and then orbited the 26034 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 25610 to 26296.78.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 25872 area during a pullback, representing the 61.8% retracement of the same appreciating range, and bottomed out around the 25814 area before BTC/USD climbed to the 26260.25 area.&nbsp; The recent fresh multi-month low around the 25234.76 area represented a test of a major downside price objective around the 25128.94 area that is associated with selling pressure that increased around the 31862.21 and 30421.29 levels in July.&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Stops were elected below the 27620.46 area during the decline, another downside price objective linked to recent downward pressure around the 30222 and 29665.27 areas.&nbsp; Major Stops were also elected below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in appreciating ranges from the 15460 and 19568.52 levels include the 23661, 22793, and 21725 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Following recent selling pressure, areas of technical resistance and potential selling pressure include the 26798, 27139, 27728, 27766, 28316, 28548, 29154, 29330, and 30443 levels.&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 27525.77 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 26083.17.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), in its recent study, emphasised the importance of judiciously regulating cryptocurrencies rather than imposing outright bans.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto is a mirage
<p dir="ltr">The study hinted at the increasing allure of digital currencies but cautioned against their mirage-like appeal. The research by BIS, a global financial institution known as the "central bank for central banks", pointed out the swelling enthusiasm for digital currencies. They cited their promise for faster and cheaper remittances, increased financial inclusion, and potential as an alternative investment vehicle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows; the BIS also underlined some inherent vulnerabilities. These include potential misuse for illicit activities, energy concerns associated with crypto mining, and heightened market risks.</p>
A complete ban is not the answer
<p dir="ltr">The BIS study further stressed that simply banning these digital currencies might not be the solution. Outlawing them could stifle innovation and push activities to unregulated sectors, increasing risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Instead, the institution recommends establishing robust regulatory frameworks. These frameworks should prioritise transparency, combat illicit activities, and protect consumers while fostering technological advancements in the financial space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The paper concludes by highlighting that while cryptocurrencies are indisputably transformative, their optimal utility can only be realised in a well-regulated environment. It's a balance of harnessing their potential while ensuring they don't jeopardise the broader financial ecosystem's stability.</p>
Opinion
<p dir="ltr">It should be borne in mind when reading the BIS report that this organisation is set on seeing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) rolled out across the globe. CBDCs are only an extension of the existing fiat currencies but they can also be used to totally control spending, right down to the individual level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The BIS admits to being worried about cryptocurrencies going elsewhere if they are banned in certain countries, so their thinking is to put crypto into a regulatory straitjacket in order to stop private money in its tracks.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To central banks and central planners decentralised money is anathema. They see the danger to the continuance of the fiat monetary system that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies present and will fight tooth and nail to suppress this new technology in order to be able to establish CBDCs and thereby obtain ultimate control over citizens.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The NFT platform Recur has shut down operations despite raising $50 million and having support from industry bigwigs.&nbsp;</p>
Big-Name Partnerships Fade Away
<p dir="ltr">Despite its initial promising trajectory and significant partnerships, NFT startup Recur has made the disheartening announcement that its Web3 platform is shutting down. The platform's inability to withstand the challenges of the crypto winter has led to this unexpected decision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recur had set sail with grand ambitions, boasting partnerships with iconic brands such as Hello Kitty and Nickelodeon. However, the cold winds of the crypto winter have taken a toll on the platform's sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The firm acknowledged that its core features would gradually phase out over the coming months, including the withdrawal of NFTs, cashing out stablecoin balances, and trading collectibles on Recur-hosted marketplaces.</p>
A Shift In The NFT Space
<p dir="ltr">Established in 2021, Recur positioned itself as a provider of Web3 "building blocks" for businesses, enabling the creation of in-game assets, loyalty programs, and digital collectibles through NFTs. However, Recur's fate is not unique, as the broader NFT space witnessed the closure of companies like Nifty, which had also secured partnerships with big media titles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With over 380,000 minted NFTs, Recur is working to ensure the legacy of these digital collectibles. The company plans to migrate metadata and media for its NFTs to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized file-sharing network. Additionally, other assets will be hosted on Filecoin's network, indicating Recur's commitment to maintaining the digital artifacts it helped create.</p>
A Shift In Value
<p dir="ltr">Recur's journey included milestones like the Recur Pass, which was initially sold as an NFT for $300 and granted holders early access to NFT drops. Despite an impressive early sale of a Recur Pass for $88,888, current prices reflect a stark contrast, with the cheapest pass listed on OpenSea for 0.001 ETH (about $1.69).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recur had garnered notable attention with a $50 million Series A funding round in late 2021, valuing the company at $333 million. Esteemed investors like Gary Vaynerchuk, the Winklevoss twins, and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin participated in an earlier $5 million seed funding round. Despite the initial momentum, Recur's journey underscores the volatility and challenges inherent in the NFT landscape.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In conclusion, Recur's announcement to shut down its Web3 platform serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges faced by NFT-focused companies in the ever-evolving crypto space. The dissolution of big-name partnerships and the necessity to adapt to changing market dynamics highlight the fragility of even the most promising ventures.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A phishing site has seized control of the Terra website, leading the site developers to sound the alarm and eventually freeze the Terra.money website.&nbsp;</p>
Terra.money Now Phishing Site
<p dir="ltr">Over the weekend, the Terra.money website fell under the control of hackers who were using the site to launch phishing attacks on whatever users were left on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kiruse, an esteemed web3 developer at Terra, took to Twitter to sound the alarm about this phishing site that's masquerading as the authentic Terra website. The site's sinister objective revolves around duping unsuspecting users into divulging their highly sensitive and confidential information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The domain in question, terra(dot)money, is presently under intense scrutiny due to its alleged involvement in this phishing endeavor. The perpetrators manipulated the website to pilfer sensitive user data, employing tactics that led users to unwittingly reveal their seed phrases, putting both cryptographic keys and funds in severe jeopardy.&nbsp;</p>
Alerts and Precautions
<p dir="ltr">Terra's response was swift. On August 19, the platform issued a stern warning against engaging with any site under the Terra money domain. This caution was reiterated the very next day, on August 20. Further efforts to bolster safety and security came from Station Wallet on August 21, advising users to steer clear of the Station desktop and mobile apps until their safety can be ensured.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team has also issued a strict directive for users: rely solely on the official communication channels&mdash;namely X (Twitter), Discord, and Telegram. This strategic move is aimed at ensuring that users receive authentic and trustworthy information during this period of uncertainty.</p>
Temporary Shutdown And Road Ahead
<p dir="ltr">In a bid to fend off these phishing scams, the Layer-1 blockchain Terra took the proactive step of temporarily shutting down its website.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team released an official statement on X,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">"The terra(dot)money domains have successfully been frozen to prevent further user phishing scams, but a full resolution is still underway. Our team has been working around the clock to rectify this issue, but we&rsquo;ve encountered delays with some third-party responses.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Terra is still recovering from the devastating crash of the Terra/LUNA ecosystem last year. The company is desperately attempting to rebuild its reputation by replacing CEO Do Kwon, who was arrested and then released on bail. Furthermore, news of undisclosed wallets containing $160 million worth of digital assets belonging to Do Kwon has not helped his case. It remains to be seen if the Terra team is able to deal with the new phishing attack on top of its existing troubles.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Two pioneering companies in the blockchain-based advertising landscape&mdash;VeraViews, under the Verasity ($VRA) umbrella, and Alkimi, a decentralized advertising exchange built on Ethereum &ndash; have announced their new joint venture today on August 22. The duo claims that their collaboration has the potential to redefine what's achievable in digital advertising, particularly in combating lack of transparency and inefficiency.</p>
<p>As Verasity has long argued, the advertising industry has grappled with challenges around transparency. Advertisers are often in the dark about where their ads appear, raising concerns over brand safety and ROI. The new partnership looks set to address these long-standing issues by integrating VeraViews' 'Proof of View' (PoV) technology into Alkimi Exchange's ad platform.</p>
<p>Within the collaboration, Alkimi's network of publishers can tap into VeraViews' ad stack, thus gaining access to a verified audience within VeraViews' network. Simultaneously, VeraViews will be able to scale up its monetization through Alkimi Exchange&rsquo;s robust network of advertising partners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The decentralised advertising ecosystem is still nascent, and we&rsquo;re delighted that VeraViews and Alkimi Exchange have found ways to leverage our innovative technology solutions in synergy, working together to achieve our common goal of bringing trust and transparency to the programmatic advertising supply chain,&rdquo; says David Murray, Demand Director at VeraViews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ben Putley, the CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Alkimi Exchange, adds, "Our collaboration symbolises not just a mutual understanding of our industry&rsquo;s future, but also a shared commitment to drive sustainable growth, forge new pathways, and redefine the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Broader Impact on the Advertising and Blockchain Landscape
<p>Verasity has already been a strong advocate for using tech-based solutions to battle chronic challenges that plague digital advertising for several years. Its technology is already integrated into several significant video hosting and publishing platforms, including its notable partnerships with Brightcove Marketplace and Hoopla Digital.</p>
<p>The integration between VeraViews and Alkimi Exchange could serve as a significant step in eradicating some of these pervasive issues &ndash; which according to British newspaper The Guardian affects a whopping 25 percent of all digital advertisements.</p>
<p>Should this alliance between VeraViews and Alkimi Exchange demonstrate success in mitigating fraud and increasing transparency, it may pave the way for broader adoption within the burgeoning blockchain sector &ndash; and in turn revolutionize an industry that is estimated to rise to more than a trillion US dollars annually in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>A connection between meme coins and popular social media platforms has altered how we perceive meme cryptos. Dogecoin (DOGE)&rsquo;s playful attitude may find a new home and utility on X, formerly known as Twitter. Elon Musk, an elusive tech tycoon, is at the heart of this enticing proposition. Musk's well-documented liking for meme coins has aroused the interest of both enthusiasts and bankers. Do Elonator Coin (ETOR) and Dogelon Mars (ELON), two Elon-themed meme coins, also have the possibility of future integration with X.com? Could this be the beginning of a cryptocurrency revolution led by top meme coins?</p>
<p></p>
Will Dogecoin&rsquo;s Token Integrate With X.com?
<p>Dogecoin began as a playful jest and quickly captivated the hearts of a global community. Dogecoin has proved its capacity to transcend traditional concepts of digital assets with its unique Shiba Inu logo and lighthearted approach, which piqued interest in its possible inclusion into a platform as significant as Twitter/X. The incorporation of Dogecoin into X might result in the widespread adoption of digital assets.</p>
<p>Dogecoin's incorporation into Twitter's redesigned platform, X, gives a fascinating potential to alter the convergence of social media and cryptocurrency. This possible collaboration might not only enhance Dogecoin's standing in the crypto realm but also make the digital asset ecosystem more accessible and entertaining for new investors. Integrating X and Dogecoin could bridge the gap between online culture and technology.</p>
<p></p>
Dogelon Mars: A Distinct Theme With A Playful Charm
<p>A dog-themed meme currency, Dogelon Mars operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It takes the same route as other digital currencies like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Floki Inu in its meme-centric focus. Its name is a mix of Dogecoin and Elon Musk, a multibillionaire businessman and outspoken Twitter supporter of Dogecoin. This currency has sparked considerable attention, raising the issue of whether it can follow in the footsteps of Dogecoin and benefit from integration with Twitter's X platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Musk's participation in Dogelon Mars, while not as obvious as his involvement with Dogecoin, demonstrates Musk's ability to expand his influence beyond a single cryptocurrency. As Musk's space exploration efforts gather traction, Dogelon Mars' community-driven attitude matches his goal, creating a beneficial relationship that might lead to increasing demand and possible price increases.</p>

Elonator Coin Next In Line For Integration To X.com
<p>The Elonator token was designed with a special combination of comedy, cultural significance, and promising investment opportunities. It seeks to write a new chapter in the history of meme-based digital assets. With this innovative strategy, the token may significantly advance the utility and adoption of cryptocurrencies in addition to acting as a speculative tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elonator supports a project that is driven by the community and benefits all of its investors. This dedication goes beyond the typical meme coin incentives. Investors receive significant rewards, including a brand-new Tesla. The Elonator protocol is further advanced than the invention of a passive revenue source. It also resolves a number of issues that have plagued the crypto industry thus far. The creation of a strong and varied community is Elonator's top aim.</p>
<p>Elonator's possible integration with Twitter's newly renamed platform, X, carries the promise of a mutually beneficial connection that may completely alter the parameters of online interaction. Users might encounter a fresh manner of dealing with cryptocurrencies by integrating Elonator's capabilities into the X platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
It&rsquo;s Time To Join Elonator Presale
<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s move to rename Twitter as X heralds a new age of possibilities, suggesting an intention to expand beyond its existing identity. As Twitter/X attempts to revolutionize the user experience, the inclusion of Dogecoin appears to be a bold move toward embracing the unorthodox and promoting unique interactions. And this can only mean good things for the new meme coins emerging.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This inclusion acts as a catalyst as more people get interested in digital currencies, boosting awareness and adoption to new heights. It's time to invest in the Elonator Coin presale and be part of the future when the lines between social interaction and finance are redefined. As more top meme coins move to integrate with X.com, the growth and ROI opportunities will only continue to grow, too.</p>

Could this be the beginning of a cryptocurrency revolution led by top meme coins?</p>
<p></p>
Will Dogecoin&rsquo;s Token Integrate With X.com?
<p>Dogecoin began as a playful jest and quickly captivated the hearts of a global community. Dogecoin has proved its capacity to transcend traditional concepts of digital assets with its unique Shiba Inu logo and lighthearted approach, which piqued interest in its possible inclusion into a platform as significant as Twitter/X. The incorporation of Dogecoin into X might result in the widespread adoption of digital assets.</p>
<p>Dogecoin's incorporation into Twitter's redesigned platform, X, gives a fascinating potential to alter the convergence of social media and cryptocurrency. This possible collaboration might not only enhance Dogecoin's standing in the crypto realm but also make the digital asset ecosystem more accessible and entertaining for new investors. Integrating X and Dogecoin could bridge the gap between online culture and technology.</p>
<p></p>
Dogelon Mars: A Distinct Theme With A Playful Charm
<p>A dog-themed meme currency, Dogelon Mars operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It takes the same route as other digital currencies like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Floki Inu in its meme-centric focus. Its name is a mix of Dogecoin and Elon Musk, a multibillionaire businessman and outspoken Twitter supporter of Dogecoin. This currency has sparked considerable attention, raising the issue of whether it can follow in the footsteps of Dogecoin and benefit from integration with Twitter's X platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Musk's participation in Dogelon Mars, while not as obvious as his involvement with Dogecoin, demonstrates Musk's ability to expand his influence beyond a single cryptocurrency. As Musk's space exploration efforts gather traction, Dogelon Mars' community-driven attitude matches his goal, creating a beneficial relationship that might lead to increasing demand and possible price increases.</p>

Elonator Coin Next In Line For Integration To X.com
<p>The Elonator token was designed with a special combination of comedy, cultural significance, and promising investment opportunities. It seeks to write a new chapter in the history of meme-based digital assets. With this innovative strategy, the token may significantly advance the utility and adoption of cryptocurrencies in addition to acting as a speculative tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elonator supports a project that is driven by the community and benefits all of its investors. This dedication goes beyond the typical meme coin incentives. Investors receive significant rewards, including a brand-new Tesla. The Elonator protocol is further advanced than the invention of a passive revenue source. It also resolves a number of issues that have plagued the crypto industry thus far. The creation of a strong and varied community is Elonator's top aim.</p>
<p>Elonator's possible integration with Twitter's newly renamed platform, X, carries the promise of a mutually beneficial connection that may completely alter the parameters of online interaction. Users might encounter a fresh manner of dealing with cryptocurrencies by integrating Elonator's capabilities into the X platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
It&rsquo;s Time To Join Elonator Presale
<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s move to rename Twitter as X heralds a new age of possibilities, suggesting an intention to expand beyond its existing identity. As Twitter/X attempts to revolutionize the user experience, the inclusion of Dogecoin appears to be a bold move toward embracing the unorthodox and promoting unique interactions. And this can only mean good things for the new meme coins emerging.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This inclusion acts as a catalyst as more people get interested in digital currencies, boosting awareness and adoption to new heights. It's time to invest in the Elonator Coin presale and be part of the future when the lines between social interaction and finance are redefined. As more top meme coins move to integrate with X.com, the growth and ROI opportunities will only continue to grow, too.</p>
For all things Elonator&ndash;&nbsp;

                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">When El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender two years ago, the IMF was scathing of the move, and warned of dire consequences. Two years later and El Salvador is flourishing.</p>
IMF against decentralisation
<p dir="ltr">Max Keiser, pro Bitcoin entrepreneur, now living in El Salvador, was interviewed on the Swan Bitcoin YouTube channel, where he gave his thoughts on the IMF and how El Salvador is on a much better path.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Keiser started by saying that in his view the IMF was akin to a central bank, and that central banks do not like decentralised money, and that the IMF does not like the idea that El Salvador can adopt Bitcoin and decentralise itself away from the fiat monetary system.</p>
Years of US exploitation
<p dir="ltr">Keiser quoted John Perkin&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Confessions of an Economic Hitman&rdquo; which tells of US-backed hitmen who he claims were out to instigate coups and topple governments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He said that the US always looked upon Latin America as its own &ldquo;backyard&rdquo; and that it was there to be controlled with the help of huge multinational corporations such as the United Fruit Company which heavily exploited the countries in which they were based.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Keiser said that since Bitcoin came into being with its decentralised and sound money, it was putting central banks out of a business that has been perpetuated for 300 years and would end up making them extinct, and in the process also make the IMF irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>
El Salvador&rsquo;s energy program
<p dir="ltr">One of the biggest excuses for detractors maligning Bitcoin is its heavy use of energy for its proof-of-work consensus. However, Keiser explained how El Salvador will use geothermal energy to supply the power for Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nevertheless, the lead time for developing such an infrastructure is around five years, therefore the country is developing its wind and solar plants to help fill in the gap until volcano power is fully harnessed and online. $1 billion was raised for this project, of which $250 million has already been allocated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Keiser talked of how in the future countries will compete to provide the Bitcoin hashrate, and how El Salvador was the only country in the world to have a pro-Bitcoin mining policy right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The IMF and central banks across the world should be very worried. Financial technology has moved on and will leave all these legacy financial institutions in the dust of yesterday.</p>

                    <description>
                        <![CDATA[<p>According to LBank's latest announcement: https://support.lbank.com/hc/en-gb/articles/22061348602521</p>
<ul>
<li>Amsterdam-based cryptocurrency exchange Finst announces the successful release of its Proof of Reserves (PoR) conducted by a reputable and independent audit firm</li>
<li>Finst&rsquo;s extensive Proof of Reserves audit is a first-of-its-kind, aiming to address the limitations of traditional PoR and set higher transparency standards in the crypto industry</li>
<li>The audit, which will be renewed at least every 6 months, confirmed that Finst holds its clients&rsquo; assets on a full reserve basis (1:1) and has implemented an effective segregation of assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a crypto investor, getting access to reliable insights into an exchange&rsquo;s reserves and overall safety should be the norm. 8 months only after its launch,&nbsp;Finst&nbsp;becomes the first and only Dutch cryptocurrency platform to unveil an extensive Proof of Reserves audit conducted by AuditNow, a reputable and independent Dutch audit firm.</p>
<p>The audit was skillfully led by AuditNow&rsquo;s CEO, Dani&euml;l Waknine, a distinguished member of the World Compliance Association who has previously been collaborating with esteemed institutions such as BNP Paribas and ING holding.</p>
<p>As part of its Proof of Reserves audit, Finst has developed a comprehensive framework which provides full transparency on its structure, operations, assets, liabilities, business activities and overall&nbsp;safety.</p>
<p>Challenging traditional Proof of Reserves limitations</p>
<p>Traditional Proof of Reserves audits merely focus on an exchange&rsquo;s on chain holdings, with a scope often being limited to certain crypto assets, thus excluding the cash reserves of an exchange and its liabilities. Besides, traditional PoR audits do not verify whether an exchange has an effective segregation of assets in place, which is key in providing maximum safety as it prevents commingling of assets.</p>

<p>Julien Vallet, CEO &amp; co-founder, commented:&nbsp;&ldquo;Our analysis of various Proof of Reserves (PoR) statements highlighted a need for greater clarity in this area. Traditional PoR tend to leave important questions unanswered for investors, which is why we decided to develop a new standard which goes far beyond the verification of on-chain holdings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The outcome of Finst&rsquo;s Proof of Reserves audit</p>
<p>The results of this thorough and independent audit confirmed that Finst holds the entirety of its clients&rsquo; assets on a full reserve basis (1:1) and has an effective segregation of assets in place through a bankruptcy-remote vehicle. Additionally, the audit verified the following key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finst has policies and procedures in place to correctly safeguard its clients&rsquo; assets</li>
<li>The designated roles and responsibilities in the safeguarding procedures are fulfilled</li>
<li>A strict restriction of assets transfers to designated senior management employees is enforced</li>
<li>Clients&rsquo; assets are held in a bank account and wallets through a bankruptcy-remote vehicle, without any possibility of commingling funds</li>
<li>All clients&rsquo; assets have been acquired through users&rsquo; deposits, without the use of any loans</li>
<li>There is no transfer or use of clients&rsquo; assets by any third party</li>
<li>Clients&rsquo; assets are fully available, with a maximum time frame of 2 days</li>
<li>Finst&rsquo;s collateralization rate is &gt;100% for all coins listed on its platform</li>
<li>All cryptocurrencies listed on Finst&rsquo;s platform have been included in the audit scope</li>
</ul>
<p>The exchange also confirmed that it will renew its comprehensive Proof of Reserves audit at least every 6 months to ensure continuous and transparent information for its clients.</p>

<p>Julien Vallet, added:&nbsp;&ldquo;Cryptocurrency investors rightfully deserve to know how well they are protected, especially in the wake of recent global exchanges collapses. We were surprised to see that no Dutch crypto platform has ever released a Proof of Reserves, and we firmly believe that this should become a standard practice. We extend an open invitation to all crypto platforms to join us in embracing this vital initiative so that we can collectively enhance the transparency and safety of the entire industry.&rdquo;</p>

                    <description>
                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The team behind Friend.tech has vehemently denied a report that claimed the personal data of over 100,000 of its users had been leaked.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was claimed in a report that Banteg, a core contributor to Yearn Finance, had published scraped details of Friend.tech users, including Twitter usernames and addresses.&nbsp;</p>
Friend.tech Denies Report&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">The report suggested that data posted by a pseudo-anonymous developer for Yearn Finance, Banteg, was leaked information. According to the report, the information published contained scraped details of over 100,000 Friend.tech users. However, the Friend.tech team countered the report, stating that the information published by Banteg came from scraping its public API. In a post on X, the Friend.tech official feed stated the report was basically saying we got hacked by someone who simply looked at our Twitter feed. The post also called out the publication that published the report.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;This is just someone scraping our public API that shows the association between public wallet addresses and public Twitter usernames. It&rsquo;s like saying someone hacked you by looking at your public Twitter feed.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The post by Friend.tech also received input from X&rsquo;s Community Notes contributors, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The underlying data is public, and anybody can work it out by reading a block explorer: if you buy a share, 5% goes to the creator&rsquo;s wallet, and he will have needed to fund his wallet. The database only scraps that public info.&rdquo;</p>

Banteg&rsquo;s Original Post&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">Banteg had published a repository containing publicly available scraped data, including critical details of users on the Friend.tech platform on GitHub. The details include wallet addresses on Base and the corresponding Twitter usernames of over 100,000 users. Banteg stated in a post,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;101,183 people have given friend.tech access to post as them, leaked db (database) indicates.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">He also drew attention to Friend.tech&rsquo;s permissions, insisting that users had granted the app to post on their behalf without a complete understanding or consent. Notably, Banteg&rsquo;s post regarding the data came after a post from blockchain analytics service Spon-On-Chain, which noted that Friend.tech&rsquo;s API revealed specific information not available to typical users of the app. Spot-On-Chain also gave an example of this, stating that wallets created by certain users could be viewed through the API.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spot-On-Chain stated that this information could potentially be used to game the system by allowing bots to almost instantaneously purchase shares of big accounts as soon as they signed up on the Friend.tech platform. Spot-On-Chain added,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;A lot of bots have already taken advantage of this, it monitors the contract, finds the big KOL, and buys shares before others.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, X users saw the funny side of the unfolding situation, with one user posting a link to the Ethereum block explorer and claiming that they had discovered a leaked database of all transactions on Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Friend.tech is a Web3 social application on the Base Layer-2 chain. It gives users a platform to trade shares in Twitter accounts, giving shareholders unique features such as access to private chat rooms. The platform has gained considerable traction since its launch, particularly due to a number of high-profile signups. Friend.tech had also recently generated over $1.4 million in protocol fees, putting it among the top three crypto projects when it came to fees. The project ranked only behind Ethereum and Lido.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The team behind Friend.tech has vehemently denied a report that claimed the personal data of over 100,000 of its users had been leaked.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was claimed in a report that Banteg, a core contributor to Yearn Finance, had published scraped details of Friend.tech users, including Twitter usernames and addresses.&nbsp;</p>
Friend.tech Denies Report&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">The report suggested that data posted by a pseudo-anonymous developer for Yearn Finance, Banteg, was leaked information. According to the report, the information published contained scraped details of over 100,000 Friend.tech users. However, the Friend.tech team countered the report, stating that the information published by Banteg came from scraping its public API. In a post on X, the Friend.tech official feed stated the report was basically saying we got hacked by someone who simply looked at our Twitter feed. The post also called out the publication that published the report.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;This is just someone scraping our public API that shows the association between public wallet addresses and public Twitter usernames. It&rsquo;s like saying someone hacked you by looking at your public Twitter feed.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The post by Friend.tech also received input from X&rsquo;s Community Notes contributors, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The underlying data is public, and anybody can work it out by reading a block explorer: if you buy a share, 5% goes to the creator&rsquo;s wallet, and he will have needed to fund his wallet. The database only scraps that public info.&rdquo;</p>

Banteg&rsquo;s Original Post&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">Banteg had published a repository containing publicly available scraped data, including critical details of users on the Friend.tech platform on GitHub. The details include wallet addresses on Base and the corresponding Twitter usernames of over 100,000 users. Banteg stated in a post,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;101,183 people have given friend.tech access to post as them, leaked db (database) indicates.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">He also drew attention to Friend.tech&rsquo;s permissions, insisting that users had granted the app to post on their behalf without a complete understanding or consent. Notably, Banteg&rsquo;s post regarding the data came after a post from blockchain analytics service Spon-On-Chain, which noted that Friend.tech&rsquo;s API revealed specific information not available to typical users of the app. Spot-On-Chain also gave an example of this, stating that wallets created by certain users could be viewed through the API.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spot-On-Chain stated that this information could potentially be used to game the system by allowing bots to almost instantaneously purchase shares of big accounts as soon as they signed up on the Friend.tech platform. Spot-On-Chain added,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;A lot of bots have already taken advantage of this, it monitors the contract, finds the big KOL, and buys shares before others.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, X users saw the funny side of the unfolding situation, with one user posting a link to the Ethereum block explorer and claiming that they had discovered a leaked database of all transactions on Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Friend.tech is a Web3 social application on the Base Layer-2 chain. It gives users a platform to trade shares in Twitter accounts, giving shareholders unique features such as access to private chat rooms. The platform has gained considerable traction since its launch, particularly due to a number of high-profile signups. Friend.tech had also recently generated over $1.4 million in protocol fees, putting it among the top three crypto projects when it came to fees. The project ranked only behind Ethereum and Lido.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Coinbase and Circle, the two entities behind USD Coin (USDC), have announced new terms that would change the governance and funding of the USDC stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new terms will see Coinbase acquire an equity stake in Circle, with the two also shutting the Centre Consortium, which initially governed the stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>
Coinbase Takes Equity Stake&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">The new agreement reflects the shifting economics and popularity of the USDC stablecoin and comes at a time when it is facing competition from other stablecoins in the market and an uncertain regulatory environment. Competing stablecoins include offshore rival Tether and the recently announced PayPal stablecoin. As part of the new terms, Circle will also be launching USDC on six new blockchains over the next few months. The company hopes this will increase the adoption of the stablecoin, although it has not provided any details about how. In an update published on its website, Circle stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Circle and Coinbase, the founding companies behind Centre Consortium, a jointly managed self-governance consortium for USDC, have agreed that with growing regulatory clarity for stablecoins in the U.S. and around the world, the requirement of a separate governance body like Centre is no longer needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">It is also still unclear how big of a stake Coinbase got in Circle. However, what is known is that Coinbase did not give Circle cash for the deal, according to sources familiar with the matter. It is also not known which six blockchains will see the introduction of USDC. Circle did state back in September 2022 that it was looking to add Near, Polkadot, Optimism, and Cosmos.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;USDC will be launching on six new blockchains between September and October, bringing multi-chain access of USDC up to 15 to continue accelerating USDC&rsquo;s momentum with developers around the world.&rdquo;</p>

A Strong Alignment For Long-Term Success&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire stated that the new arrangement helps to &ldquo;tune up the economics in a way that felt really fair for both of us.&rdquo; He further stated that the equity lays the foundation for a good, strong alignment for long-term success. Coinbase and Circle previously operated using a revenue-share agreement outlined in financial disclosure forms from both companies. The split was based on the amount of USDC distributed by each firm and the amount of USDC held on each platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Under the new agreement, income generated through interest will be equally shared from off-platform USDC, such as USDC held in DeFi wallets.&nbsp;</p>
A Major Change For USDC&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">The shuttering of Centre is a significant change for USDC. The initial whitepaper showed Centre as a steward for a global, interoperable payments network that focused on consumers and would include a number of fiat-backed tokens. However, so far, Centre has only launched USDC, while Circle issued a euro-backed stablecoin which was accessible on two blockchains.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, recent initiatives around USDC have targeted the crypto developer community. These include the launch of cross-blockchain transfers and programmable wallets, which also reflect on the predominance of DeFi.&nbsp;</p>
Governance To Shift Under Circle&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">Centre initially described itself as a consortium but only included Coinbase and Circle as members. This is because partnerships with other firms did not materialize. The organization, at one point, had over 20 employees, although this figure dwindled to under 10 in recent months. The new arrangement will see the governance of USDC shift under Circle. According to Allaire, governance under a separate entity like Centre was no longer needed as governments worldwide developed and adopted stablecoin legislation.&nbsp;</p>
Spurring Growth&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">For the moment, Coinbase and Circle face a different challenge, that of spurring the growth of USDC. Back in March, Circle revealed that around $3.3 billion of the reserves backing USDC were stuck at Silicon Valley Bank. As a result, the stablecoin had briefly lost its peg to the dollar. However, the price recovered after the federal government guaranteed Circle&rsquo;s deposits with the bank. However, USDC has seen a considerable decline in its market share, with most of the stablecoin market moving to Tether. Tether&rsquo;s market cap is currently around $83 billion, while USDC is around $26 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The stablecoin markets have also seen a considerable shakeup with the introduction of PayPal&rsquo;s PYUSD stablecoin, launched in partnership with Paxos.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">The SEC charged Titan Global Management with securities violations, alleging the firm misrepresented performance metrics. The firm agreed to a cease-and-desist order and will pay a $850,000 fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">In a statement released on Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission alleges that Titan Global Management used &ldquo;hypothetical performance metrics in advertisements that were misleading.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
Titan Accused of an Array of Transgressions 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">According to its statement, the SEC also charged the New-York-based Fintech firm with &ldquo;multiple compliance failures that led to misleading disclosures about custody of clients&rsquo; crypto assets, the use of improper &ldquo;hedge clauses&rdquo; in client agreements, the unauthorized use of client signatures and the failure to adopt policies concerning crypto asset trading by employees.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">The press release further explains the SEC&rsquo;s order: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;The SEC&rsquo;s order further finds that Titan (1) made conflicting disclosures to clients about how Titan custodied crypto assets; (2) included in its client advisory agreements liability disclaimer language that created the false impression that clients had waived non-waivable causes of action against Titan; and (3), contrary to representations, failed to adopt policies and procedures concerning employee personal trading in crypto assets. The order also states that Titan self-reported to the SEC staff that it failed to ensure that client signatures were obtained for certain types of transactions in client accounts and agreed to settle related charges.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">The SEC said that from August 2021 to October 2022, Titan made &ldquo;misleading statements&rdquo; on its website and advertised &ldquo;annualized&rdquo; performance results of up to 2,700% for its Titan Crypto strategy product.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">Chief of the Enforcement&rsquo;s Complex Financial Instruments Unit, Osman Nawaz, said: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;When offering and marketing complex strategies, investment advisers must ensure the accuracy of disclosures made to existing and prospective investors. The Commission amended the marketing rule to allow for the use of hypothetical performance metrics but only if advisers comply with requirements reasonably designed to prevent fraud.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;Titan&rsquo;s advertisements and disclosures painted a misleading picture of certain of its strategies for investors. This action serves as a warning for all advisers to ensure compliance.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Titan agreed to a cease-and-desist order to pay a $850,000 civil penalty which will be distributed to affected customers, to pay $192,454 in disgorgement and prejudgement interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">The SEC hastened its crackdown on the crypto industry this year, sued Binance and Coinbase, charged 18 defendants involved in DEBT Box, charged Hex founder Richard Heart with securities violations, and warned auditing firms over misleading crypto audits.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">A new report from the US FBI reveals it confiscated almost $2 million in cryptocurrencies between March and May 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">In its latest filing, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) revealed it seized about $1.7 million in cryptocurrencies from March to May. In an effort to combat illicit activities, the FBI seized crypto assets, including Bitcoin, Ether, Tether, Monero and Dai.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">The agency reported that most of the confiscations were in ether, with tokens to the value of $800,000 seized. Around $147,000 in Bitcoin (BTC), $307,000 in Tether (USDT), 469,000 in Dai (DAI), and $20,000 in Monero (XMR) were seized. The FBI even managed to seize $200 worth of Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">According to the FBI, the majority of seizures were from Binance accounts. The largest confiscation took place in the Eastern District of Virginia in the form of $463,811 in ether. The agency said most of the seizures came from Florida and Virginia. The FBI further confiscated digital assets in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Illinois, Massachusetts, Louisiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">In its filing, the agency said the asset seizures came about after violations of federal regulations: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) gives notice that the property listed below was seized for federal forfeiture for violation of federal law.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">The FBI has been cracking down on digital assets used in illicit activities. In February, the agency announced that it confiscated several cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and NFTs worth around $250,000 from two different locations in the US. The agency also announced in March that it launched an investigation into Do Kwon and Terraform Labs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">Melbourne-based cryptocurrency lender Helio Lending received a sentence for a non-conviction good behaviour bond for a year after it falsely claimed to have a local credit license.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) said Helio Lending had been sentenced for stating that it held a local credit license. Helio was sentenced to a non-conviction bond of AU$ 15,000 ($9,600) based on the condition it displays good behaviour for a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">In a media statement, the ASIC said: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;Melbourne-based cryptocurrency lender Helio Lending Pty Ltd (Helio) has been sentenced to a non-conviction bond for falsely claiming that it held an Australian credit licence (ACL) when it did not.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">Helio entered into a recognisance in the sum of $15,000 for a period of 12-months on the condition they are of good behaviour.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">The ASIC states the lender made false representations in a news article on its website in August 2019, claiming it held a local credit license. According to the Commission, &ldquo;Helio was neither an ACL holder nor a representative of an ACL holder at the time the statement appeared.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">The ASIC explained that falsely claiming to have an ACL breaches section 30 of the National Consumer Protection Act 2009. The crypto lender was sentenced under section 19B(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1914.&nbsp;</p>
ASIC Will Not Tolerate &ldquo;Misleading&rdquo; Statements
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">At the time of the false claim, Helio offered crypto-backed loans to consumers using crypto as security over the loan. The lender pleaded guilty to the charge of making false statements. A further charge relating to alleged content on Helio&rsquo;s website was withdrawn.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court commented on Helio&rsquo;s conduct and sentence, saying: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">&ldquo;We expect entities and individuals to provide accurate information to their customers and potential customers. Helio falsely claimed that it held an Australian Credit licence, misleading their customers to believe that they had the protections afforded by such a licence.&rdquo; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">&nbsp;The sentence of a non-conviction good behaviour bond means that the lender will only face conviction if it breaks its bond.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The crypto market is at the edge of perhaps another move to the downside. Binance token $BNB needs to bounce soon, or face a drop into the void.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The crypto market is in the red for yet another day. Bitcoin is flirting with $26,000 currently, and should it now fall and go through the support at $25,000 then things could get rather uncomfortable indeed for the entire crypto sector.</p>
A bounce in sight?
<p dir="ltr">However, bitcoin is battling and bulls do not look as though they will go down without a real fight. A rather large gap on CME is open above, with the upper bound at $27,620. Given that bitcoin is also looking quite oversold, a potential bounce could be seen later today or tomorrow.</p>
Plenty of bad news around
<p dir="ltr">There is plenty of really negative news on the global financial front, such as Chinese property developer Evergrande going into bankruptcy, but these sorts of events are nearly always priced into the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With global financial markets at the edge of their own black hole, there will definitely be a need for bitcoin, which is outside of the huge timebomb of $1 quadrillion + in derivatives. Holders should think of this before selling.</p>
Binance continues to suffer
<p dir="ltr">One issue within the crypto ecosystem is that of the continuing SEC persecution of Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume. Having already published its intentions to sue the exchange and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, the enforcement overhang is having a deleterious effect on Binance.</p>
$BNB on the brink
<p dir="ltr">For the $BNB exchange token things are looking rather shaky. From a technical perspective, $BNB has fallen out of its bear flag and has lost the $220 support. A measured move out of the flag should still see $BNB fall a lot further, but this is probably immaterial as there is really no kind of decent support until under $50, which is a more than 4x drop into the abyss from here.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Should such a calamity befall $BNB, and the exchange goes into a nosedive, the impact for the rest of crypto could potentially be far worse than the FTX and LUNA meltdowns, putting the bull market on hold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If this worst case scenario does come into fruition it should be remembered that bitcoin, ethereum, and some of the fundamentally stronger cryptos might be at bargain basement prices. Investors should do their research.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There is plenty of really negative news on the global financial front, such as Chinese property developer Evergrande going into bankruptcy, but these sorts of events are nearly always priced into the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With global financial markets at the edge of their own black hole, there will definitely be a need for bitcoin, which is outside of the huge timebomb of $1 quadrillion + in derivatives. Holders should think of this before selling.</p>
Binance continues to suffer
<p dir="ltr">One issue within the crypto ecosystem is that of the continuing SEC persecution of Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume. Having already published its intentions to sue the exchange and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, the enforcement overhang is having a deleterious effect on Binance.</p>
$BNB on the brink
<p dir="ltr">For the $BNB exchange token things are looking rather shaky. From a technical perspective, $BNB has fallen out of its bear flag and has lost the $220 support. A measured move out of the flag should still see $BNB fall a lot further, but this is probably immaterial as there is really no kind of decent support until under $50, which is a more than 4x drop into the abyss from here.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Should such a calamity befall $BNB, and the exchange goes into a nosedive, the impact for the rest of crypto could potentially be far worse than the FTX and LUNA meltdowns, putting the bull market on hold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If this worst case scenario does come into fruition it should be remembered that bitcoin, ethereum, and some of the fundamentally stronger cryptos might be at bargain basement prices. Investors should do their research.</p>

                    <description>
                        <![CDATA[<p class="s4">Investors and traders are consistently on the lookout for high-growth cryptocurrencies. Whale movements typically indicate that an altcoin could potentially get a significant level of attention or spike in value in the future. Recently, whales behind the ApeCoin (APE) and VeChain (VET) cryptocurrencies began accumulating Pomerdoge (POMD)..</p>
Summary
● ApeCoin decreased in value by 69.6% during the year
● VeChain is down 9.3% in the past 30 days
● Pomerdoge (POMD) attracts whale attention with potential 17x spike

ApeCoin (APE) Price Movement
<p class="s4">As of August 14, 2023, the ApeCoin (APE) cryptocurrency traded at a value of $2.08. During the past week, its low point was at $1.79, with its high point at $2.10.</p>
<p class="s4">Moreover, the ApeCoin crypto had a market cap of $769,172,736 and a 24-hour trading volume of $143,182,381. In the past week, its price increased by 12.1%.</p>
<p class="s4">However, during the past year, the ApeCoin price decreased by 69.6%, and this worried investors. As a result, many whales began diversifying from the cryptocurrency. In any case, according to the ApeCoin price prediction, it is expected to reach $2.32 by the end of the year.</p>
VeChain (VET) Price Prediction
<p class="s4">Then there's VeChain (VET), a competing project that was also initially accumulated by whales. As of August 14, 2023, It trades at $0.01834331. In addition, during the past week, the low point for VeChian was at $0.01740241, while the high point was at $0.01834902.</p>
<p class="s4">The overall VeChain crypto market cap was at $1,333,631,743, with its 24-hour trading volume at $34,511,656. As of recently, it showcased a bearish performance, as in the past 30 days, it's down 8.3%.</p>
<p class="s4">It did attempt to recover in the past week with a 3.1% increase, but its decrease has been higher. According to the VeChain price prediction, it can reach $0.023 by the end of the year.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) to Spike 17x
<p class="s4">With the recent bearish performance behind ApeCoin and VeChain, whales began to diversify. The main cryptocurrency they've switched to is Pomerdoge (POMD). It's a unique ecosystem that combines the best elements of meme-coins and the Play-to-Earn (P2E) sector to provide an innovative experience.</p>
<p class="s4">There are three main components behind it, including Pomergame, Pomerplace, and an NFT collection. Pomergame is a virtual world where players can explore and finish objectives in order to get virtual rewards or items of value. They are rewarded for their time committed to the game. Each player has a character called a Pomer.</p>
<p class="s4">Once a Pomer reaches gold status, it can then enable them to enter the Pomerplace. This is the dedicated marketplace in which anyone can buy, sell or trade valuables. However, it also features an Arena where players can compete. Subsequently, there's a 7,777 NFT collection, where anyone who holds the POMD token can buy each NFT for 0.2 ETH.</p>
<p class="s4">During the early presale period, Pomerdoge (POMD) trades at just $0.008. However, analysts are bullish on its future and predict that it can spike in value by 17x at launch. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zebec has launched Nautilus, a modular L3 network that supports its blockchain-based global payment infrastructure. Nautilus enables continuous payment streaming and real-time payroll services on a previously impossible scale.</p>
<p>As a first-of-its-kind L3, Nautilus enables more than just instant payments. It can also facilitate Zebec Protocol&rsquo;s live-payment streaming service at scale, made possible by the fastest EVM environment in web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capable of parallel transaction processing, Nautilus is built for scalability, interoperability, and security through interchangeable modules for consensus, settlement, data availability, and transaction execution. This modularity will have a significant impact on how web3 payment infrastructure is composed and adopted.</p>

<p>"Zebec is helping to create a future where money moves more freely, providing individuals, businesses, investors, and teams with quicker and easier access to funds and tokens," said Zebec Founder Sam Thapaliya. "Launching the Nautilus Chain, and the new suite of products built on it, is a significant step towards our vision."</p>

<p>With Nautilus now live, Zebec&rsquo;s team is set to bring single-side staking and DeFi yields online in select jurisdictions and power ZebecPay - its live streaming web3 payroll services. Zebec is also in the process&nbsp;of launching a traditional payroll app, WageLink, with a planned integration with Circle. With the Nautilus chain functionality, Zebec is able to offer crypto off-ramps directly linked to US bank accounts (via a partnership with CoinFlow) and roll out Zebec Card programs in Asia and Europe. These products and services will augment Zebec's existing services.</p>
<p>Zebec started as a continuous settlement protocol that enabled real-time payments, or payment streaming, allowing businesses to pay employees and partners in real-time in a tax-compliant way. However, the limitations of existing blockchain technology soon became apparent. Networks were either too slow or too unreliable to keep up with demand. To solve the issue, Zebec Labs created a next-generation blockchain: fast enough to facilitate payment streaming at scale, which could, critically, integrate with Ethereum-based chains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally planned for Zebec&rsquo;s core DeFi projects for internal payments and value/assets transfer, Nautilus testnet became one of the most prominent testnets in the crypto world. Having facilitated over 50 million transactions, with 400,000 wallets and 3,000 smart contracts deployed in its first 8 months, Nautilus chain has proven its utility and functionality beyond DeFi and opened to projects from other sectors, such as NFTs, Gamefi, etc., thus becoming a &ldquo;general purpose&rdquo; L3.</p>
<p>A huge upside to Nautilus&rsquo; modular system is that it gives developers the flexibility to configure the &ldquo;chain stack&rdquo; they use to build their dApps. A modular chain uses interchangeable modules for consensus, data availability, settlement, and execution. Each of these layers can be configured to developer needs or optimized based on the dApp being serviced. Especially at the execution layer, customized rollups can be deployed that optimize for privacy or scalability, or decentralization &mdash; whatever is required by the dApp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modular chains allow for infinite horizontal scaling and greater levels of interoperability. Since developers build from the same pool of modules, code is safer, more battle-tested, and easier to connect. More rollups and parallel chains can be deployed to increase block space and throughput effectively. Nautilus is a pioneer in this new type of blockchain, and its architecture will permanently change how blockchains are built and bring them into the real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At launch, Nautilus&rsquo; settlement layer is built using Solana&rsquo;s VM, MOVE, and its execution layer on Neon EVM using Solidity smart contracts. Data availability is stored off-chain using Celestia. Nautilus' initial default execution layer will use optimistic rollups, but the team plans to transition to zkRollups for faster settlements, privacy, and even higher levels of scalability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nautilus is built with Celestia and Eclipse empowering modular chains. Through Celesita, Nautilus allows projects to tailor their consensus and settlement layers. Eclipse allows builders on Nautilus to deploy customized rollups on their execution layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result is a chain with Solana-like speeds but with the security and decentralization of Ethereum. According to its engineers, Nautilus has been tested up to 3,000 TPS, but the team expects the number to increase with the transition to zkRollups. By having such a high TPS, Nautilus chain provides a platform that can keep up with the demands of the real world, opening the door to decentralized markets for financial instruments and assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and tokenized real-world assets.</p>
<p>Thanks to Nautilus, Zebec can now operate on a much larger scale. Businesses can pay employees and partners in real time through live payments or payment streaming. Zebec&rsquo;s goal isn&rsquo;t merely to provide more efficient payment services; it&rsquo;s to onboard millions of new users through user-friendly, secure payment apps and new use cases.</p>
<p>Zebec&rsquo;s innovation paves the way for pay-as-you-go payment plans for streaming services, car-sharing platforms, gyms, residential clubs, and more. It enables potential new business models and applications not yet created. As Zebec continues to innovate and grow its ecosystem, it invites developers and founders from around the world to join it in creating a more connected, efficient, and accessible financial future.</p>

<p>Zebec enables real-time and continuous streams of payments and financial transactions for payroll, investments, and more. It was founded in 2021, with investments from Circle, Coinbase, Solana Ventures, Breyer Capital, Republic, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, among others. Zebec already services hundreds of companies, running thousands of continuous payment streams and bringing the blockchain to our day-to-day lives.</p>

<p>Solidus AITECH Tokenomics</p>
<p>In tune with the forward-looking innovations that are coming out of Solidus AI Tech&rsquo;s ecosystems, their vision of a decentralized, digital future is underscored with its elegant tokenomics that complement and underpin their system processes. Empowering users of all types with equal access to high quality infrastructure the $AITECH token adheres to inclusive, cost-efficient ideologies. From a payment vehicle for their product licenses, an incentive for creating and publishing quality AI tooling, and membership to the DAO, $AITECH is worth taking a look at:</p>
<p>Token Name: AI TechToken Symbol: $AITECHToken Standard: BEP-20Issuing Network: Binance Smart ChainTotal Supply: 2,000,000,000</p>
<p>Moreover, the $AITECH token has adopted the leading practices in deflationary economics by implementing a variable burn program that takes 5%-10% of every transaction used for acquiring platform serves and systematically removes them from circulation; thereby exerting constant pressure on the open market dynamics of the asset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>$AITECH IDO on ChainGPT Pad Details</p>
<p>Solidus AI Tech has dedicated a portion of its supply for the ChainGPT Pad IDO as follows:</p>

<p>Based in Europe, Solidus AI Tech is an IaaS (infrastructure as a service) company that is solving some of the most prevalent, fundamental issues plaguing the digital economy; namely the demand for computational infrastructure. Building out their own 8,000-square-foot facility to house hardware that has been wired with their proprietary algorithms that improve computational costs and efficiencies. In tandem to the physical infrastructure, they are tapping into their resources to provide a full stack of cutting-edge Web3 infrastructural software solutions including Artificial-Intelligence-as-a-service (AIaaS), Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS), High Performance Computing power (HPC), and an Artificial Intelligence marketplace.</p>
<p>What does AI Tech Provide?</p>
<p>As an infrastructure services company, Solidus AI Tech is providing a suite of four core services that can be used by companies, institutions, and even governments as a foundation to build sustainable digital systems. From metaverse to CBDC to gaming and beyond this is what AI Tech is providing:</p>
<p>AIaaS - Artificial-Intelligence-as-a-serviceArtificial intelligence is the frontier of mankind's intellectual flourishing. Considered to be just as, if not more important a technological revolution as was the steam engine, AI has become the building block for new technologies promising to improve the lives of people around the world. Solidus AI Tech has neatly wrapped up a turnkey solution to jumpstart the integrations and implementations of AI into a broad range of applications.</p>
<p>BaaS - Blockchain-as-a-serviceBuilding blockchains from scratch is an extremely tedious, long, and resource-intensive (labor and capital) process. Building quality blockchains that can satisfy the security and operational demands of sensitive, high-value operations if even more arduous. Solidus AI Tech is extending its intelligent blockchain designs for any imaginable use case.</p>
<p>HPC - High Performance ComputationThe demand for computation continues to grow alongside the world&rsquo;s population that is coming online and new energy-dependent solutions are introduced into society. Solidus AI Tech provides computation for the most intensive use cases across a multitude of industries.</p>
<p>AI MarketplaceThe exchange of automated intelligent processes unlocks an entirely new machine economy that contributes to a potentially entirely new and untapped market segment. Solidus AI Tech will be providing a venue where industrial and individual AI commerce can take place.</p>
<p>What are some of AI Tech&rsquo;s Unique Features?</p>
<p>Apart from the four key products that Solidus AI tech provides, there is a mixture of sophisticated novel developments at the design, code, and principle layers of the project that make it stand out from the crowd and supersede all existing solutions attempting to spearhead the enormous, evergreen market segment of Computational Infrastructure.</p>
<p>Some of these features include:</p>
<p>High Performance Computing Costs reductionNotorious for its insatiable energy demands, HPC is a problem that is looking for solutions beyond just the linear increase of hardware. Solidus AI Tech has developed proprietary algorithms that improve hardware efficiencies by 40% above the benchmark rate of existing industry standards; driving down costs, while increasing efficiency.</p>
<p>Eco Friendly Computation IP (Intellectual Property)Going hand-in-hand with its HPC reductions costs, a byproduct of Solidus AI Tech&rsquo;s focus on optimization has resulted in the creation of innovations granting them intellectual property in the form of algorithmic systems that is much friendly for the environment with its efficient (lowered) consumption of energy and heightened computational capacity.</p>
<p>Custom Data CenterSolidus AI Tech has been able to secure a location with some of the lowest-cost energy and highest internet speed internet in all of Europe. With the presence of an in-house data center, Solidus AI Tech is in control of the computational supply chain and has full sovereignty in optimizing its service across every vertical of supply and demand. Built in Bucharest, the facility spans some 8,000 square feet and operates under ISO 14001:2015.Vulnerability MonitoringSecurity, monitoring, and specifically designed firewalls, Solidus AI tech provides a full spectrum of proactive protective measures to ensure the reliability of its systems.

From voting, taxation, land registration, and supply chain traceability to Healthcare and Identity management; the security, flexibility and expertise Solidus AI Tech provides caters to every grade of entity.</p>
<p>Solidus AITECH Tokenomics</p>
<p>In tune with the forward-looking innovations that are coming out of Solidus AI Tech&rsquo;s ecosystems, their vision of a decentralized, digital future is underscored with its elegant tokenomics that complement and underpin their system processes. Empowering users of all types with equal access to high quality infrastructure the $AITECH token adheres to inclusive, cost-efficient ideologies. From a payment vehicle for their product licenses, an incentive for creating and publishing quality AI tooling, and membership to the DAO, $AITECH is worth taking a look at:</p>
<p>Token Name: AI TechToken Symbol: $AITECHToken Standard: BEP-20Issuing Network: Binance Smart ChainTotal Supply: 2,000,000,000</p>
<p>Moreover, the $AITECH token has adopted the leading practices in deflationary economics by implementing a variable burn program that takes 5%-10% of every transaction used for acquiring platform serves and systematically removes them from circulation; thereby exerting constant pressure on the open market dynamics of the asset.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, will list DongCoin (DONG) on August 25, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the DONG/USDT trading pair will be officially available for trading at 8:00 UTC on August 25, 2023.</p>
<p>DongCoin (DONG) is Korea's first shitcoin (excluding Luna).</p>
<p>Introducing DongCoin</p>
<p>LBank Exchange is thrilled to announce the upcoming listing of DongCoin (DONG), Korea&rsquo;s first shitcoin (excluding Luna).</p>
<p>The global digital currency sphere is no stranger to meme coins. Yet, the waves created by these fun, internet-inspired tokens have not fully hit the shores of South Korea until now. Enter 똥코인 (DongCoin), Korea's premier meme coin. Though Luna may claim some notoriety, DongCoin is setting out to prove its mettle in the meme coin arena.</p>
<p>While meme coins have been majorly a Western phenomenon, with tokens inspired by internet humor, DongCoin serves as Korea's answer to this trend. The name itself &ndash; "똥" which translates to "s**t" in English &ndash; carries a cheeky nod to the term "s**tcoin". This is not just a coin; it's a statement, embracing the humor and playfulness that internet culture is known for.</p>
<p>The fact that Americans aren't the only ones enjoying meme coins is now evident. Koreans have a rich internet culture, appreciating memes and emoticons, notably the poop emoji. Now, they have a coin tailored for their humor.</p>
<p>About DONG Token</p>
<p>A whopping 420,000,000,006,969 tokens are up for grabs. Such an elaborate figure, filled with meme-worthy numbers like 420 and 69, further reinforces the playful nature of this cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Based on ERC20, DONG has a total supply of 420 trillion (i.e. 420,000,000,006,969). It will be listed on LBank Exchange at 8:00 UTC on August 25, 2023, investors who are interested in DONG can easily buy and sell it on LBank Exchange by then.</p>

<p>LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, listed Lady Pepe (LPEPE) on August 18, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the LPEPE/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading.</p>
<p>LPEPE is a meme coin devoid of any intrinsic value or prospects for financial gain, serving purely as a pointless and entertaining digital asset.</p>
<p>Introducing Lady Pepe</p>
<p>LBank Exchange is thrilled to announce the listing of Lady Pepe (LPEPE), a meme coin devoid of any intrinsic value or prospects for financial gain, serving purely as a pointless and entertaining digital asset.</p>
<p>Lady Pepe, often symbolized as LPEPE, has swiftly captured the admiration of a passionate and engaged community. The character of Lady Pepe exudes a need for attention and affection, fostering a unique bond between the digital token and its enthusiasts. The project centers around the release of distinct card packs, which enthusiasts can collect, enhancing the interactive dimension of the Lady Pepe experience. Notably, the diverse and enthusiastic community eagerly anticipates the integration of new members into the ever-evolving Lady Pepe narrative.</p>
<p>The journey of Lady Pepe is delineated through a well-defined roadmap spanning three pivotal phases. In the initial phase, the emphasis is on constructing a robust foundation, commencing with the creation of the project's smart contract. This phase extends to crafting an intuitive and informative website that serves as a hub for enthusiasts to gather and engage. The establishment of a strong community forms a cornerstone of this phase, exemplified by the envisioned LPEPE Airdrop Event, designed to enhance user participation and foster a sense of ownership.</p>
<p>Transitioning to the second phase, the focus gracefully shifts towards expanding the reach of Lady Pepe. A key milestone within this phase involves securing a listing for the LPEPE coin on a prominent cryptocurrency exchange (CEX). This strategic move is poised to widen the project's visibility, making it more accessible to potential holders and users. Simultaneously, efforts will be invested in attracting and retaining LEPE holders, nurturing a loyal base of supporters. Telegram marketing campaigns will play an integral role in disseminating the project's ethos and value proposition.</p>
<p>The crescendo of the roadmap culminates in Phase 3, characterized by a fervent celebration of community engagement. An array of Lady Pepe-focused events will invigorate the project's ecosystem, fostering camaraderie among participants. The ambitious goal of attaining 5,000 holders and an equivalent number of Telegram members signifies a collective aspiration to create a robust and thriving community.</p>
<p>Lady PEPE emerges as more than a digital token; it's a testament to the power of shared narratives and the allure of community-driven endeavors. As the project advances through its roadmap, the fervor of the community and its penchant for storytelling propel Lady PEPE's evolution into a distinctive and endearing digital experience.</p>
<p>About LPEPE Token</p>
<p>Based on BEP20, LPEPE has a total supply of 9 billion (i.e. 9,000,000,000). It was listed on LBank Exchange at 7:00 UTC on August 18, 2023, investors who are interested in LPEPE can easily buy and sell it on LBank Exchange now.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>London, United Kingdom, August 21st, 2023, Chainwire</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shiba Memu, a dynamic new cryptocurrency meme coin supported by AI, is causing a stir as its presale surpasses the impressive $2 million fundraising milestone. This remarkable achievement was further spurred by the recent news it would list on BitMart, a renowned crypto exchange, all within the first month of the presale's launch.</p>
<p>The inception of the Shiba Memu AI stems from the team's previous experiences with exorbitant marketing agency fees. This motivated Shiba Memu to develop a self-promoting AI solution capable of adapting to various practical applications.</p>
<p>Presently at $0.021700 per token, Shiba Memu's price experiences scheduled increments every 24 hours due to the team's well-crafted smart contract. This mechanism is particularly appealing to presale supporters, as it ensures that the token purchase price remains lower than the eventual listing price on exchanges. For instance, if purchased today at $0.021700, the increase by the end of the 60-day presale would amount to 10%.</p>
<p>Those interested can acquire SHMU tokens via the official Shiba Memu website.</p>
<p>The Surge of Shiba Memu: Unleashing AI Potential</p>
<p>Shiba Memu's remarkable success can be attributed to its untapped AI potential. In its nascent stages, the AI employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis to scour the web, primarily focusing on social platforms, for mentions of Shiba Memu. It tailors its promotions accordingly, transforming the brand from a simple cute dog meme to an amusing and engaging one, infused with a sharp sense of humor. The project's forthcoming AI dashboards scheduled for Q4 further stimulate investor interest in meme coins with tangible utility.</p>
<p>The project's tokenomics demonstrate a robust structure, with 85% of tokens allocated to the presale, 10% to exchange listing liquidity, and 5% to development. This allocation empowers SHMU holders to actively participate in the future development of the dApp.</p>
<p>Crypto Community Propels Shiba Memu's Soaring Engagement</p>
<p>In the recent video shared by influencer, CryptoPRNR, Shiba Memu was featured among the top four cryptocurrencies predicted to perform well in the next bull run. Additionally, Shiba Memu was also showcased as the best meme coin to buy in 2023 on investing website Invezz.&nbsp;This recognition highlights the project's strategic advancements and AI-driven capabilities, solidifying its position as a competitive player in the crypto market. The inclusion of Shiba Memu in this selection also reflects the growing interest and attention directed towards AI-powered crypto projects within the broader cryptocurrency community.</p>
<p>The Shiba Memu presale is approaching its closing date on the 1st of September. At this juncture, the price is set to reflect an increase of 119% from its launch price, moving from $0.011125 to $0.024400.</p>
<p>About Shiba Memu</p>

This technology is poised to gain traction within the blockchain industry in the coming years, establishing Shiba Memu's position as an industry innovator.

                        <![CDATA[<p>Warsaw, Poland, August 21st, 2023, Chainwire</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ETHWarsaw, a web3 conference and hackathon, organized by a passionate group of local Ethereum enthusiasts, returns for its second edition. The event is set to take place from August 31st to September 3rd, 2023 in Warsaw, Poland, bringing together a global community of builders, founders, and educators in web3.</p>
<p>Building upon the achievements of its debut, the second edition of ETHWarsaw promises enhanced experience as it will coincide with the first in the history Warsaw Blockchain Week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the backdrop of crypto&rsquo;s resurgence after a challenging year, we&rsquo;re ready to deliver an even more comprehensive experience for the global community traveling across the world to Poland. This year we&rsquo;re literally transforming Warsaw, a tech hub teeming with talent, into a hotbed of web3 action.&rdquo; said Lukasz Stoczynski, ETHWarsaw&rsquo;s Co-Founder, Business Development Lead.</p>
<p>This collaborative initiative, set against the charming blend of tradition and modernity that defines Warsaw, promises community-organized side events, including conferences, networking meetups, and parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collective effort is poised to make this year&rsquo;s ETHWarsaw, for the second year in a row, the biggest web3 conference in the CEE region and Warsaw Blockchain Week the largest blockchain event ever held in Poland.</p>
<p>ETHWarsaw is structured to cater to both seasoned professionals and curious newcomers including web2 developers and students. The conference spans two dynamic days of talks, panels and fireside chats divided into six key tracks: DeFi, Scalability, Security, Infrastructure, Governance, and Non-Tech.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s speakers include Marius Van Der Wijden, Ethereum Foundation; Akram El Milligy, Ledger; Patrick McCorry, Arbitrum Foundation; Artis from Gitcoin, and Adam Gagol from Aleph Zero.</p>
<p>Similarly to last year, the overnight hackathon will start on Friday evening and it will be a 48 hours marathon of non-stop building. There will be opportunities for teams and individuals to get hands-on, practical experience working with applications and advanced tools with ~$50,000 in value to be won from various competitions.</p>
<p>ETHWarsaw&rsquo;s reputation as a hub for breakthroughs in the blockchain realm continues to be reinforced by the awe-inspiring success stories of projects born from the event. Antoni Zolciak, Co-founder of Aleph Zero, Ocean Sponsor of ETHWarsaw, explains: &ldquo;The brilliant team behind our recently launched ecosystem company, AZERO.ID, was formed after they emerged as victorious champions of the ETHWarsaw hackathon. This win led them to secure a grant, develop the platform&rsquo;s first version, and successfully close an oversubscribed pre-seed funding round. Their mainnet launch on Aleph Zero is just weeks away, marking an exciting beginning for AZERO.ID. We&rsquo;re excited for this year&rsquo;s hackathon during ETHWarsaw and have no doubt that this year&rsquo;s edition will not disappoint.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other ETHWarsaw returning sponsors include RedStone Oracles, Arweave, Octant, Scroll, IPOR. In addition, EthWarsaw secured support for the vol2 event from companies like Lukso, zkSync, Request Network, PROPERLY, Beamer Bridge, Mantle &amp; Chronicle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Islamic Coin, a Shariah-compliant, ethics-first, digital money that has been featured globally, has announced it is working with Republic Crypto, the web3 advisory group within global digital finance leader, Republic.</p>
<p>The collaboration includes white-glove support to promote Islamic Coin&rsquo;s go-to-market strategy, along with advisory services focused on tokenomics, DAO governance, and long-term economic utility value. Republic Crypto will also help engage with potential strategic partners, exchanges, and market makers.</p>
<p>Fine-tuning the Islamic Coin value proposition, Republic Crypto advised on creating fair and Shariah-compliant allocation options, distribution, and other mechanisms aimed at adding to the sustainability features in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Separately, Islamic Coin plans to conduct a Reg D public token offering facilitated by OpenDeal Broker on Republic&rsquo;s retail investment platform in September 2023. Upon public launch, Islamic Coin&rsquo;s international community will reap various advantages, including options to offer liquidity, stake their holdings, and gain tokens during the liquidity mining stage.</p>
<p>The Advisory Board of Islamic Coin is steered by members of ruling families of the UAE, including the grandson of UAE founder, Sheikh Dr. Hazza bin Sultan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the country&rsquo;s Navy Chief, Sheikh Saeed bin Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Nahyan (serving in a private advisory capacity), Sheikh Khalifa Bin Mohammed bin Khalid Al Nahyan, Sheikh Mohammad Bin Khalifa Bin Mohammad Bin Khalid Al Nahyan, His Highness Sheikh Juma bin Maktoum Al Maktoum, and Her Highness Sheikha Mariam Suhail Obaid Suhail Al Maktoum.</p>
<p>The Executive Board is also composed of experts from both traditional and Islamic finance. It humbly highlights Emaar&rsquo;s Hussein Al Meeza (also a co-founder), an award-winning banker with over four and a half decades of experience across the Islamic banking, finance, and insurance industries. He was a key figure in the establishment of the Dubai Islamic Bank, one of the first fully operational Islamic Banks. The Executive Board is further strengthened by Khamis Buharoon AI Shamsi, the former Assistant Director of the Finance Division, and Assistant Director of the Internal Audit Division of the Central Bank of the UAE. Adding to the team&rsquo;s robust profile, Greg Gigliotti, CEO, Chief Investment Officer, and Founding Partner of Xtellus Advisors. With a rich background at Goldman Sachs and other global institutions, Gigliotti has managed a portfolio exceeding $16 billion throughout his career.</p>
<p>The Reg D offering is slated for September 2023.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">US District Judge Robert Pitman has dismissed an appeal filed by six Tornado Cash users who sought to lift sanctions placed on the controversial cryptocurrency mixer.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The United States Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control had added Tornado Cash to its SDN list in August 2022, alleging it had enabled billions in illicit funds.&nbsp;</p>
Court Upholds Treasury Department&rsquo;s Sanctions&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">A federal court has upheld the Treasury Department&rsquo;s decision to impose sanctions on cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash, throwing out the legal challenge brought by several users of the mixing service. The judge sided with the government and the Treasury Department on all of its claims and also granted summary judgment in the case. This reinforced the fact that the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control is entitled to sanction Tornado Cash under current sanction statutes. Furthermore, the court denied the summary judgment requested by the plaintiffs. The court filing stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The Court finds that Tornado Cash is an association within the ordinary meaning of the term and is, therefore, an entity that may be designated per OFAC regulations.&rdquo;</p>

The Plaintiff&rsquo;s Argument&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">The plaintiffs in the case, six users of Tornado Cash, had stated that the government&rsquo;s action to sanction the cryptocurrency mixer was unlawful because it violated the first amendment. The plaintiffs argued that because of the decision, they were being denied the ability to engage in socially valuable speech. This is because they would have used Tornado Cash to donate to several social and political causes.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, Judge Pitman disagreed with this argument, stating that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the action taken by the government had, in any way, implicated the first amendment. The plaintiffs also pointed out that there is significant confusion regarding what Tornado Cash really is, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The parties disagree on how to characterize Tornado Cash. Plaintiffs contend that Tornado Cash is a decentralized, open-source software project comprised of a subset of smart contracts, or &ldquo;pools,&rdquo; on the Ethereum blockchain.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The plaintiffs also argued against classifying Tornado Cash as an association, claiming that the designation would exclude individual founders, developers, DAO members, and users involved in supporting the application. The plaintiffs asserted that Tornado Cash users rely on smart contracts that are immutable, autonomous, and self-executing. If Tornado Cash was recognized as an autonomous software instead of an association, it would be exempted from the SDN requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The OFAC has classified Tornado Cash as an entity that operates a cryptocurrency mixing service. It has also stated that the service was being used to launder virtual currencies, including those by the dreaded hacker group Lazarus.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;OFAC determined that the DPRK&rsquo;s malicious cyber-enabled activities threaten the United States and the broader international community and pose a significant threat to the international financial system. OFAC also observed that the DPRK has increasingly relied on cybercrime to generate revenue for its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.&rdquo;</p>

Court Disagrees With Plaintiffs&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">Judge Pitman concluded that Tornado Cash operates as an association and hence, can be sanctioned by the authorities as an entity under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The judge also determined that smart contracts deployed by Tornado Cash were subject to sanctions under regulatory definitions outlined by the OFAC.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Interestingly, the judge also noted that the plaintiffs could have made a case stating that their inability to access Ethereum trapped in Tornado Cash smart contract pools violated the fifth amendment. The fifth amendment guarantees protection against the taking of any property by the government without fair compensation. However, the judge noted that the plaintiffs did not pursue their fifth amendment claim.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Plaintiffs did not pursue their Fifth Amendment claim, even after the government raised the issue of waiver in its cross-motion. Because Plaintiffs failed to pursue their Fifth Amendment claim, they have waived it.&rdquo;</p>

Coinbase Backing Lawsuit&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">The chief legal officer at Coinbase, Paul Grewal, stated that the exchange continues to believe in the plaintiffs&rsquo; challenge against the OFAC action and that the issues require Fifth Circuit appellate review. Coinbase is also backing the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;We continue to believe Plaintiffs&rsquo; challenge to OFAC&rsquo;s Tornado Cash action is right. We&rsquo;ve always known that Fifth Circuit review is required to resolve these issues, and we continue to support them on appeal.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin Ordinals are going nowhere, with data reporting that nearly 85% of network activity on Bitcoin was Ordinals-related.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Bitcoin Ordinal&rsquo;s domination comes despite the fact that Bitcoin&rsquo;s price has seen a considerable decrease and suggestions that the hype around Bitcoin NFTs may have taken a back seat.&nbsp;</p>
Ordinals Continue To Dominate Bitcoin Network&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">On the 21st of August, Bitcoin Ordinals developer Leonidas took to X (formerly Twitter) to highlight that Bitcoin had around 530,788 transactions over the past 24 hours. Leonidas stated that out of this number, 450,785 were transactions that were related to Ordinals. Leonidas stated in their post,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin had 530,788 transactions. 450,785 of those transactions were Ordinals related. In the midst of everyone claiming &ldquo;Ordinals are dead,&rdquo; they have literally accounted for 84.9% of the activity on Bitcoin. You can&rsquo;t make this stuff up.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Data from Dune Analytics backed up the trend, with the platform reporting that the 20th of August saw over 400,000 Ordinal inscriptions. Meanwhile, data sourced from Bitinfocharts reported a daily Bitcoin transaction count of around 556,000. According to these numbers, over three-quarters of activity on the 20th of August on the Bitcoin network was related to Ordinals.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;85% of on-chain bitcoin transactions in the past 24 hours are ordinals related EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT the main use case of the bitcoin chain is ORDINALS.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to industry researcher Eric Wall, the past week saw 54% of the transactions on the Bitcoin network were Ordinals or related to Ordinals. Data sourced from Dune Analytics has shown that there have been a total of 25.5 million Ordinals inscriptions, which have generated over $53 million in fees on the Bitcoin network. Currently, BRC-20 token minting dominates inscriptions, with over 1.9 million of them mined during the previous week.&nbsp;</p>
Numbers In Stark Contrast To DappRadar Report&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">These figures and claims are in stark contrast to a report published by DappRadar on the 17th of August. The report claimed that Ordinals NFT usage and sales volume had registered an &ldquo;alarming plunge,&rdquo; and trading volume had tanked by a staggering 98% since peaking in May.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">DappRadar showed its data which showed that the total Bitcoin Ordinals sales volume had dropped from a peak of $452 million in May to around $3 million as of the 14th of August. It described the scenario as &ldquo;grim&rdquo; for the larger Ordinals market. However, it also emphasized that it would need more time to determine if the situation was a temporary setback or a systemic problem with Bitcoin-based NFTs. The report stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;This steep decline in both sales volume and count within such a short period is alarming for Bitcoin Ordinals. The diminishing sales count underscores the waning enthusiasm or perhaps confidence in Bitcoin NFT. While fluctuations in sales volume could be attributed to market dynamics, a consistent decline in transaction count may point toward broader issues. It suggests that fewer traders are engaging with Bitcoin Ordinals, which could raise concerns about its longevity and relevance in the NFT space.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, many have pointed out that the DappRadar report looked at the sales and trading volume of those NFTs that were minted on the Bitcoin network. However, it did not look at the actual inscription activity, which they pointed out was very high.&nbsp;</p>
A Divided Community
<p dir="ltr">DappRadar suggests in its report that a key issue regarding the sustainability of Ordinals is that the Bitcoin community is split down the middle on whether NFTs should even be on the Bitcoin network or not. This is not an issue when it comes to blockchains such as Ethereum, which has a thriving NFT community. According to DappRadar, many in the Bitcoin community view Bitcoin as &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; and that its primary function is that of a store of value. The report added,</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;There are voices within the community that view Bitcoin primarily as &lsquo;digital gold,&rsquo; suggesting that its primary function should remain as a store of value. On the other hand, Ethereum is often referred to as &lsquo;digital oil,&rsquo; indicating its role in fueling the digital economy. The coming months will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin finds a foothold in the ever-evolving NFT landscape or reverts to its primary role as a store of value.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">DappRadar suggests in its report that a key issue regarding the sustainability of Ordinals is that the Bitcoin community is split down the middle on whether NFTs should even be on the Bitcoin network or not. This is not an issue when it comes to blockchains such as Ethereum, which has a thriving NFT community. According to DappRadar, many in the Bitcoin community view Bitcoin as &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; and that its primary function is that of a store of value. The report added,</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;There are voices within the community that view Bitcoin primarily as &lsquo;digital gold,&rsquo; suggesting that its primary function should remain as a store of value. On the other hand, Ethereum is often referred to as &lsquo;digital oil,&rsquo; indicating its role in fueling the digital economy. The coming months will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin finds a foothold in the ever-evolving NFT landscape or reverts to its primary role as a store of value.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The social app Friend.tech has registered a big increase in protocol fees, generating fees in excess of $1.4 million over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The jump in 24-hour fees places it in the top three projects for fee generation, only behind Ethereum and Lido, according to data from DeFiLlama.&nbsp;</p>
A Significant Jump In Fees&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">With the protocol fees generated over the past 24 hours exceeding $1.4 million, Friend.tech has surpassed several prominent blockchain projects when it comes to fees generated. This includes projects such as Tron and Uniswap. Currently, the project sits only behind Ethereum and Lido Finance, according to data sourced from DeFiLlama. Data also shows that the recorded fees for the protocol for the last week were $2.99 million, out of which $1.49 was revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Friend.tech is a social app that operates on Coinbase&rsquo;s Base Layer-2 chain. The social app is integrated with platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), allowing users to trade tokenized shares directly in one another&rsquo;s social profiles. Shareholders get plenty of unique perks, such as excluding access to content and access to private chat rooms. Friends.tech has only recently gained considerable traction among Twitter users.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a result, the protocol has seen a bevy of new, high-profile members join over the weekend. Prominent new joinees include NBA star Grayson Allen and startup incubator Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan.&nbsp;</p>
$26 Million In Volume Since Launch&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">Since the platform&rsquo;s beta release, Friend.tech has managed to record over 65,000 unique traders of shares, resulting in over $26 million in trading volume. These figures have been backed up by data sourced from a Dune Analytics dashboard created by Crypto Koryo. Friend.tech&rsquo;s stellar rise to the third position among projects when it comes to 24-hour fees is even more significant when you consider the fact that the platform is currently available and accessible on an invite-only basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Friend.tech also recently revealed a seed investment from venture capital firm Paradigm. However, the protocol did not disclose the exact amount of the investment from Paradigm. Friend.tech shared some details on X, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Earlier this year, we partnered with @paradigm to build tools for new online social interactions. We&rsquo;re grateful for the community&rsquo;s warm reception and excited to continue growing with you all.&rdquo;</p>

Critics Not Convinced&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">While a majority of crypto heavyweights have been extremely bullish about the decentralized social media app, some critics remain unconvinced and have advised caution. Crypto commentator Yazan highlighted several factors that, according to him, indicated that the app had between six to eight weeks before share prices and general activity on the platform registered a significant drop. Yazan stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Let me tell you one thing. Something isn&rsquo;t right about @friendtech. Creators making money from a group chat that doesn&rsquo;t even work when you can&rsquo;t even reply directly to people? The way pricing works is ridiculous and can be easily taken advantage of. Pumps and dumps.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">He also argued that the rate at which the share prices have increased is unsustainable.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The market making that guarantees that the app makes the most money along with creators &mdash; the price goes up too fast. How come there&rsquo;s 100 holders, and the price is 1 ETH &mdash; 1 ETH to be able to see a private chat?&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, in a thread on X, the pseudo-anonymous software engineer Cygaar stated that the price of a user&rsquo;s shares on the app is proportional to the square of its outstanding supply. This means that as supply increased, the price increased exponentially. Web3 marketer Legendary drew comparisons with BitClout, a decentralized social app launched in 2021 that gave a bearish outlook regarding Friend.tech&rsquo;s longevity. He stated that the platform would eventually collapse like BitClout did.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I think the platform will collapse as BitClout did. We are in a bear market, and there&rsquo;s nothing to do. Everyone jumps on an opportunity to make money, but I think the platform will be done within the next weeks to months.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, some have shared a far more positive outlook and have praised the decentralized social media app for its novel developments in UX when it came to crypto applications. The co-founder of Jokerace and EcoDAO, David Phelps, called Friend. tech&rsquo;s UX as the &ldquo;greatest UX crypto has seen.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Bitget, the prominent cryptocurrency trading platform, has recently announced a significant change in its user policy, to take effect by September 2023. The platform will make it mandatory for its users to complete KYC verification.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Regulators across the world are exerting pressure on all centralised crypto exchange platforms to conform to regulatory requirements, and KYC (know your customer) is one of the most basic of these requirements.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitget&rsquo;s decision is seen as an effort to align with global regulatory standards and increase the security measures on the platform. By ensuring all users are KYC-verified, Bitget aims to establish a safer trading environment and curtail potential misuse or illicit activities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a Bitget support post on the subject on its Announcement Centre, all newly signed-up users are obliged to complete a level 1 KYC verification requirement. Users signed up before this date have to complete this same requirement by 1 October 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This mandatory KYC verification is also expected to provide a safeguard against fraudulent accounts, ensuring a more transparent and accountable trading environment. Such rigorous measures reflect Bitget's dedication to prioritising user safety and compliance, all while striving to uphold the platform&rsquo;s reputation in the crypto community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, the move is in sync with the broader trend in the cryptocurrency industry, where regulatory compliance is increasingly becoming a focal point. Many platforms are now adopting robust verification processes to meet the regulatory demands of different jurisdictions, with Bitget's announcement further cementing this trend.</p>
A contrary view
<p dir="ltr">However, some exchange users will feel that they need to protect their identity when trading crypto, for all sorts of reasons. After all, crypto did grow out of a distrust of the banking system and of the regulators that many believe are just there to perpetuate the continuation of the current traditional financial system.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Decentralisation is the key to this endeavour, and the race is on for the current so-called decentralised exchanges to really up their game and strengthen their protocols such that anyone can trade without cost-increasing and slow middlemen getting in the way. Crypto should be about ultra-fast and efficient finance and not central planners attempting to control and smother.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to orbit a technical level early in the Asian session as the pair traded around the 26121.32 area, right around the 50% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 25234.76 to 27007.87.&nbsp; &nbsp;BTC/USD recently came off to the 25234.76 area, its weakest print since mid-June.&nbsp; This fresh multi-month low represented a test of a major downside price objective around the 25128.94 area that is associated with selling pressure that increased around the 31862.21 and 30421.29 levels in July.&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Stops were elected below the 27620.46 area during the decline, another downside price objective linked to recent downward pressure around the 30222 and 29665.27 areas.&nbsp; Major Stops were also elected below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in appreciating ranges from the 15460 and 19568.52 levels include the 23661, 22793, and 21725 levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 28322.23 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 26130.51.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="s7">The last few weeks have seen some exciting events. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pomerdoge have been in the lead. However, analysts prefer Pomerdoge over Shiba Inu (SHIB) for better gains. The former is a new project, and is still in its presale. But experts opine that it will grow at least 4,000% in 2023.</p>
Summary
● Shiba Inu (SHIB) has grown by more than 25% since July 1.
● Pomerdoge is likely to grow by 4,000% in the next four months.
<p class="s13">Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Gains Massively From Shibarium Mania
<p class="s7">Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been on the rise lately, despite the overall market conditions being bearish. Decoupling with larger market trends, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has witnessed a rise in its market value in recent times. The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has soared by more than 16% in the last seven days. On the 30-day chart, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is up by more than 36%. Consequently, the trading price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has increased to $0.000010.</p>
<p class="s7">The data from Kaiko shows that Shiba Inu (SHIB) had an explosion in developer activity, thereby supporting its price movement. The meme coin has grown by more than 25% since July 1. Notably, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has surpassed its arch-rival, Dogecoin, in network growth. The biggest reason behind this exponential growth of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is the upcoming Shibariummainnet launch. According to reports, Shiba Inu (SHIB) can launch the Shibarium mainnetbefore the end of August. Therefore, there is a strong mania around Shiba Inu (SHIB).</p>
<p class="s7">Another development that has helped Shiba Inu (SHIB) rise on the growth chart is the self-sovereign identity (SSI) protocol. Recently, Shiba Inu developers announced that they would tie digital identity verification, dubbed SSI, to all the development within the SHIB ecosystem. With this update, Shiba Inu (SHIB) aims to give users more control over their personal data. According to experts, this update can make Shiba Inu (SHIB) more attractive, as users are getting privacy-conscious.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Posts Ballistic Growth
<p class="s7">As per the latest market data, the global play-to-earn (P2E) NFT Games industry can rise at a CAGR of over 21% during the next five years. Pomerdoge has planned to launch a new P2E meme coin that will disrupt the blockchain gaming industry. The platform has attracted a large number of investors with its growth-oriented business roadmap.</p>
<p class="s7">It has brought a new P2E game, Pomergame. In this game, which has not been launched yet, players will get an opportunity to battle against each other, win rewards, and earn money. Players can also create and improve their characters with customized in-game items. If gamers get a gold status Pomer, they become eligible to sell or trade their in-game items with other members.</p>
<p class="s7">Pomerdoge has also planned to launch 7,777 non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, one must be a POMD token owner to get an opportunity to purchase these exclusive NFTs. POMD will be the native crypto of the platform, and has been built on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p class="s7">The project will have four stages of POMD&rsquo;s presale. At present, the platform&rsquo;s presale is in stage 1. The purchase price of a token has increased from $0.007 to $0.008. However, the token&rsquo;s market value can jump by 1,700% during the presale round, and 40x before the end of 2023. Additionally, Pomerdoge will give a $50,000 mega Pomer prize, and weekly giveawaysworth $100,000. Moreover, there is no buy or sell tax on POMD transactions, making it lucrative to savvy investors.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>OpenSea is still the biggest NFT marketplace, but there are new players and competitors that offer things that Opensea doesn&rsquo;t. One example is an upcoming project called Everlodge, which allows people to buy NFTs that represent a share in luxury holiday projects. Here I&rsquo;ll explore both of them and the potential for the future.</p>
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
OpenSea is behind the times with Real World Assets NFTs
<p>Founded in 2017, OpenSea is a grandaddy of Web3 at this point, given the speed at which blockchain technology progresses. With over 40 million NFTs for sale its the best place to find everything and anything, but not necessarily to find something truly special.</p>
<p>Many customers are using Nifty or SuperRare to find truly special NFTs, and Blur, a newer market entrant. In May 2023, Blur emerged as the dominant NFT marketplace with an impressive 65% market share and $442 million in sales. They disrupted the market with their zero royalty fee platform and customer loyalty rewards. Meanwhile, OpenSea, once a heavyweight, struggled to keep up with Blur's disruptive approach. They eventually followed suit by offering zero royalty fees after experiencing traffic loss to Blur.</p>
<p>However even Blur&rsquo;s success versus Opensea may be more to do with the fact that Blur incentivised people to do wash trading in order to receive Blur tokens.</p>
<p>PFPs and in game NFTs have lost a lot of popularity and value this year, with industry experts turning towards tokenisation of financial products and also Real World Assets (RWA) such as property and art, and social projects. &nbsp;Since Opensea and Blur focuses mainly on the former types of NFTs, they arent keeping on trend with NFT options. Everlodge on the other hand, is part of a wider trend where NFTs have real use cases and tokenise RWA.</p>
What Everlodge has to offer over Opensea in terms of NFTs and value
<p>Everlodge provides the chance for people to make money in property, using NFTs. Luxury villas and holiday homes are fractionalised on the blockchain, with deeds in the metadata, and then sold in fractions to users.</p>
<p>As property tends to go up, there is a good chance that the NFTs rise in value, as the properties do. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s more ways to make money from Everlodge. &nbsp;One of the ways is to buy into their presale of their native token ELDG.</p>
<p>Holders will get staking benefits with an APR of 10%, discounts in the Everlodge NFT marketplace, and lower fees on property maintenance costs. &nbsp;Holders can also provide liquidity and receive an APY for that. Owning an NFT also brings advantages since you get a timeshare in one of these luxury places. &nbsp;But for those who want to skip that they can then rent out their timeshare for extra income.</p>
<p>Big players like Avalanche, Solana and Polygon are also just getting involved in the RWA tokenization space, showing how much room for growth there is in the industry. Boston Consulting Group predict that the space will be worth $16 trillion by 2030. Binacnce believe the figure is much higher due to the value of the total global asset market.</p>
<p>ELDG is currently on offer for $0.01 and 40 million will be available at that price. That&rsquo;s bullish considering that 480 million tokens will be offered in the presale. This means that now is a great chance to get in, before the price increases. &nbsp;The token will launch for $0.035, and is expected to do around a 3000% after it goes live on Uniswap and certain CEXes.</p>

<p class="s3">Furthermore, pundits speculate that Borroe will be a force to be reckoned with in the Web3 sector based on the deployment of cutting-edge technologies, such as automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology in the fundraising process.</p>
<p class="s3">$ROE tokens sold at stage 1 have surpassed the 37.5 million mark as more investors continue to jump on the Borroe bandwagon. $ROE is retailing at $0.0125 with the price hitting $0.015 at the next stage.</p>
LINK whales have been on a buying spree
<p class="s3">With hodling being a favored strategy in the crypto space, Chainlink whales have been on an accumulation mode.</p>
<p class="s3">Market analyst Ali Martinez disclosed that approximately 14 million LINK, worth more than $100M were bought in a span of one week.</p>
<p class="s3">&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s3">Source: Santiment</p>
<p class="s3">The analyst also stated that the accumulation trend had gained significant momentum in the Chainlink ecosystem, given that nearly 29,000 addresses had bought 295M LINK worth more than $2.2 billion.</p>

<p class="s3">He noted, &ldquo;Chainlink established strong support between $6.63 and $6.88. Nearly 29,000 addresses acquired 295 million LINK within this range. As long as LINK maintains above this level, there's strong bullish sentiment since on-chain data shows no major resistance barriers ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s3">Based on this analysis, LINK&rsquo;s bullish outlook still stands as it eyes a 100x growth potential because the coin was trading at $7.50 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko data.</p>
<p class="s3">This trend has been happening as development activity on the LINK network soars.</p>

<p class="s3">Leading market insight provider Santiment stated, &ldquo;Chainlink's Github development activity has been notably higher this summer, leading to the asset cracking the top 5 most frequently developed assets. Additionally, whales &amp; sharks with 100K-10M LINK now hold the most coins since December, 2022.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s3">Cardano&rsquo;s transaction volume balloons</p>
<p class="s3">The ADA network enjoyed significant growth in the second quarter of this year based on a Messari report.</p>
<p class="s3">The transaction volume or blockchain load on the Cardano blockchain saw a growth rate of nearly 50% between the end of April and August, illustrating heightened activity as more users onboard the ecosystem.</p>

<p class="s3">Messari noted, &ldquo;State of Cardano Q2 2023. With a dedicated community of users and developers, Cardano has demonstrated staying power. In Q2, average daily dapp transactions were up 49%, TVL up 10%, and 199% YTD.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s3">The accumulation trend has also engulfed the ADA network as whales and sharks continue to accumulate.</p>

<p class="s3">Santiment disclosed, &ldquo;As Cardano sits just above $0.29, whales and sharks holding between 100K-10M ADA have accumulated back to their highest level since September, 2022. Additionally, onchain transaction volume has been rising nearly every week for the past 6 months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 28512.23 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 26569.93.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Chainlink (LINK), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Everlodge (ELDG) &ndash; three coins that could bring unique value to your investment portfolio. When it comes to building a portfolio, the key is diversity. Including a mix of established players and promising newcomers can help mitigate risks and maximize potential gains. Due to these reasons, let's explore all three of them in greater detail. </p>
Summary
- Chainlink integrates with Coinbase&rsquo;s Base 
- Shiba Inu one of the top weekly gainers 
- Everlodge expected to rally by 30x
<p>Join Everlodge Presale</p>
Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Solution
<p>Chainlink (LINK) has solidified its position as a cornerstone in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As a bridge between smart contracts and real-world data, Chainlink's decentralized oracle network ensures blockchain applications access to accurate information.</p>
<p>In recent Chainlink news, it announced that it merged with Coinbase's Base. As a result, the Chainlink crypto interest rose. In fact, its value jumped by 6.3% over the past month alone. </p>
<p>Currently, Chainlink is trading hands at $7.28 with a market cap of $3.9B. However, due to its technical indicators showing green, market analysts remain bullish about it. Therefore, they forecast a $9.12 price for Chainlink by the end of 2023. </p>
Shiba Inu (SHIB): Expected To Soar 
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the scene as a community-driven experiment inspired by the success of meme coins like Dogecoin. While often associated with its meme status, Shiba Inu aims to create a decentralized ecosystem that includes tokens like BONE. </p>
<p>The Shiba Inu price has increased 13.2% over the previous week, ranking among the top 20 altcoins by total market capitalization. Not only that, Shiba Inu is one of the best-performing currencies overall. The Shiba Inu crypto has a value of $0.00001036 with a market cap of $6.1B. </p>
<p>Most importantly, the Shiba Inu technical analysis shows bullish signs. To clarify, all its moving averages and technical indicators are showing strong buy signals. As a result, experts in the field predict Shiba Inu surging to $0.00001078 soon..</p>
Everlodge (ELDG): Brings Something Unique to the Real Estate Market
<p>Everlodge (ELDG) aims to democratize real estate investment by tokenizing properties and offering fractional ownership through blockchain technology. This approach allows investors to purchase fractions of high-value properties, such as luxury villas, vacation homes, and hotels, for $100. Therefore, Everlodge enables more individuals to participate in real estate investment.</p>
<p>One of the most innovative aspects of Everlodge is its integration of NFTs into the real estate market. Each property is minted as an NFT, representing ownership, and stored securely on the blockchain. This provides several benefits, including increased transparency, immutability of ownership records, and removing the need for intermediaries.</p>
<p>At the core of this platform lies the ELDG native token. ELDG holders are rewarded with discounts on property purchases, reduced trading fees, and even free nightly stays in the properties within the Everlodge ecosystem. This rewards program incentivizes participation and fosters a vibrant and engaged community of investors.</p>
<p>One ELDG token costs only $0.01. But keep in mind that it is in Stage 1 of its presale. In other words, it will rise as it advances. And with Stage 2 coming this month, a 20% surge will also occur. Everlodge stands out from Chainlink and Shiba Inu thanks to its low market cap, which means it will surge faster. Consequently, experts foresee a 30x growth for it on launch day. </p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>NFT marketplace OpenSea will be sunsetting its on-chain royalty enforcement tool, Operator Filter.&nbsp;</p>
Operator Filter Falls Short Of Expectations
<p>On Thursday, OpenSea announced on X (formerly Twitter) that it would be removing the Operator Filter tool from its platform. The tool was introduced on the platform back in November 2022 to allow creators to blacklist NFT marketplaces that didn't adhere to royalty enforcement standards. However, according to founder and CEO Devin Finzer, the tool's effectiveness fell short of expectations.</p>
<p>Starting August 31, the Operator Filter will cease to block any marketplaces. For existing collections on non-Ethereum blockchains and those currently using the tool, creator fees will remain enforced until February 29, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finzer clarified,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To be clear, creator fees aren&rsquo;t going away &mdash; simply the ineffective, unilateral enforcement of them."</p>

Operator Filter Rendered Useless
<p>The Operator Filter, touted as a "simple code snippet," aimed to limit NFT sales exclusively to marketplaces that upheld creator fees. Yet, its impact didn't align with the aspirations of its creators, as Finzer pointed out that the NFT ecosystem's support for the tool was insufficient.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain NFT marketplaces like Blur, Dew, and LooksRare managed to bypass the filter by integrating Seaport Protocol, which helped them circumvent OpenSea's blacklist and thus avoid creator fees.</p>
Creator Concerns and Redirecting Efforts
<p>Creators themselves expressed concerns about the Operator Filter infringing upon their control over where their collections were sold.</p>
<p>He said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have heard from some creators that the Operator Filter limits their sense of control over where their collections are sold, and at the same time may collide with a collector&rsquo;s expectation of full ownership&hellip;The Operator Filter&rsquo;s restrictions come at the expense of decentralized ownership.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finzer also emphasized that while creator fees play a role in specific business models, they constitute only one among many revenue streams available to creators. OpenSea is redirecting its efforts toward enabling new use cases, such as digital and physical redeemables, and promoting these use cases more effectively in primary and secondary experiences.</p>
Mixed Reactions from the NFT Community
<p>This decision from OpenSea holds implications for NFT artists seeking passive income. Some creators expressed disappointment, suggesting that collectors should support them on platforms that enforce royalties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a Reddit avatar artist posited that the move might have been prudent, as the existing business model appeared to profit excessively from hype trading.</p>
<p>OpenSea's cessation of the Operator Filter reflects a shift in approach to NFT market dynamics. While the decision might disappoint some in the NFT community, the move aims to strike a balance between creator autonomy and the evolving landscape of NFT technology applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Trading-focused blockchain Sei&rsquo;s latest SEI token launch did not go over as well as expected after being plagued with delays and problems with the token giveaway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
SEI Token Drama
<p>The newly launched Sei blockchain Sei generated quite a buzz in the crypto space as its SEI token hit the market with a resounding start, quickly amassing a market capitalization of over $400 million within the first day of trading. Despite the promising start, a wave of discontent emerged on social media platforms regarding the much-anticipated airdrop of SEI tokens to early users and community members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Airdrops have become a common tactic for attracting users and bootstrapping liquidity, but they often encounter operational and legal complications. The SEI airdrop was no exception, facing issues such as difficulties in claiming tokens and uncertainties surrounding eligibility criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sei Labs intended to incentivize users from established platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain to migrate by offering SEI tokens upon "bridging" assets.</p>
Airdrop Discontent
<p>Trading activity for SEI surged, with a staggering $1.6 billion in trading volume over the next 24 hours. Leading exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken all joined the fray, listing SEI in conjunction with the blockchain's debut.</p>
<p>The situation led to confusion and frustration, as the initial announcement about the airdrop's launch did not align with the actual claim process. Early SEI adopters experienced delays, with some users unable to claim the promised tokens at the network's launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company behind the blockchain, Sei Labs, attempted to clarify the situation through an X post, mentioning that "airdrop rewards will be claimable following an initial warmup period," yet failing to provide a specific timeline. Only after the airdrop claim process had already been criticized by some as a "fiasco" did the functionality eventually open to users, underscoring the complexities inherent in crypto airdrops.</p>
Airdrop Challenges
<p>Sei's mainnet launch coincided with the announcement of an airdrop of the SEI token. In response to airdrop-related concerns, a spokesperson from the Sei Foundation explained that the airdrop was never officially tied to the mainnet launch and would be executed according to the Foundation's timeline. Despite community frustration, the Foundation encouraged patience and emphasized the need for partners and validators to ensure a smooth experience for Sei's mainnet beta launch.</p>
Foundation's Response
<p>The Sei Foundation addressed issues with its official Discord server, limiting channels to combat spam and fraudulent links arising from the excitement around the mainnet beta launch. Sei Labs allocated 40% of the circulating SEI supply to its team and private investors, while 48% is designated for ecosystem reserves, including the airdrop and other incentives. The remainder of the supply is divided between the SEI Foundation (9%) and Binance launchpool incentives (3%).</p>

Despite community frustration, the Foundation encouraged patience and emphasized the need for partners and validators to ensure a smooth experience for Sei's mainnet beta launch.</p>
Foundation's Response
<p>The Sei Foundation addressed issues with its official Discord server, limiting channels to combat spam and fraudulent links arising from the excitement around the mainnet beta launch. Sei Labs allocated 40% of the circulating SEI supply to its team and private investors, while 48% is designated for ecosystem reserves, including the airdrop and other incentives. The remainder of the supply is divided between the SEI Foundation (9%) and Binance launchpool incentives (3%).</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>After a heavy crash on Thursday bitcoin bulls are still struggling to stop the king of the cryptocurrencies from falling further. Is this it, or is there more to go?</p>
A precipitous drop
<p>A palpable nervousness had beset the crypto market over the previous week. All eyes were on bitcoin as it continued to traverse down in its bull flag. Given the pattern, many were expecting the apex crypto to finally break out to the upside and confirm the bull market.</p>
<p>However, bears had other ideas.</p>
<p>Things really started getting serious on Thursday evening as bitcoin suddenly painted an hourly red candle to the downside, of a whopping 9.6%.</p>
<p>This reached the $25,000 price level where bulls were waiting in numbers to buy the asset back up. A wick back to $26,250 resulted - all in the space of the same hourly candle.</p>
A healthy correction
<p>Around 12 hours later and bitcoin is moving sideways, with the market waiting for the next direction to become apparent. Bitcoin is currently at a reasonable area of support at $26,500, which is just above the 0.786 Fibonacci level. The next very strong support below is at $24,250.</p>
<p>The upwards trendline has been broken and so has the 200-day moving average, both incredibly important supports if bitcoin is to maintain its bull momentum. However, the weekly candle does not close for another couple of days or so, giving bulls a chance to at least potentially regain the 200-day MA at $27,250.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, it does look like bitcoin just came to the bottom of a range it entered back in March of this year, with the bottom of the range at $25,000 and the top at $31,000.</p>
<p>So far, this looks like a healthy correction, given the incredible thrust upwards since the beginning of this year. Even if bitcoin were to go lower, $25,000 is a huge platform to sustain the price.&nbsp;</p>
Bull market still intact
<p>Some investors may have been cursing their luck at missing the giant step up out of the bear market. This correction, or even if bitcoin were to go back down to $25,000, would be great areas to start building a position.</p>
<p>If investors are still nervous, they only need to look at the other available asset options, all of which are tied into the monetary system. Even gold and silver are manipulated by the paper futures market.</p>
<p>Bitcoin may have corrected, but there is certainly no reason for panic. Phase 1 of the bull market is still very much intact, and phase 2 can potentially begin next year when bitcoin gets above the $31,000 level.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The United States Securities Commission (SEC) is all set to greenlight the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ether (ETH) futures in a big win for the crypto space.</p>
<p>Nearly a dozen companies have expressed interest and filed applications with the SEC to launch ETFs.</p>
Big Win For Crypto
<p>According to sources familiar with the matter, the regulator will not block or oppose products. This comes as a major relief to companies who have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Bitwise, Roundhill, ProShares, and Volatility Shares. However, it is still unclear which funds would receive the nod from the SEC. Officials and sources close to the matter have stated that approvals could come as early as October, but the SEC has yet to comment on the matter. Ether (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain and is the world&rsquo;s second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, second only to Bitcoin.</p>
The SEC&rsquo;s Changing Stance
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly blocked previous attempts at an ETF based directly on a cryptocurrency. However, in late 2021, the regulator began permitting trading in a fund that involved Bitcoin futures contracts trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Since then, speculation has been growing that the Securities and Exchange Commission would allow a product with Ether futures which would also be traded on the exchange.</p>
<p>However, despite the buzz and excitement, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dragged its feet when it comes to approvals for a product that involves derivatives in Ether. Data from CoinGecko shows that ETH commands a market value of just under $200 billion, second only to Bitcoin, which has a market value of nearly $700 billion.</p>
Hope For Bitcoin ETFs?
<p>However, the Securities and Exchange Commission is still pushing back against Bitcoin-based ETFs and is locked in a tense standoff with the crypto industry on the matter. Grayscale Investments has already challenged the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s rejection of its application to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. A panel of US federal appellate court judges will be deciding on the matter soon.</p>
<p>On its part, the Securities and Exchange Commission has argued that the crypto space is fraught with several hazards. The regulator has repeatedly expressed concerns about price manipulation and insufficient liquidity when it comes to crypto. The regulator has also flagged Bitcoin&rsquo;s volatility as a threat, especially to newer investors. However, several firms, including BlackRock, have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list ETFs based on Bitcoin. BlackRock&rsquo;s filing had a considerable impact on the market, pushing the price of Bitcoin above $31,000. However, since then, the price has hovered around the $29,000 mark.</p>
Valkyrie&rsquo;s ETF Filing
<p>Asset management firm Valkyrie has also submitted an application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for an Ethereum (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund. The application signals the asset manager&rsquo;s intention to move beyond just offering Bitcoin futures ETFs. Valkyrie had filed the application on the 16th of August. The application stated that the ETF would not directly invest in ETH, purchasing ETH futures contracts instead.</p>
<p>The application also outlines a specific limit on the ETF&rsquo;s investment in ETH futures contracts. As per the application, the investments are capped at 8000 contracts per month. This has been done to comply with position limits set by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. If the Securities and Exchange Commission approves the application, investors will be able to speculate on ETH&rsquo;s future price movements via the ETF. Valkyrie also plans to invest in cash, cash-like instruments, or high-quality securities. These include government-issued bonds, bills, notes, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.</p>
<p>Valkyrie is one of several asset managers looking for approval for an Ether futures ETF. Others include VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, ProShares, Volatility Shares, and Round Hill Capital.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX has reportedly reduced the value of its Bitcoin by a whopping $373 million and has potentially liquidated all of its holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Elon Musk-led technology firm had announced in 2021 that it held some Bitcoin. Accounting rules state that once written down, the value cannot be adjusted upwards.&nbsp;</p>
Uncertainty Around Bitcoin Holdings&nbsp;
<p>According to a report published on the 17th of August, the Wall Street Journal stated that SpaceX had recorded $373 million worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet in 2021 and 2022. It has now reportedly sold the cryptocurrency in question. However, it is still not clear if the company has sold its entire $373 million stash. The Wall Street Journal stated in its report,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SpaceX wrote down the value of bitcoin it owns by a total of $373 million last year and in 2021 and has sold the cryptocurrency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The outlet reportedly viewed financial documents related to the firm&rsquo;s finances, showing expenses of around $5.2 billion for 2022. The documents also showed expenses of around $5.2 billion towards acquiring property and equipment and towards research and developmental costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Big Four Accounting Firm Deloitte, Bitcoin is typically considered an &ldquo;indefinite-lived intangible asset.&rdquo; It further adds that companies should account for Bitcoin at cost and then make adjustments should the price of the asset experience a notable decrease. If the value of Bitcoin declines, companies must declare a write-down in its books, which is also referred to as impairment charges. However, the asset&rsquo;s value cannot be written up after recording a decrease. This applies to all subsequent Bitcoin price increases or rebounds.</p>
Tesla&rsquo;s Revision Of Bitcoin Holdings&nbsp;
<p>Elon Musk had publicly announced that SpaceX had acquired crypto, Bitcoin in particular, in 2021. This announcement came after a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Tesla, another of Musk&rsquo;s companies, was planning to purchase $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. The announcement by Tesla had played a crucial role in Bitcoin hitting a then-all-time high price of $43,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, according to the company&rsquo;s second-quarter earnings report for 2023, Tesla had sold all except for $184 million worth of its Bitcoin holdings. Tesla confirmed that it had liquidated over 30,000 BTC in the second quarter of 2022, netting around $936 million. This figure represented around 75% of Tesla&rsquo;s original $1.5 billion worth of BTC holdings. However, since then, Tesla has held on to its remaining Bitcoin reserves, with the company continuing to do so in the second quarter of 2023 as well. This means the company has not purchased or sold Bitcoin for the fourth consecutive quarter, with the value of its assets holding steady at $185 million.&nbsp;</p>
Musk and Crypto&nbsp;
<p>Elon Musk is one of the richest individuals in the world and has often commented on the crypto space and cryptocurrencies. Musk seems particularly fond of Dogecoin (DOGE) and had briefly changed Twitter&rsquo;s iconic blue bird logo to the Shiba Inu of Dogecoin. Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion, later rebranding the company to X, and has suggested that the platform could offer an entire financial world to users, including payment and banking services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Musk and his companies may hold a considerable amount of Bitcoin, he has often reaffirmed that his favorite crypto remains Dogecoin. Musk has not given any reason for his admiration for Dogecoin, simply stating that &ldquo;it has the best humor, and it has dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not advising anyone to buy crypto or bet the farm on Dogecoin or anything like that.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The National Agency for Prospective Projects in Uzbekistan has granted two banks in the country to issue crypto cards. </p>
<p>Two banks in the Central Asia nation of Uzbekistan have obtained permission from the National Agency for Prospective Projects (NAPP) to issue crypto cards.</p>
Private Banks to Issue Crypto Cards Powered by Mastercard
<p>The NAPP reported on August 14 that it granted approval to two private banks in Uzbekistan &ndash; Kapital Bank and Ravnaq Bank &ndash; to issue cryptocurrency cards and take part in the NAPP&rsquo;s digital sandbox of crypto regulation. The announcement reported Ravnaq Bank had just received approval, but Kapital had already received its approval in May.</p>
<p>The two private Uzbeki banks will issue UzNEX cards and will be supported by payment giants Mastercard. The UzNEX cards will integrate a bank account with access to a crypto exchange and automated exchange mechanism, Cointelegraph reports.</p>
<p>Kapital Bank and Ravnaq Bank are two of the three registered participants in the Uzbeki national sandbox, the NAPP reports. The third participant is &ldquo;UZINFOCOM,&rdquo; a &ldquo;single integrator for the creation and support of state information systems,&rdquo; which will implement &ldquo;NFT certificates based on distributed data registry technology (&ldquo;blockchain&rdquo;) for names in the &ldquo;.UZ&rdquo; domain zone.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The deadline for final customer rollouts of both institutions&rsquo; cards expires in December 2023.</p>
Uzbekistan Restricts Provision of Crypto Services to Licensed Firms
<p>The government of the Republic of Uzbekistan initially granted licenses to local crypto firms in November 2022, according to the NAPP. But from 2023, it has restricted crypto service provision to licensed crypto firms.</p>
<p>Before providing clarity regarding crypto service provision, the Uzbeki government restricted access to several international cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Huobi, and the now-collapsed FTX, after accusing them of conducting unlicensed activities.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan introduced its regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in early 2022 by presidential decree and launched the NAPP to oversee the industry.</p>
<p>The government of Uzbekistan started its crackdown on the crypto industry in October 2021 after it identified over half a dozen crypto exchanges operating illegally.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) extended its recent weak performance early in the Asian session as the pair remained on the defensive after encountering additional selling pressure around the 29665.27 area.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 28921 and 28614 levels during the ongoing depreciation, downside price objectives associated with recent selling activity around the 30222 and 29665.27 areas.&nbsp; Large Stops were also elected below the 28495.58 area during the tumble, a downside price objective linked to selling pressure around the 30421.29 area.&nbsp; The downside price pressure temporarily slowed around the 28316.37 area, representing a test of the 50% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 24750 to 31862.21.&nbsp; Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>
<p>Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28213, 28137, 27979, 27757, 27430, 27409, 27338, 27312, 27246, 26501, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp; Also, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historic depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29249.21 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 28998.47.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Recently, three cryptocurrencies have been catching the eye of traders - Stellar (XLM), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Everlodge (ELDG). While the crypto market is a dynamic and ever-expanding landscape, these cryptocurrencies stand out with their unique features and potential for substantial growth. Let&rsquo;s examine these three projects further and find out what makes them so appealing. </p>
Summary
- Stellar partners up with Bitso, causing a price increase
- Dogecoin shows green monthly charts
- Everlodge to bring outstanding returns for early buyers
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Stellar (XLM): Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments
<p>Stellar (XLM) is hailed as one of the frontrunners in the blockchain industry when it comes to facilitating cross-border transactions. Designed to bridge traditional financial systems with decentralized networks, Stellar&rsquo;s mission is to make money more fluid and accessible globally. </p>
<p>Additionally, Stellar&rsquo;s partnerships with established financial institutions bolster its credibility.</p>
<p>Recently, Bitso announced its partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation. This partnership aims to improve communication between the world stage and the Latin American crypto ecosystem. As a result, interest in the Stellar crypto rose as its trading volume jumped by 3% overnight, reaching $75,597,416. </p>
<p>Currently, one Stellar token costs $0.1339. In the past week, it achieved a peak of $0.1450. But,the technical indicators for Stellar are all showing strong buy signals. Therefore, experts remain bullish about it. Consequently, they predict a jump to $0.17 for Stellar by December 2023. </p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): From Meme to Market Resilience
<p>The Dogecoin (DOGE) journey from being a playful meme to a resilient cryptocurrency is a testament to its enduring popularity. Despite its lighthearted origins, Dogecoin has carved out a significant place in the crypto market. Consequently, gaining attention from high-profile individuals and capturing the mainstream spotlight.</p>
<p>This attention was displayed on the Dogecoin price charts as well. Most notably, the Dogecoin value soared by 4% in the past month alone. Moreover, its trading volume surged by 11.11% overnight, jumping to $318,640,213. One Dogecoin costs $0.0737 with a market cap of $10.3B. </p>
<p>While its price may experience fluctuations, its strong community engagement and potential for broader adoption continue to make it an attractive choice for investors. Due to all these reasons, bullish experts predict Dogecoin skyrocketing to $0.098 by this year&rsquo;s end. </p>
Everlodge (ELDG): Transforming Real Estate Investment
<p>While Stellar and Dogecoin are tokens worth watching, one project may outshine them - Everlodge (ELDG). With a predicted 20% pump coming in August, this upcoming property marketplace is breaking new ground by merging real estate and blockchain technology through fractional ownership and NFTs.</p>
<p>This innovative approach allows investors to gain exposure to many real estate assets that were previously out of reach. In other words, you can become a fractional owner of a luxurious home on the blockchain for prices as low as $100. Everlodge accomplishes this by minting NFTs representing high-end villas, homes, and properties and then fractionalizing them. </p>
<p>Due to this investment method, Everlodge provides greater property ownership transparency, security, and immutability. Not only that, NFTs enable unique and customizable ownership experiences, as owners can trade their NFTs on Everlodge&rsquo;s secondary marketplace or any third-party ERC20-compatible marketplace.</p>
<p>Holding the ELDG native token is crucial to obtaining discounts on trading fees, free nightly stays in properties, or staking rewards. One token costs only $0.01 since it is in Stage 1 of its presale. What separates ELDG from Stellar and Dogecoin is its low market cap, which means it can surge much faster. Thus, analysts forecast a 280% rise before its presale ends.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="s5">Pushing the possibility of artificial intelligence (AI), tools like Google Bard are now being used for market analysis and predictions. With very high accuracy, these tools are growing in relevancy. Today, Google Bard has stirred excitement in the crypto space, after bullish predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB), ApeCoin (APE), and Everlodge (ELDG).</p>
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Summary
● Shiba Inu is forming a golden cross and can rally by as much as 50%
● With an expansion of the APE ecosystem, the price of ApeCoin could rally to $2.5
● Experts predict up to 20x rally as Everlodge allows everyone to invest in real estate
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts a Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rally
<p class="s5">Over the last eight weeks, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been steadily increasing, finally reclaiming the $0.00001000 support last week. Google Bard has predicted that the rally for the Shiba Inu coin will continue, citing three major reasons.</p>
<p class="s5">The first reason according to Bard is the launch of Shibarium. The layer 2 network is set to launch this week and add more utility to Shiba Inu. Next, Google Bard highlights the increasing Shiba Inu burn. By reducing the number of SHIB, it predicts an increase in the Shiba Inu price.</p>
<p class="s5">Lastly, SHIB is approaching a golden cross after printing six consecutive weeks of bullish candles. If this holds up, Google Bard has predicted that the price of Shiba Inu could rally by 50% and trade as high as $0.00001510.</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts an ApeCoin (APE) Rally
<p class="s5">The AI chatbot has highlighted several reasons why the ApeCoin price could increase in the coming days. According to the AI chatbot, ApeCoin (APE) first is part of the biggest non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem, ensuring its success.</p>
<p class="s5">Also, the ecosystem is about to witness a significant expansion, which could also help the Apecoin value increase. Lastly, APE has been decoupling from the price of Bitcoin, which hints at a major price outbreak.</p>
<p class="s5">At the time of this writing, the price of Apecoin stands at $2.01. With the current projections, ApeCoin could reach highs of $2.5 by the end of August.</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts an Everlodge (ELDG) Rally
<p class="s5">Everlodge (ELDG) is another project that has attracted strong bullish predictions from Google Bard. The project is disrupting the timeshare sector by introducing a hybrid property co-ownership model, allowing millions of new investors to participate with as little as $100.</p>
<p class="s5">Google Bard is bullish about Everlodge as the project debuts as a one-of-a-kind initiative in the $280 trillion global real estate industry. Also, the project&rsquo;s partnerships with well-known hotel brands and luxury real estate developers would drive the price higher.</p>
<p class="s5">Lastly, Everlodge's growth will be ensured by the project's broad ecosystem and customer-friendly benefits. At the time of this writing, Everlodge is in its beta presale stage and sells for $0.01.</p>
<p class="s5">Based on Google Bard&rsquo;s predictions, investors can expect a 20x price surge for Everloge in 2023 as the token has been given a yearly high of $0.20 per token.</p>

                    <description>
                        <![CDATA[<p>Recently, Visa announced its trial of Ethereum (ETH) gas payments via cards, marking a significant milestone toward mainstream crypto adoption. Additionally, the popularity of projects like Pomerdoge (POMD) and its presale has further illustrated the appeal of innovative crypto projects. Today, we will take a closer look at both of these developments. </p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Price Rises After Visa Announcement 
<p>The global payment company Visa has been developing an experimental method that enables on-chain Ethereum (ETH) gas prices to be paid using credit cards. The fintech startup claims that the testing for this solution is now complete, allowing customers to use credit or debit cards to pay the gas cost with fiat on Ethereum directly. </p>
<p>The ease of use and convenience offered by this approach has the potential to make Ethereum transactions more accessible to a broader audience. As a result, the Ethereum price soared by 1.2% over the past seven days.</p>
<p>This bullish trend has continued as the Ethereum value now sits at $1,849.67 with a market cap of $222B, a rise of 0.18% overnight. Furthermore, the technical analysis of Ethereum paints a bullish picture. In other words, its moving averages and technical indicators show buy signals. Therefore, experts forecast a jump to $2,335.71 by December 2023.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD): Stellar Presale Performance
<p>While traditional financial players are making strides in crypto adoption with Ethereum, innovative blockchain projects are also making waves. Pomerdoge (POMD), an exciting play-to-earn gaming project, has captured mass appeal with its presale, providing early birds with a 14% ROI.</p>
Exploring The Pomerdoge (POMD) Success
<p>At the heart of Pomerdoge is the opportunity to build and nurture your Pomer character. As you progress through the game, your Pomer character evolves and grows to elite levels, reflecting your skill and dedication. To clarify, this unique feature adds an element of personalization and ownership that resonates with the core principles of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Pomerdoge 7,777 NFT collection is another rare and exciting component. Each NFT within this limited edition collection holds the promise of something extraordinary, but the full extent of its benefits remains tantalizingly undisclosed until closer to the launch. What we do know is that only POMD holders will gain access to it, and each NFT will be worth 0.2 ETH.</p>
The Allure of POMD Tokens
<p>POMD tokens fuel the play-to-earn mechanics, allowing players to engage with the game and reap the rewards. Currently, the POMD token is valued at just $0.008 as it is in Phase One of its presale. However, millions of tokens have been sold already, so demand is high. In fact, some experts even foresee a 20x surge for it before its presale concludes.</p>
<p>Considering its low market cap of $14M and ties to an online game industry with 3B players, Pomerdoge could see the same growth as Ethereum did. If you wish to purchase this token and participate in weekly giveaways totaling $150,000 - sign up below. </p>

<p>Considering its low market cap of $14M and ties to an online game industry with 3B players, Pomerdoge could see the same growth as Ethereum did. If you wish to purchase this token and participate in weekly giveaways totaling $150,000 - sign up below. </p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>In this market analysis, we'll delve into the movements of three intriguing cryptocurrencies: XRP (XRP), Tron (TRX), and Pomerdoge (POMD). Market analysis is important since trends can shift daily in the cryptocurrency market. Thus, traders and enthusiasts alike must keep a keen eye on the performance of various tokens.</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
XRP (XRP): Navigating the Waves
<p>XRP (XRP) has been navigating waves in the market. Recent weeks have seen the XRP price experiencing turbulence, with a 10.8% decline over the past 14 days. </p>
<p>However, XRP has shown green charts again as it trades hands at $0.6306 with a market cap of $33.2B, up 0.70% overnight. This came as a result of the recent XRP listing on Gemini. </p>
<p>Despite this minuscule rise, the XRP coin trading volume has plummeted by 40.78% daily, sinking to $1,022,725,535. Moreover, its moving averages and technical indicators show strong sell signals. Therefore, many experts foresee a short-term price drop for XRP, prompting buyers to sidestep this token.</p>
Tron (TRX): Showing Increased Volatility
<p>Tron (TRX) has been facing challenges recently. In fact, over the past two weeks, the Tron price has dropped by 7.2%. Since it was rejected by the range high on July 22, the Tron coin value has been fluctuating between $0.070 and $0.088.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tron recently breached a short-term ascending support line, further indicating the possibility of a negative trend. Tron has a value of $0.07725 with a market cap of $6.9B, up 0.39% in the past day alone. </p>
<p>But, the trading volume of Tron has taken a 10.41% dip during that time, sinking to $154,358,626. Its technical indicators also paint a bearish outlook as they are all in the red. Thus, market analysts foresee a drop to its support level of $0.066 for Tron soon. </p>
Pomerdoge (POMD): Unleashing Gaming Potential
<p>Amid XRP's and Tron's ups and downs, a new player has emerged on the scene with an intriguing ecosystem - Pomerdoge (POMD). This cryptocurrency introduces a gaming-focused approach, aiming to connect players globally through a play-to-earn model. In fact, with over 3B individuals playing online games, Pomerdoge taps into a flourishing market.</p>
Closer Look at the Pomergame
<p>The main appeal for gamers will lie in the Pomergame - a unique P2E crypto game where users can earn rewards just by playing it. Not only that, the Pomerplace marketplace is another exciting component of Pomerdoge. This innovative platform is a bustling hub where players gather to engage in many activities.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Pomerplace is a marketplace that opens doors to a universe of possibilities. Here, you can buy, sell, and trade the valuable items you've skillfully collected throughout your Pomerdoge journey, adding a tangible dimension to your virtual conquests.</p>
What Makes the POMD Native Token So Alluring?
<p>Buyers are flooding the Pomerdoge presale looking to obtain the POMD native token for an affordable price. One POMD token is worth $0.008, and those who bought it early enjoy a 14% ROI. Also, experts have taken notice of POMD's $14M market cap. In other words, when compared to XRP and Tron, POMD will skyrocket much quicker.</p>
<p>Those who purchase it now will gain access to an exclusive 7,777 NFT collection created by Pomerdoge. Each NFT will cost 0.2 ETH and provide holders with unique perks. In addition, early birds will also participate in weekly giveaways totaling $150,000. Therefore, do not miss out on this potential blue-chip token projected to surge by 20x before its presale ends.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Polygon Labs has partnered with Korean telecommunications company SK Telecom to develop a complete Web3 ecosystem.</p>
Enhancing Web3 Ecosystem with Polygon Integration
<p>International software development company Polygon Labs has announced a strategic collaboration with Korean mobile giant SK Telecom (SKT) to develop a robust Web3 ecosystem. The agreement signing ceremony took place at SKT's headquarters in Seoul, with Oh Se-hyun, Vice President and Head of Web3 CO of SKT, and Polygon Labs' CEO Marc Boiron in attendance.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, SKT will integrate support for the Polygon blockchain into its NFT marketplace TopPort and upcoming Web3 wallet.&nbsp;</p>
Polygon&rsquo;s Web3 Advancement
<p>The partnership between Polygon Labs and SKT will enable users to avail of faster and more cost-efficient transactions while leveraging the security and decentralization of Ethereum.</p>
<p>Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron emphasized the significance of this collaboration, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Polygon Labs has been developing optimal blockchain technology for Web3 popularization, and we see this collaboration with SKT as an important step in providing Web3 experiences to more consumers."</p>

<p>The Polygon Labs team had previously revealed its plans to establish multiple layer-2 networks on the Polygon blockchain as an integral component of their Polygon 2.0 roadmap.&nbsp;</p>
TopPort and Web3 Wallet Integration
<p>SKT had launched its NFT marketplace, TopPort, in 2022. The new partnership will also come in handy for the marketplace, as it will expand its capabilities. Creators would be able to mint Polygon-based NFTs on TopPort, making it compatible and scalable with other NFT platforms on the Polygon ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SK Telecom is also scheduled to drop its Web3 wallet in the second half of 2023. The partnership with Polygon Labs will integrate the latter&rsquo;s excellent network support and NFT trading facilities into the wallet for a seamless adoption of Web3 technologies by SKT users.&nbsp;</p>
Fostering Web3 Startups and Ecosystem Growth
<p>The collaboration extends beyond technical integration. Both companies will work together to identify promising Web3 startups and provide incubation support. Polygon Labs plans to explore potential investments in Web3 startups recommended by SKT through its subsidiary, Polygon Ventures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the partnership aims to facilitate the entry of competitive Web3 startups into the global market and introduce leading decentralized apps (dApps) from around the world into the Korean market.</p>
<p>Oh Se-hyun, Vice President and Head of Web3 CO at SKT highlighted the potential of the collaboration, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"By combining our experience in blockchain services and Polygon Lab's blockchain infrastructure and ecosystem, we will be able to create valuable business opportunities and boost the Web3 ecosystem."</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University of California Berkeley&rsquo;s SETI@Home project is no longer allowing new users to participate in its ongoing search for extraterrestrial life, meaning it&rsquo;s no longer able to provide a passive income stream for those who&rsquo;re willing to leave their computer on 24/7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SETI@Home project launched way back in 1999, inviting users to download a special software program that enabled them to donate their excess computing power to the initiative, which is looking for signs of alien life elsewhere in the cosmic void. But much to people&rsquo;s disappointment, scientists announced in 2021 that they&rsquo;re winding down the project and no longer require contributions from the general public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the announcement was a major disappointment for participants, the good news is that there are still many other distributed computing projects that allow users to make money by renting out their idle storage space or processing power.&nbsp;</p>
What is Distributed Computing?
<p>It might sound incredibly technical, but the concept of distributed computing is actually a very simple one. It refers to a process where the combined resources of multiple, distributed computers are aggregated together, providing powerful compute or storage resources for heavy-duty projects. In some ways it can be likened to Airbnb, but instead of renting out your spare room or vacation home, you simply rent out your unused computing resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To participate, you&rsquo;ll need to download and install the required application or plugin for whatever project it is you want to contribute to. Then it&rsquo;ll run in the background, allowing your computer&rsquo;s excess resources to be used by the organization concerned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Where Can I Participate?
<p>There are dozens of interesting projects looking to borrow people&rsquo;s excess computing capacity in support of various use cases:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Spacemesh
<p>Mining cryptocurrency is one of the most obvious ideas for utilizing your spare capacity that comes to mind, but it&rsquo;s important to choose a suitable network. While it was possible to mine Bitcoin from a PC back in the early days, its cryptographic algorithms have become so complex and its mining ecosystem so competitive that such limited hardware simply won&rsquo;t do any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter Spacemesh, an alternative cryptocurrency network that&rsquo;s designed to serve the average joe who wants to mine a little crypto on his or her computer at home. Unlike Bitcoin&rsquo;s proof-of-work consensus algorithm, Spacemesh uses a novel proof-of-space time consensus mechanism that is much less energy-intensive. It also employs a unique &ldquo;race-free approach&rdquo; that disincentivizes the use of massive amounts of hardware, ensuring everyone can participate and earn a passive income on their personal Mac or PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All that&rsquo;s required to start mining with Spacemesh is an Intel or AMD CPU with at least 1GB of RAM, and an always-on, unmetered internet connection with a minimum of 5 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike Bitcoin, where the CPU is the main factor for miners, Spacemesh relies on disk storage resources, which do not use energy when they&rsquo;re idle, resulting in much lower costs. The protocol is centered on fairness, and ensures all miners are rewarded for their contributions at every EPOCH, which currently concludes every two weeks, with their exact reward based on how much storage space they commit in proportion to the network size. In addition, the protocol prevents whales from joining the system with massive storage resources &ndash; in such a case, they would face much higher overhead costs, eliminating any profit gains. In this way, Spacemesh ensures its network remains highly decentralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
HyperCycle&nbsp;
<p>As an alternative, PC and laptop owners can opt to join the HyperCycle network, which is a Layer-0 blockchain that&rsquo;s building an artificial general intelligence network. The idea with this is to promote cooperation between AI agents by establishing a network of nodes that collaborate with one another to solve complex problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cooperative AI sees distributed computers aggregate their compute resources to create a &ldquo;global brain&rdquo;, kind of like a distributed supercomputer. AI systems can tap into this network and use its combined power to perform computing tasks that would normally be performed by sophisticated server networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users are required to purchase an individual software node license to participate in HyperCycle&rsquo;s network and deposit a minimum of 1,024 HYPC tokens. That might sound expensive, but HyperCycle insists it&rsquo;s a small price to pay to democratize access to advanced AI computation and pave the way for a future &ldquo;Internet of AIs&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Fleek Network
<p>A great option for Web3 enthusiasts, Fleek Network is calling on users to participate in the industry&rsquo;s first decentralized edge network.&nbsp;Edge networks are made up of nodes, or subnetworks, positioned closer to end users and directly connected to the network core. They enable content to be delivered to end users with lower latency, no matter where they are located, while providing services such as serverless functions, SSR (server-side rendering), container orchestration and various database functions. Examples of edge network devices include WiFi access points, sensors, branch offices and individual computers.</p>
<p>Fleek Network is building the first decentralized edge network, as an alternative to centralized networks that go against the ethos of Web3. It&rsquo;s not feasible to build out a global network of edge devices from scratch, so instead it relies on individuals who are willing to provide computing resources in exchange for rewards. With Fleek, anyone can contribute edge resources by running a cache node. As a node operator, users can contribute resources including bandwidth, CPUs and GPUs to enable Fleek&rsquo;s edge services. The goal is to provide a shared performance layer that every Web3 protocol can leverage. With its protocol-agnostic and modular architecture, Fleek&rsquo;s edge network can add value to virtually any decentralized application or service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Storj
<p>If you have plenty of hard drive space and you&rsquo;re willing to put it to work, Storj offers a viable opportunity with its decentralized cloud storage network, which it presents as an alternative to services like Dropbox, Box and Amazon Web Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It claims to have some big advantages, including greater privacy with guarantees that content stored within the Storj network will never be monitored or censored. All content stored on people&rsquo;s hard drives is fully encrypted, and only the owner has the keys required to access it. The other key selling point is that content is automatically distributed across multiple devices, eliminating the risk of downtime that would prevent users from accessing their files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To rent out your extra disk drive space to Storj, all that&rsquo;s required is to download its application, install it, and then select how much storage capacity you want to contribute. Once activated, that portion of your hard drive becomes a part of the Storj network so you can no longer use it yourself. Instead, you&rsquo;ll be compensated for renting it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the requirements, obviously, is that you must be willing to leave your computer up and running and ensure it&rsquo;s always online, in return for payments made to your bank account each month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Hyperlink
<p>Hyperlink refers to itself as the &ldquo;World Supercomputer&rdquo;, but is really a global network of computers that anyone can join to earn passive income. Users donate their computer&rsquo;s resources to host third-party websites, mobile applications and content. Its services are offered as a low-cost alternative to businesses that don&rsquo;t want to invest in their own infrastructure or traditional cloud computing services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the advantages of Hyperlink is that it claims to offer significant earnings potential for users, saying it&rsquo;s possible to earn up to $8,600 per year by connecting a desktop or laptop to its network and leaving it running 24/7. Users can even contribute an entire server if they happen to have one lying around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another bonus is that Hyperlink offers flexible payment options, allowing users to receive their earnings through PayPal, bank transfers, credit card payment and more. In future, Hyperlink will expand its network to include tablets and smartphones too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What Are The Downsides?
<p>There actually does not seem to be a lot of downsides to earning a passive income, but those considering it should be aware that by running these programs and keeping their computer switched on 24/7, it may degrade its performance and lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the reality is that most people don&rsquo;t normally use the full capacity of their machine, so they can afford to contribute without really noticing any performance impact. And of course, it&rsquo;s always possible to use an external storage device if you do need more disk space.</p>
<p>Then again, if you do need to perform intensive computing tasks yourself, it might be worth investing in a more powerful machine, or even a second computer that you can leave running and forget about.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest partnership is an extension of Open Campus&rsquo; mission to educate and raise awareness on issues of climate change and environmental conservation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This July, Open Campus, a community-led Web 3 educational content platform, announced the launch of their #ClimateChange4Kids campaign on X (formerly Twitter) to educate the upcoming generations on the importance of protecting our planet. To extend its efforts, Open Campus is now in partnership with its affiliate, TinyTap and Code Green, a Web 3 organization leveraging blockchain and art to help conserve the environment, to create educational content on climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strategic partnership aims to extend knowledge and awareness of climate change via the Open Campus platform, providing creators, educators and teachers with a decentralized platform to create interactive educational games and earn from their content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While several parts of the world face extreme temperatures and wildfires, such an initiative could be a crucial step in imparting knowledge on how to stop it.&nbsp; Code Green, TinyTap and Open Campus come together in a mission to educate younger generations &ndash; in an engaging and interactive way &ndash; on climate change. Furthermore, the initiative extends the belief in &ldquo;the power of education to shape a more sustainable future&rdquo;, a mission also shared by the&nbsp; United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).&nbsp;</p>

<p>"By combining education, technology, and gaming, we're creating a unique platform to engage children and empower them with the knowledge and awareness to tackle this urgent crisis for our planet,&rdquo; Inna Modja, CEO of Code Green and Goodwill Ambassador for the UNCCD, said.</p>

Open Campus, TinyTap and Code Green launch NFT Giveaway&nbsp;
<p>In light of the new collaboration, TinyTap will create a new climate change-centred course and integrate some elements of Code Green&rsquo;s game HEALV3RSE, available on The Sandbox. Featured on the UNCCD website, HEALV3RSE is a metaverse game that allows users to play, learn about the planet, and have a real-world impact. The game&rsquo;s avatars and NFT will feature in the lessons to incentivize learners and enhance the overall quality of the course, the press statement reads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through various levels of the game, players discover facts about the environment, make eco-friendly choices to help their virtual planet and perform healing actions. The &lsquo;Play To Heal&rsquo; model enhances the game and gives players a novel experience as they participate in healing actions for our planet, such as planting trees, cleaning oceans, and installing solar panels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Open Campus and Code Green are launching a giveaway to promote the new course. Players who participate in the giveaway campaign have a chance to win up to 100 HEALV3RSE avatars and equipment NFTs. Follow-up details on the giveaway will be posted on Open Campus X (fmr. Twitter) page.</p>
<p>The latest strategic partnership follows the successful launch of &lsquo;Climate Change for Kids&rsquo; in July, aiming to enhance awareness of climate change, especially in younger generations. The #ClimateChange4Kids initiative has seen tremendous support worldwide, with over 200,000 impressions on X. Lastly, Open Campus&rsquo; recent partnership with Cloud Co Entertainment saw the company get a license to use the image of Care Bears, one of the most popular children's products line.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>According to hedge fund manager Mark Yusko, banks take $7 trillion dollars out of the system every year. The advent of triple entry accounting with blockchain means that banks are becoming redundant.</p>
Banks fight dirty
<p>Founder of Morgan Creek Capital, Yusko recently gave an interview in which he gave a portrayal of the banks that isn&rsquo;t often heard. He stated that banks have paid more in fines for criminal acts such as fraud and money laundering than the entire market cap of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>He affirmed that banks are extremely worried about crypto and blockchain technology because it heralds an end to their existence, given that the middle man is now no longer needed. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We (the banks) skim $7 trillion a year out of this system. It&rsquo;s 6 to 8% of GDP that goes to the banks for trust - but we can replace trust with truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yusko is of the belief that the FTX collapse was actually orchestrated in order to bring controversy to the crypto industry and allow US regulators to react by launching an aggressive onslaught against the crypto sector.</p>
<p>He believes that the banking industry, in charge of money for hundreds of years, is in league with regulators to cripple the crypto industry so that it can continue its hegemony over printing money.</p>
<p>Yusko expects the banks&rsquo; fight against the crypto industry will carry on for the next few years before the obvious advantages of crypto and blockchain are finally recognised and given government support.&nbsp;</p>
How the incumbent fights the newcomer
<p>An example of an antiquated and embedded system that seeks to suppress and cripple a new and better system is given by Yusko. He points to when cars were invented and how the incumbent transport system of the horse and buggy sought to do just this in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>Reportedly there was collusion between those seeking to protect the horse and buggy system, and the regulators. Ridiculous and onerous rules were imposed on cars that forced them to have someone walking ahead of them holding a red flag. In addition, three persons were required by law to have charge of a vehicle, and additional persons were needed if wagons or carriages were attached.</p>
<p>These harsh and exacting laws were in place for 30 years before being repealed, and technology was finally allowed to progress.&nbsp;</p>
Imposition of CBDCs
<p>According to Yusko, banking is attempting to do the same thing against crypto. He believes that moves are afoot to impose central bank digital currencies on citizens, forcing their use. Yusko said of CBDCs:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t watched Agustin Carstens (Head of the Bank for International Settlements) talk about what a CBDC actually is - and of course the central bank should control how, when, and if you are allowed to spend &lsquo;your&rsquo; money - it&rsquo;s one of the most chilling 1 minute and 47 seconds that you&rsquo;ll ever watch.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>$BNB, the Binance exchange token, is on the brink of a potential heavy collapse. Will this bring Bitcoin and the crypto market down?</p>
$BNB on the brink
<p>Following negative downward price action since November 2021, the $BNB token has reached the point where a slide under the critical $220 level could lead to a calamitous -5x crash down to below $50.</p>
<p>Right now the price is struggling to stay within the bottom limits of a bear flag it first entered in early June of this year. The price has already slid out of the bottom of the bear flag at time of going to press, but this break is still to be confirmed.</p>
<p>A nervousness does still appear to be upon the crypto market over recent weeks as bears and bulls both eye bitcoin and ethereum as they approach their own critical trendlines and support levels.</p>
Bitcoin and Ethereum also at critical levels&nbsp;
<p>If bitcoin hits the support of its bullish trendline this is likely to be as low as $28,000. The 200 daily moving average is just below this at $27,300. In its favour, the bitcoin hash ribbons indicator very recently signalled a buy. Ethereum is already at and holding its bullish trendline at just under $1,800. This is also the level of its 200 day moving average. Both bitcoin and ethereum could see a significant price drop if these levels break.</p>
Altcoins having a good day
<p>The rest of the altcoin market is mostly doing a lot better than either bitcoin or ethereum so far today. Total 3 (all cryptos with the exception of bitcoin and ethereum) is up 1% on the day so far. Strong support at $331 billion is below the current value of just under $337 billion.</p>
<p>$RUNE is still on the charge this morning with a more than 6% gain so far. This is counted in $RUNEs epic 70% rise since the beginning of August, making this crypto one of the biggest movers over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Kaspa ($KAS) has also featured prominently among the altcoins but more so over the longer term. The innovative proof-of-work layer 1 rose more than 330% since May, but has been correcting over the last couple of weeks. It is up 3.6% on the day so far.</p>
A $BNB wipeout could mean serious issues for crypto&nbsp;
<p>The question now is whether or not $BNB can hold its ground at $220 if it should get down there. Many will be shorting the token given how the SEC is suing both Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao. Should $BNB indeed make the drop, the token, as well as the exchange, could be in serious financial trouble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Binance accounting for much of the trade in crypto, plus holding large amounts of many other tokens, such a scenario could be calamitous for the exchange, as well as for the crypto market in general.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Road Town, BVI., August 17th, 2023, Chainwire</p>
<p>As the cryptocurrency market has witnessed a decline for over a year, many investors have chosen to liquidate their assets or move to alternative markets. However, 2023 has painted a different picture, positioning cryptocurrency as one of the best-performing investments. According to CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market capitalization rebounded from a low of $780.9 billion to a staggering $1.2198 trillion. Amid this resurgence, LBank, after a few years of dormancy, has announced the reboot of its IEO. Official participation link:&nbsp;https://www.lbank.com/launchpad-list/pins/</p>
<p>With LBank&rsquo;s IEO making a comeback, let&rsquo;s dive deep into its historical performance to gauge its potential.</p>
<p>Historical Gains of LBank IEO &ndash; 8 IEOs with an Average Surge of 1274%</p>
Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of LBank&rsquo;s past eight IEOs and their respective gains:
<p></p>
Key Insights from the Data:
<p>Extreme Performers: VEN stands out remarkably with an opening surge of 100% and a jaw-dropping peak surge of 5300%. DBC, with its 300% opening and 2096% peak, also highlights the potential of high return for investors when the right project is picked.</p>
<p>Steady Climbers: Projects like BLOC, SEER, and INK might not have the most impressive opening surges, but their peak surges underline the importance of holding onto investments and the potential for long-term gains.</p>
<p>Consistent Performers: Both CMT and DDD had modest opening surges but still managed to deliver reasonable peak surges. These indicate that even projects that start with a quieter entry can offer profitable opportunities.</p>
<p>Risky Endeavors: While the data predominantly showcases successes, it&rsquo;s also essential to note projects like INK and DDD. Their minimal to zero opening surges serve as a reminder of the risks inherent in IEO investments.</p>
<p>This data also showcases a strong correlation between the initial surge and peak surge. In simpler terms, projects with an impressive opening usually fare well in the long run. From the data, it&rsquo;s evident that investing in LBank&rsquo;s IEOs can provide returns in the short term. Holding onto these investments for an extended period might amplify the gains further, as exemplified by the metaverse project SAND.</p>
LBank&rsquo;s Current Market Stance:
<p>While LBank carries a notable legacy, it is essential to consider contemporary metrics when assessing its present standing. According to the H1 report from CoinMarketCap, LBank is featured among the top five global exchanges, an indication of its continued relevance and adaptability in the fast-evolving crypto landscape. Holding a 4.6% market share in spot trading volume, it&rsquo;s intriguing to observe their strategic emphasis on MEME coins. This focus, often seen as a blend of calculated risk and innovative market positioning, distinguishes LBank from many of its counterparts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To conclude, based on the available data and recent market performances, one can argue that LBank remains a significant player in the exchange arena. As they reboot their IEO, it might be a space to watch for investors keen on exploring fresh avenues.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>According to a notice published by the regulatory authority, Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority has hit digital asset exchange OPNX and its founders nearly $2.8 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crypto bankruptcy claims exchange and its founders, Su Zhu, Kyle Davies, and Mark Lamb, were formally reprimanded by VARA in May.&nbsp;</p>
A Hefty Fine&nbsp;

The fines are for violations of Administrative Order No. 01/22 Relating to Regulation of Marketing, Advertising, and Promotions Related to Virtual Assets [failure to ensure marketing meets the requirements of paragraph II.1 and/or II.5 of the Marketing Regulation]. The fines were issued on the 2nd of May 2023 and have been fully paid by the individuals in question.&rdquo;</p>

Further Action?&nbsp;
<p>The fines issued by the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority are the biggest fines the regulator has issued to date. The regulatory body noted that all fines were referred to its grievance committee and were in accordance with all governance requirements. The committee determined that enforcement actions against OPNX and its founders should be upheld in their entirety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All fines noted above were referred to Vara&rsquo;s grievance committee in accordance with due governance requirements. The committee reviewed the referral of the grievance and determined that the enforcement actions taken be upheld in their entirety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The regulator also hinted at further action against OPNX in a bid to recover payments and could potentially see the matter being referred to law enforcement agencies or competent courts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vara shall determine consequential actions warranted against Opnx, which may include further fines, penalties, and/or taking any actions necessary to recover payment and definitively remedy the behavior including, but not limited to, referring the matter to any law enforcement agency (ies) or competent courts.&rdquo;</p>

The Controversial OPNX Exchange&nbsp;
<p>OPNX was set up and launched by the founders of the failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Kyle Davies and Su Zhu. The platform was created following the downfall of Three Arrows Capital, with Zhu and Davies heavily criticized for starting the project. The platform allows investors to trade bankruptcy claims for platforms such as CoinFLEX and FTX. The exchange conducted less than $2 worth of trades as it stumbled into a launch, with major trading firms claimed to be investors by OPNX denied their involvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency sector has endured a difficult 2022, with several major projects and entities collapsing, while hacks and other threats have also led to investor interest cooling. The most notable collapse was that of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>In a major development, the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange (COIN) has received regulatory approval to list crypto futures in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approval comes nearly two years after the exchange had originally applied for approval to offer crypto futures in the markets.&nbsp;</p>
A Long Wait Ends&nbsp;
<p>Coinbase announced on Wednesday that it had secured approval from the National Futures Association (NFA) to operate as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). FCMs are similar to market makers, buying and selling futures contracts. With approvals in place, Coinbase has stated its intention to offer eligible US-based customers regulated derivatives products through Coinbase Financial Markets. These will be subject to the oversight of the National Futures Association and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The crypto exchange stated in a post on X,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The National Futures Association, a CFTC designated SRO, has approved Coinbase Financial Markets. as a registered Futures Commission Merchant. Coinbase can now offer futures contracts in BTC and ETH to eligible customers in the US.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The approval makes Coinbase the first crypto platform in the United States to offer traders regulated and leveraged crypto futures along with traditional spot trading. According to the announcement, Coinbase had applied for registration as a Futures Commission Merchant with the NFA in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In September of 2021, we filed an application with the NFA to register an FCM. Our team has worked with regulators since then to ensure we will comply with all the necessary regulations and that our FCM&rsquo;s business model meets the CFTC&rsquo;s customer protection requirements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Coinbase, the approval will allow US customers to access regulated crypto derivatives and allow greater access to the larger crypto economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to announce that approval has been secured, which will allow eligible US customers to access regulated derivatives products through Coinbase Financial Markets and alongside our spot market for a seamless experience subject to the oversight of the CFTC and the NFA. Approval for US customers to access regulated crypto derivatives will allow more people to access the crypto economy in the United States in a safe way that helps keep the US at the center of digital innovation.&rdquo;</p>

Futures Contracts In Bitcoin And Ether&nbsp;
<p>The company also put up a post on X, stating that it could now offer users cryptocurrency futures contracts in Bitcoin And ETH. Coinbase stated in a message,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe this is a watershed moment to be able to bring regulated crypto products to US customers. This is a critical milestone that reaffirms our commitment to operate a regulated and compliant business and be the most trusted and secure crypto-native platform for our customers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Other Approvals&nbsp;
<p>The cryptocurrency unit of Cboe Global Markets, Cboe Digital, had already received approval from the CFTC to offer margined Bitcoin and Ether futures back in June. At the time, Christy Goldsmith Romero, the Commissioner of the CFTC, had stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been vocal about the benefits of bringing appropriate crypto activities into the regulated space in order to protect customers, but in a way that supports oversight, accountability, transparency, and risk management.&rdquo;</p>

<p>COIN shares have also registered a significant jump, opening 4% higher at $82.49. Currently, COIN is trading at around $79.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield has reported that around $1.7 million worth of ETH is stuck in the Shibarium Bridge after its launch failed to create a meme coin rally, as was widely expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The much-hyped and highly anticipated Shibarium Network went live late on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
ETH Stuck In Limbo
<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield broke the news in a post on social media platform X. The firm stated that around $1.7 million worth of ETH was stuck in the Shibarium Bridge. The news comes shortly after Shibarium, a chain that was designed to facilitate the optimum utilization of dog-themed tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), TREAT, and the much-hyped Doge killer LEASH.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many expected the launch of Shibarium to push the price of these meme coins into orbit. However, things did not go as planned and went sideways quite quickly, with the value of the tokens plummeting. Tokens such as TREAT were down 10%, while the BONE and LEASH tokens were down 17% and 25%, respectively, over the past 24 hours. While the developments have, no doubt, left many new users disappointed. However, recovery is possible as network users adapt and reconcile with the changes.&nbsp;</p>
SHIB Plunges By Over 9%&nbsp;
<p>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) token dropped nearly 10% as users began reporting widespread bridging issues after the Shibarium network went live on Wednesday. Available data showed that transactions on the network had been stalled for hours, with users transferring around 954 ETH worth $1.7 million and $750,000 worth of BONE tokens to the contract. Additionally, users were also blocked from sending messages on community forums on Discord after reports of the issue began to surface.&nbsp;</p>
The Shibarium Mainnet&nbsp;
<p>The Shibarium mainnet is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution launched by Shiba Inu on the 16th of August. The launch was initiated after months of testing and participation from millions of users. In the end, around 21 million wallets were created. Shibarium uses a new consensus mechanism called the Proof-of-Participation, which selects validators based on the proportion of the quantity of their holdings in the associated crypto asset. This helps avoid the computational costs typically associated with Proof-of-Work consensus mechanisms. The new Layer-2 solution will interact with the Ethereum blockchain and provide a more scalable and cost-effective transaction platform.&nbsp;</p>
Significant Traction&nbsp;
<p>Prior to launch, Shiba Inu&rsquo;s lead developer, who uses the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama, stated that the new Layer-2 solution has already gained significant traction from new projects interested in building on it. According to a post by the developer on X, over 100 companies are already using the Layer-2 network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kusama has also noted that people in the tech and blockchain industry are discussing an &ldquo;everyday app.&rdquo; However, they added that such innovations must be conducted from a community and decentralized perspective. They further added that Shibarium incorporates both of these principles without compromising on decentralization, interoperability, and user-centric design. Kusama elaborated that while the validator and delegator aspects of the new Layer-2 solution will keep it decentralized, its true innovation lies in the governance, framework, and charter that help govern the nascent ecosystem&rsquo;s technology, community, and innovative aspects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By using Shibarium for governance in this system, alongside self-sovereign identity to ensure quality membership (Shibizenship), the metaverse as our territory, and the ability to partner with other like-minded states, we have effectively shattered what nationhood is and rebuilt it upon the Shib ethos of decentralization!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shibarium will utilize the Heimdall validator and Bor block production nodes, similar to that of the Polygon ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance has officially announced the launch of its opBNB Mainnet, a notable addition to the burgeoning decentralized scaling solutions sector. Touted to bolster transaction speed, security, and scalability, the move is closely watched by industry insiders and users alike.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Harnessing the Optimism OP Stack Bedrock, an optimistic rollup framework, opBNB underwent a comprehensive Testnet phase over a span of 1.5 months. During this time, the network recorded more than 7 million on-chain transactions, connecting to over 435,000 unique wallet addresses. This trial run demonstrated block processing capabilities with times hovering around one second.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, opBNB's Testnet revealed its capacity to support an array of tokens, encompassing not only Binance's proprietary BNB but also widely recognized stablecoins like BUSD, USDT, and DAI. A distinguishing feature emerged in the form of minimized transaction costs, with the Layer 2 gas price set at a minimal 0.2 gwei, leading to significantly reduced expenses for users.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The impending Mainnet rollout, slotted for mid-August 2023, is bifurcated into stages: an initial access for infrastructure providers followed by a general user release. Calearly defined criteria underline the Mainnet's launch, with emphasis on High Availability to mitigate potential bottlenecks and an ambitious performance benchmark, aiming for a consistent 4,000 TPS.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Governance remains central to opBNB's approach. The Mainnet's governance framework, as detailed in the BEP-1 proposal, underscores the commitment to democratic governance processes. Concurrently, to foster ecosystem growth, opBNB is initiating a range of grants and builder programs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Looking ahead, Binance's roadmap for opBNB is multifaceted. It includes enhancing fraud-proof systems, streamlining account abstraction, and ensuring seamless data exchange with the BNB Greenfield ecosystem. A pivotal feature on the horizon is the decentralized sequencer, indicative of Binance's preemptive stance on potential centralization concerns.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While the opBNB Mainnet launch represents a significant juncture, the path ahead focuses on robust security, augmented community engagement, and facilitating broader digital adoption.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, provided an analytical dive into X's Community Notes tool via a post on his personal website. Notably, Buterin lauded the tool, formerly known as Twitter's Birdwatch, for aligning closely with the ethos of "crypto values" in mainstream contexts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Launched as Birdwatch in the U.S. in October 2022, Community Notes was conceptualized as a feature that would empower users to classify tweets based on their helpfulness and context. This was introduced prior to Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Buterin's assessment illuminated that the tool's core strength lies in its open-source algorithm, ensuring decisions about which notes are displayed are transparent and unbiased. He opined that the system is &ldquo;the closest thing to an instantiation of &lsquo;crypto values&rsquo; that we have seen in the mainstream world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While emphasizing its merits, Buterin also touched upon certain imperfections of the algorithm, noting, "It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s surprisingly close to satisfying the ideal of credible neutrality." Additionally, he highlighted the tool's capability in providing context to potentially misleading images used in news previews and addressing misinformation related to COVID-19.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Going deeper into the mechanics, Buterin elaborated on how the algorithm avoids simplistically averaging out people's votes to gauge a comment's utility. He further noted its efficiency in detecting stark political differences in content, reinforcing its neutrality.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Musk's Approach and Buterin's Observations</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Elon Musk's role in steering X's strategy since acquiring Twitter has been under scrutiny. Vitalik Buterin, while appreciating the algorithm's robustness, speculated that Musk might have directed the removal of certain Community Notes that could be perceived as contrary to his business alignments, specifically those critiques of the Chinese government. Despite this conjecture and comments on "highly contentious actions" post-Musk's takeover, Musk acknowledged Buterin's wrrite-up as a "great analysis".</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This commendation occurs amidst a backdrop of various discussions surrounding Musk's approach to free speech, exemplified by his self-proclaimed stance as a "free speech absolutist." There have been allegations, as per a Washington Post report, suggesting Musk&rsquo;s potential involvement in introducing a five-second delay for links to specific news outlets, including The New York Times.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a somewhat tangential twist, Buterin's analysis was published at a time when Musk was reportedly involved in a digital altercation with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with discussions hinting at a potential mixed martial arts face-off between the two tech magnates.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ethereum layer-2 solution Arbitrum is set to &ldquo;cliff unlock&rdquo; over 1 billion worth of $ARB on March 16, 2024 and finally start ARB&rsquo;s staggered unfreezing over the next four years. The first unlock is set almost a year after the $ARB token finally launched last March 2023.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Token Unlocks, after the initial March 16 unlock, more $ARB tokens will be unlocked every four weeks for the next four years.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At present, over 5 billion ARB tokens remain locked. Staggered unfreezing is a way to ensure that investors do not immediately sell the token in large quantities (thus drastically lowering the price so as to be completely worthless) and also to ensure that its stakeholders stay involved for a longer period.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The initially turbulent launch of the ARB token last March was somewhat remedied by its $120 million airdrop to DAOs. But ARB is currently on the decline partly because of security issues plaguing the still relatively-new platform. Just last July, Rodeo Finance suffered a significant $1.5 million blow when a code vulnerability was exploited. Last June, Chibi Finance executed a rug pull that stole approximately $1 million worth of tokens from users. The disturbing fact is that these were not the only incidents of some form of exploit in the Arbitrum platform. They highlight the pressing need for security measures in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Still, according to DefiLlama, Arbitrum is the fourth biggest protocol as of writing, with $1.88 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL). ARB on the other hand is currently trading at $1.09 according to Coingecko, down from $1.3 last July. Investors and traders should remain vigilant for developments in the protocol as the unlock date nears.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The initially turbulent launch of the ARB token last March was somewhat remedied by its $120 million airdrop to DAOs. But ARB is currently on the decline partly because of security issues plaguing the still relatively-new platform. Just last July, Rodeo Finance suffered a significant $1.5 million blow when a code vulnerability was exploited. Last June, Chibi Finance executed a rug pull that stole approximately $1 million worth of tokens from users. The disturbing fact is that these were not the only incidents of some form of exploit in the Arbitrum platform. They highlight the pressing need for security measures in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Still, according to DefiLlama, Arbitrum is the fourth biggest protocol as of writing, with $1.88 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL). ARB on the other hand is currently trading at $1.09 according to Coingecko, down from $1.3 last July. Investors and traders should remain vigilant for developments in the protocol as the unlock date nears.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>In a shift in investor appetite, the cryptocurrency community is witnessing a phenomenon that might reshape the Web3 ecosystem for good. Ethereum (ETH), the blockchain synonymous with decentralized applications and smart contracts, is now facing a bold contender, Borroe ($ROE), as the top 10 addresses control over 36% of Ethereum supply.&nbsp;</p>
Whales Circle as Borroe ($ROE) Presale Makes Waves
<p>Borroe Finance is an artificial intelligence, blockchain, and smart contracts-powered NFT marketplace that is rapidly reshaping the future of web3 financing. Borroe has a unique concept that merges cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world financial problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the presale of $ROE continues, investors are grabbing the opportunity to be part of this game-changing project. The current Stage 1 offers $ROE tokens at a low price of $0.0125 per token. With six more stages to come and incremental price increases, early participants can join the Borroe revolution at a pivotal moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the web3 space continues to flourish, Borroe Finance is a testament to the power of innovation, teamwork, and the unwavering belief that a brighter financial future is within reach.</p>
<p>Borroe Finance boasts a roster of experts with deep-rooted experience in the financial, fintech, and blockchain sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Price, the Chief Product Officer (CPO), brings over 25 years of leadership in the Financial Services domain, while Maxim Prishchepo, the Blockchain Lead, has an extensive background in blockchain technologies and crypto trading systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This powerhouse of visionaries is committed to revolutionizing how businesses access funding in the web3 era.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
$ROE: Powering the Borroe Revolution
<p>The $ROE token lies at the heart of Borroe Finance's transformative ecosystem. With a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens, $ROE operates on the Polygon (Ethereum sidechain) network, offering rapid transfers and scalability while maintaining the structural integrity of the Ethereum Mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the governance and utility token of the Borroe Ecosystem, $ROE grants holders many benefits, including priority notifications, discounted fees, access to premium features, rewards, and the power to shape the future of the Borroe marketplace through governance membership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a clear and innovative tokenomics structure, $ROE fuels Borroe's revolution and empowers investors to actively participate in shaping the web3 financing landscape.</p>
<p>A Point of Entry in a New Financial Frontier</p>
<p>Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain, Borroe allows businesses to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing future recurring revenues, all in exchange for immediate funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This innovative approach ensures a faster, more efficient way for businesses to secure the capital they need to thrive in the rapidly evolving web3 landscape. The brilliance of Borroe's AI-driven risk assessment is that it automates the entire process, reducing the need for cumbersome paperwork and lengthy approval timelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, Borroe Finance provides a seamless experience for both sellers and buyers, making it a game-changer in web3 financing. Borroe's smart contract has undergone a thorough audit by BlockAudit, a top-tier auditing firm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This stamp of approval demonstrates Borroe's commitment to security and reassures investors of the platform's reliability and integrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transparency extends to the smart contract address, which is live and available for scrutiny. This level of openness is a testament to Borroe's dedication to building trust within the community and ensuring that investors can confidently participate in the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its approach of seeking regulation where possible and adhering to best practices showcases a responsible approach to growth. By bridging the gap between traditional financial models and the web3 landscape, Borroe Finance has created a unique entry point for investors seeking opportunity and security.</p>
<p>Shifting Tides: Ethereum's Evolution Sparks Interest in $ROE</p>
<p>While Ethereum (ETH) has long been a staple in the crypto realm, recent developments in its Proof-of-Stake transition have stirred uncertainty within its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Santiment recently reported that Ethereum's top 10 addresses now control over 34% of the total supply. This highlights a potential centralization of ownership and influence within Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reacting to the update, savvy investors are turning their attention to Borroe Finance, an entire presale. The appeal lies in the unique opportunity Borroe presents, a marketplace that seamlessly marries AI, NFTs, and blockchain technology to reinvent web3 financing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the $ROE presale gains traction, investors recognize Borroe as more of a move towards a novel financial frontier, drawing attention away from the uncertainties surrounding Ethereum and taking advantage of a revolutionary platform promising outsized returns.</p>
<p>Investors are catching on to this trend, loading up on $ROE tokens in the presale. Analysts predict that $ROE is poised for a massive rally, with potential gains of 100X even amid the current market conditions. The market sentiment speaks volumes about investors' confidence in Borroe's vision and execution.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Sei Labs has just announced the launch of its Mainnet beta platform, seeking to facilitate the mass adoption of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
Sei Foundation Announces Mainnet Launch
<p>Open-sourced tech firm behind the Sei blockchain, Sei Labs, has just announced a significant milestone in its journey toward revolutionizing the digital asset landscape. Following a successful Testnet alpha phase that witnessed an impressive 400 million transactions and the creation of 7.5 million unique testnet wallets, Sei Labs has officially launched the Sei Mainnet beta phase.</p>
<p>The team tweeted the announcement on X,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This marks the beginning of an long voyage, transitioning web2 experiences to web3 applications, with lightning fast time to finality&hellip;The Sei Foundation looks forward to seeing the exciting new applications built using Sei's infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mainnet beta phase's core mission is to undergo refinement through active community engagement and to seamlessly accommodate industry growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notably, Sei isn't just limiting its impact to decentralized finance (DeFi) but extends its prowess to any sector requiring trading, including gaming economies, NFT marketplaces, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>
Scaling to Address Current Challenges
<p>As regulatory scrutiny mounts on centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized applications face the imperative of handling increased on-chain volume. Sei is seeking to provide a timely solution to the scalability challenges plaguing existing Layer 1 and Layer 2 infrastructures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform had taken a multi-faceted approach to decentralization, scalability, and capital efficiency, combined with geographical node diversification, to strengthen its resilience against potential network disruptions.</p>
<p>Sei Labs' co-founder Jeff Feng encapsulates the mission succinctly:</p>

<p>"Current Web 3 infrastructure is unscalable, congested, and still too slow. Sei is designed to let apps and other projects scale in a way that no other blockchain can, while also maintaining a user-friendly experience."&nbsp;</p>

Sei&rsquo;s Performance Optimization
<p>The platform has reported some unprecedented speed, with impressive time to finality clocking in at a mere 250ms, which is further enhanced by a 100ms buffer to ensure protocol stability. This speed is fortified by built-in parallelization, further optimizing its performance.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Sei Labs has just announced the launch of its Mainnet beta platform, seeking to facilitate the mass adoption of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
Sei Foundation Announces Mainnet Launch
<p>Open-sourced tech firm behind the Sei blockchain, Sei Labs, has just announced a significant milestone in its journey toward revolutionizing the digital asset landscape. Following a successful Testnet alpha phase that witnessed an impressive 400 million transactions and the creation of 7.5 million unique testnet wallets, Sei Labs has officially launched the Sei Mainnet beta phase.</p>
<p>The team tweeted the announcement on X,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This marks the beginning of an long voyage, transitioning web2 experiences to web3 applications, with lightning fast time to finality&hellip;The Sei Foundation looks forward to seeing the exciting new applications built using Sei's infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mainnet beta phase's core mission is to undergo refinement through active community engagement and to seamlessly accommodate industry growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notably, Sei isn't just limiting its impact to decentralized finance (DeFi) but extends its prowess to any sector requiring trading, including gaming economies, NFT marketplaces, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>
Scaling to Address Current Challenges
<p>As regulatory scrutiny mounts on centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized applications face the imperative of handling increased on-chain volume. Sei is seeking to provide a timely solution to the scalability challenges plaguing existing Layer 1 and Layer 2 infrastructures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform had taken a multi-faceted approach to decentralization, scalability, and capital efficiency, combined with geographical node diversification, to strengthen its resilience against potential network disruptions.</p>
<p>Sei Labs' co-founder Jeff Feng encapsulates the mission succinctly:</p>

<p>"Current Web 3 infrastructure is unscalable, congested, and still too slow. Sei is designed to let apps and other projects scale in a way that no other blockchain can, while also maintaining a user-friendly experience."&nbsp;</p>

Sei&rsquo;s Performance Optimization
<p>The platform has reported some unprecedented speed, with impressive time to finality clocking in at a mere 250ms, which is further enhanced by a 100ms buffer to ensure protocol stability. This speed is fortified by built-in parallelization, further optimizing its performance.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) has made a strategic investment in MoneyGram International, which resulted in obtaining a coveted seat on the firm&rsquo;s Board of Directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Building On A Strong Partnership
<p>The Stellar Development Foundation, responsible for expanding the Stellar network, announced a substantial investment in MoneyGram, a key player in the money transfer sector. This decision builds upon their existing commercial partnership, which was established two years ago. Although the SDF established a commercial partnership with MoneyGram in 2021, the two have collaborated on tools and technology since 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back then, MoneyGram joined forces with SDF to enable cryptocurrency payments and to introduce a cash-to-crypto service. Late last year, the payments firm announced plans to enable users to buy, sell, and hold crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>
Strategic Investment from SDF
<p>Denelle Dixon, the CEO and Executive Director of SDF, clarified in a recent blog post that the investment was made from the SDF's cash treasury, distinct from the Enterprise Fund, which typically supports startups and early-stage companies. This marks the first instance of such an investment being drawn from SDF's treasury. Dixon emphasized that this strategic move aligns with SDF&rsquo;s core mission and is a testament to MoneyGram's commitment to digital evolution.</p>
A Leap Towards Digital Advancement
<p>This investment is expected to bring about substantial benefits for both parties involved. MoneyGram, a prominent player in global financial technology, is set to expand its digital reach with the support of SDF's investment. Moreover, this collaboration will pave the way for the exploration of blockchain technology in the realm of money transfers.</p>
<p>Dixon highlighted the significance of this partnership by stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most importantly, it signifies a rededication from MGI, one of the world&rsquo;s leading global financial technology, to becoming a digital-forward leader in fintech.&rdquo;</p>

Gaining a Seat at the Table
<p>The most noteworthy outcome of this investment is SDF securing a seat on MoneyGram's Board of Directors. This move not only solidifies their partnership but also positions SDF to actively contribute to MoneyGram's strategic decisions and digital business expansion.</p>
<p>Although the exact amount of the investment remains undisclosed, Dixon affirmed that this collaboration underscores SDF's commitment to bridging the gap and democratizing access to financial services.</p>
<p>In her own words,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Continuing to build strong partnerships with organizations across the payments space puts SDF one step closer to achieving our mission of creating equitable access to financial services."</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>From October 1st onwards, PayPal will temporarily halt its cryptocurrency sales in the United Kingdom. This decision can be attributed to the shifting regulatory environment in the UK.</p>
<p>The underlying motive behind this suspension appears to be twofold. Firstly, it underscores PayPal&rsquo;s commitment to adhering strictly to local regulations. By suspending sales temporarily, the company is ensuring that it remains in compliance with the UK's dynamic regulatory framework on cryptocurrency transactions. This move demonstrates a precautionary measure to prevent any potential regulatory discord.</p>
<p>Secondly, the pause can be seen as a measure to safeguard users. As the UK refines its stance on crypto activities, there might be potential uncertainties and implications for users. By taking this proactive step, PayPal aims to shield its clientele from potential pitfalls and uncertainties until the regulatory landscape is clearer.</p>
<p>A significant driver behind these changes in the UK is the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The body has been proactive, focusing on establishing clearer guidelines and stricter regulations for cryptocurrency operations. The Authority&rsquo;s stated goal is to bring clarity to the sector, protect investors, and mitigate the inherent risks associated with digital assets.</p>
<p>In the US, PayPal has a lot more challenges on its plate. The recent supervisory letter issued by the Federal Reserve was a warning to banks that are doing business with crypto companies, or who are thinking of such a move. The letter reminds the banks of exactly what their due diligence entails, and adds that all Federal Reserve controlled banks must first gain permission from the Fed before engaging with any crypto-related entity.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The path to government control with central bank digital currencies is becoming clearer as cash is being stealthily removed by banks.</p>
ESG is the excuse
<p>Despite government saying that cash will be around for a very long time yet, steps are being taken to broaden our &ldquo;cashless society&rdquo;, as bank branches close and ATMs are being taken away.</p>
<p>So how are banks managing to get away with this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are seizing on the Environmental, Social, and Governance narrative (ESG) which has become de rigueur in Western society, and which has become a rallying cry for governments and big business looking to shut down anyone and anything that doesn&rsquo;t fit with their ideals.</p>
<p>For example, if someone goes to their local bank branch or ATM to withdraw cash it is being stated by banks that they are emitting carbon in their movement. The fact that if they weren&rsquo;t going to the bank they would be going somewhere else and still would be emitting carbon isn&rsquo;t discussed.</p>
<p>In addition the banks say that ATMs use a lot of electricity, plus if someone is making a deposit or withdrawing cash someone in the branch has to deal with this, thereby adding to more electricity and carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Is this all just nonsense, and is all this being used to justify the banks&rsquo; desire to eventually remove cash from society?</p>
NatWest sets cash limits
<p>NatWest, one of the biggest banks in the UK, coming under the umbrella of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which owns Coutts (Nigel Farage scandal), and other banks, has recently decided to give itself the right to set limits on customers&rsquo; deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>The bank hasn&rsquo;t yet said how much these limits will be, but Neil McCoy Ward who has a YouTube channel with 413,000 subscribers is surmising that the daily limit could be &pound;250. The limit is set to be imposed on September 11.</p>
Banks are closing all exits
<p>Banks are currently under a lot of pressure, not just in the UK but around the world. Three major banks have collapsed in the US, and Credit Suisse was recently taken over by UBS in Europe. If it were not for the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank the contagion would very likely have brought down the entire global banking system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments must know how shaky the fiat monetary system has become and therefore it appears they are giving banks carte blanche to do everything they can to stop customers from moving their funds.</p>
<p>Citizens are forced to own bank accounts if they want to be able to pay their bills etc. However, banks no longer provide any kind of service that would make up for customers&rsquo; depreciation of purchasing power, inflation, and the possibility that their bank might fail and decide to bail them in.</p>
<p>Central planners are starting to close all the exits from the fiat monetary system at the same time as banks increase their power and control over customers. Bitcoin is completely outside of this dystopian nightmare. The world&rsquo;s citizens may want to investigate this option before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee are demanding that SEC Chair Gary Gensler explain how Prometheum got approval from the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawmakers have petitioned both financial regulators for more information regarding the company&rsquo;s registration status.&nbsp;</p>
Republicans Demand Answers&nbsp;
<p>The Republican lawmakers on the Financial Services Committee, led by Chairman Patrick McHenry, have questioned how the previously unknown entity was able to beat other, more established entities to obtain approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a broker-dealer for crypto. The members have directed their inquiries to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a letter signed by 23 House Financial Services Lawmakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several questions have been raised regarding the context of Prometheum&rsquo;s approval, especially since the approval came shortly after a joint hearing held by the House Financial Committee and the House Agriculture Committee on digital assets. The letter stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The timing of the approval raises concerns that it was aimed at demonstrating that legislation is not needed because there is a workable regulatory framework for the custody of digital asset securities.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

A Play By Gensler?&nbsp;
<p>The letter has also flagged serious concerns about whether the Securities and Exchange Commission put Prometheum up as a poster firm to shore up SEC Chair Cary Gensler&rsquo;s argument that no new laws were required to regulate the crypto space in the United States. The approval comes just before McHenry&rsquo;s committee is about to send the digital assets legislation to the house floor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Prometheum executives have insisted there is nothing to be surprised about regarding the approval. They added that they followed the registration process step-by-step, just like other firms looking for approval. Prometheum&rsquo;s co-CEO, Aaron Kaplan, has also insisted that the firm would go about demonstrating the right way to build a crypto platform that is also fully compliant with current laws and regulations. In response to the letter, the company released a statement, responding,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prometheum purpose-built its technology with the goal to develop a market infrastructure for digital asset securities that is compliant with the federal securities laws. This technology will serve as a building block for a compliant and orderly digital asset securities marketplace that protects investors and serves their best interests.&rdquo;</p>

Lawmakers Wary Of Prometheum&nbsp;
<p>The Republican lawmakers are the latest to call for more information and an investigation into the sudden approval of Prometheum, a company that has not done any trading as yet. Several other Republican members of the Senate have called for greater scrutiny of the prevailing situation. Republican lawmaker Thomas Tuberville has alleged that the company may have provided false testimony to Congress or violated several US Securities Laws. Meanwhile, Democrat lawmaker Ritchie Torres has requested an investigation of the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>
Prometheum&rsquo;s China Connection&nbsp;
<p>Prometheum has previously collaborated with the Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain Inc. to develop a blockchain trading software, a point that has been noted by lawmakers. While the collaboration has been concluded, reports have highlighted the involvement of a Chinese firm during Prometheum&rsquo;s early days. According to several reports, a Chinese entity owns a portion of the company and even has a representative, Feng Ziao, as a director at Prometheum. Lawmakers have also pointed to the connection between Wanxiang and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has led to significant concerns about national security and data privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kaplan&rsquo;s posts on social media have also garnered considerable attention. Kaplan&rsquo;s views closely align with that of the Securities and Exchange Commission and differ from those taken by crypto-space members. Kaplan has insisted that existing Federal Securities Laws are sufficient to regulate crypto. Kaplan and other top executives at Prometheum&rsquo;s connections with the Securities and Exchange Commission and FINRA have also been discussed.</p>

Lawmakers have also pointed to the connection between Wanxiang and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has led to significant concerns about national security and data privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kaplan&rsquo;s posts on social media have also garnered considerable attention. Kaplan&rsquo;s views closely align with that of the Securities and Exchange Commission and differ from those taken by crypto-space members. Kaplan has insisted that existing Federal Securities Laws are sufficient to regulate crypto. Kaplan and other top executives at Prometheum&rsquo;s connections with the Securities and Exchange Commission and FINRA have also been discussed.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>GSR, the oldest market maker in the crypto space, is feeling the full impact of the ongoing bear market, with multiple top executives, including the CFO, departing the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company had also announced a staff cut in October 2022, terming them as a part of &ldquo;structural changes&rdquo; in the organization.&nbsp;</p>
Top Executives Depart&nbsp;
<p>As crypto&rsquo;s largest market maker retreats in the face of the bear market onslaught, several high-level executives, including C-level and department heads, are headed toward the exit. According to sources, the retrenchment is having a major impact on one of the industry&rsquo;s oldest and best-known players and one that is extremely prominent in the US markets. The most recent and maybe the most high-profile departure from the firm is its Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan Hugh. Hugh joined GSR in 2021 and played a pivotal role in building the company&rsquo;s finance function. Hugh has so far not commented on his departure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other high-level executives leaving the company include GSR&rsquo;s Global Head of Product, Benoit Bosc, and its Director of Trading Operations, Aman Bhalla. Bosc had taken over the sales role from Michael Bressler, a highly experienced TradeFi executive from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Bressler had joined GSR in 2021, becoming the company&rsquo;s sales head in 2021. However, Bressler left the firm in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
Other Notable Departures&nbsp;
<p>Other notable departures from the company include Jake Dwyer. Dwyer had joined the firm in 2021 and was tasked with leading GSR&rsquo;s DeFi and venture initiatives. Trader Quentin Dubois and the head of Quant Trading, Romain Bernard, have also exited the company, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Director of Business Development at GSR, Jeff Stern, has also left the organization. All of these departures occurred this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Dwyer confirmed his departure from GSR, the others, including Bhalla, Bosc, Vince, Barnard, and Dubois, have not commented on the matter. A spokesperson from GSR commented on the matter, stating that the company will look to evolve with the fast-moving crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;GSR has been at the center of crypto markets for ten years &mdash; markets that are fast-moving and volatile. We owe it to our clients to continue adapting and evolving to keep pace with the speed of crypto, and we will continue to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spokesperson also confirmed the departures of Bosc and Bhalla. However, they added that they will continue in their respective roles until the end of August and ensure a smooth transition of their respective roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our business operations and strategy have naturally evolved to respond to changing market conditions, but there has been no restructuring.&rdquo;</p>

Crypto Winter Takes Its Toll&nbsp;
<p>GSR had laid off around 10% of its workforce in October 2022, adding that the layoffs were part of structural changes. In doing so, the company became the latest in a long line of crypto firms that had to curtail their growth and ambitions in the face of a crippling crypto winter. Companies and exchanges operating have sanctioned a wave of layoffs as they look to navigate the crypto bear market. The firm had undertaken an aggressive expansion drive, growing its workforce to over 200 and reaching a peak of 300 before the layoffs took place. A source familiar with the firm and its operations stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The executive team is mostly friends, and I think it threw off a lot of the momentum GSR built in the previous cycle. They hired a lot of corporate Wall Street executives that came in at the top of the bull market, which ended up costing the firm dearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the c-suite executives have links with Winton, CEO Jacob Palmstierna&rsquo;s former employer, or Goldman Sachs, the former employer of Rich Rosenblum and Cristian Gil. Staff at GSR believes that the firm got too big too soon and the team needs to be better streamlined. A GSR spokesperson stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While last year&rsquo;s bear market created challenges for all crypto companies, our long-term belief in the space hasn&rsquo;t changed. We have continued investing and hiring in high-conviction areas and have maintained a world-class team of TradFi and DeFi talent that is uniquely positioned for another decade of growth.&rdquo;</p>

Scaling Back US Operations&nbsp;
<p>The firm is also focusing on scaling back its US operations. Multiple sources have attributed the retreat to a combination of a number of factors. These include a decreasing appetite for token listings, a high cost of talent acquisition, and concerns around regulations. According to a source, the company has also moved from its New York office, taking up a space in Jersey City instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At one point, it was probably their largest office, and they have been scaling it down meaningfully. They have given up their New York office and have a smaller space in Jersey City.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Binance is reportedly shutting down its regulated fiat-to-crypto platform, Binance Connect. The platform will reportedly shut down today, 16 August. </p>
<p>Binance&rsquo;s regulated buy-and-sell crypto arm, Binance Connect, will reportedly shut down today. Reports by Cointelegraph broke the news saying the news had been confirmed in an email with a Binance spokesperson.</p>
Binance Connect to Shut Down
<p>Binance Connect, the regulated fiat-to-crypto platform of Binance, will shut down operations on 16 August. Formerly known as Bitfinity, the platform supported over 50 cryptocurrencies and fiat card payments such as Mastercard and Visa. The platform launched in March 2022.</p>
<p>BNB Chain-based decentralised exchange Biswap tweeted on the day the news broke that Binance &ldquo;has made a difficult decision to disable Binance Connect on 15 August due to its provider closing the supporting card payments service.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Biswappers,The Biswap team keeps abreast of the latest DeFi news and aims to inform you right away.After a thorough consideration, @binance has made a difficult decision to disable @Binance_Connect on 15 August due to its provider closing the supporting card payments&hellip; pic.twitter.com/HcooyLn4sg</p>

</p>
<p>The Binance spokesperson who confirmed the shutdown said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Binance, we periodically review our products and services to ensure that our resources continue to be focused on core efforts that align with our long-term strategy.</p>
<p>In the last six years, Binance has grown from being an exchange to a global blockchain ecosystem with multiple business lines. We consistently adapt and modify our business approach in response to changing market and user needs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Binance Connect aimed to be the official fiat-to-crypto on-ramp between the exchange and blockchain-based platforms.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Crypto media outlet CoinDesk has cut its editorial staff by 45% as its parent company DCG prepares to introduce strategic investors. </p>
<p>Rumours that DCG is negotiating a sale of its crypto media outlet CoinDesk have been circulating for a while. Reports by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) claim that the crypto conglomerate was reportedly finalizing a $125 million deal to sell a portion of the company. DCG would reportedly retain a stake in the company.</p>
CoinDesk Announced Staff Cuts
<p>Reports by crypto news outlet The Block claim that CoinDesk let go of 45% of its editorial staff as its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), prepares for a partial sale of the company. DCG purchased CoinDesk in 2016 for $500,000. The company was established in 2013.</p>
<p>In an internal memo viewed by The Block, the firm was soon to have an &ldquo;all-hands&rdquo; meeting to discuss the layoffs.</p>
<p>In an email, Kevin Worth, CoinDesk CEO, told staff:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The purpose of the meeting is to inform everyone that today several roles, predominantly in our media team, were impacted by a reduction in force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an incredibly difficult message to send to everyone over email and yet I also wanted everyone at CoinDesk to know as soon as possible what is happening today. This was a required step to ensure a financially sound business moving forward and to set us on the path to close the deal to sell CoinDesk Inc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to The Block&rsquo;s report, which cites someone familiar with the matter, CoinDesk would let go of 45% of its editorial team or 20 people.</p>
DCG Will Retain a Stake in CoinDesk
<p>CoinDesk recently appointed financial advisers to &ldquo;help bring on new institutional and strategic investors&rdquo; alongside its parent company. DCG has faced severe pressure from crypto exchange Gemini over a dispute involving the &ldquo;Earn&rdquo; program. In July, Gemini announced that it had filed a lawsuit against DCG.</p>
<p>The reports from the WSJ indicated CoinDesk was in the final stages of a partial sale of the company to a crypto syndicate led by crypto investor Matthew Roszak of Tally Capital. As part of the $125 million deal, DCG would retain a share of CoinDesk.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Coinbase has announced its official entry into the Canadian market in a strategic move that involved the integration of Interac payment rails.&nbsp;</p>
Expanding Horizons: Canada as a Crypto Hub
<p>On Monday, Coinbase executives Nana Murugesan and newly-appointed Lucas Matheson penned a joint announcement declaring Coinbase's decision to venture into Canada's crypto landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statement also addressed the various factors why Canada was chosen as the next Coinbase outpost, calling it the world's third-most crypto-aware nation, with a thriving local tech ecosystem that firmly positions it as a potential global leader in the crypto-economy. The duo pulled up the Ontario Securities Commission's survey highlights, which revealed that over 30% of Canadians are gearing up to explore crypto assets within the year.</p>
Pioneering Innovations for Canadians
<p>According to the statement, Coinbase will be presenting a slew of innovative offerings to cater to the Canadian market. The integration of Interac payment rails takes center stage as it would enable Canadian users to effortlessly deposit and withdraw funds (CAD) to and from their Coinbase wallets in an attempt to make the crypto experience more accessible to Canadians.</p>
<p>They also revealed the launch of Coinbase One, which is being touted to feature benefits like a 30-day trial period, zero trading fees, enhanced staking rewards, and priority support.&nbsp;</p>
Coinbase Appoints New Canada Director
<p>In March 2023, Coinbase appointed Lucas Matheson as the Country Director for Canada. Matheson, who has experience leading operation and financial teams, will be focusing on Coinbase&rsquo;s offerings for Canadians by working with partners, government, and regulators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the regulatory front, the company has also signed an Enhanced Pre-Registration Undertaking in order to highlight its dedication to regulatory compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firm has almost 200 full-time employees at the Canadian tech hub, thus making the most of local talent and fostering a user-centric platform tailored to Canadian citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Other Crypto Firms In Canada
<p>Other leading crypto firms have also turned to Canada, especially in the wake of growing regulatory uncertainty in the United States. Crypto exchange Kraken has demonstrated its commitment to Canada's financial sector by signing a pre-registration undertaking (PRU) with the Ontario Securities Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a few of them, like Binance and ByBit, have had to wrap up their Canada operations, citing an unfavorable regulatory climate in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, Coinbase's official launch in Canada, backed by Interac payment integration, Coinbase One, and a strong commitment to local engagement, ushers in a new chapter in Canada's crypto journey. This move is a testament to Coinbase's unwavering dedication to fostering financial empowerment through innovative crypto solutions.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Polygon and Solana are two of DeFi&rsquo;s most popular altcoins. In 2023, both projects have grown their ecosystems, with Solana taking a slight lead over Polygon in terms of market cap. Now, however, a new cryptocurrency could outperform both.</p>
<p>Everlodge is a new DeFi project set to release in 2023. It has revolutionary utility and could offer returns of 280% during its presale. Here&rsquo;s why analysts are choosing Everlodge over Polygon and Solana.</p>
<p class="s6">Find Out How To Buy Everlodge (ELDG)</p>
Everlodge Brings Travel Properties To Web3 
<p>Everlodge is a DeFi property marketplace designed for luxury villas, vacation homes, and hotels. Its marketplace lets individuals buy, sell and invest in fractional real estate on the blockchain. To achieve this, a property is minted into an NFT and fractionalized.</p>
<p>For example, A $2 million luxury villa in Spain could be fractionalized into 20 fragments. Each can then be purchased or sold for $200,000, reducing the amount an investor needs for their investment.</p>
<p>Everlodge will also offer a launchpad designed for property developers. This launchpad will let developers raise capital from the Everlodge community to kick-start developments. Investors will then profit from getting involved in developments early to maximize their returns.</p>
<p>In addition to its launchpad and property marketplace, Everlodge will offer an exclusive rewards club. As part of the rewards club, investors will earn free nightly stays across properties throughout the Everlodge ecosystem. Several tiers will be available and will determine the properties and number of stays an individual gets. Members aren&rsquo;t obliged to use this timehowever. Instead, it can be sold on third-party platforms such as Airbnb to generate another income source.</p>
<p>Investors who co-own properties will be able to use their NFT as collateral to obtain other short term loans. This will give them access to more capital to quickly scale their property portfolio.</p>
<p>ELDG tokens will be used throughout the Everlodge ecosystem. They will grant holders a number of benefits such as staking bonuses, discounts on property and free stays at properties. Tokens will start at $0.01 when the Everlodge presale begins, and are expected to hit $0.035 before tokens are launched on mainstream exchanges.</p>
Experts Predict That Solana Will Pass $30 
<p>Solana&rsquo;s total value locked has consistently increased since the start of 2023. Over the last month, Solana&rsquo;s TVL has stayed above $1 billion. This indicates that confidence in Solana is starting to build following the project's crash in June.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Solana&rsquo;s value has also increased. In the last 30 days, Solana has increased in value by 22.44%. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $23.59. Given its steady increase, experts believe that Solana will pass $30 in August.</p>
Confidence In Polygon Remains High Despite POL Proposal
<p>Polygon&rsquo;s price increases slowed over the last week after Polygon founders proposed an upgrade to Polygon's native token. This proposal has caused Polygon to decrease in value by 2.24%, andcreated confusion throughout the Polygon community.</p>
<p>The development team has proposed replacing MATIC tokens with POL. This new token would be used throughout the Polygon network, though investors are questioning why the upgrade needs to be made.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, confidence in Polygon continues to rise. PancakeSwap recently launched its v3 on the Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta, which is a huge win for the Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p>Currently trading at $0.6897, analysts believe that Polygon will increase to $1 by the end of the year. Despite this increase, experts still predict that Everlodge will be a more profitable investment.</p>

                    <description>
                        <![CDATA[<p class="s5">Amidst the wavering performance of well-known Memecoins such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), Pomerdoge (POMD) emerges as a fresh attraction. Currently, in its presale phase, Pomerdoge is quickly becoming the new memeCoin magnet, demonstrating the unending appetite for new ventures in the dynamic cryptocurrency market. Let's take a closer look.</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Pomerdoge (DOGE): Early Adopters and The Race to Buy POMD
<p class="s5">Pomerdoge is breaking new ground in the meme cryptocurrency arena, coupling the allure of meme culture with a dynamic play-to-earn gaming environment and a sound token structure. Although it bears some resemblance to Shiba Inu as an Ethereum-based meme coin, Pomerdoge's appeal lies in its unique offerings.</p>
<p class="s5">At the heart of Pomerdoge's distinctiveness is an integrated ecosystem, featuring an engaging P2E gaming platform and a bustling marketplace called Pomerplace. The gaming platform enables players from across the globe to compete and earn rewards, while Pomerplace provides a vibrant hub for trading in-game assets.</p>
<p class="s5">The driving force behind this multifaceted universe is the POMD token. Not just a means of exchange, POMD unlocks various rewards and special functionalities within the platform, which promotes user loyalty and sustainable growth for the project.</p>
<p class="s5">Financial pundits are forecasting an astonishing 5,000% surge in Pomerdoge's value come 2024. This is, in part, due to the current low price of $0.07 during the first phase of the presale.</p>
<p class="s5">By joining the presale, early adopters can cement their position in what promises to be an exciting new chapter in the world of meme cryptocurrencies. More than 100 million POMDtokens have already been purchased, and the number is increasing daily.</p>
Pitting Shiba Inu (SHIB)'s Limited Utility Against Pomerdoge(POMD)'s Offerings
<p class="s5">Shiba Inu burst onto the cryptocurrency scene with a bang as it tried to topple Dogecoin as the biggest meme coin. Shiba Inu has been a wild ride since then, with its value shooting up and crashing back down multiple times in the span of a few months.</p>
<p class="s5">Shiba Inu is now trading 88% below its all-time high at just $0.00001030. The euphoria and frenzy that once surrounded Shiba Inu seem to have dimmed, primarily because its intrinsic value appeared limited. Shiba Inu lacked a clear utility beyond being just a meme, rendering it no different from Dogecoin.</p>
<p class="s5">This is in stark contrast to Pomerdoge, which offers both a meme coin and an array of practical uses. As the Shiba Inu craze subsides, many investors are turning their attention towards Pomerdoge &mdash; a new and exciting project that offers investors the best of both worlds.</p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): Analyzing the Shift in Investor Interest
<p class="s5">The crypto realm is currently under a bearish spell, and Dogecoin is taking the brunt of it. Dogecoin is now a whopping 90% under its 2021 peak of $0.79, with a 2% decline in the last 24 hours alone.</p>
<p class="s5">Dogecoin may not tout cutting-edge technology, but it boasts a position within the top 20 coins on CoinMarketCap, largely thanks to its humorous origin and loyal following of supporters.</p>
<p class="s5">However, this lack of utility limits just how high Dogecoin can go. Analysts predict that Dogecon will continue to range in the tight trading window of $0.050 to $0.010 in the near term. It seems Dogecoin might have to wait in the wings for the next altcoin surge to steal the spotlight.</p>
<p class="s5">In comparison, Pomerdoge is now emerging as the new shining star within meme coins. As evidenced by the sale of 100 million tokens already, Pomerdoge is not affected by the current bearish market trends that have weighed down on Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.</p>

<p class="s5">Financial pundits are forecasting an astonishing 5,000% surge in Pomerdoge's value come 2024. This is, in part, due to the current low price of $0.07 during the first phase of the presale.</p>
<p class="s5">By joining the presale, early adopters can cement their position in what promises to be an exciting new chapter in the world of meme cryptocurrencies. More than 100 million POMDtokens have already been purchased, and the number is increasing daily.</p>
Pitting Shiba Inu (SHIB)'s Limited Utility Against Pomerdoge(POMD)'s Offerings
<p class="s5">Shiba Inu burst onto the cryptocurrency scene with a bang as it tried to topple Dogecoin as the biggest meme coin. Shiba Inu has been a wild ride since then, with its value shooting up and crashing back down multiple times in the span of a few months.</p>
<p class="s5">Shiba Inu is now trading 88% below its all-time high at just $0.00001030. The euphoria and frenzy that once surrounded Shiba Inu seem to have dimmed, primarily because its intrinsic value appeared limited. Shiba Inu lacked a clear utility beyond being just a meme, rendering it no different from Dogecoin.</p>
<p class="s5">This is in stark contrast to Pomerdoge, which offers both a meme coin and an array of practical uses. As the Shiba Inu craze subsides, many investors are turning their attention towards Pomerdoge &mdash; a new and exciting project that offers investors the best of both worlds.</p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): Analyzing the Shift in Investor Interest
<p class="s5">The crypto realm is currently under a bearish spell, and Dogecoin is taking the brunt of it. Dogecoin is now a whopping 90% under its 2021 peak of $0.79, with a 2% decline in the last 24 hours alone.</p>
<p class="s5">Dogecoin may not tout cutting-edge technology, but it boasts a position within the top 20 coins on CoinMarketCap, largely thanks to its humorous origin and loyal following of supporters.</p>
<p class="s5">However, this lack of utility limits just how high Dogecoin can go. Analysts predict that Dogecon will continue to range in the tight trading window of $0.050 to $0.010 in the near term. It seems Dogecoin might have to wait in the wings for the next altcoin surge to steal the spotlight.</p>
<p class="s5">In comparison, Pomerdoge is now emerging as the new shining star within meme coins. As evidenced by the sale of 100 million tokens already, Pomerdoge is not affected by the current bearish market trends that have weighed down on Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is in the news once again after a recent development revealed that he had allegedly used stolen customer funds to donate over $100 million to political campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
FTX Founder's Troubles Deepen
<p>Federal prosecutors have filed a fresh indictment against Bankman-Fried, charging him with seven counts of conspiracy and fraud related to the collapse of his crypto exchange. According to the indictment, Bankman-Fried contributed over $100 million of funds stolen from customer accounts on the FTX exchange to donate to political campaigns in the run-up to the 2022 U.S. midterm elections to influence softer crypto legislations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange is already under legal scrutiny over charges of pilfering billions in FTX customer funds to offset losses at Alameda Research, his crypto-focused hedge fund.&nbsp;</p>
Political Leanings And Opaque Donations
<p>The 31-year-old entrepreneur, who previously pleaded not guilty to the initial charges, is now confronted with new allegations that he misappropriated customer funds for political donations.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried reportedly made substantial political donations in 2022, with a CBS News analysis suggesting the figure exceeded $40 million. Although the majority of these contributions were made to Democratic candidates and causes, he stated that Bankman-Fried had also supported Republicans through undisclosed "dark" donations.</p>
Lobbying Efforts And Hidden Agendas
<p>The indictment highlights Bankman-Fried's alleged use of FTX's influence and connections to push for cryptocurrency-friendly regulations. He purportedly directed fellow FTX executives to make donations aimed at circumventing contribution limits, with the goal of supporting legislation that would enable FTX to continue accepting customer deposits and growing its operations.</p>
<p>The indictment claims that Bankman-Fried orchestrated the donations in a covert manner, transferring funds from FTX's sister trading firm, Alameda, to the personal bank accounts of FTX executives. These executives would then make donations under their own names, evading restrictions on certain political contributions and enhancing FTX's political clout.</p>
Legal Maneuvering And Upcoming Trial
<p>While prosecutors initially charged Bankman-Fried with violating U.S. campaign finance laws, they later dropped this charge in light of the Bahamas' refusal to extradite him on that basis. Despite this setback, prosecutors have indicated their intention to file a new indictment that would clarify the allegations of an illegal campaign finance scheme as part of the broader fraud and money laundering charges.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ordered Bankman-Fried's incarceration prior to his scheduled trial on October 2. The decision was made based on probable cause to believe that he tampered with witnesses on two occasions. Previously confined to his parents' home in Palo Alto, California, on a $250 million bond, Bankman-Fried now faces a more restrictive situation in the lead-up to his trial.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust and some affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday. </p>
<p>Las Vegas-based cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this week after Nevada regulators placed it into receivership in June.</p>
Prime Trust Records Significant Deficit on Its Books
<p>Nevada&rsquo;s Financial Institutions Division (NFID) placed crypto custodian Prime Trust into receivership, took control of the business, and froze its operations and businesses. Regulators decided to step in after it determined the company was insolvent and could not serve its customers.</p>
<p>Prime Trust said in a filing that it has between 25,000 to 50,000 creditors and estimates its liabilities to be between $100 million and $500 million. The firm added its assets are worth $50 million to $100 million.</p>
<p>The Chapter 11 filing indicates John Guedry, the former president of the Bank of Nevada, will act as a receiver and lead the restructuring committee. Judge Susan Johnson of the Eighth Judicial Court of the State of Nevada will oversee the bankruptcy proceedings. Prime Trust will continue in their role as &ldquo;debtors-in-possession&rdquo; under the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing its bankruptcy, Prime Trust said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Company, under the supervision and direction of the Special Committee, continues to manage their businesses as &ldquo;debtors-in-possession&rdquo; under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It added,</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Company intends to file a number of motions with the Bankruptcy Court designed to facilitate the Company&rsquo;s orderly evaluation of all strategic alternatives, including potentially a sale of the Company&rsquo;s assets and operations as a going concern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Regulators claim Prime Trust misused customer funds to pay withdrawals since December 2021 after the firm lost access to several customer crypto wallets.</p>
<p>Prime&rsquo;s voluntary bankruptcy filing comes as no surprise. In a press statement, the NFID commented on its decision to place the firm under receivership:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Nevada Financial Institutions Division (&ldquo;NFID&rdquo;) was actively monitoring the solvency of Prime Trust, LLC (&ldquo;Prime&rdquo;) in anticipation of a potential acquisition or merger.&nbsp;Ultimately, Prime failed to safeguard assets under its custody and cannot meet all client withdrawals. As such, Prime has breached its fiduciary duties to its clients, in violation of Nevada trust laws. NFID&rsquo;s primary objective is to preserve any enterprise value remaining in Prime for the benefit of Prime&rsquo;s clients.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several of the company&rsquo;s affiliates, including Prime Core Technologies Inc., Prime Trust, LLC, Prime IRA LLC and Prime Digital LLC, also filed for bankruptcy relief.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Singapore&rsquo;s central bank has announced the release of a revised regulatory framework to ensure stability for single-currency stablecoins regulated in the city-state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The framework outlines requirements that issuers need to meet to be deemed as regulated by the monetary authority of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
Better Regulatory Clarity&nbsp;
<p>The revised framework was announced on the 15th of August and is primarily aimed at non-bank issued stablecoins that are pegged to the value of the Singapore Dollar, or G10 currencies, including the British Pound, Euro, and the United States Dollar, and whose circulation is greater than 5 million Singapore Dollars. The Monetary Authority of Singapore stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stablecoins are digital payment tokens designed to maintain a constant value against one or more specified fiat currencies. When well-regulated to preserve such value stability, stablecoins can serve as a trusted medium of exchange to support innovation, including the &ldquo;on-chain&rdquo; purchase and sale of digital assets. MAS&rsquo; stablecoin regulatory framework will apply to single-currency stablecoins (SCS) pegged to the Singapore Dollar or any G10 currency that is issued in Singapore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the Singapore central bank&rsquo;s financial supervision deputy managing director, Ho Hern Shin, the framework helps to establish and facilitate stablecoin use as a credible digital medium of exchange and a bridge between the traditional and digital currency ecosystems. Shin also urged stablecoin issuers to prepare for compliance if they wished for their stablecoin to be labeled as regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Framework&nbsp;
<p>The revised regulatory framework lists several requirements for stablecoin issuers. These include redemption timelines, reserve management, disclosures, and capital requirements. According to the MAS, reserve assets will be subject to requirements depending on their valuation, composition, custody, and audit. Stablecoin issuers will also have to maintain a minimum base capital and liquid assets to stave off any risk of insolvency. Stablecoin issuers will also be required to return the par value of the stablecoins to holders within five business days following a redemption request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore also observed that only those issuers who could fulfill the revised requirements could apply to be regulated by the MAS. According to the country&rsquo;s central bank, this label would help distinguish regulated stablecoins from non-regulated ones in the market. It also warned that those representing a token or stablecoin to be certified by the Monetary Authority of Singapore would also be subject to penalties defined in the new framework. The penalties include prison time, fines, as well as the addition on an alert list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Penny Chai, VP of Business Development for Sumsub in APAC, reiterates the importance of crypto businesses prioritizing AML compliance processes:</p>
<p>"Singapore's aim to establish comprehensive regulations for stablecoins is a significant step towards fostering a secure and transparent digital currency environment - the move sets a noteworthy example for other jurisdictions. Stablecoins have surpassed $100 billion in market value, according to&nbsp;recent reports, therefore the need for regulatory clarity is paramount as the market continues to grow.Failing to adhere to this regulation could potentially result in fraudulent activities due to the inability to identify suspicious users, leading to financial penalties and substantial reputational harm for cryptocurrency businesses operating in Singapore and broader markets, APAC and further beyond. Companies must prioritise establishing crypto transaction monitoring tools and comprehensive AML compliance and verification procedures, both during the onboarding process and beyond."</p>
Attempts At Regulating Stablecoins
<p>The revised framework takes into account feedback from a public consultation held in October 2022. However, the MAS will still need to hold consultations, while parliament would need to pass amendments to enforce the revised framework. The MAS highlighted the risks involved in investing in crypto last year following the collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) and Luna tokens. The United States is also looking to pass regulations regarding stablecoins. The United States House Financial Services Committee had recently proposed a bill that would establish a federal regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill proposes that the United States Federal Reserve draw up requirements for the issuance of stablecoins while maintaining the authority of state regulators. The bill was modified after several democrats raised concerns that stablecoin issuers could simply bypass stricter federal oversight by opting to be regulated by state regulatory authorities.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius received permission to seek creditor approval for its proposed bankruptcy plan. </p>
<p>According to reports by Bloomberg and Reuters, bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network was granted permission by a US bankruptcy judge to send its proposed bankruptcy plan to its creditors. Celsius&rsquo; proposed strategy will see it exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy as an entity its creditors own.</p>
Creditors Have Sufficient Information to Vote on Bankruptcy Plan
<p>On Monday, during a US Bankruptcy Court hearing in Manhattan, Judge Martin Glenn approved Celsius&rsquo;s disclosure agreement and solicitation material, noting the firm had provided creditors with enough information to vote on its bankruptcy proposal.</p>
<p>Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2022, leaving customers with uncertainty over the outcome of their funds. The firm reached two settlements in July which will allow the lender to exit bankruptcy proceedings and return customer assets. In addition to its proposed bankruptcy plan, a confirmation hearing is scheduled for October to deal with Celsius&rsquo; reorganization plan. If all goes well, customers may see disbursements of their assets before the end of the year.</p>
<p>When Celsius filed for bankruptcy, it had 600,000 customers who invested around $4.4 billion in interest-bearing Celsius accounts.</p>
Fahrenheit Group to Take Control of Remaining Business Lines
<p>Under Celsius&rsquo; bankruptcy plan, retail customers will receive some crypto deposits, and the Fahrenheit Group will take over the lender remaining business line, including bitcoin mining and staking. The Fahrenheit consortium recently won the bid to acquire Celsius.</p>
<p>The lender suggests that most of its customers with interest-bearing Earn accounts will receive a 67% recovery. The recovery will consist of the return of liquid crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ether, equity shares in the new entity, and proceeds from the litigation against Celsius&rsquo; founder Alex Mashinsky and other executives.</p>
<p>Mashinsky was arrested and sued by US regulators and charged with seven counts of securities, commodities, and wire fraud, as well as a conspiracy charge to manipulate the lender&rsquo;s native token, $CEL.</p>
<p>During an appearance in federal court, Mashinsky pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.</p>
<p>The lender&rsquo;s creditors have until September 20 to submit votes on the proposal.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The SEC has taken decisive action against Crowe U.K. LLP, a pro-crypto London-based audit firm over the auditing of music streaming service Akazoo.</p>
<p>The firm's CEO, Nigel Bostock, and senior auditor, Matthew Stallabrass, who advocate for wider crypto adoption, have also been implicated for their roles in a flawed audit of the music streaming entity, Akazoo Limited. All parties involved have opted for a settlement with the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
Akazoo revenue overstated
<p>Diving into the details, the SEC's findings reveal that Crowe U.K. had given Akazoo's 2018 financial statements a clean bill of health. However, post Akazoo's public debut in 2019 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition entity, discrepancies emerged.</p>
<p>Akazoo's 2018 financial records boasted a whopping $120 million in revenue, a figure that was later debunked, revealing only trivial revenue figures. The SEC's probe highlighted that Crowe U.K.'s audit team lacked the requisite experience and training in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The oversight became evident when the team missed glaring warning signs, such as accepting fabricated agreements and dubious confirmation letters from Akazoo without the necessary scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
Failings and penalties
<p>The SEC's findings also spotlighted the roles of Bostock and Stallabrass. Bostock, as the lead for the Akazoo audit, was found lacking in his supervisory duties, documentation, and professional care. On the other hand, Stallabrass, responsible for reviewing the audit's quality, failed to conduct a comprehensive review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eric Werner, the Regional Director of the Fort Worth Regional Office, commented on the situation, emphasising the role of Crowe U.K. in lending an unwarranted legitimacy to Akazoo, facilitating its entry into the public trading arena. He stressed the SEC's commitment to holding such gatekeepers accountable to prevent financial deceptions from infiltrating public markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the settlement, without admitting to any wrongdoing, Crowe U.K., Bostock, and Stallabrass have agreed to pay penalties amounting to $750,000, $25,000, and $10,000, respectively. They've also committed to refraining from any future violations related to the Exchange Act and Regulation S-X. Additionally, Crowe U.K. will voluntarily withdraw its PCAOB registration and introduce measures concerning new client acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Bostock and Stallabrass face suspensions from practising before the SEC as accountants, with potential reinstatements after five and two years, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has included crypto in its annual risk review for the first time, stating that crypto presents key risks and that it needs closer supervision.</p>
FDIC seeks more control over crypto companies
<p>The crypto industry may not be entirely happy with being closely supervised by the likes of the FDIC given that it came about as an alternative to a slow-moving banking system that does not provide a helpful service to clients.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the FDIC has the reins of power and will do what it will do in order to try and bring crypto under the control of regulators that are regulating on behalf of the incumbent system.</p>
<p>Banks are already working with crypto institutions, and others are contemplating such a move. Therefore, in collaboration with its fellow federal banking entities the FDIC has stated in its report that it is ready to delve further into how banks are getting involved in crypto, and with this knowledge provide full supervisory guidance.</p>
Perceived risks to banks
<p>In its report the FDIC talks of the &ldquo;dynamic nature of crypto-assets&rdquo;, and their &ldquo;rapid pace of innovation&rdquo;. The main risks for the banking sector, as perceived by the FDIC is the possibility of &ldquo;contagion&rdquo; which could spread over into banks with exposure to the sector, and also the &ldquo;run risk&rdquo; for banks that hold stablecoin reserves.</p>
<p>The report went on to specify that all FDIC supervised banks must notify the agency of any crypto related activities that they have or that they are planning to engage in. Examples were then given of firms that had made misleading claims as to the eligibility of FDIC insurance for certain crypto-assets. The report ended with what the authors saw as &ldquo;heightened liquidity risks&rdquo; due to what they saw as the &ldquo;unpredictability&rdquo; of deposit inflows and outflows.</p>
Opinion
<p>The FDIC is an organisation staffed by those from the existing financial system, and therefore it is biassed towards the protection of the banks within that system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no conversation as to how more failing banks might impact any crypto companies that are dealing with them, or how obliging crypto companies, or the banks that seek to deal with them, to jump through ever more complex regulatory hoops, might end up squashing the dynamism and innovation of crypto.</p>
<p>The FDIC is there to insure the funds of bank customers should their bank fail. However, without the money to guarantee the savings of the clients of more than one or two big banks should they fail - it might be asked: what is the point of this organisation anyway?</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Base project RocketSwap has shared an emergency plan with users as it looks to recover from a brute force hack that saw the protocol lose around 471 ETH, valued at around $865,000, on the 14th of August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team behind the project also plans on reaching out to the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
The Emergency Plan&nbsp;
<p>The team at RocketSwap explained in a post on X on the 15th of August, stating that they planned to redeploy a new farm contract, following which it would be open-sourced on-chain. The team stated that they would also be relinquishing mining rights, mostly of RCKT, and also reach out to the hackers in an attempt to negotiate a return of the stolen assets, This approach was taken by Curve, and several other decentralized protocols following the Curve exploit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The emergency programme agreed upon by the team is as follows. We plan to redeploy a new farm contract by dropping the proxy contract and open-sourcing it on-chain. The new farm will advance the production reduction plan by 0.075 per block. The team relinquishes minting rights and retains only low-risk rights to allocate new pools. Locked initial liquidity and 80k tokens will be extended for 1 year. The team will continue to roll out LaunchPad, with further updates planned. Telegram groups will be reopened after stabilization. Call on hackers to return assets to victims.&rdquo;</p>

The RocketSwap Hack&nbsp;
<p>On the 14th of April, a hacker managed to steal around 471 ETH, bridging it from Base to Ethereum. The activity was flagged by blockchain security firm PeckShield. The hacker then created 90 trillion LoveRCKT tokens before transferring them to Uniswap, along with 400 of the 471 ETH initially stolen. PeckShield detailed the hack in a post on X, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;#PeckShieldAlert The @RocketSwap_Labs exploiter has grabbed ~471 $ETH and bridged them from #Base to #Ethereum, and then created the token $LoveRCKT, the exploiter already supplied 90T $LoveRCKT and 400 $ETH to #Uniswap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>RocketSwap eventually confirmed the news on the same day, with PeckShield and another blockchain security firm, CertiK, providing additional details about the hack a few hours later. The attack was attributed to a brute force attack on RocketSwap&rsquo;s server, with the protocol stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a result of the team&rsquo;s investigation, We are sorry to inform you that the team needed to use offline signatures when deploying the launchpad and put the private keys on the server. A brute force hack of the server was detected, and due to the proxy contract used for the farm contract, there were multiple high-risk permissions that led to the transfer of the farm&rsquo;s assets. We shut down the farm to prevent further damage. The team is currently working on an emergency plan, and the Telegram group has been banned for the time being. The loss of farm assets is only a concern, DEX is not affected in any way.&rdquo;</p>

Growing Headaches On Base&nbsp;
<p>Coinbase&rsquo;s layer-2 blockchain Base has faced several issues since commencing operations. LeetSwap, a leading decentralized exchange on the Base blockchain, suspended trading operations after flagging a security vulnerability in their factory, leading to the suspicion of compromised pool liquidity. The pause was done so that the team could investigate the issue further. PeckShield reported that around 340 ETH was exploited from liquidity pairs on Base, showing the gravity of the prevailing situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the pause in trading by LeetSwap, the BALD memecoin suffered a significant drop in value. The crash occurred after the token&rsquo;s developer withdrew 6800 ETH, valued at around $12.5 million, from the liquidity pools on LeetSwap, raising several eyebrows and compounding the list of issues faced by LeetSwap. Furthermore, Coinbase is also dealing with its own set of regulatory challenges after finding itself as a target of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered Coinbase to stop all crypto trading, except for that of Bitcoin. When Coinbase questioned the decision made by the regulatory body, Coinbase filed a lawsuit against the exchange.</p>

The new farm will advance the production reduction plan by 0.075 per block. The team relinquishes minting rights and retains only low-risk rights to allocate new pools. Locked initial liquidity and 80k tokens will be extended for 1 year. The team will continue to roll out LaunchPad, with further updates planned. Telegram groups will be reopened after stabilization. Call on hackers to return assets to victims.&rdquo;</p>

The RocketSwap Hack&nbsp;
<p>On the 14th of April, a hacker managed to steal around 471 ETH, bridging it from Base to Ethereum. The activity was flagged by blockchain security firm PeckShield. The hacker then created 90 trillion LoveRCKT tokens before transferring them to Uniswap, along with 400 of the 471 ETH initially stolen. PeckShield detailed the hack in a post on X, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;#PeckShieldAlert The @RocketSwap_Labs exploiter has grabbed ~471 $ETH and bridged them from #Base to #Ethereum, and then created the token $LoveRCKT, the exploiter already supplied 90T $LoveRCKT and 400 $ETH to #Uniswap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>RocketSwap eventually confirmed the news on the same day, with PeckShield and another blockchain security firm, CertiK, providing additional details about the hack a few hours later. The attack was attributed to a brute force attack on RocketSwap&rsquo;s server, with the protocol stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a result of the team&rsquo;s investigation, We are sorry to inform you that the team needed to use offline signatures when deploying the launchpad and put the private keys on the server. A brute force hack of the server was detected, and due to the proxy contract used for the farm contract, there were multiple high-risk permissions that led to the transfer of the farm&rsquo;s assets. We shut down the farm to prevent further damage. The team is currently working on an emergency plan, and the Telegram group has been banned for the time being. The loss of farm assets is only a concern, DEX is not affected in any way.&rdquo;</p>

Growing Headaches On Base&nbsp;
<p>Coinbase&rsquo;s layer-2 blockchain Base has faced several issues since commencing operations. LeetSwap, a leading decentralized exchange on the Base blockchain, suspended trading operations after flagging a security vulnerability in their factory, leading to the suspicion of compromised pool liquidity. The pause was done so that the team could investigate the issue further. PeckShield reported that around 340 ETH was exploited from liquidity pairs on Base, showing the gravity of the prevailing situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the pause in trading by LeetSwap, the BALD memecoin suffered a significant drop in value. The crash occurred after the token&rsquo;s developer withdrew 6800 ETH, valued at around $12.5 million, from the liquidity pools on LeetSwap, raising several eyebrows and compounding the list of issues faced by LeetSwap. Furthermore, Coinbase is also dealing with its own set of regulatory challenges after finding itself as a target of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered Coinbase to stop all crypto trading, except for that of Bitcoin. When Coinbase questioned the decision made by the regulatory body, Coinbase filed a lawsuit against the exchange.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Coca-Cola has launched its new exclusive NFT collection on Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 network during the &ldquo;Onchain Summer&rdquo; festival.</p>
Coca-Cola&rsquo;s Masterpiece Campaign
<p>On Sunday, August 13, one of the most recognizable consumer brands in the world, Coca-Cola, revealed its new non-fungible tokens (NFT) collection on Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 blockchain called &ldquo;Base&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The collection is a part of Coca-Cola's global &ldquo;Masterpiece&rdquo; campaign which was partially created by the brand&rsquo;s AI platform known as &ldquo;Real Magic&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Masterpiece&rsquo; is not a story in which Coke appears&hellip; Coke is the story,&rdquo; commented Pratik Thakar, Global Head of Creative Strategy and Integrated Content for Coca‑Cola. &ldquo;True to the spirit of the brand&mdash;and not unlike the way a synchronized supply chain collaborates to seamlessly deliver ice-cold Coca‑Cola to consumers at just the right time&mdash;a diverse collection of artwork spanning multiple genres, geographies and generations comes together to uplift a slumping teenager. Creating human connection and bringing enchantment to everyday moments is what &lsquo;Real Magic&rsquo; is all about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Masterpiece NFT collection showcases the artwork featured in the brand&rsquo;s campaign, including Andy Warhol&rsquo;s iconic 1962 Coca‑Cola painting, classical pieces of timeless artists such as Edvard Munch&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Scream&rdquo; and Johannes Vermeer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Girl with a Pearl Earring,&rdquo;, as well as works of emerging artists such as Aket, Fatma Ramadan, and Vikram Kushwah.</p>
Coinbase&rsquo;s Onchain Summer
<p>Coca-Cola&rsquo;s new NFT collection has been offered for a limited time and presented as a part of the Coinbase&rsquo;s Onchain Summer event:</p>

<p>&ldquo;@CocaCola is bringing their Global Masterpiece campaign onchain with iconic works from leading artists,&rdquo; Coinbase announced on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>Onchain Summer is Coinbase's month-long celebration of its Layer-2 Blochcian Base which became available to the general public on August 9. Each day, the festival offers numerous onchain mints, stories, and activities related to art, culture, music, gaming, and more. Coca-Cola is undoubtedly the most recognizable brand presented on the list of Base&rsquo;s partners so far.</p>
Coca-Cola and NFTs
<p>This is not the first time the world-renowned soft drinks brand has ventured into the NFT space. Back in 2021, Coca-Cola auctioned off exclusive NFT collectibles with the aim of raising funds for Special Olympics International. At that time, the first Coca-Cola&rsquo;s NFT loot box was sold as a single asset for over $575,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coca-Cola&rsquo;s engagement with NFTs is meaningful for the whole cryptocurrency industry. As one of the largest global consumer brands, Coca-Cola could introduce many of its customers to the world of digital art and Web3. Besides, the beverage giant will likely play a big role in promoting Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 network Base.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Former United States President Donald Trump&rsquo;s latest public financial disclosure has revealed that he owns around $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump had recently launched an exclusive non-fungible token (NFT) collection after leaving the White House in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
Trump Holds Considerable ETH&nbsp;
<p>The financial disclosure was filed with the Office of Government Ethics and outlined Trump&rsquo;s various assets and sources of income. Eagle-eyed observers noticed a section that mentioned a &ldquo;cryptocurrency wallet Ethereum&rdquo; on the second to last entry on the 82-page form. According to the information in the financial disclosure, the wallet held an estimated $250,000 to $500,000 worth of ETH. It is believed that the contents of the cryptocurrency wallet are linked with the NFT collection launched by Trump in December 2022.&nbsp;</p>
The Trump NFTs&nbsp;
<p>The former president launched his NFT collection in December 2022 after weeks of speculation regarding his &ldquo;special announcement.&rdquo; Many believed the announcement would be naming a running mate for his presidential campaign. However, Mr. Trump announced the launch of his exclusive NFT collection instead. The collection features the former president in several avatars, including a Nascar driver and an astronaut. At the time of the launch, Mr Trump had stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These limited edition cards feature amazing ART of my Life &amp; Career. It would make a great Christmas gift. Don&rsquo;t Wait. They will be gone; I believe, very quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had also posted a clip that featured an animated version of himself standing in front of the Trump Tower, with lasers shooting out of his eyes. The NFT collection was described as similar to baseball cards but far more exciting and priced at $99 each. Buyers of the collection will also be able to enter a sweepstake and have a chance at winning a gala dinner or a game of golf with Mr. Trump. However, the move was roundly criticized on social media, with several high-profile Republicans speaking out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following her husband&rsquo;s footsteps, the former first lady also launched an NFT collection only a couple of months after the former president&rsquo;s NFT collection. Each NFT in the Melania Trump collection is priced at $50. The collection consisted of seven designs, with a total of 3500 NFTs. The former first lady had stated at the time of launch,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 1776 Collection of artwork draws inspiration from several iconic landmarks of our nation, which I had the privilege of visiting during the time I served as first lady. Each piece provides a view into our nation&rsquo;s history, culture, and patriotism. I am proud to celebrate our great nation and remain inspired by the words contained within the Declaration of Independence.&rdquo;</p>

Past Skepticism Of Crypto&nbsp;
<p>The disclosure that the former president owns a considerable amount of ETH is interesting, especially when you consider how skeptical he had been about crypto in the past. Back in 2019, Trump had stated that he was not a fan of Bitcoin and described it as &ldquo;not money&rdquo; with its valuation based on thin air.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trump reiterated these views in a 2021 interview, once again highlighting his opposition to the crypto ecosystem and digital assets. He stated that he was quite wary of digital assets such as Bitcoin because they were a threat to the dollar. He even called the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency a scam, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin just seems like a scam&hellip;I don&rsquo;t like it because it is another currency competing against the dollar. Essentially it&rsquo;s a currency competing against the dollar. I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. That is what I have always said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) experienced elevated downside risk early in the Asian session as the pair depreciated to the 29072.96 area after selling pressure expanded around the 29447.60 area, representing another failed test of the 76.4% retracement of the depreciating range from 30350.70 to 26501.59.&nbsp;&nbsp; This interday high also represented a test of the 50% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 28660.53 to 30222, while the move to multi-session lows around the 29072 area represented a test of the 76.4% retracement of the same appreciating. &nbsp;Technical trading was recently evident when buying pressure strengthened around the 28754 area, a previous downside price objective associated with selling pressure around the 29526 and 29344 areas.&nbsp; Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Prominent decentralized exchange Uniswap has confirmed that it has fired a prominent developer over his involvement in a $25,000 memecoin rug pull.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developer in question, AzFlin, or Allen Lin, orchestrated a rug pull hours after initiating the deployment of the FrensTech meme coin.&nbsp;</p>
Uniswap Moves To Fire AzFlin
<p>Allen Lin, the Uniswap developer at the center of the storm surrounding the FrensTech meme coin rug pull, has lost his job at Uniswap. The sacking was confirmed in a post on X by Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, with Uniswap moving quickly to distance themselves from the actions of their former employee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wanted to let people know this person is no longer with the company. Not behavior we support or condone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>AzFlin lost his job at the decentralized exchange following the FrensTech meme coin rug pull that saw investors lose 14 ETH, valued at around $25,900. The meme coin was launched on the social platform of the Coinbase Layer-2 base program, friend.tech.&nbsp;</p>
How The Rug Pull Was Orchestrated&nbsp;
<p>A pseudo-anonymous user on X going by the name UniswapVillain initially made the Uniswap community aware of the fact that AzFlin had rug-pulled a meme coin project just hours after creating it. UniswapVillain noted that AzFlin initiated the rug pull by withdrawing support that was previously added to enable the trading of the FRENs token. Once the project had accumulated 14 ETH in fees, AzFlin removed liquidity and pocketed all the funds collected by the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rug pull was orchestrated via the Hop Protocol, a decentralized bridge that allows users to transfer tokens between different blockchains. Furthermore, UniswapVillain added that the developer did not just remove liquidity from the project and meme coin. He also sold all the coins from which he had withdrawn the liquidity. He also added that the situation was particularly concerning, given AzFlin&rsquo;s association with Uniswap, one of the most prominent decentralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frenstech (@FrensTech) $FRENS was deployed a few hours ago by the dev, @AzFlina Uniswap employee. One hour and four minutes ago, he effectively rugged the project, moving 14 ETH off of Base chain through HOP. Multiple people have confirmed he is the dev, and there were numerous early Uniswap employee followers on Twitter. He removed liquidity he added from fees and pocketed 14 ETH of fees. He sold the tokens he removed from liquidity even. This is wild to me that someone who is doxxed and works for Uniswap would do this.&rdquo;</p>

AzFlin Calls Sacking Net Neutral&nbsp;
<p>An unremorseful AzFlin called his sacking &ldquo;net neutral,&rdquo; boasting that he had gained 600 new followers and the status of a crypto villain on X. While people have wondered why someone who is doxxed and works for Uniswap would do this, AzFlin has remained unrepentant. The bad actor simply gave an update about losing their job on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got fired from UniSwap but gained new followers and Crypto Twitter villain status.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He also changed his bio on X, adding the words AzFlin &ldquo;Unemployment arc&rdquo; and further commented on the issue:</p>

<p>"To those who think I rugged 14E: that came from dev taxes. It belonged to me. I know whatever I say, the low IQ CT narrative has already been spun. I will not comment further on this anymore, everything is on chain.&rdquo;</p>

The Growing Menace Of Rug Pulls&nbsp;
<p>Rug pulls have become increasingly common in the crypto space in recent times, primarily impacting newer tokens and decentralized exchanges. This comes against the backdrop of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum making record price moments that are not actionable, leaving investors desperate for a hefty profit. This is why traders should not buy into the hype of new projects and tokens pushed by influencers. Instead, they must do their own research and invest in reputable projects.</p>

While people have wondered why someone who is doxxed and works for Uniswap would do this, AzFlin has remained unrepentant. The bad actor simply gave an update about losing their job on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got fired from UniSwap but gained new followers and Crypto Twitter villain status.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He also changed his bio on X, adding the words AzFlin &ldquo;Unemployment arc&rdquo; and further commented on the issue:</p>

<p>"To those who think I rugged 14E: that came from dev taxes. It belonged to me. I know whatever I say, the low IQ CT narrative has already been spun. I will not comment further on this anymore, everything is on chain.&rdquo;</p>

The Growing Menace Of Rug Pulls&nbsp;
<p>Rug pulls have become increasingly common in the crypto space in recent times, primarily impacting newer tokens and decentralized exchanges. This comes against the backdrop of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum making record price moments that are not actionable, leaving investors desperate for a hefty profit. This is why traders should not buy into the hype of new projects and tokens pushed by influencers. Instead, they must do their own research and invest in reputable projects.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>For cryptocurrency traders, having constant access to account balances, open positions, and global market prices is absolutely essential. But being chained to a trading desk or computer simply isn't always desirable in today's fast-paced, mobile world. Thankfully, the award-winning PrimeXBT mobile app provides traders with everything they could possibly need to stay tightly connected to crypto markets, no matter where they are in the world.</p>
<p>Whether lounging by the seaside on a tropical beach vacation, traversing new exotic lands as a digital nomad, or simply walking your dog around the neighborhood, you can react in real-time to sudden volatility spikes and efficiently manage existing trades in just a few taps. The PrimeXBT app puts a full suite of professional trading tools right to the palm of your hand.</p>
<p></p>
Stay informed with real-time market data and pricing
<p>The intuitive PrimeXBT interface grants easy access to over 100 diverse trading instruments across forex, commodities, stock indices, and of course, cryptocurrencies. The mobile app's customisable watchlist feature lets you easily track real-time pricing data across all major global markets.</p>
<p>Scroll through and view up-to-the-second price action on popular forex pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/JPY. Check current gold and crude oil prices, alongside stock indices such as the S&amp;P 500, FTSE 100, and Nikkei 225. The app also provides live updated prices for all top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and many more.</p>

<p>The app's robust trading features allow executing complex strategies like building long/short portfolios across diverse asset classes, to properly diversify and reduce risk. Or utilise leverage up to 200x on crypto trades, for significantly greater profit potential.</p>
<p>Managing open positions across markets is equally simple and intuitive. The app clearly displays all current positions, their unrealised profit/loss in real-time, and allows you to quickly modify stop losses and take profit levels. You thus have full mobile control and can close positions to take profits or add margin to current trades when necessary.</p>

<p></p>
Deposit, withdraw, and manage your account on the go

                        <![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore-based Web 3 gaming firm Affyn is set to participate in the annual Grand Prix Season Singapore (GPSS), a 10-day event supported by the Singapore Tourism Board that culminates during the&nbsp; Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix weekend. According to the team statement, Affyn entered a strategic partnership with GPSS to present a metaverse event to the fans of the Grand Prix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;"We are proud to partner with GPSS as it underlines Affyn&rsquo;s intent to bolster Government initiatives and bring Web 3.0 development to the next level,&rdquo; said Affyn CEO Lucaz Lee. &ldquo;As the only official Web 3.0 company partnering with GPSS, an event supported by STB, it is an incredible opportunity to drive awareness of developments in the industry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event, titled &lsquo;Web 3.0 | Art Meets Metaverse&rsquo;,&nbsp; is set to run on Saturday, 16th September 2023, at Suntec City&rsquo;s Synthesis from 1 PM to 4 PM (local time). The event will include NFT exhibitions from artists around Singapore, a celebrity-hosted panel talk show and experiential zones that allow guests to delve into the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Singapore rising as a crypto hub in the East, the involvement of crypto in such a global sporting event blends well in maintaining its verve as the leading crypto hub in Asia. The event aims to educate non-crypto fans on the developments of the metaverse in the art world, dive into discussions on the state of the metaverse industry, interact during the exhibition and learn from experts via their talk shows. In addition, attendees can interact and share with other enthusiasts and dive into how blockchain and the metaverse affect art in the real world today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other news, Affyn-based gaming title Nexus World Land City will be launching its third wave of land parcels starting August 23.&nbsp; Players will have the chance to claim their land parcels in eight cities, including Amsterdam, Barcelona, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Manilla, Sydney, and Zurich.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto companies&rsquo; relationship with F1 extends
<p>Despite the recent departures of FTX and Tezos, who sponsored the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team and Scuderia AlphaTauri, respectively, crypto partnerships with F1 teams have grown, as evidenced by Affyn&rsquo;s Singapore GP event. Earlier this year, British F1 team Williams Racing entered a strategic partnership with Kraken Exchange to launch a competition to see NFTs showcased around this year's Singapore GP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other crypto partners in F1 include Bybit, sponsoring Redbull Racing Team in a $150 million deal and Stake.com, an Alfa Romeo Formula One Team sponsor.&nbsp;</p>]]>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance platform Zunami Protocol has become the latest protocol to be hacked after confirming on Sunday that bad actors hacked its liquidity pool on Curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exploit led to the protocol losing over $2.1 million, according to estimates from blockchain security firm PeckShield and Ironblocks.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>The protocol confirmed the hack on Sunday, with security firm PeckShield confirming it as well. The protocol advised users to refrain from purchasing any of its Zunami Ether (zETH) or Zunami USD (UZD) stablecoins following the attack. The protocol further added that collateral remained secure and it was investigating the cause of the exploit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears that zStables have encountered an attack. The collateral remain secure, we delve into the ongoing investigation. Please do not buy zETH and UZD at the moment; their emission has been attacked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield, in an analysis of the attack, estimated that around $2.1 million was stolen from the decentralized finance protocol&rsquo;s Curve pool and put the exploit down to a price manipulation issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi @ZunamiProtocol Today&rsquo;s hack leads to &gt;$2.1m loss, and there are two hack txs involved: - tx1:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2aec4fdb2a09ad4269a410f2c770737626fb62c54e0fa8ac25e8582d4b690cca - tx2:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0788ba222970c7c68a738b0e08fb197e669e61f9b226ceec4cab9b85abe8cceb It is a price manipulation issue, which can be exploited by donation to incorrectly calculate the price as shown in the following figures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fellow security firm Ironblocks also conducted an analysis of the hack, coming to the same conclusion as PeckShield regarding the cause of the hack. In its analysis, Ironblocks explained,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The attacker took [a] flash loan from [the] balancer, then he added liquidity so he [would] be able to change the price significantly and started to trade in Zunami&rsquo;s exchange. Then he removed the liquidity and changed the price, then he traded back and [returned] the flash loan and got 1,152 ETH to himself. Classic price manipulation.&rdquo;</p>

Price Of Zunami USD And Zunami ETH Collapses&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The price of both the Zunami USD stablecoin and Zunami ETH (zETH) fell off a cliff following the exploit. The stablecoin lost its entire value, dropping 99%, while zETH dropped over 88%, dropping to $206. PeckShield also confirmed that the stolen funds had already been put through the controversial coin mixer Tornado Cash.&nbsp;</p>
Curve&rsquo;s Recent Troubles&nbsp;
<p>The Zunami protocol is a yield farming aggregator for stablecoins and maintains its primary zStable pools on Curve. The protocol is managed as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and promises users the &ldquo;highest API on the market.&rdquo; It has also stated that it has over $5 million in total value locked (TVL) on its website. According to Zunami, users can use the protocol to diversify their stablecoin portfolio and avoid the risk of crashing one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve Finance has faced multiple attacks over the past few weeks, impacting multiple decentralized finance protocols. Attackers managed to steal over $24 million worth of crypto by leveraging a vulnerability in the liquidity pools on Curve. The vulnerability was eventually traced back to Vyper, a third-party programming language being used to program Ethereum smart contracts on the protocol. At the time, Curve stated that liquidity pools not using Vyper were not impacted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A number of stablepools (alETH/msETH/pETH) using Vyper 0.2.15 have been exploited as a result of a malfunctioning reentrancy lock. We are assessing the situation and will update the community as things develop. Other pools are safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exploit put major protocols at risk, especially due to Curve founder Michael Egorov&rsquo;s $168 million lending position, which was at risk of liquidation.</p>

<p>The price of both the Zunami USD stablecoin and Zunami ETH (zETH) fell off a cliff following the exploit. The stablecoin lost its entire value, dropping 99%, while zETH dropped over 88%, dropping to $206. PeckShield also confirmed that the stolen funds had already been put through the controversial coin mixer Tornado Cash.&nbsp;</p>
Curve&rsquo;s Recent Troubles&nbsp;
<p>The Zunami protocol is a yield farming aggregator for stablecoins and maintains its primary zStable pools on Curve. The protocol is managed as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and promises users the &ldquo;highest API on the market.&rdquo; It has also stated that it has over $5 million in total value locked (TVL) on its website. According to Zunami, users can use the protocol to diversify their stablecoin portfolio and avoid the risk of crashing one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve Finance has faced multiple attacks over the past few weeks, impacting multiple decentralized finance protocols. Attackers managed to steal over $24 million worth of crypto by leveraging a vulnerability in the liquidity pools on Curve. The vulnerability was eventually traced back to Vyper, a third-party programming language being used to program Ethereum smart contracts on the protocol. At the time, Curve stated that liquidity pools not using Vyper were not impacted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A number of stablepools (alETH/msETH/pETH) using Vyper 0.2.15 have been exploited as a result of a malfunctioning reentrancy lock. We are assessing the situation and will update the community as things develop. Other pools are safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exploit put major protocols at risk, especially due to Curve founder Michael Egorov&rsquo;s $168 million lending position, which was at risk of liquidation.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Visa recently completed a test that allows users to pay Ethereum (ETH) gas fees through credit and debit cards. </p>
<p>Global payment giant Visa has successfully completed a test for an innovative solution on the Ethereum blockchain, which will allow its users to pay on-chain gas fees using a Visa debit or credit card.</p>
<p>The test was revealed by Mustafa Bedawala, a Visa product manager, to address the ongoing challenge of ensuring Ether balances for covering gas fees.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're excited to share our experimental solution on Paying Onchain Gas Fees with a Visa Card At @Visa, we've been exploring ways to simplify blockchain transactionsImagine paying for gas fees as easily as buying coffee with your card! But how did we get here?🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/uGhAde60xe</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>The possible solution aims to improve the interaction process with dApps on the Ethereum blockchain. Visa said the trial &ldquo;helps set the stage for a more accessible and user-friendly approach to digital transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visa said:</p>

<p>"To transact using a blockchain like Ethereum, consumers must maintain a balance of the blockchain&rsquo;s native token (e.g., ETH) to pay fees for using the network, known as &ldquo;gas.&rdquo; What if sending blockchain transactions using self-custodial wallets was as straightforward for the user as using your card to pay for a cup of coffee?"</p>

Visa Aims to Eliminate Overspending ETH
<p>The standard Ethereum transaction requires users acquiring ETH from an exchange wanting to transfer it to their wallets to pay variable gas fees. The variable gas fees often result in users spending more ETH than necessary or having insufficient ETH.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, Visa&rsquo;s solution uses Ethereum&rsquo;s ERC-4337 standards and the &ldquo;Paymaster&rdquo; smart contract allowing off-chain gas fee payments. Users trigger an Ethereum transaction through their wallets which is then sent to the paymaster. Paymaster calculates the gas fee and charges Visa through a service called Cybersource.</p>
<p>A digital signature is produced and validated for a limited time, then attached by the wallet before sending it to the blockchain. The signature is verified, and Paymaster settles the gas fees. Visa&rsquo;s innovative solution thereby allows users to pay gas fees off-chain with their Visa card and eliminates the need for users to hold ETH to pay for gas fees.</p>
<p>Visa explained that:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The intricacies and complexities of blockchain-based transactions have been a significant stumbling block for many users, creating a challenging learning curve and increasing user friction.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visa&rsquo;s research team added that the solution offers a &ldquo;promising approach to substantially addressing these challenges.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Beyond traditional financial assets, the cryptocurrency world has now branched out to include the gaming industry. Gaming tokens, referred to as "play-to-earn" tokens, have drawn a lot of attention since they combine investment and enjoyment. This article examines three gaming tokens that have the potential to add value to your cryptocurrency portfolio: Axie Infinity (AXS), Gala Games (GALA), and Pomerdoge (POMD).</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Axie Infinity (AXS): Pioneering NFT Gaming Revolution
<p>Starting off, Axie Infinity (AXS) has gained notoriety for its brilliant fusion of blockchain and NFT technologies. At its foundation, the game gives players the ability to gather, raise, and fight against fantastical beings known as "Axies."</p>
<p>Additionally, these Axies have been painstakingly tokenized as NFTs, giving them inherent valuethat players may trade and sell with ease. This idea is supported by the ground-breaking play-to-earn paradigm. This enables users to make money by actively engaging in battles and quests. As a result, it leads to a ground-breaking fusion of gaming and investment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Axie Infinity's value has dramatically increased, drawing in both investors and gamers. As a result, Axie Infinity offers an enticing opportunity for diversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio due to its strong potential for future expansion and integration.</p>
Gala Games (GALA)- Empowering Game Development Democracy
<p>By introducing player and creator empowerment, the creative force known as Gala Games (GALA) is unwaveringly committed to reshaping the game business landscape.</p>
<p>Gala Games expands a platform where users can intricately participate in creating and owning games thanks to blockchain technology. Consequently, the GALA token is the key to this dynamic since it allows for easy transactions and interactions between players and creators.</p>
<p>Moreover, Gala Games stands out for its unwavering dedication to decentralization and community involvement. Thereby, giving developers the power to maintain creative liberty and ownership of their video game creations.</p>
<p>Because of Gala Games' unusual commitment to user-centricity, it stands out in a sea of gaming tokens. As a result, it is enticing to both gamers and astute investors.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) To Surpass Axie Infinity and Gala Games
<p class="s10">As Axie Infinity and Gala Games are stagnating, Pomerdoge is expected to increase 10x in the next month, according to analysts. The complex environment that Pomerdoge is creating will house NFTs, POMD tokens, a marketplace and an exciting play-to-earn (P2E) gaming platform.</p>
<p class="s10">Therefore, these components combine to provide an engaging and satisfying experience that draws crypto aficionados from all over the world. Players from all over the world will be able to compete and converse on the P2E game's platform.</p>
<p class="s10">As a result, the Pomerdoge P2E game merges enjoyment and earning potential by giving players the chance to earn prizes while having fun.</p>
<p class="s10">Pomerdoge is creating Pomerplace, an in-game marketplace that lets players earn incentives by purchasing, reselling, and exchanging items. This thriving ecosystem revolves around the Pomerdoge meme coin, or POMD.</p>
<p class="s10">This utility token makes all platform transactions possible. Subsequently it also gives owners real utility and the chance to earn rewards through staking. Meanwhile, POMD tokens are selling for just $0.008 during the first stage of the presale. You now have the chance to integrate into this thriving ecosystem.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>There are gems of tokens that have been overshadowed by bigger, well-established tokens. However, we'll be highlighting some of these lesser-known tokens that have shown significant growth potential. They include Nexo (NEXO), Pomerdoge (POMD), and 1inch (1INCH) tokens.</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Key Cryptocurrencies To Watch Closely &ndash; 1inch (1INCH), Nexo(NEXO), and Pomerdoge (POMD)
<p>The once bearish trend experienced by the 1inch (1NCH) token has flattened and it is looking set to go on a bullish rally. This is evident in the stats that show that it has seen a slight move towards a positive price action after suffering a 2.45% loss in price value in the last 7 days. 1INCH currently trades at $0.30 with a 24-hour trading volume of $14 million.</p>
<p>After falling to an all-time low of $0.25 on June 15, 2023, 1inch is bouncing back at the moment, with the coin gaining 3% in the last 30 days. Crypto price prediction platforms have projected that 1inch could exceed the $0.5 benchmark very soon.</p>
<p>Right now, analysts reckon that 1 inch is on the right track to surge in the coming days and weeks.</p>
Investors Confident in the Resurgence of Nexo (NEXO) Despite Current Dip in Price
<p>Notwithstanding the ongoing declining price action of the Nexo (NEXO) token, investors and analysts are confident that the token will rally anytime soon. For context, It has lost 1.93% in price value in the last 24 hours and trades at $0.63 as of the time of writing.</p>
<p>However, the trading volume of Nexo in the last 24 hours shows that the market activity of the token gained 8.88% to see a market return of over $1.90M.</p>
<p>A further look at the price chart shows that Nexo is 3.69% better off in price value than it was in the last 30 days and has only lost 0.58% of its price value in the last 7 days. As such, Nexo may well be a shrewd investment option.</p>
<p>Most crypto price prediction platforms already predicted that Nexo will hit the $1 benchmark in the year. If the coin breaks the current resistance level, we could witness a rally very soon.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Surges As More Investors Buy Into the Presale
<p>Pomerdoge (POMD) has been consistently on an upward trajectory since its presale phase started. Pomerdoge is a P2E gaming platform where individuals from around the globe can connect and network with each other while engaging in healthy digital gaming competitions.</p>
<p>Currently, Pomerdoge is rewarding presale investors with the chance to exclusively own part of the 7,777 NFTs that'll be minted on the platform. Moreso, presale investors will earn a percentage of the revenue generated from the Pomergame platform - a platform under the Pomerdoge ecosystem.</p>
<p>The revenue will be distributed based on the number of POMD tokens users have in their accounts. Anyone can become a presale investor and enjoy these benefits. All you have to do is buy the Pomerdoge tokens now at the price of only $0.008.</p>
<p>The Pomerdoge project has been vetted by SolidProof and Cyberscope. The token's liquidity will be locked for life as a security measure for investors' assets. There are concrete reasons to believe in the promising investment opportunity presented by Pomerdoge.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>In spite of the IMF obliging the Argentine central bank to say it wouldn&rsquo;t entertain Bitcoin, the next potential president is very much pro the king of the cryptocurrencies.</p>
IMF should be concerned
<p>When the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forced the Argentine central bank to guarantee that it wouldn&rsquo;t dabble in bitcoin, on pain of having its last crucial loan denied, the global financial agency must have thought that it had stopped bitcoin from being used in at least one Latin American country.</p>
<p>A short time later, and the IMF must be feeling more than a trifle worried as a libertarian pro-Bitcoin candidate looks to be about to win the country&rsquo;s presidential primary elections with more than 90% of the vote already counted.</p>
Central bank is a scam
<p>Javier Milei, young leader of La Libertad Avanza party, is not a meek and mild libertarian either. He is openly campaigning to abolish the Argentine central bank, calling it a &ldquo;scam&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Such a statement is inflammatory in the extreme and will probably be taken by many from the Argentine elites and the banking sector as the rantings of a revolutionary hot head.</p>
<p>However, the presidential hopeful has shown in interviews that he understands how money works, and he is calling out politicians and the central bank for cheating people with an &ldquo;inflationary tax&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Milei had the following to say in an interview:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The problem is that governments are not going to want to give up compulsory use of fiat currency. Bitcoin is the natural reaction to central bank fraud, but allowing money to become private once more isn&rsquo;t something the thieving politicians will allow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In past times, such language used by an aspiring politician, let alone one that would be president of his country, would have been denounced by the ruling class and would have been enough to see that this person got nowhere near any position of power.</p>
Argentina running out of options
<p>However, this is Argentina, a country that has played the IMF game for many decades, with presidents and top bank officials doing exactly as they were told, only for Argentina to lurch from one default crisis to another, over and over again, with citizens' purchasing power in the Argentine peso practically going to zero, and with an annual inflation rate of well over 100%.</p>
<p>For Argentina to move onto the sound money base that is Bitcoin, could be a very interesting move for the country. That the elites in Argentina, plus the powers that be across the globe, might allow such a decision is something else.</p>
<p>Argentina is in an extremely precarious financial position, and has only just managed to avoid default just recently with the help of China and the Latin American Development Bank. It will take a very brave and resolute leader to oversee such an incredible transition. For Argentina, there may be no other option.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin Hash Ribbons has just signalled again. Is this yet another infallible buy signal for this indicator?</p>
Price action about to change?
<p>All quiet on the Bitcoin front as the apex cryptocurrency continues to follow a meandering, slightly boring and predictable sideways trajectory between the $29,000 to $30,000 range.</p>
<p>However, momentum is perhaps just starting to bubble up underneath Bitcoin&rsquo;s wanderings as one of the most successful and trusted indicators has suddenly sprung into life - flashing a buy signal that was last seen at the beginning of the year, after which Bitcoin started to thrust its way out of the last bear market.</p>
The Bitcoin hash rate
<p>The Bitcoin hash rate is the amount of computing power that Bitcoin miners contribute to the network. The hash rate goes up when more miners are competing for blocks. On the flip side, when the price drops, or does not go up for a long period of time, miner capitulation happens, meaning that mining is no longer profitable, and miners take their machines offline.</p>
<p>Even though the Hash Ribbons are a lagging indicator, on the higher time frame they are a very reliable sign that a bottom or a dip in the Bitcoin price has been reached.</p>
<p>Given that Bitcoin is at a rather crucial point in what is seen by some as just a bear market rally, and by others as the initial phase of the new bull market, this signal will perhaps tip the argument more in the favour of the latter exponents.</p>
A perilous financial time
<p>A backdrop of dire economic warnings make for an incredibly interesting time for Bitcoin. The traditional monetary and banking system is on the edge of a cliff of financial oblivion, and should it go over this cliff, most financial assets might be expected to go with it.</p>
<p>There are analysts who say that Bitcoin is a risk asset, and so would be expected to be one of the first to feel the pain of a financial meltdown. However, others would say that Bitcoin was created precisely for such an extreme scenario, and given that it is outside of the traditional financial system, many investors would see it as a liferaft to which they could transfer their wealth.</p>
<p>It is certainly hoped that financial armageddon can be avoided, but given the way that governments and central banks have handled world economies, things are looking extremely perilous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be argued that the fiat currency experiment has reached the bitter end. All those still hoarding currency in the bank are doing so naively, probably unaware that their purchasing power is diminishing rapidly, and that they run the risk of being &lsquo;bailed in&rsquo; should the bank fail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a sovereign store of wealth that is scarce, predictable, and the most secure computing system on the planet. Those looking to save themselves in the perilous time to come would do well to investigate Bitcoin&rsquo;s properties.&nbsp;</p>

We believe we are providing a critical component for a new type of open data supply chain to power AI applications.&rdquo;<p class="ql-align-justify">In addition to crypto payments, the Train2Earn platform also uses the blockchain to enable a public voting process in which contributors reach consensus about the quality of the submitted data.

                        <![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Orbiting 29372 Objective: &nbsp;Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 14 August 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained confined to a very tight rangeearly in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 29372.20 area, a previous upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure around the 24750 and 26044.70areas. &nbsp; Selling pressure has recently intensifed around the 29709 and 29534 areas while buying pressure emerged around the 29213 area, underscoring the recent tight range. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical trading was recently evident when buying pressure strengthened around the 28754 area, a previous downside price objective associated with selling pressure around the 29526 and 29344 areas. &nbsp;Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21. &nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>
<p>Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas. &nbsp; Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28432, 28213, 28137, 27979, 27757, 27430, 27409, 27338, 27312, 27246, 26501, 26348, and 26199levels. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historic depreciating range from 69000 to 15460. &nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly) and above&nbsp;the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly). &nbsp;Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29315.07and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29386.53.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly aboveSlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) awaited a new technical bias early in the Asian session as the pair orbited the 29403.79 area, representing a downside price objective associated with recent selling pressure around the 30421 and 29851 levels.&nbsp; Selling pressure has recently strengthened around the 29709 and 29534 areas while buying pressure emerged around the 29213 area, underscoring the recent tight range.&nbsp; Technical trading was recently evident when buying pressure strengthened around the 28754 area, a previous downside price objective associated with selling pressure around the 29526 and 29344 areas.&nbsp; Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>

<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29302.77 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29398.79.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="s6">Beyond its ground-breaking features, Uwerx's developers' agile methodology approach has significantly contributed to the project's success. They have been so committed to promoting Uwerx&rsquo;s vision and purpose that investors and users could completely trust them and buy into the project.</p>
<p class="s6">This was part of why the Uwerx launch was overwhelmingly successful, surpassing expectations and initial forecasts. The developers are back to work and ready to take Uwerx to the next level.</p>
<p class="s6">However, they witnessed a setback as Uwerx was attacked. The team has yet again shown commitment by quickly and efficiently developing recovery strategies and plans. This article will detail the launch, updates, the hack, and Uwerx&rsquo;s road to recovery.</p>
Uwerx&rsquo;s Successful Launch: Developers Set To Renounce Smart Contract Ownership
<p class="s6">After so much anticipation, Uwerx finally launched on August 1, 2023. The launch was successful, as everyone wanted to become a WERX holder. Also, investors and users made tons of profits with all the bonuses that were up.</p>
<p class="s6">The developers released updates on what to expect next from Uwerx as soon as the launch ended. Uwerx has finally deployed liquidity on Uniswap. The Uwerx Vault, which received positive feedback from 84% of the community, will soon be available as the smart contracts await a thorough audit. </p>
<p class="s6">To show their commitment to Uwerx&rsquo;s community, the developers immediately began the 25-year liquidity locking they promised to do once Uwerx launched. They are also ready to denounce smart contract ownership when Uwerx goes live on centralized exchanges. The team has submitted their applications to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko to facilitate this. </p>
<p class="s6">The team is working to ensure the Uwerx platform is completed immediately. They are working on the core functionality design, focusing on Freelancer, Client, and Agency Dashboards, Project Management, and Additional Settings Pages. </p>
<p class="s6">Once this is finished, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with functions will be released to the community for testing. Based on the feedback obtained, they will proceed with the premium design. </p>
<p class="s6">There will be a buyback campaign that will scale accordingly to provide support for Uwerx. It will happen weekly, although the dates and times will not be released to avoid anyone taking unfair advantage of the system.</p>
Uwerx Gets Exploited
<p class="s6">On August 2, Uwerx reported it got hacked, with the hacker stealing around $327,000. The attacker flash-loaned 20,000 ETH, which he swapped for 5,053,637 WERX. He then sent 4,429,817 WERX to the Uniswap pool. This amount was ten times the prior balance.</p>
<p class="s6">Afterward, he used the skim() function of Uniswap with the address 0x00...1 as the &ldquo;to&rdquo; address. He also used the transfer function of the Uwerx contract, which first modifies a sender&rsquo;s balance. </p>
<p class="s6">Since the &ldquo;to&rdquo; address was a UniswapPoolAddress (0x00...1), an extra 1% of the initial amount was burned. As a result, there was an imbalance that the attacker took advantage of to gain 176 ETH ($327,000).</p>
Uwerx Maintains Momentum As It Sets To Relaunch
<p class="s6">Despite the hack, Uwerx continues to shine as it devises ways to tackle the hack and maintain its momentum. Once they noticed the hack, they immediately alerted SolidProof and InterFiNetwork, their auditors. Also, the team contacted PeckShieldAlert and SlowMist_Team directly on Twitter. </p>
<p class="s6">The team began by putting out a white-hat bounty, stating the attacker should return 80% of the exploited funds and keep 20%. </p>
<p class="s6">A new WERX will be relaunched, and its platform will have more robust security measures. As to the relaunch, there will be a new contract address, which will be released to the community soon. </p>
<p class="s6">However, the contract address will be audited twice by reputable companies and once by an independent contractor. Due to a change in the contract address, the Uwerx Vault smart contracts are being altered, after which they will be audited before being released to the public.</p>
<p class="s6">The new WERX will be deployed on the Polygon network instead of Uniswap, on which it is currently deployed. This will enable token holders to easily use WERX on the Uwerxplatform without having to bridge, and it will also lower gas fees. </p>
<p class="s6">However, those who bought WERX on Uniswap will not be abandoned. The team has decided to airdrop the tokens at the end of the vesting period to ensure they still benefit. They also assure those who bought WERX during the presale that they are safe and will be unaffected by the relaunch.</p>
<p class="s6">The new WERX will be deployed with more liquidity. To do this, the funds reserved for the buyback campaign will be directed to liquidity. Also, the team is proposing a no-burn tax and a sliding sell tax, of which 100% will be directed to liquidity. </p>
<p class="s6">A poll is already up on Uwerx&rsquo;s Twitter page and Telegram channel, asking the community if they support a sliding sell tax wholly directed to liquidity. Another poll also asks the community how long the vesting period should be. </p>
<p class="s6">These polls will end on August 13, after which the development of the new WERX will commence on August 14. The team also welcomes feedback or opinions, which can be sent to feedback@uwerx.network.</p>
<p class="s6">Also, there will be press releases this week and another major announcement on August 21 to update the community on the new WERX development and plans for the relaunch. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx platform development is ongoing, and the team has completed certain sections like Settings, Security, Help Center, Login, Privacy Policy, Create Account, and Finished Payments.</p>
<p class="s6">The WERX allocations will also be changed, and the new allocation is:</p>
● Presale: 57% (427,500,000)
● User Performance Incentives: 6% (45,000,000) 
● Liquidity Reserve: 14% (105,500,000)
● Marketing: 9% (67,500,000) 
● Team Tokens: 6% (45,000,000) 
● Partnership Incentives: 2% (15,000,000)
● Joining Incentives: 6% ( 45,000,000) 
<p class="s6">At the end of the presale, 25,499,071 WERX will be burned. The airdrop and vesting schedules were shifted, and the new schedules have been released. Uwerx&rsquo;s whitepaper will also be modified to reflect the ongoing changes. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx is on to big things, and once the polls are concluded on August 13, the team will announce the specific details of the new WERX, as they are committed to launching it as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx&rsquo;s dedication throughout this period has been incredible. Their efforts in tackling this challenge have removed all forms of doubt and fear the community initially had. No wonder its community has continued to gather momentum, growing to over 2,500 Telegram members and 2,000 Twitter followers.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx remains focused on its vision, which is to be a change in freelancing, and no matter what, it is resolved to achieve this purpose. So why not throw in your support? Be a part of this value-driven community by following the links below:</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Bank of America reacts to the launch of PayPal&rsquo;s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin PYUSD and argues that the asset is not likely to be used widely, at least not in the short term.</p>
<p>PayPal&rsquo;s recent groundbreaking announcement about the launch of its U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin PYUSD has provoked its share of criticism around the world. While it does seem a significant step towards crypto adoption, some say that PayPal won&rsquo;t see much success any time soon.</p>
<p>One of the U.S. largest banks, Bank of America, described the main reasons why PayPal USD is not likely to witness immediate adoption in its recent research report.&nbsp;</p>
Competing Against CDBCs
<p>First of all, Bank of America&rsquo;s analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss explained that the PayPal&rsquo;s stablecoin might face intense competition on the market:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the longer term, we expect PYUSD to experience additional adoption headwinds as competition from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and yield-bearing stablecoins increases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is true that numerous countries are actively exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that could potentially compete with stablecoins as both are based on similar technologies and pegged to fiat currencies. Only this year, countries such as Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Japan, the UK, among others have reported new developments on the rollout of their CBDCs. There are speculations that the U.S. might also be working on its CBDC, even though some of the country&rsquo;s presidential candidates have claimed to be against it.</p>
Competing Against Other Stablecoins
<p>Besides, there are many other stablecoins PYUSD will have to compete with. Yield-bearing stablecoins are now especially attractive to investors, according to Bank of America:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Investors may have been fine holding non-yield bearing stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, when rates were close to zero, but yield-bearing stablecoins will likely become increasingly available and attractive with short-term rates above 5%.&rdquo;</p>

Dealing with Regulatory Scrutiny&nbsp;
<p>Finally, the analysts also suggested that PayPal could face regulatory troubles if traditional banks are banned from issuing stablecoins:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Investors are likely indifferent to which stablecoins they hold as long as the stablecoins are perceived as safe and accessible on the largest trading platforms. We do not expect PYUSD&rsquo;s launch to lead to accelerated regulatory clarity, given the stablecoin&rsquo;s issuance does not alter systemic risk for traditional markets, but the stablecoin may face regulatory headwinds if non-banks are ultimately barred from stablecoin issuance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only a day after PayPal had unveiled its stablecoin project, the U.S. Federal Reserve published new guidelines regarding the use of &ldquo;dollar tokens&rdquo; by American banks. According to the statement, in order to engage in any sort of activity linked to stablecoins, the U.S. banks will now have to receive a written supervisory non-objection from the Fed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, crypto scammers didn&rsquo;t wait long to try and profit from the big news and flooded decentralized exchanges with fake PayPal tokens.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>As cybercrimes rise in the country, Canada challenges local developers to create a secure repository for seized cryptocurrencies and NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
Challenge for Creating a Digital Asset Repository
<p>Due to a reported rise in crypto-related illegal activities across the country, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Shared Services Canada (SSC) are pursuing a solution that can facilitate the seizure and storage of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on various blockchains, according to the statement of August 10, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The RCMP requires the ability to safely and securely store digital assets that have been seized and retained, until their eventual disposition at the conclusion of any legal proceedings. The development of a centralized repository solution would allow police officers to seize these assets in a user friendly manner, while also offering significant security to prevent the theft of said assets during their storage,&rdquo; reads the statement.</p>

<p>The authorities dare the Canadian innovative developers to come up with a safe digital asset repository that would help the police seize and safeguard stolen assets, in an effort to decrease cryptocurrency frauds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RCMP outlines fourteen mandatory and three desirable features a proposed solution should have. The primary considerations require the repository to be able to accept and process transactions on the top 20 cryptocurrency networks by market capitalization, as well as onboard and support new blockchains in the future.</p>
<p>Other demands on the list include a native Android application; secure processes to protect assets and dispose of them if needed; daily automated verification and notifications on asset transfers; clear instructions on seizing assets for officers; and more. The RCMP also listed three NFT blockchains that must be supported by the system at this stage &ndash; Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants of the challenge can submit their idea until September 21, 2023. Up to four contracts for Phase 1 could result from the challenge. Then, only two eligible businesses will be invited to submit a proposal for Phase 2.&nbsp;</p>
Combatting Cryptocurrency-Related Crimes
<p>The main reason behind the development of the digital asset repository is the surge of crypto-related activities in Canada:</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the rise of new and innovative methods to store and transfer assets, Canadian Law enforcement needs a safe and secure method to identify and seize said assets. As cryptocurrency continues to gain popularity as a transaction method and store of value in the general population, it continues to be used as a payment method for criminal activities. With ransomware/malware attacks and online scams making up the majority of these transactions. This challenge aims to leverage the private sectors innovation to develop a system used by the police to seize and store the ill-gotten gains from these criminal activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Canada is not the only country that experiences a rise in crimes linked to digital assets. For example, the FBI in the US has also recently reported numerous scams related to cryptocurrencies and NFTs, with one of the recent cases resulting in the loss of staggering $9million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, other countries are also looking for effective ways to deal with crypto crimes. One of the latest examples is a multi-agency investigation unit established by South Korea.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="s5">TVL or the total value of digital assets locked in a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform is often used as a metric to judge the growth of a network. A recent report shows that Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) TVL have seen an upsurge. A new project, Pomerdoge (POMD), has shown potential, but can it keep up in the highly competitive cryptocurrency world?</p>

Ethereum and Cardano TVL Explodes
<p class="s5">The TVL metric is often used to judge the growth of a DeFi network. Recent reports from Messari have shown that the TVL of Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) has been on the rise despite the bearish crypto market.</p>
<p class="s5">According to Messari, the TVL of Cardano has increased by 198.6% year-to-date (YTD). Cardano now has more than $175 million locked in its DeFi ecosystem. The increase in TVL has helped Cardano move from the 34th position to the 21st in overall TVL across all blockchains.</p>
<p class="s5">Messari links the growth of Cardano&rsquo;s DeFi ecosystem to the launch of stablecoins, improved programming languages, and new wallets. On the other hand, Ethereum still dominates the DeFispace as the leading network. At the time of this writing, Ethereum has more than $23.5 billion in TVL.</p>
<p class="s5">The explosive growth of Cardano and Ethereum is considered impressive due to the recent price drop in crypto prices. With the prices of Ethereum and Cardano forecasted to recover by the end of 2023, the TVL locked in their respective chains could increase further.</p>
Can Pomerdoge (POMD) Catch Up in the DeFi Space?
<p class="s5">In the already competitive DeFi space, a new project, Pomerdoge (POMD), is launching to public acclaim from market experts. There are bullish predictions for Pomerdoge because it is creating a unique niche for itself. Pomerdoge would be the first project to combine the fanfare of crypto meme coins with the fast-growing play-to-earn sector.</p>
<p class="s5">Pomerdoge is building an enthralling game where players can earn rewards and alsocommunicate via a social infrastructure. With unique, eccentric avatars called Pomerdoge, players will enter competitions in the eye-catching world of Pomerdoges. In-game products and NFTs can be sold for real money in the Pomerplace, the ecosystem's marketplace.</p>
<p class="s5">The platform is growing at an impressive rate as players have great opportunities to earn. Players can enter weekly contests and giveaways for a chance to win up to $100,000 in weekly giveaways. Experts have predicted that Pomerdoge will compete with the biggest names in DeFias it perfectly fuses entertainment and financial opportunity.</p>
<p class="s5">As a result, many analysts have predicted that Pomerdoge will become one of the P2E games and stage one of the largest rallies before the end of the year. Early forecasts estimate a 4,000% price gain for the Pomerdoge utility coin by December. Investors have a wonderful opportunity to join the Pomerdoge ecosystem before its massive rally, which is now trading at $0.007.</p>

<p class="s11">As innovation is the driving force in the Web3 space, one project is capturing the attention of investors and blockchain analysts alike &ndash; Borroe Finance.

<p class="s11">As Borroe Finance continues its presale, the crypto community is excited over the potential of its native token, $ROE, to outperform even the mighty Ethereum.</p>
<p class="s11">At the heart of Borroe Finance lies its innovative marketplace, where businesses can mint Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing future revenue streams and outstanding invoices. </p>
<p class="s11">These NFTs are then sold at a discount, enabling Web3 startups to access upfront cash quickly and efficiently.

What further sets Borroe Finance apart is its commitment to regulation and best practices.

This strategic approach provides a solid foundation for investors, offering peace of mind and reducing potential risks associated with regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p class="s11">One of the standout features of Borroe Finance is its recent smart audit by BlockAudit, a top auditing firm renowned for its thorough analysis of blockchain projects. This audit underscores the project's commitment to security and trustworthiness, a vital factor in today's crypto landscape. </p>
<p class="s11">With the assurance of a reputable audit, $ROE's appeal as a safe investment option is further amplified.</p>

The Successful $ROE Presale 
<p class="s13">$ROE tokenomics is a cornerstone of Borroe Finance's ecosystem, designed to empower both investors and businesses within the Web3 space. </p>
<p class="s13">With a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens residing on the Polygon (Ethereum sidechain) chain, $ROE offers a unique value proposition differentiating it from traditional investments. </p>
<p class="s13">$ROE grants holders priority access to new sales in the Borroe marketplace, discounted fees, premium features, and rewards, including recognition and awards for marketplace participation. </p>
<p class="s13">Its role in facilitating the Borroe marketplace's streamlined processes and secure transactions makes $ROE essential, ensuring seamless interactions between buyers and sellers while driving growth in the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p class="s14">The presale stages of $ROE further enhance its appeal. With Stage One offering tokens at $0.0125 each, and the preceding Beta stage having sold out at $0.01 per token, early investors have witnessed the project's momentum and potential for value appreciation. </p>
<p class="s14">As the presale progresses through different stages, each with varying token prices, the tokenomics of $ROE creates an enticing opportunity for investors to participate in the project. </p>
<p class="s14">With the potential to outperform traditional investments and provide a unique gateway to the Web3 revolution, $ROE's tokenomics align investor incentives with Borroe Finance's mission of transforming the future of funding in the crypto space.</p>

$ROE to Dwarf ETH
<p class="s3">The crypto world is excited as Bluntz, a prominent trader known for accurately predicting Bitcoin's 2018 market bottom, unveils his latest analysis that's turning heads in the Ethereum (ETH) market. </p>
<p class="s3">In a recent tweet, Bluntz highlighted a nearly year-long wedge formation in the ETH/BTC trading pair, which he believes sets the stage for a "glorious" breakout. </p>
<p class="s3">The trader expressed optimism and signaled that the breakout might already be underway, suggesting a bullish target price of over 0.07 BTC (approximately $2,101). His prediction challenges the status quo, as he believes that many market participants are underprepared for Ethereum's potential upswing, making them vulnerable to a significant price movement.</p>
<p class="s11">Notably, Bluntz believes that Ethereum's bullish momentum has the potential to drive the price to an impressive high of 0.112 BTC (approximately $3,362). </p>
<p class="s11">This projection represents a substantial leap from Ethereum's current level of $1839. Investors and enthusiasts alike are eagerly watching Ethereum's price action, anticipating a "glorious" breakout and the potential for outsized gains continue to drive excitement within the crypto market. </p>
<p class="s11">As Ethereum's breakout scenario unfolds, $ROE's journey to outperforming ETH becomes an exciting narrative investors can't overlook. This is because, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum's price movements often serve as a barometer for the broader market sentiment. </p>
<p class="s11">Ethereum's significant moves can trigger other altcoins to surge even harder and outperform the leader.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Binance Labs, the venture capital and incubation division of Binance, has plunged $5 million into the Curve DAO Token (CRV), cementing its stance in the DeFi realm.&nbsp;</p>
Support From Industry Bigwigs
<p>The $5 million investment from Binance Labs in the CRV token is part of a strategic deal under which Curve will explore deployment to the BNB Chain. With $2.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) and a daily volume of $215 million, Curve is the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX).&nbsp;</p>
<p>CRV, the Ethereum-based utility token of the Curve DeFi protocol, serves as a linchpin for exchanging stablecoins and other ERC-20 tokens, alongside staking, boosting, and governance voting.</p>
<p>The DeFi platform was recently hit by a severe re-entrancy exploit that robbed it of over $60 million worth of funds from its liquidity pools. It affected Curve even further as several exchanges withdrew their support for the CRV token from their platforms. Binance Labs&rsquo; investment in the CRV token has somewhat reversed that effect, acting as a vote of confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform has also received support from other crypto bigwigs, like Justin Sun and DCF God.&nbsp;</p>
Binance Labs' Forward-Thinking Approach
<p>Yi He, Co-Founder of Binance and Head of Binance Labs, underscored the partnership's significance, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Curve is the largest stableswap, and as a key protocol in DeFi, it has contributed to the steady growth of the space in 2023. Binance Labs has offered our full support to Curve through our investment and strategic collaboration. We view this cooperation as a starting point and look forward to working together to further propel the growth of the DeFi ecosystem."</p>

Strategic Amalgamation for BNB Chain Boost
<p>Curve's multi-chain presence, capitalizing on speed and cost efficiency, is set to expand with its planned deployment to BNB Chain. This strategic move aims to bolster the growth of the BNB Chain DeFi ecosystem, amplifying its influence in the DeFi landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve founder Michael Egorov noted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"BNB Chain has earned a significant presence in DeFi, and is well positioned to deploy Curve's current and future products on its chain. We look forward to collaboratively fostering innovation and growth across the DeFi ecosystem."</p>

<p>The integration of Curve onto the BNB Chain will enhance scalability paving the way for handling more transactions and catering to the escalating user demand. Additionally, the alluring prospect of reduced transaction fees on BNB Chain serves as a magnet for cost-conscious users, solidifying the appeal of Curve.</p>

<p>Curve's multi-chain presence, capitalizing on speed and cost efficiency, is set to expand with its planned deployment to BNB Chain. This strategic move aims to bolster the growth of the BNB Chain DeFi ecosystem, amplifying its influence in the DeFi landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve founder Michael Egorov noted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"BNB Chain has earned a significant presence in DeFi, and is well positioned to deploy Curve's current and future products on its chain. We look forward to collaboratively fostering innovation and growth across the DeFi ecosystem."</p>

<p>The integration of Curve onto the BNB Chain will enhance scalability paving the way for handling more transactions and catering to the escalating user demand. Additionally, the alluring prospect of reduced transaction fees on BNB Chain serves as a magnet for cost-conscious users, solidifying the appeal of Curve.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>South Korean authorities have arrested the CEO of the Bitsonic crypto exchange, Jinwook Shin, for allegedly stealing $7.5 million dollars of user funds.&nbsp;</p>
Embezzlement Allegations
<p>Jinwook Shin was taken into custody by South Korean authorities on August 7th after an investigation uncovered that the CEO had been allegedly embezzling investments and deposits belonging to the exchange's users during the time period between January 2019 and May 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the initial report, Shin allegedly engaged in fraudulent activities that manipulated cryptocurrency prices and trading volume on Bitsonic, which led to the misappropriation of approximately $7.5 million (10 billion won) from user funds.&nbsp;</p>
Liquidity Issues Leads To Shutdown
<p>Despite facing liquidity problems and suspension of withdrawals on the crypto platform, Shin continued to provide cryptocurrencies to new customers. This persistence drew the attention of the Seoul cyber crime department, which alleged that Shin failed to purchase cryptocurrencies during this period, raising suspicions about the legitimacy of the exchange's operations.</p>
<p>In August 2021, the platform finally announced the closure of its operations, attributing the decision to "internal and external issues."&nbsp;</p>
<p>This announcement was followed by the shutdown of 11 domestic cryptocurrency platforms by South Korean authorities, who were investigating alleged fraudulent activities.</p>
Vice President Also Complicit
<p>The investigation further implicated the vice president of Bitsonic, who is believed to have played a role in devising a scheme to acquire the cryptocurrencies held by the CEO within the exchange system. The VP, who is referred to as Mr. A, was allegedly working hand-in-hand with Shin to buy the cryptocurrency held by the latter on the exchange platform. A shell company established in Singapore was allegedly used in the process of manipulation.</p>
Government's Stance Against Fraud And Cybercrime
<p>South Korean authorities have recently taken a tough stance against fraudulent activities within the digital asset industry. Last month, the Korea Securities Depository partnered with Code, a firm specializing in Travel Rules, to address the rise in unlawful activities within the virtual asset market. This partnership aims to promote the issuance and utilization of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) to enhance investor protection.</p>
<p>Additionally, the government has also been working on a crypto-tracking system, including an interagency investigation team, to counter cybercrime as a part of its commitment to ensuring the security and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>As the investigation into the alleged embezzlement unfolds, South Korea's proactive approach against fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency sector continues to underscore the nation's commitment to fostering a secure and trustworthy digital asset environment.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The US financial regulators&rsquo; attack on all things crypto continues as the Federal Reserve issues a new announcement obliging banks to jump through extremely exacting requirements in order to do business with crypto entities.</p>
<p>Referring to its recently established &ldquo;novel activities supervision program&rdquo;, the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s latest supervisory letter states that any&nbsp; banks wishing to do business in &ldquo;dollar tokens&rdquo; must obtain a written supervisory non-objection from the Fed before doing anything in line with this sort of activity.</p>
<p>This latest regulatory pronouncement might well have been inspired after seeing PayPal roll out its PYUSD stablecoin which seeks to become a bridge between fiat and Web3 for merchants and consumers alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This particular innovation for the dollar and crypto may have been seen as a step too far by US financial authorities, given the size of PayPal and its huge financial clout and influence.</p>
<p>The new strictures put in place by the Fed will make doing business in PayPal&rsquo;s stablecoin extremely challenging and demanding, requiring any bank to "identify, measure, monitor and control the risks of its activities,".</p>
<p>The Fed will then weigh up the risks for money laundering, substantial short term redemptions, and cybersecurity risks among others.</p>
<p>Obliging all companies wanting to do such business to follow such an exacting and arduous process is likely to put a real damper on the use of PayPal&rsquo;s PYUSD stablecoin and has led to some volatility in PayPal&rsquo;s stock price.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the Fed that is acting in such a manner either. The FDIC and the OCC, both very weighty financial agencies, have also put rules into place that crypto companies, and the businesses looking to interact with them, are likely to find burdensome and difficult to comply with.</p>
Opinion
<p>The financial agencies should act to give adequate protections to businesses and consumers from the issues that can arise from such groundbreaking financial innovations in the crypto sector, but instead they are acting as kingmakers in order to favour the banking industry from which they come.</p>
<p>Crypto came into being as a creative and innovative industry that favours speed, security and privacy, and puts the consumer first. However, cumbersome and pro-bank regulations are pulling crypto companies down to the same level as their lumbering banking competitors.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Huobi is doing its best to dispel the arrest and financial stability rumours that have led to a flight of funds.</p>
<p>Huobi Global, a prominent Asian crypto exchange, has found itself at the centre of some negative speculation recently. Over the past week the exchange has suffered from whispers of employee arrests, potential insolvency, and fraud allegations.</p>
The FUD
<p>The saga first unfolded when a tweet by Wu Blockchain hinted at investigations into several crypto exchange leaders by mainland authorities. At least one other Twitter account reported that multiple Huobi executives were apprehended by mainland police, with some staff even advised to exit the country.</p>
<p>In a swift response, Huobi refuted the claims. The company's representative made a request to the mentioned websites to rectify the "misinformation" and hinted at possible legal actions.</p>
<p>In a Kitco article on the subject, a message conversation between a spokesperson from Huobi and Adam Cochran of Cinneamhain Ventures was recorded. While the Huobi representative sought to avoid FUD, Cochran replied that his source was verified as a senior Tron executive, and repeated his claim that the spokesperson&rsquo;s &lsquo;colleagues&rsquo; were &ldquo;under criminal investigation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Despite these claims, Huobi has remained steadfast, dismissing the insolvency speculations as mere attempts to spread "fear, uncertainty, and doubt."</p>
The positives
<p>In the face of the ongoing turbulence, a Huobi representative confirmed the exchange&rsquo;s intention to pursue a VAT licence, highlighting the recent example of the introduction of a Hong Kong trading app for retail investors.</p>
<p>A substantial inflow to Huobi in USDT and USDC on August 8 and 9, as per data from Defi llama, was speculated to be from a wallet associated with Justin Sun, and has appeared to bolster investor confidence as Huobi's total locked assets made a notable rise from previous figures.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The Aave community has started voting on three crucial proposals that could help significantly reduce the protocol&rsquo;s exposure to Curve Finance&rsquo;s CRV token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two out of the three proposals in question opened for voting on the 10th of August.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Proposals
<p>The move by the Aave community comes as it attempts to limit the risk posed to the protocol by the large borrowing position held by Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve Finance. On-chain risk management platform Chaos Lab put forward the proposals. According to the platform, volatility in Curve markets had considerably increased after the recent exploit suffered by Curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CRV token is the native token of the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance. Curve founder Egorov had used as much as 30% of CRV&rsquo;s total market capitalization to take out nearly $60 million in loans on Aave. However, the Curve Finance hack significantly impacted the price of CRV, sending it plummeting. This made Egorov&rsquo;s position vulnerable, potentially exposing Aave to a liquidation risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The voting on the proposals is set to continue until the 12th of August. The first proposal seeks to reduce the liquidation threshold by 6% for CRV on Aave v2. This could lead to user accounts becoming subject to liquidation upon approval. The second proposal disables borrowing of CRV tokens on Polygon v3 and Ethereum. This would make it impossible to short CRV through the Aave protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two proposals to limit Aave&rsquo;s exposure have found overwhelming support in the community. So far, over 571,000 votes have been cast, with 100% of the votes in favor of limiting Aave&rsquo;s exposure to CRV.&nbsp;</p>
The Third Proposal&nbsp;
<p>With fears surrounding Egorov&rsquo;s loans, Aave&rsquo;s community is also voting on a third proposal, voting for which ends on the 11th of August. The proposal, put forward by Aave Chan founder Marc Zeller, calls on the Aave treasury to purchase $2 million worth of CRV tokens from Curve Finance. Zeller&rsquo;s reasoning for such a move is that it would signal that major DeFi players support Curve and the health of the larger DeFi ecosystem. However, this proposal has not gained as much support in the community, although a majority do support it. Currently, around 62% of votes favor the proposal, while 37% have voted against it.&nbsp;</p>
The Curve Finance Exploit&nbsp;
<p>Curve Finance suffered a major exploit at the beginning of the month, with hackers managing to siphon off millions worth of crypto. As a result of the hack, the protocol&rsquo;s CRV token saw a significant price drop, casting a long shadow on the DeFi ecosystem. The decline in CRV&rsquo;s value also put a $168 million lending position taken by Curve founder Michael Egorov at risk. If this position was liquidated, it could have disastrous consequences for the larger DeFi ecosystem, putting major protocols at risk. Following the exploit, crypto exchanges moved to suspend withdrawals, with Upbit among the first to act, suspending deposits and withdrawals of the CRV token.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, certain vulnerabilities have been discovered in some of the stablecoin pools associated with Curve (CRV). As a result, CRV is currently experiencing significant volatility. We advise exercising caution when considering any investments related to CRV. To ensure the safety of digital asset transactions, we have temporarily suspended deposits and withdrawals for CRV.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Curve and Egorov found support from prominent players in the crypto space. These include Power DeFi user DCF God, Jeffrey Huang, and Tron Foundation CEO Justin Sun. All have since stepped in and purchased CRV from Egorov, resulting in the principal value of Egorov&rsquo;s loans dropping to $54 million. Justin Sun posted a message in support of Curve, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excited to assist Curve! As steadfast partners, we remain committed to providing support whenever needed. Our joint efforts will introduce an @stusdt pool on Curve, amplifying user benefits. Together, we aim to empower the community and forge a decentralized finance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two proposals to limit Aave&rsquo;s exposure have found overwhelming support in the community. So far, over 571,000 votes have been cast, with 100% of the votes in favor of limiting Aave&rsquo;s exposure to CRV.&nbsp;</p>
The Third Proposal&nbsp;
<p>With fears surrounding Egorov&rsquo;s loans, Aave&rsquo;s community is also voting on a third proposal, voting for which ends on the 11th of August. The proposal, put forward by Aave Chan founder Marc Zeller, calls on the Aave treasury to purchase $2 million worth of CRV tokens from Curve Finance. Zeller&rsquo;s reasoning for such a move is that it would signal that major DeFi players support Curve and the health of the larger DeFi ecosystem. However, this proposal has not gained as much support in the community, although a majority do support it. Currently, around 62% of votes favor the proposal, while 37% have voted against it.&nbsp;</p>
The Curve Finance Exploit&nbsp;
<p>Curve Finance suffered a major exploit at the beginning of the month, with hackers managing to siphon off millions worth of crypto. As a result of the hack, the protocol&rsquo;s CRV token saw a significant price drop, casting a long shadow on the DeFi ecosystem. The decline in CRV&rsquo;s value also put a $168 million lending position taken by Curve founder Michael Egorov at risk. If this position was liquidated, it could have disastrous consequences for the larger DeFi ecosystem, putting major protocols at risk. Following the exploit, crypto exchanges moved to suspend withdrawals, with Upbit among the first to act, suspending deposits and withdrawals of the CRV token.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, certain vulnerabilities have been discovered in some of the stablecoin pools associated with Curve (CRV). As a result, CRV is currently experiencing significant volatility. We advise exercising caution when considering any investments related to CRV. To ensure the safety of digital asset transactions, we have temporarily suspended deposits and withdrawals for CRV.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Curve and Egorov found support from prominent players in the crypto space. These include Power DeFi user DCF God, Jeffrey Huang, and Tron Foundation CEO Justin Sun. All have since stepped in and purchased CRV from Egorov, resulting in the principal value of Egorov&rsquo;s loans dropping to $54 million. Justin Sun posted a message in support of Curve, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excited to assist Curve! As steadfast partners, we remain committed to providing support whenever needed. Our joint efforts will introduce an @stusdt pool on Curve, amplifying user benefits. Together, we aim to empower the community and forge a decentralized finance!&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The MakerDAO founder, Rune Christensen, has announced an airdrop for the Spark Protocol&rsquo;s native SPK token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the proposal, the tokens will be released gradually, with the proposal outlining the distribution of two billion SPK tokens over the next ten years.&nbsp;</p>
The SPK Token Airdrop&nbsp;
<p>The proposal is aimed at promoting long-term engagement with the platform and outlines the eventual distribution of two billion SPK tokens over ten years in an effort to incentivize the continued usage of the Spark Protocol. The SPK token will also act as a governance token for SparkDAO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goal of the SPK pre-farming airdrop is to give users and borrow-arbers a reason to keep using Spark Protocol if the EDSR proposal to increase stability fees to 5% goes through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Rune, the proposal would be an avenue for the community to secure SPK tokens before the launch of the SubDAO, with Rune stating on X,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I posted an overview of the potential SparkDAO SPK pre-farming airdrop for early users of http://sparkprotocol.io borrowing: This would be a way to secure early SPK tokens before the SubDAOs launch (Farming not available to US and VPN users)&rdquo;</p>

Spark Expected To Become SubDAO&nbsp;
<p>Spark Protocol is a lending protocol that has been introduced by MakerDAO. The protocol provides DeFi loans, sourcing liquidity directly from Maker. As collateral, the protocol accepts several assets, such as DAI, ETH, and Staked ETH. Spark Protocol eventually aims to become a SubDAO, which marks a significant step in Maker&rsquo;s Endgame Plan. As a subDAO, Spark will be an entirely independent, decentralized autonomous organization within MakerDAO. The Endgame plan envisions the creation of several subDAOs similar to Spark, each governed by its own distinct community and token.&nbsp;</p>
A Way To Incentivize Usage&nbsp;
<p>The SubDAO tokens will be allocated to Spark borrowers and will utilize several assets as collateral, distributed proportionately towards the amount and duration of borrowing. According to Christensen, the aim is to bootstrap a community of users and DAO participants whose goals are aligned with SparkDAO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to bootstrap a community of users and DAO participants that are aligned with the mission and potential of SparkDAO.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eventual goal is to incentivize the Spark token&rsquo;s active usage, despite it offering a 5% yield on DAI deposits, also called Enhanced DAI Savings Rate. The EDSR on Spark climbed to 8% earlier in the week, resulting in a significant inflow of capital as users rushed to leverage borrowing arbitrage opportunities. This saw users borrow DAI at lower rates and then deploy it for higher yields in EDSR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maker&rsquo;s new Spark Protocol has courted controversy following its launch after it emerged that the protocol&rsquo;s terms of service actively prevented users from accessing the platform through virtual private networks (VPNs). By limiting VPN access, MakerDAO appeared to be restricting US-based users from accessing the platform.&nbsp;</p>
Maker&rsquo;s Endgame Plan&nbsp;
<p>MakerDAO&rsquo;s Endgame is a significant update planned to enhance the protocol&rsquo;s efficiency, resilience, and participation. It aims to do this by creating a strong governance equilibrium that would act as the bedrock for SubDAOs, helping parallelize growth and innovation in a community-driven ecosystem. In the short term, Endgame hopes to enhance the supply of DAI to over 100 billion within three years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also aims to ensure that the Maker ecosystem is anchored in a vibrant and independent DAO economy that could grow at an accelerating rate. At the same time, it would also maintain governance equilibrium, ensuring it could scale to any size.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto exchange Bittrex has agreed to a $24 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), bringing to a close allegations of offering unregistered securities to American investors.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The announcement, made on Thursday, comes within two months of Bittrex's bankruptcy filing and follows the trend of regulatory scrutiny facing cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
Bittrex's Position and SEC's Allegations
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Bittrex, which filed for bankruptcy in May, was sued by the SEC earlier this year. The regulator's charges revolved around the simultaneous operation of the company as a securities exchange, broker, and clearinghouse without appropriate registration, allegations that have also been leveledd at Coinbase and Binance.US.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the settlement agreement, Bittrex neither admits nor denies the allegations. The terms also stipulate that Bittrex will have 90 days after its liquidation plan is effective to pay the SEC, and any delays may prompt the regulator to seek court judgment.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">SEC Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said the following in an official statement:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Today&rsquo;s settlement makes clear that you cannot escape liability by simply changing labels or altering descriptions, because what matters is the economic realities of those offerings [as such]."</p>

Context and Details of the Settlement
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The case against Bittrex is rooted in its alleged role as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearing agency in providing services to U.S. investors in connection with crypto assets. Part of the charges includes an accusation that Bittrex worked closely with token issuers to edit online statements to circumvent federal securities laws.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The settlement, subject to court approval, includes financial components: disgorgement of $14.4 million, prejudgment interest of $4 million, and a civil penalty of $5.6 million, culminating in a total monetary payment of $24 million.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, noted in his remarks that:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;[For years], Bittrex worked with token issuers to 'scrub' their online statements of any indicia that they were investment contracts&mdash;all in an effort to evade the federal securities laws. They failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The settlement underscores the broader regulatory landscape and the SEC's vigilant stance against non-compliance in the crypto industry. The outcome serves as a reminder to other crypto exchanges of the necessity to adhere to existing regulations, in a market that continues to draw significant attention from both investors and regulators.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Bittrex's settlement with the SEC, centering on unregistered operationbs as a broker, exchange, and clearing agency, brings further focus to the compliance measures (and, by extension, frameworks designed to adapt specifically for crypto) necessary in the space. The detailed legal agreements and financial components of the settlement highlight the regulatory challenges and ongoing efforts to bring clarity to the industry.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, fell victim to a sophisticated phishing scam after its social media account on X, previously known as Twitter, was hijacked.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The perpetrators posted a series of fraudulent messages on August 9, promising a giveaway of &ldquo;BCAP&rdquo; tokens. They provided a link to a fake website closely resembling Blockchain Capital's original site, intending to deceive users into linking their cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The fraudulent website had a minor alteration in its URL, adding an extra 'n', a detail easily missed by unsuspecting users. The scam strategy also involved a sense of urgency by stating the giveaway would only be available for a day, aiming to exploit the fear of missing out. Notably, to prevent potential exposure, the comments section was deactivated, inhibiting users from flagging the scam.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prompt action from informed members of the blockchain community led to the swift identification of the deceit. Blockchain Capital reestablished control over its account within hours, removing the misleading posts. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This cyber intrusion follows a broader pattern of scams in the crypto space, as highlighted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recently. The agency issued a warning about the increasing instances of criminals posing as non-fungible token (NFT) developers. These fraudsters hack into high-profile social media accounts, falsely advertising new NFT releases. Victims are directed to counterfeit websites where, once their crypto wallets are linmked, funds are syphoned using malicious smart contracts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the FBI, stolen tokens are then laundered through multiple cryptocurrency mixers and exchanges, obfuscating their tracks.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Blockchain Capital breach echoes a similar incident from April involving the crypto exchange platform, KuCoin. Its social media account was compromised, leading to a fake giveaway scam resulting in a loss of over $22.6K in cryptocurrency. In response, KuCoin assured full compensation to the impacted customers and emphasized the continued security of assets on its platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao, CEO of Binance, a global cryptocurrency exchange, recently warned of the uptick in such phishing attacks and advised the community against using text message-based two-factor authentication. Instead, he recommended more secure methods like hardware devices.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the frequency and sophistication of these cyber-attacks on the rise, stakeholders within the cryptocurrency domain remain on high alert, reinforcing the necessity for enhanced digital security measures.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">MakerDAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) stalwart, is facing heightened scrutiny after the introduction of its new platform, Spark Protocol.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The controversy arises from Spark Protocol's terms of service, which actively prevent users from accessing the platform via virtual private networks (VPNs). By limiting VPN access, it appears MakerDAO is attempting to restrict U.S. users from the platform, causing a ripple effect on global user rights and igniting concerns over privacy in the DeFi sector.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The decision to restrict VPN access follows closely on the heels of Rune Christensen, MakerDAO's founder, announcing the potential for DAI stablecoin holders to earn up to 8% returns via the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) on Spark Protocol. The appeal of these high yields comes from a system adjustment: when DSR adoption is sparse, the rate increases to attract users. Despite only 9% of DAI holders currently participating in DSR, the platform's mechanism automatically optimizes rates based on user engagement.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite these prospective states, behind this innovative yield mechanism lies a broader issue. The DeFi space, characterized by its decentralized ethos and user autonomy, is now confronting questions about the balance between regulatory compliance and individual privacy rights.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Chris Blec, a DeFi analyst, voiced strong concerns over Spark Protocol's VPN restrictions. Blec's stance is that MakerDAO's decision could compromise global user privacy, potentially prioritizing profit motives over decentralized principles. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This contention around user rights and access isn't isolated. Over the past year, DAI's market trajectory experienced turbulence. Its market cap plummeted by 43%, from $7B to $4B, after a destabilizing event in March when both DAI and USDC stablecoins momentarily dropped below their usual peg. Concerns arose about the solvency of USDC's banking partners, and since DAI's collateral heavily comprised USDC, both tokens suffered.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MakerDAO's strategy, introducing high DSR yields through Spark Protocol, aims to bolster its position in the volatile stablecoin ecosystem. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On the contrary, by blocking VPN access, MakerDAO has placed itself in the crosshairs of a larger debate around the intersection of regulatory compliance, decentralized operations, and user rights in the crypto domain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While it remains that there is a need to evaluate the implications of MakerDAO's recent decisions, the line between user privacy and platform governance is set to be a defining conversation in the industry's DeFi sector.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The French financial regulator announced amendments to its registration requirements for digital asset service providers as it prepares for MiCA&rsquo;s implementation. </p>
<p>France&rsquo;s Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF) announced it would introduce &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; requirements for crypto firms as it prepared for the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework.</p>
Amendments to Align with MiCA
<p>The AMF has amended its registration requirements for digital asset service providers (DASPs) to better align with the EU&rsquo;s upcoming regulatory framework. The regulator said its &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; requirements will take effect on January 1, 2024.</p>
<p>In its announcement, the AMF said the changes have two objectives:</p>

<p>&ldquo;to incorporate into the General Regulation and its policy the provisions applicable to DASPs subject to &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; registration. This regime will become mandatory from January 1, 2024, for new players wishing to provide the four services subject to mandatory registration;&rdquo;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&ldquo;align the requirements for DASPs licence with those for European authorisation for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under the MiCA Regulation, and allow a fast track procedure to be implemented towards CASP authorisation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>France already has a relatively comprehensive licensing regime for crypto firms and is implementing changes to its regulation to comply with MiCA which will take effect within the next 12 &ndash; 18 months.</p>
EU Signs MiCA Into Law
<p>The European Union announced in May that it formally signed MiCA into law. MiCA has been in the works for a long time and will introduce a comprehensive framework for licensing and regulating crypto businesses operating within the EU.</p>
<p>France has been one of the most welcoming countries for regulating the crypto sector. The governor of the Bank of France called for a stricter and more comprehensive licensing regime for crypto companies after 2022&rsquo;s market turmoil.</p>
<p>Recognising the need for heightened regulatory scrutiny, the French National Assembly voted on new measures for crypto regulation, including a new set of compliance frameworks for new crypto firms seeking registration in France.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) issued a warning addressing investors against crypto platforms &ldquo;engaging in improper practices.&rdquo; </p>
<p>On Monday, Hong Kong regulators issued a warning to unlicensed crypto platforms &ldquo;engaging in improper practices.&rdquo; The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said some platforms are falsely claiming to have applied for registration. HashKey and OSL are the only two licensed exchanges in the city. &nbsp;</p>
SFC Takes a &ldquo;Dim View&rdquo; of Non-Compliance
<p>The SFC warned the unlicensed crypto platform advising investors to beware of these operations trading without the necessary registration. In a press release, the regulator said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has observed some unlicensed virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) engaging in improper practices. This statement warns VATPs of the potential legal and regulatory consequences of these improper practices and reminds investors to be wary of the risks of trading virtual assets on unregulated VATPs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The regulator said it became aware of exchanges conducting business after falsely claiming to have applied to it for registration. The SFC noted such false claims aim to &ldquo;give the public a false sense of assurance&rdquo; with the goal of &ldquo;inducing another person to trade in virtual assets&rdquo; and are an offence under Hong Kong&rsquo;s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is doing everything possible to regulate the industry and introduce a new licensing regime for virtual asset service providers. On 1 June, the SFC introduced a new regulatory framework for platforms engaging in trading activities. Under the regulations, such providers can apply to the SFC for licenses to legitimise their operations. Hong Kong&rsquo;s approach to regulation aims to provide a structured environment for investors and traders. The Hashkey Exchange recently announced it obtained a license from the SFC, making it the first cryptocurrency platform allowed to offer services to retail users.</p>
<p>The SFC further warned the public that some unlicensed platforms continue to launch new products and services under existing entities that do not comply with its regulatory requirements. The Commission explained:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For example, they may, under new or existing entities, launch certain virtual assets for trading by retail clients, trading services in virtual asset derivatives, or arrangements involving virtual assets such as virtual asset &lsquo;deposits,&rsquo; &lsquo;savings&rsquo; or &lsquo;earnings&rsquo; which are not allowed under the new regime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The regulator advised investors trading on unregulated exchanges that they could risk &ldquo;losing their entire investment&rdquo; held on that exchange should they discontinue their operations, collapse, or are hacked.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Reserve of the U.S. issued new guidelines regarding the use of stablecoins and other digital assets by the national banks.</p>
Fed Tightens the Regulation of Stablecoins
<p>Just a day after PayPal had announced the launch of its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin PYUSD, the Federal Reserve of the U.S. published new guidelines clarifying the ways state member banks can interact with dollar-denominated digital currencies.</p>
<p>Basically, national banks are now required to seek permission of the Federal Reserve to engage in any sorts of activities related to the U.S. dollar-pegged digital assets, referred to as &ldquo;dollar tokens&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the statement, state member banks need to notify the Federal Reserve about the activities they mean to perform with the use of dollar tokens, whether it is issuing, holding, transacting, or even testing digital assets. The Federal Reserve might ask for additional information regarding the proposed activity. To proceed with the use of stablecoins in any way, the bank needs to receive a &ldquo;a written notification of supervisory nonobjection from the Federal Reserve&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A state member bank seeking to engage in such dollar token activities, including for the purpose of testing, must notify its lead supervisory point of contact at the Federal Reserve of the bank&rsquo;s intention to engage in the proposed activity and should include a description of the proposed activity. Federal Reserve supervisory staff may follow up with the bank to seek additional information in order to better understand the proposal and the control framework that the state member bank has put in place. After receiving a written notification of supervisory nonobjection, state member banks will continue to be subject to supervisory review and heightened monitoring of these activities,&rdquo; reads the statement.</p>

Mitigating Risks Related to the Use of &ldquo;Dollar Tokens&rdquo;
<p>To acquire the notification of nonobjection from the Federal Reserve, the bank needs to showcase an effective system of risk management and the ability to measure and control the risks of the proposed stablecoin activities on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve outlines five major types of risks linked to the use of dollar tokens:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">operational risks: associated with the governance and the management of the network;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">cybersecurity risks: related to the stablecoin&rsquo;s network, smart contracts, and any use of open source code;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">liquidity risks, such as high redemptions of the token in a short period of time;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">illicit finance risks: customer identity verification, due diligence, monitoring suspicious activities, etc;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">consumer compliance risks: related to identifying and ensuring compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Federal Reserve has also reported that it would evaluate the banks&rsquo; comprehension of the relevant laws and their commitment to them.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>India has challenged its residents to develop an indigenous web browser with the feature of signing documents digitally through crypto tokens.</p>
Self-Reliant India
<p>In its press release of August 9, 2023, the Indian Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology (MeitY) announced the launch of the Indian Web Browser Development Challenge (IWBDC).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The IWBDC is an Open Challenge Competition that seeks to inspire and empower technology enthusiasts, innovators, and developers from all corners of the country to create an indigenous web browser with its own trust store with an inbuilt CCA India root certificate, cutting edge functionalities and enhanced security &amp; data privacy protection features,&rdquo; reads the statement.</p>

<p>One of the key features that&rsquo;s expected to be supported by the browser is the digital signing of documents through a crypto token, with the aim to enhance the security of transactions and digital engagements.</p>
<p>The release of the India&rsquo;s native multifunctional web browser will mark a significant step towards &ldquo;Aatmanirbhar Bharat&rdquo; (translates to &ldquo;self-reliant India&rdquo;), Prime Minister Modi&rsquo;s plan to make the country more independent, technologically and economically .</p>

<p>&ldquo;Digital India has revolutionized how our nation functions, empowering citizens, boosting the economy and enhancing overall governance. As we move forward, embracing technology and promoting indigenous innovation will be pivotal in realizing the vision of a self-reliant, digitally empowered India,&rdquo; said Smt Sunita Verma, Scientist G &amp; GC (R&amp;D in Electronics &amp; IT).</p>

<p>The Indian Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), Shri Arvind Kumar, strives to ensure the security of digital certificates issued within the country and contributes to developing a robust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) framework that would enable secure electronic transactions throughout the nation.</p>
<p>However, India has been reliant on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates issued by foreign entities&rsquo; roots. Now, the challenge is to integrate India Root Certificate into the upcoming national browser, thus addressing the issue and making the country more &ldquo;Internet Resilient&rdquo;.</p>
Who Can Participate in the Challenge?
<p>All of the country&rsquo;s creative minds, including academia, industry, start-ups, or individuals, are encouraged to take part in the challenge and submit an idea for the innovative Indian web browser that could cater to a global audience.</p>
<p>The challenge will consist of three rounds: 18 participants will be selected in the first round, shortlisted to 8 in the second one, with only 3 coming to the final round. The winner will be granted 34 million Indian rupees (around $411,000) and will receive additional support in further development of the new browser.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The waitlist for the integration of a self-custody wallet TON Space within Telegram Messenger is now available for developers.</p>
Merging Web2 and Web3
<p>On Wednesday, August 9, the TON, a blockchain system originally created by Telegram, announced the launch of its self-custodial crypto wallet TON Space that would be integrated in the prominent messaging app. The product is now in its beta phase and available for developers only.</p>
<p>By applying for the beta version of TON Space, developers will have a chance to integrate the wallet into their apps before everyone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TON Space aims at facilitating the Web3 adoption by offering the whole user experience entirely within Telegram Messenger. Developers will be able to build their apps, integrate the blockchain, and unboard their users without leaving the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The developers&rsquo; beta is a critical moment in launching the first self-custodial wallet built into a thriving Web2 platform,&rdquo; said Jordan Dunne, Head of DeFi at Wallet. &ldquo;The introduction of TON Space will allow blockchain developers to build Web3 services that feel like the intuitive mobile app experiences users have every day. Easy-to-use and all without ever leaving Telegram, with 800 million users every month, this opens up a staggering growth opportunity for builders.&rdquo;</p>

Main Features of TON Space
<p>As a self-custody wallet, TON Space will provide its users with full control over their assets, allowing them to store, trade, and manage crypto within Telegram. One of the unique advantages of TON Space is that it can be seamlessly linked to any app built on Telegram, all integrated within a single ecosystem. According to the press release, TON Space is the most highly anticipated feature among the users who wish to have full access to the TON network within Telegram Messenger.</p>
<p>The custodial wallet is expected to open for consumer use by the end of Q3 2023. The team also plans to integrate NFT collectables and swapping services into the product by that time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The launch of TON Space is a significant milestone that establishes a new infrastructure layer for the TON ecosystem,&rdquo; commented Justin Hyun, Director of Growth at TON Foundation. &ldquo;The power to build decentralized applications and bots fully integrated inside of Telegram cannot be underestimated. These services, and their users, will now enjoy the infinite possibilities that come with the power to store, manage, and trade assets within Telegram.&rdquo;</p>

Telegram vs Twitter?
<p>By integrating the crypto wallet, Telegram, which has always had an unwavering emphasis on privacy and security, is now officially entering the Web3 space. The move makes the global messenger a key player in the industry, which could potentially compete with such giants as X (previously known as Twitter), recently bought and rebranded by Elon Musk.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The new collaboration between Microsoft and Aptos Labs will use the best of AI and blockchain technologies to drive Web3 into the masses.</p>
Why Does Aptos Need AI?
<p>On Wednesday, August 9, Aptos Labs, a crypto project founded by Facebook ex-employees, announced its new partnership with tech giant Microsoft. The Layer 1 blockchain will use Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to help onboard new users to Web3.</p>
<p>Even though both blockchain and AI are being developed at astonishing speed, their adoption by the global population can be challenging due to user skepticism around the technologies. To facilitate and speed up the onboarding process, Aptos Labs joins forces with Microsoft to introduce Aptos Assistant, an AI-driven chatbot, similar to the distinguished ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aptos Assistant will help everyday Internet users bridge seamlessly from Web2 to Web3. The AI tool will be able to answer any questions regarding the Aptos blockchain ecosystem, and will guide developers through the creation of smart contracts and decentralized apps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Artificial Intelligence and blockchain technologies are quickly converging for one important reason: they are both generational breakthroughs that profoundly impact the evolution of the internet and shape society," commented Mo Shaikh, CEO of Aptos Labs. "Together with Microsoft, our shared vision is to ensure that this technology is accessible to more people and organizations than ever before."</p>
<p>"The intersection of AI and blockchain is one of the most interesting combinations of emerging technologies and can generate transformational use cases," said Rashmi Misra, General Manager, AI &amp; Emerging Technologies, Microsoft. "By fusing Aptos Labs' technology with the Microsoft Azure Open AI Service capabilities, we aim to democratize the use of blockchain enabling users to seamlessly onboard to Web3 and innovators to develop new exciting decentralized applications using AI."</p>

Why Does Microsoft Need Blockchain?
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why the tech giant wants to infuse its AI model into Aptos Web3 solutions. Microsoft explains that blockchain technology can provide more transparency to the AI-generated content, making it more credible and trustworthy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For example, how do we know that LLM-generated outputs are authentic [and] trustworthy? How do we know that the training data is bias free in the first place? Blockchain-based solutions can help with verifying, time-stamping and attributing content to its source, thereby improving credibility in a distributed digital economy,&rdquo; said Daniel An, global director of business development for AI and Web3 at Microsoft.</p>

<p>The choice of the Aptos network can be explained by its phenomenal speed &ndash; the blockchain can support up to 160,000 transactions per second.</p>
Digital Payments and CBDCs
<p>According to the press release, Microsoft and Aptos have also agreed to collaborate upon innovative solutions, such as asset tokenization, payments, and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). This will also be part of the effort towards Web3 adoption. Additionally, Aptos will operate validator nodes on Azure to make its blockchain more secure and reliable.</p>
<p>Following the news, the Aptos token jumped by around 17% and is hovering at $7.36 at the moment of writing.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The new collaboration between Microsoft and Aptos Labs will use the best of AI and blockchain technologies to drive Web3 into the masses.</p>
Why Does Aptos Need AI?
<p>On Wednesday, August 9, Aptos Labs, a crypto project founded by Facebook ex-employees, announced its new partnership with tech giant Microsoft. The Layer 1 blockchain will use Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to help onboard new users to Web3.</p>
<p>Even though both blockchain and AI are being developed at astonishing speed, their adoption by the global population can be challenging due to user skepticism around the technologies. To facilitate and speed up the onboarding process, Aptos Labs joins forces with Microsoft to introduce Aptos Assistant, an AI-driven chatbot, similar to the distinguished ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aptos Assistant will help everyday Internet users bridge seamlessly from Web2 to Web3. The AI tool will be able to answer any questions regarding the Aptos blockchain ecosystem, and will guide developers through the creation of smart contracts and decentralized apps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Artificial Intelligence and blockchain technologies are quickly converging for one important reason: they are both generational breakthroughs that profoundly impact the evolution of the internet and shape society," commented Mo Shaikh, CEO of Aptos Labs. "Together with Microsoft, our shared vision is to ensure that this technology is accessible to more people and organizations than ever before."</p>
<p>"The intersection of AI and blockchain is one of the most interesting combinations of emerging technologies and can generate transformational use cases," said Rashmi Misra, General Manager, AI &amp; Emerging Technologies, Microsoft. "By fusing Aptos Labs' technology with the Microsoft Azure Open AI Service capabilities, we aim to democratize the use of blockchain enabling users to seamlessly onboard to Web3 and innovators to develop new exciting decentralized applications using AI."</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The Central Bank of Brazil reveals the official brand name of the upcoming government-backed &ldquo;digital real&rdquo; &ndash; DREX.</p>
What Does DREX Stand For?
<p>On Monday, August 7, the Central Bank of Brazil broadcasted a live conversation on the topic &ldquo;What will change for me with the Digital Real?&rdquo; on the institution&rsquo;s official YouTube account. F&aacute;bio Ara&uacute;jo, coordinator of the digital real, Aristides Cavalcante, deputy head of the Central Bank's technology and information department, and Gustavo Igreja, communications specialist at the Central Bank of Brazil, discussed the main features of the anticipated CBDC (central bank digital currency).</p>
<p>As it was revealed during the broadcast, the official name of the digital real will be the acronym &ldquo;DREX&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;DREX combines several elements of innovation: the D for digital, R for real, E for electronic, and X for transaction, taking a step further in this family of Pix that we created and was a success,&rdquo; Ara&uacute;jo explained.</p>

<p>* Pix is the instant payment system developed by the Central Bank of Brazil and widely used across the country. Pix is a way to transfer money from one account to another instantly and free of charge by using a QR code or an ID such as phone number, email, or CPF (the taxpayer registry number) via any bank&rsquo;s application.</p>
The Meaning Behind DREX&rsquo; Logo
<p>The official logo of DREX also represents the evolution of Brazil&rsquo;s currency in the digital environment:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alluding to a transaction, the two arrows that lean into the 'D' relate to the evolution of the real to the digital environment, reinforcing the attribute of agility, and the use of colors, in a transition from blue to light green, conveys the message of 'transaction completed,'&rdquo; the Central Bank of Brazil stated.</p>

How Will the Digital Real Work?
<p>The authorized entities will mint the digital real with the help of a similar-to-blockchain distributed ledger technology. DREX will support the trading of public treasury bonds, transactions backed by Web3 infrastructure for token burning, creation, and registration. Thus, the tokenized real will be the representation of the digital real and will be managed exclusively by authorized financial institutions.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Brazil claimed that DREX will make the life of Brazilians easier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The solution, previously referred to as the Digital Real, will provide citizens and entrepreneurs with a safe and regulated environment for the creation of new businesses and a more democratic access to the benefits of the economic digitization&rdquo;, highlighted the agency.</p>

<p>Apparently, the Brazilian CBDC project has been in works since at least the beginning of this year. The Central Bank of Brazil plans to start the digital real pilot testing in September 2023. However, DREX is expected to be widely available to the population no earlier than the end of 2024.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Prominent stablecoin issuer Circle announces the launch of its Web3 Programmable Wallets public beta version for developers on three blockchains.</p>
The First Product of Circle&rsquo;s Web3 Services Line
<p>On Tuesday, August 8, 2023, global fintech company Circle, known for its USDC stablecoin, announced the launch of Programmable Wallets, the first product of the platform&rsquo;s Web3 Services product line. The public beta version of Programmable Wallets is now available for businesses, developers, and builders. The product currently supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche networks, with other chains coming soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programmable Wallets allows developers to seamlessly integrate secure crypto wallets into any application, thus expediting the adoption of Web3 and blockchain technologies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;​​Programmable Wallets bridge the gap between today&rsquo;s internet and blockchain networks by abstracting complexities such as private key security, blockchain node operations, transaction management, interoperability across blockchains, and many others to enable developers to iterate on applications faster,&rdquo; reads the statement on the Circle&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p>One of Programmable Wallets&rsquo; key features is that it gives developers the freedom to customize the crypto wallet experience to best fit their use case. This helps greatly increase customer satisfaction because different types of apps (DeFi, games, e-commerce, etc.) will use their crypto wallet in different ways.</p>
<p>Programmable Wallets offers a self-service, end-to-end solution, enabling developers to register, build, and implement their first wallets and transactions within minutes. The developer console provides all the necessary tools for debugging, launching, and scaling Web3 applications.</p>
<p>According to the company&rsquo;s press release, these are the core features of Programmable Wallets:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">User-controlled wallets: gives end-users full control of their assets;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Developer-controlled wallets: allows developers manage assets on behalf of users;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">REST APIs manage both user-controlled and developer-controlled wallets;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">iOS and Android SDKs speed up development processes and facilitate wallet UI customization;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Webhooks keep users updated on their incoming or outgoing transactions;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Wallet operations dashboard enables developers to monitor transactions;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Multiparty computation (MPC) is a built-in cryptographic security configuration;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Blockchains Agnostic allows to build a wallet once and use it across different blockchains;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Pay-as-you-grow provides a rebate on USDC usage, starting at $0.05/Monthly Active Wallet.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Other features such as Gas Abstraction and Smart Contract Wallets should be rolled out shortly.</p>
Circle Expands the Range of Its Web3 Solutions
<p>Earlier this year, Circle launched a Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to allow permissionless transfers of USDC natively across supported blockchains. A couple of months later, the platform announced the operationalization of its CCTP on Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum network, with the aim to make the USDC transfers faster and more secure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With USDC, CCTP, Programmable Wallets, and our broader Web3 Services offering, our goal is to make it easy for developers to rapidly build, deploy, and scale blockchain-powered apps for a variety of use cases, regardless of the blockchain network they choose to build on,&rdquo; the Senior Director of Product Management at Circle, Gagan Mac, wrote in the statement. </p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Global interest in non-fungible tokens has sharply plummeted as the base prices of prominent NFT collections have declined since 2022. Peaking at $5.8 billion in January 2022, NFT trading volume dropped to $707.70 million in June 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert Quartly-Janeiro, CSO of Bitrue, a Tier 1 crypto exchange, says:</p>

<p>"FOMO fueled the massive surge in the NFT market, but the decline in trading volume by 90% from the last year&rsquo;s peak shows the dynamics has shifted. Barriers such as skepticism towards NFTs as potential scams, lack of sustained interest, scalability challenges, and lack of clear use cases are hindering the wide adoption of non-fungibles."</p>

<p>As fundamental elements of Web3, NFTs, and metaverse projects have a lot of scope and opportunity. In this shifting environment, mainstream digital media is poised to play a significant role, given its power to amplify trends or foster skepticism.&nbsp;</p>
NFT Plazas: All the Latest NFT and Metaverse News
<p>Founded in 2018, NFT Plazas offers daily insights into the multifaceted spheres of non-fungible tokens and the broader metaverse. Over its years of operation, the independent NFT news platform has methodically carved out a reputation as a leader in NFT and metaverse coverage.</p>
<p>It delivers timely industry news, feature articles with thorough educational content, insightful data analyses, and performs due diligence and analysis on new NFT projects. This blend of content makes the often convoluted world of Web3 technologies more accessible to laypeople.</p>
<p>The outlet concentrates on quality over hype, aiming to demystify the space and reduce barriers of entry. In a field where misinformation is rampant, NFT Plazas helps to ensure that accurate, unbiased information is always at the reader&rsquo;s fingertips.</p>
Media and NFTs: The symbiotic catalysts for adoption
<p>With its expansive reach and influence, the media has been instrumental in narrating the story of non-fungibles, delineating their value, and encouraging their adoption. As NFTs enter mainstream consciousness, it serves as passive observer and an active participant, crafting narratives that influence perception, drive interest, and foster understanding.</p>
<p>Social media platforms have also metamorphosed into bustling marketplaces where buyers, sellers, and mediators intersect, while platforms like Twitter and Discord continue to serve as critical nodes of discovery and discussion. The synergy between NFTs and social media hints at a future where the line between digital assets and traditional online interactions further blurs.</p>
<p>"The role of media is not just to report on the world of crypto, metaverses, and NFTs," commented Mary Pedler, Founder of Input PR communications agency for cutting-edge crypto and tech projects. "It actively shapes perceptions, demystifies complexities, and lowers the entry threshold for the average user."</p>
<p>NFT Plazas, acutely aware of the challenges of NFT adoption, harnesses the power of media to bridge knowledge gaps. They employ a multi-pronged approach, where comprehensive educational content aids the uninitiated, while data-driven insights offer value to veterans. While their educational efforts have garnered praise, more aggressive marketing techniques might find lesser traction among a discerning audience wary of hype.</p>
<p>The media's role in Web3 and the broader digital asset landscape is pivotal. As gatekeepers of information, platforms like NFT Plazas can influence the trajectory of NFT adoption, ensuring that the metamorphosis of the digital realm is rooted in knowledge, transparency, and trust.</p>

<p>Founded in 2018, NFT Plazas offers daily insights into the multifaceted spheres of non-fungible tokens and the broader metaverse. Over its years of operation, the independent NFT news platform has methodically carved out a reputation as a leader in NFT and metaverse coverage.</p>
<p>It delivers timely industry news, feature articles with thorough educational content, insightful data analyses, and performs due diligence and analysis on new NFT projects. This blend of content makes the often convoluted world of Web3 technologies more accessible to laypeople.</p>
<p>The outlet concentrates on quality over hype, aiming to demystify the space and reduce barriers of entry. In a field where misinformation is rampant, NFT Plazas helps to ensure that accurate, unbiased information is always at the reader&rsquo;s fingertips.</p>
Media and NFTs: The symbiotic catalysts for adoption
<p>With its expansive reach and influence, the media has been instrumental in narrating the story of non-fungibles, delineating their value, and encouraging their adoption. As NFTs enter mainstream consciousness, it serves as passive observer and an active participant, crafting narratives that influence perception, drive interest, and foster understanding.</p>
<p>Social media platforms have also metamorphosed into bustling marketplaces where buyers, sellers, and mediators intersect, while platforms like Twitter and Discord continue to serve as critical nodes of discovery and discussion. The synergy between NFTs and social media hints at a future where the line between digital assets and traditional online interactions further blurs.</p>
<p>"The role of media is not just to report on the world of crypto, metaverses, and NFTs," commented Mary Pedler, Founder of Input PR communications agency for cutting-edge crypto and tech projects. "It actively shapes perceptions, demystifies complexities, and lowers the entry threshold for the average user."</p>
<p>NFT Plazas, acutely aware of the challenges of NFT adoption, harnesses the power of media to bridge knowledge gaps. They employ a multi-pronged approach, where comprehensive educational content aids the uninitiated, while data-driven insights offer value to veterans. While their educational efforts have garnered praise, more aggressive marketing techniques might find lesser traction among a discerning audience wary of hype.</p>
<p>The media's role in Web3 and the broader digital asset landscape is pivotal. As gatekeepers of information, platforms like NFT Plazas can influence the trajectory of NFT adoption, ensuring that the metamorphosis of the digital realm is rooted in knowledge, transparency, and trust.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Ratings agency Moody&rsquo;s downgraded 10 US banks on Monday, with negative ratings actions on many more. Bitcoin has broken higher.</p>
27 Banks suffer negative ratings actions
<p>Following on from the Fitch ratings agency downgrade of the US from triple A to double A+, the Moody&rsquo;s rating agency has followed up with downgrades of 10 small and midsize US banks, and put such august banking giants as New York Mellon and US Bancorp under review for possible downgrades.</p>
<p>In all, 27 banks received negative ratings actions from Moody&rsquo;s which is likely to put them under further pressure and scrutiny at a time when the whole banking sector is struggling to keep itself above water after the Federal Reserve felt it had to buy all the bad bond debts, and as the commercial real estate time bomb gets ever closer to exploding.</p>
<p>Moody&rsquo;s included the following in its report on Monday:</p>

<p>"To date, stress on US banks has been reflected almost exclusively in funding and interest rate risk related to monetary policy tightening, but a worsening in asset quality will likely come,"&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report added:</p>

<p>"We continue to expect a mild recession in early 2024, and given the funding strains on the US banking sector, there will likely be a tightening of credit conditions and rising loan losses for US banks."</p>

Bitcoin impervious to banking woes
<p>As the noose around the US banking sector continues tightening, an asset class completely outside of the entire traditional financial system has just broken higher. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are perhaps being seen as a tech asset class that has already seen its bear market bottom, and is now ripe for investment.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ripped higher on Monday and into Tuesday, climbing from a $28,700 low to as high as $30,200. The price has since returned to confirm the top of a bull flag, and should it hold above, higher prices can certainly follow.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has remained trapped in a downward channel since the latter part of June. With the last couple of days of positive price action, is bitcoin now ready to go higher?</p>
A bull flag breakout?
<p>Bitcoin has been in an accumulation phase for the past seven weeks. Following a spike higher from a mid-June low of $24,800, the price almost reached $32,000 before rolling over and following the downwards channel it is currently trying to free itself from.</p>
<p>Positive price action since Monday saw bitcoin emerge from its bull flag. However, Wednesday sees price trying to hold the top of the flag. Whether it is successful or not will signal the next phase of price action. If the breakout of the bull flag does get confirmed, bitcoin has the possibility to go much higher, with a measured move out of the flag taking it to $35,000, which would potentially turn $30,000 into new support.</p>
<p>However, failure to break out of the flag can bring bitcoin ever closer to its major support of the uptrend which is underpinned by the 200-day moving average. A bounce here would be even more likely.</p>
Bears and bulls evenly balanced
<p>In fact the chart and fundamentals for bitcoin do look ridiculously bullish. It therefore has to be wondered why there is still so much bearish sentiment around the number one crypto asset?</p>
<p>The Fear and Greed Index has been oscillating around the Neutral 50 value since the beginning of the year, signalling that bitcoin is balanced on a 50/50 market sentiment for higher or lower prices.</p>
<p>It appears that something is needed to tip bitcoin one way or the other, and despite regulatory overhang of the crypto industry and the extremely negative pursuit of the foremost crypto exchanges of Binance and Coinbase by the SEC, there is still enough positive sentiment to balance things up.</p>
Why keep currency in the bank?
<p>In bitcoin&rsquo;s favour, it does have to be wondered why people would choose to keep their fiat currency in banks. On the one hand there is the resulting reduction in purchasing power of fiat currency as central banks print more of it in order to pay debts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are the banks themselves. Only propped up by the printing out of thin air of their own central banks. As exposure to commercial real estate and other bad debts become due, the central banks are going to have to hammer further on the keyboard digits in order to inflate even further.</p>
<p>If one is to add all this negativity to the fact that we are living in an age where banks are becoming obsolescent, then all the currency being poured into propping them up would just appear to lead to much more pain for the average citizen, who must bear this cost through inflation and an accelerating loss in purchasing power.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>In a major decision taken on the 8th of August, Bitstamp has announced that it would suspend trading for several cryptocurrencies identified as securities by the SEC in cases against Binance and Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impacted tokens will no longer be available to trade by the end of August.&nbsp;</p>
Bitstamp Moves To Suspend Tokens&nbsp;
<p>According to the announcement, several prominent cryptocurrencies will soon be blocked, rendering US-based users unable to trade them. These include Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), Chiliz (CHZ), Near Protocol (NEAR), Polygon (MATIC), The Sandbox (SAND), and Solana (SOL). As per the company&rsquo;s announcement, after delisting the above-mentioned cryptocurrencies, the platform will offer only 30 listed cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency exchange urged users to execute all trades involving these tokens by the 29th of August, following which they will become unavailable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Update for our US users Starting the 29th of August: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments. Execute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the exchange, US trading of the tokens will be permanently disabled after the 29th of August. However, customers can still withdraw and hold the tokens after the date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We kindly request our users to promptly execute any desired buy or sell orders involving the affected assets before the 29th of August, 2023. After this deadline, trading activities related to AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL will be permanently disabled on the Bitstamp platform.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Recent Developments&rdquo; Led To Decision&nbsp;
<p>The announcement pointed at recent market developments as the reason behind the suspension of trading of the cryptocurrencies mentioned. While the firm did not provide a concrete reason, all of the tokens mentioned in the announcement have been alleged to be unregistered securities by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Securities and Exchange Commission identified the cryptocurrencies in question as unregistered securities in separate complaints against Binance and Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Bitstamp has not delisted other assets mentioned in the cases against Binance and Coinbase. These assets include Nexo (NEXO), Algorand (ALGO), and Cardano (ADA).&nbsp;</p>
Other Platforms Have Also Delisted Assets&nbsp;
<p>The allegations against the tokens made by the Securities and Exchange Commission have yet to be proven in a court of law. However, other platforms have voluntarily delisted specific assets mentioned by the SEC in the cases. In recent months, several platforms, including Bakkt, Robinhood, and Revolut, have delisted Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platforms seem to have delisted these three cryptocurrencies because they are among the largest assets which the SEC targets. Following the developments, projects such as The Sandbox have also started mandating Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for SAND staking. According to the SEC, a total of 68 cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Projects Reject Claims&nbsp;
<p>However, cryptocurrency projects have repeatedly rejected the claims made by the Securities and Exchange Commission, either directly or indirectly. The Solana Foundation, in a statement, has said that it categorically disagrees with the SEC&rsquo;s observations. Cardano&rsquo;s parent company IOHK has also denied ADA&rsquo;s security status. Meanwhile, Polygon Labs has said its operations were focused outside the US, beyond the reach and jurisdiction of the SEC. From the looks of things, it appears that actions taken around the assets in question are precautionary, and it remains to be seen if the SEC will take any action against the tokens or platforms in the future.&nbsp;</p>
SEC Action Against Binance&nbsp;And Coinbase
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s suits against Coinbase and Binance have led to an uncertain future for major listed tokens. The regulatory body&rsquo;s two lawsuits against the crypto exchanges in question have cast a long shadow on the 19 tokens mentioned in both filings. The SEC has accused Binance and Coinbase of offering unregistered securities to the public through their respective platforms. The suit once again brings into focus lingering questions about whether cryptos are a security, commodity, or otherwise.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>MuesliSwap, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Cardano blockchain, has taken the decision to refund users who faced unintended losses due to a "misunderstanding" regarding slippage mechanics within its platform.</p>
Refunding Users Affected by High Slippage
<p>The team behind MuesliSwap has acknowledged that users have been grappling with substantial slippage issues over the past year. On August 8, they openly admitted that they needed to adequately clarify the intricacies of the slippage feature in their protocol via a statement on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>&ldquo;To make amends, we will be refunding affected users who encountered high slippage on the MuesliSwap pools in the last 12 months from our project funds. Additionally, immediate action has been taken to remedy the slippage issue in the MuesliSwap order book&rdquo;</p>

<p>basically, MuesliSwap has pledged to refund users who have experienced high slippage within the past year. The team also promptly made adjustments to fix the slippage problem within the MuesliSwap order book.</p>
<p>Affected users can expect the refund process to span up to four weeks. The funds will be automatically distributed based on an analysis of a user's on-chain trading history.</p>
Understanding Slippage and Its Impact
<p>Slippage, a concept widely recognized in trading, refers to the difference between the intended trade execution price and the actual price due to factors like market liquidity. DEX users can manually set a slippage threshold according to their comfort level.</p>
<p>The Cardano-based DeFi, MuesliSwap's unique approach to slippage involved allowing decentralized matchmakers to either return the extra slippage amount or retain the difference, adding an extra layer of complexity. Unfortunately, this approach led to confusion, particularly among new users.The team has promised to remedy the situation so as to prevent similar confusion amongst users, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going forward, our DEX protocol will provide clear and accurate information on slippage when interacting with our pools. Your trading experience matters, and we're determined to make it seamless!&rdquo;</p>

User Concerns Across Cardano DEXs
<p>Slippage concerns have been voiced across various DEXs operating on the Cardano network. A trader on August 4 highlighted the challenges of executing large trades due to substantial slippage, impacting overall trading value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team also responded to another trader who enquired about the process, stating that all trade-related information would be fetched from the blockchain automatically and traders would not need to fill out any form to get the refund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MuesliSwap's commitment to addressing slippage-related concerns reflects its dedication to refining the user experience and maintaining a transparent ecosystem for the Cardano community.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates, August 9th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Wallet, the TON-based application in Telegram Messenger, announces the launch of TON Space, a new self-custody wallet, that gives users complete control of their digital assets. In tandem with this upcoming product comes the opening of a waitlist for developers to integrate with TON Space in beta.&nbsp;</p><p>By joining the waitlist today, developers will be the first to access TON Space for integration into their apps. With TON Space, developers will be able to build apps with the user interface in Telegram and its seamless blockchain integration with the TON Space wallet. This way, the entire user experience, from onboarding to Web3 and then using the application, would exist within the Telegram app. This provides a comprehensive solution to Web3 builders around the world while addressing the main obstacles of crypto adoption: access to audience and frictionless onboarding. Developers should prepare their apps for the TON Space consumer launch, which is expected to go live by the end of Q3 2023.

In tandem with this upcoming product comes the opening of a waitlist for developers to integrate with TON Space in beta.&nbsp;</p><p>By joining the waitlist today, developers will be the first to access TON Space for integration into their apps. With TON Space, developers will be able to build apps with the user interface in Telegram and its seamless blockchain integration with the TON Space wallet. This way, the entire user experience, from onboarding to Web3 and then using the application, would exist within the Telegram app. This provides a comprehensive solution to Web3 builders around the world while addressing the main obstacles of crypto adoption: access to audience and frictionless onboarding. Developers should prepare their apps for the TON Space consumer launch, which is expected to go live by the end of Q3 2023.

                        <![CDATA[<p>The world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has announced that it has become the first fully licensed cryptocurrency trading platform in the country of El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance announced the news after the platform received two licenses from the Central American Nation, according to a statement released on the 8th of August.&nbsp;</p>
Licensed Bitcoin Services Provider In El Salvador&nbsp;
<p>According to a statement released by the exchange, Binance became the first fully licensed crypto exchange to operate in El Salvador after it received the two licenses required. The two licenses in question are the Bitcoin Services Provider License (BSP) given by the Central Reserve Bank (Banco Central de Reserva) and the Digital Assets Services Provider License (DASP) provided by the National Commission of Digital Assets ((Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de Activos Digitales).&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Binance, the approval is another step in the exchange&rsquo;s growing efforts to get licenses and permissions in key markets around the world. With this latest approval, Binance has approvals and registrations in 18 global markets, including Italy, Spain, France, Sweden, and Dubai. Binance General Manager for Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean, Daniel Acosta, stated,</p>

<p>&ldquo;These licenses allow Binance to expand the products and services offered, including options tailored to the needs of our customers in El Salvador. It is also a great opportunity to collaborate closely with government authorities to support the adoption of crypto assets in the country, foster financial inclusion, innovation, and ensure customer protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking about the developments, the Binance Head of Latin America, Min Lin, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are honored to be granted this license as Binance continues to work collaboratively with regulatory agencies around the world to support global standards for the crypto and blockchain industry. This announcement comes after many months of dedication from our team to provide all information and proceed with the necessary due diligence required by the agencies, showcasing our commitment to the Salvadoran market and our users.&rdquo;</p>

El Salvador And Crypto&nbsp;
<p>El Salvador, under President Nayib Bukele, has maintained an extremely welcoming posture towards crypto, especially Bitcoin. In fact, the country had given Bitcoin the status of legal tender as far back as 2021. The country has also been on a Bitcoin acquisition spree and has so far acquired over 2300 BTC, according to data sourced from Buy Bitcoin Worldwide. According to current prices, the value of El Salvador&rsquo;s Bitcoin reserves is estimated to be around $70 million. Additionally, the government of El Salvador has also introduced several pro-crypto and pro-Bitcoin measures, such as a bill allowing the country to sell bonds that are backed by Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, despite these measures, reports have suggested that crypto adoption in the country remains low, as citizens question the long-term benefits of crypto adoption. Earlier this year, Bitfinex announced that it had become the first fully regulated digital assets exchange to receive a DASP license in El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>
Binance Increases Global Presence&nbsp;
<p>Despite the exchange facing numerous regulatory headaches across a number of jurisdictions, Binance has managed to expand its global footprint further. After receiving its operating licenses in El Salvador, Binance has become the most widely licensed crypto platform and now has approvals and registrations in over 18 countries around the world. These include countries such as Japan, Sweden, Dubai, France, Italy, and several others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the exchange has also faced several setbacks, having exited several prominent markets such as Cyprus, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The exchange had to exit these markets after it failed to get the required regulatory approval to continue operations. Binance is also facing several regulatory challenges in the US, with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charging the exchange of failing to comply with local laws and regulations.</p>

                    <description>
                        <![CDATA[<p class="s7">By now, everyone knows about Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), globally. However, newer and better crypto projects often get missed by investors. Thus, here's an update on one of 2023's most promising project, Tradecurve.</p>
<p class="s7">In fact, the project experienced 4 successful presales already, raising over $4 million. So, before its ongoing 5th presale closes, investors must register to benefit from the time left.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Bitcoin (BTC) may give more stacks to MicroStrategy soon; the token trades at $29,019.48
<p class="s7">Bitcoin (BTC) has one of the biggest user bases as it's the first crypto coin to exist. Many of the Bitcoin (BTC) buyers are well-known personalities. One of them is MicroStrategy. He is a top software developer. Recently, he started showing interest in staking Bitcoin (BTC) again.</p>
<p class="s7">He has been a consistent buyer of Bitcoin (BTC) stakes for the last few years. However, he is planning to sell his Bitcoin (BTC) stake to raise up to $750 million. Further, he intends to buy more tokens with the money.</p>
<p class="s7">This announcement surfaced in one of the SEC's filings. As per information, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a price increase after the news surfaced, crossing $29,000.</p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,019.48, a 0.57% drop in a day. Experts forecast the token price to reach $30,786 by August this year.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) has a new upgrade in its list as the token trades at $1,835.52
<p class="s7">The Ethereum (ETH) community seeks better security and scalability. Hence, the platform's new upgrade, Dencun, can be a boon for Ethereum (ETH) users. Dencun stands for Deneb and Cancun.</p>
<p class="s7">As per the details, Dencum will operate on Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL). However, Cancun will operate on Ethereum Execution Layer (EL). According to Ethereum (ETH) developers, Cancun includes 5 EIPs. These EIPs will lower the Ethereum (ETH) fee and boost data storage.</p>
<p class="s7">The Dencum will launch by the end of this year. Though the date isn't fixed for launch, researchers say October will be the best time.</p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) developers prefer a standard contract for the upgrade. Furthermore, they will also plan a deployment scheme. Community members are expecting a price rise for Ethereum (ETH) tokens.</p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Ethereum (ETH) token is trading at $1,835.52, a 0.42% rise in a day. Experts predict the ETH token to drop to $1,607 in upcoming months.</p>
Tradecurve ensures inclusive and anonymous trading

                        <![CDATA[<p class="s7">By now, everyone knows about Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), globally. However, newer and better crypto projects often get missed by investors. Thus, here's an update on one of 2023's most promising project, Tradecurve.</p>
<p class="s7">In fact, the project experienced 4 successful presales already, raising over $4 million. So, before its ongoing 5th presale closes, investors must register to benefit from the time left.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Bitcoin (BTC) may give more stacks to MicroStrategy soon; the token trades at $29,019.48
<p class="s7">Bitcoin (BTC) has one of the biggest user bases as it's the first crypto coin to exist. Many of the Bitcoin (BTC) buyers are well-known personalities. One of them is MicroStrategy. He is a top software developer. Recently, he started showing interest in staking Bitcoin (BTC) again.</p>
<p class="s7">He has been a consistent buyer of Bitcoin (BTC) stakes for the last few years. However, he is planning to sell his Bitcoin (BTC) stake to raise up to $750 million. Further, he intends to buy more tokens with the money.</p>
<p class="s7">This announcement surfaced in one of the SEC's filings. As per information, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a price increase after the news surfaced, crossing $29,000.</p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,019.48, a 0.57% drop in a day. Experts forecast the token price to reach $30,786 by August this year.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) has a new upgrade in its list as the token trades at $1,835.52
<p class="s7">The Ethereum (ETH) community seeks better security and scalability. Hence, the platform's new upgrade, Dencun, can be a boon for Ethereum (ETH) users. Dencun stands for Deneb and Cancun.</p>
<p class="s7">As per the details, Dencum will operate on Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL). However, Cancun will operate on Ethereum Execution Layer (EL). According to Ethereum (ETH) developers, Cancun includes 5 EIPs. These EIPs will lower the Ethereum (ETH) fee and boost data storage.</p>
<p class="s7">The Dencum will launch by the end of this year. Though the date isn't fixed for launch, researchers say October will be the best time.</p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) developers prefer a standard contract for the upgrade. Furthermore, they will also plan a deployment scheme. Community members are expecting a price rise for Ethereum (ETH) tokens.</p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Ethereum (ETH) token is trading at $1,835.52, a 0.42% rise in a day. Experts predict the ETH token to drop to $1,607 in upcoming months.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s6">Pomerdoge has emerged as the most attractive project in the crypto world. Due to its unique business roadmap, exciting offers, and affordable entry price, this new project has become investors&rsquo; favorite.</p>
<p class="s6">Therefore, even holders of Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) are jumping their ships to Pomerdoge.</p>
Summary:
● Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a surge in its staking.
● Cardano (ADA) suffers a weekly price drop of 7%.
● Pomerdoge presale stage 1 is selling out at $0.007.
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Staking Increases Significantly
<p class="s6">A recent report by Glassnode has revealed that Ethereum (ETH) staking has hit a new all-time high of 27.03 million. Reportedly, the staking of Ethereum (ETH) tokens has seen a jump of nearly 40% since the roll-out of the Shapella upgrade.</p>
<p class="s6">Besides, the total number of validators on the Ethereum (ETH) network has surged by over 50% since the upgrade. Moreover, Ethereum&rsquo;s (ETH) supply on exchanges has dropped by over 20% in recent months. This indicates that investors are more willing to hold their Ethereum (ETH) tokens than to sell them.</p>
<p class="s6">Despite these favorable numbers, Ethereum (ETH) has witnessed a drop in the price chart. Over the past month, Ethereum&rsquo;s (ETH) price has dipped by more than 3%, and is currently hovering at $1,814.39.</p>
Cardano (ADA) Posts Mixed Growth In Q2
<p class="s6">The latest report from Messari has revealed that Cardano (ADA) has struggled to maintain its network growth during Q2 2023. While Cardano (ADA) has witnessed a rise in some metrics, it has suffered a fall in others.</p>
<p class="s6">As per the data, Cardano (ADA) has seen a decline of 4% QoQ in daily active addresses. Moreover, the average daily new address count on Cardano (ADA) has fallen by 103% during the same period.</p>
<p class="s6">However, the total value locked (TVL) of Cardano (ADA) increased by 7% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the trading price of Cardano (ADA) has plummeted by 7% in the past seven days. Thus, the current trading price of Cardano (ADA) is $0.29.</p>
Pomerdoge Presale Reignites Bullish Momentum
<p class="s6">A report has estimated that the global blockchain gaming industry will reach $65.7 billion in the next five years. To make the most of this growth opportunity, a new play-to-earn (P2E) gaming cryptocurrency, Pomerdoge, has entered the crypto market.</p>
<p class="s6">An experienced team has designed Pomerdoge, which is likely to surpass Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe in popularity and profitability. POMD will be the native token of the entire ecosystem of Pomerdoge. The project&rsquo;s ecosystem is made up of three elements: Pomergame, Pomerplace, and NFTs, each with its distinct use cases.</p>
<p class="s6">Pomergame is a P2E game that will help players from around the world to connect with, and battle against, each other. On this platform, you can earn rewards and make money just by playing the game. The more time you spend within the game, the more you will earn. You can build your character and enhance it to an elite level. If you have a gold status Pomer, you will be able to sell your custom in-game items at Pomerplace.</p>
<p class="s6">Its presale is live, and Pomerdoge has become a favorite among investors. Therefore, they are pouring huge sums into the presale of POMD tokens. Only the token holders will get to purchase a unique collection of 7,777 NFTs.</p>
<p class="s6">According to market gurus, the project&rsquo;s market value will surge by 1,700% during the presale round. Currently, the presale of POMD is in stage 1, and a token is available for just $0.007.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Stakeholders of blockchain-based trading protocol Mango Markets are grappling with financial challenges as the platform faces mounting legal expenses in the aftermath of a significant crypto market manipulation incident.</p>
Stakeholders Reluctant to Foot the Bill
<p>About a year ago, crypto market manipulator, Avi Eisenberg, had reportedly raided Mango Markets for over $100 million. He was arrested soon after confessing to the exploit, and the company has been pursuing legal action against him since then. However, the platform's stakeholders are now finding it difficult to cover the escalating legal costs.</p>
<p>A proposal by Mango Labs, the company responsible for developing the Solana blockchain-based exchange, sought approval for an additional $2 million in funding for legal expenses. The proposal was put to a vote within Mango DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization overseeing the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initial voting results indicate that Mango DAO voters are hesitant to provide the requested funds. The proposal was rejected by the voters over the weekend, with one individual referring to the situation as a "money pit."&nbsp;</p>
Strained Resources and Legal Battles
<p>Project insiders have demanded greater transparency regarding budget management from the company. Despite the availability of approximately $89 million in the Mango DAO treasury, most of these funds are tied up in illiquid MNGO tokens, making quick liquidation a challenge. The primary source for potential funding lies in a stash of dollar-linked stablecoins valued at $15.3 million, denominated mostly in USDC.</p>
<p>The platform's financial constraints have arisen after Mango Labs exhausted its 2023 budget of nearly $2 million, significantly ahead of schedule. The company is actively pursuing a costly civil suit against Avi Eisenberg, who still claims that he did nothing wrong and was only participating in regular market strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, things do not look so well for Eisenberg, as other than the Mango Markets lawsuit, he has also been slapped with market manipulation charges by the CFTC and fraud charges by the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
Founder's Dilemma and Second Funding Proposal
<p>Mango Labs' founder, Daffy Durairaj, personally holds enough MNGO governance tokens that could influence the vote's outcome. However, due to scrutiny from regulatory bodies like the SEC regarding the centralization of Mango's governance token, Durairaj might be cautious about leveraging his tokens to secure the funds. Despite the initial setback, Durairaj has initiated a second funding proposal identical to the first, indicating the company's persistence in seeking financial support for legal expenses.</p>
<p>He stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This funding is necessary to handle legal costs of regulatory inquiries that have arisen after the exploit last year, cooperation with law enforcement and regulators and pursuing legal claims against Avi Eisenberg to help recover funds for the DAO.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Ransomware crime rings rely almost exclusively on Bitcoin payments to extract vast sums from major institutions, including hospitals and providers of critical infrastructure. But, in a groundbreaking move, a&nbsp;federal court case&nbsp;in Chicago has turned the tables on cybercriminals by using inventive technology to digitally lock the criminals out of their blockchain accounts.</p><p>The case was brought against Russian and North Korean hackers who are under sanctions by the United States Treasury Department.</p>Mike Kanovitz, CEO of&nbsp;Jurat Blockchains, the firm behind the technology deployed in the case, remarked, &ldquo;It is encouraging to witness this invention in action, fighting criminals who misuse blockchains and give cryptocurrency a bad name.&rdquo; Kanovitz explained that &ldquo;Jurat technology provides the base layer for legal enforcement on blockchains by working in conjunction with official courts. It can help government officials prevent crime and lets cryptocurrency users access courts if they have had their cryptocurrency stolen, been defrauded, or lost their private keys.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The court&rsquo;s order applies to 16 individuals and international criminal organizations sanctioned under Executive Orders of the President of the United States. Among those targeted was Hydra Market, the focus of &ldquo;a collaborative initiative joined by the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations, Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and Homeland Security Investigations,&rdquo; according to a&nbsp;U.S. Treasury Department press release.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major target named in the lawsuit is the&nbsp;Lazarus Group, which engaged in &ldquo;malicious cyber activities and money-laundering of stolen virtual currency&rdquo; on behalf of the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea.&nbsp;The state-sponsored hackers committed &ldquo;the largest virtual currency heist to date, worth almost $620 million, from a blockchain project linked to the online game Axie Infinity.&rdquo;</p><p>Using the first-of-its-kind judicial injunction, the federal court has locked all accounts belonging to the 16 criminals that contain the cryptocurrency $JTC. The coin emerged following an update to Bitcoin&rsquo;s software, resulting in a &ldquo;fork&rdquo; that left two blockchains, BTC and JTC, hosting the same accounts. Victims who previously lost $BTC can claim their $JTC using the Jurat Wallet app or by filing an action to enforce their legal rights in court.

<li aria-level="1">Hope.money launches its decentralized lending ecosystem, HopeLend.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The project aims to reward all participants, including depositors, borrowers, and lenders.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope.money, a pioneer in bridging DeFi to CeFi and TradFi, has launched HopeLend, a decentralized lending protocol, on the Ethereum network. In an announcement this Tuesday, HopeLend, a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol, aims to revolutionize the borrowing and lending systems across decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, allowing users to effectively utilize and interact with digital assets within the HOPE ecosystem and across other DeFi platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the launch, Flex Yang, Founder of Hope.money, said HopeLend will increase the overall liquidity across DeFi ecosystems and reward all participants on the platform to incentivize decentralized borrowing and lending services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The debut of HopeLend is a milestone for Hope.money, as it represents an important move toward completing its all-in-one ecosystem,&rdquo; Yang said. &ldquo;The non-custodial lending protocol enables all users to benefit from it by increasing liquidity for the HOPE Ecosystem through deposits, loans, and liquidations, and rewarding them with $LT.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition, HopeLend will also significantly improve the capital efficiency and users&rsquo; liquidity within the DeFi space, allowing any user to borrow and lend within the protocol. This blends well with the protocol&rsquo;s goals of providing frictionless and transparent financial infrastructure for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike legacy DeFi borrowing platforms, HopeLend introduces a pool-based system of borrowing, whereby users directly borrow and deposit to a pool. This eliminates the need for individual loan pairing, making the process of depositing and borrowing easy and frictionless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope.money aims to provide an all-in-one financial ecosystem, providing comprehensive utility for its decentralized stablecoin, $HOPE, including swaps, custodial services, clearing and settlement. The launch of HopeLend increases the utility of the stablecoin and will provide a &ldquo;solid foundation for $HOPE&rsquo;s future success as a stablecoin&rdquo;, Yang added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, HopeLend will also reward every contributor on the platform (depositors, borrowers and lenders) with its governance token, $LT, adding an extra layer of benefits on top of the standard interest income and borrowing services. The rewards distribution will be calculated using the relative Gauge Weights and utilization rates of various asset pools. Apart from regular loans, HopeLend will also offer users flash loans &ndash; loans that are borrowed and paid back in one transaction without having to own the assets.&nbsp;</p>
Hope.money steps up as a leading DeFi protocol
<p>The launch of HopeLend signifies the potential of Hope.money to become a leading protocol in the broader Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. Earlier this month, the protocol added stETH in Hope.money&rsquo;s reserve pool, which diversifies the assets on the protocol and strengthens the utility and value of $HOPE stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform is enhancing the security of users&rsquo; funds by forming partnerships with established and trusted digital asset custodians. Following its partnership with Coinbase Custody in April, Hope.money announced a strategic partnership with Cobo, another leading digital asset custodial services provider.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, HopeLend will also reward every contributor on the platform (depositors, borrowers and lenders) with its governance token, $LT, adding an extra layer of benefits on top of the standard interest income and borrowing services. The rewards distribution will be calculated using the relative Gauge Weights and utilization rates of various asset pools. Apart from regular loans, HopeLend will also offer users flash loans &ndash; loans that are borrowed and paid back in one transaction without having to own the assets.&nbsp;</p>
Hope.money steps up as a leading DeFi protocol
<p>The launch of HopeLend signifies the potential of Hope.money to become a leading protocol in the broader Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. Earlier this month, the protocol added stETH in Hope.money&rsquo;s reserve pool, which diversifies the assets on the protocol and strengthens the utility and value of $HOPE stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform is enhancing the security of users&rsquo; funds by forming partnerships with established and trusted digital asset custodians. Following its partnership with Coinbase Custody in April, Hope.money announced a strategic partnership with Cobo, another leading digital asset custodial services provider.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="s6">If you are searching for a project that can make you a millionaire over the coming years, Pomerdoge is one cryptocurrency that you shouldn&rsquo;t miss out on. Convinced by its growth projections and presale performance, experts believe that Pomerdoge&rsquo;s value can rise by 40x this year.</p>
Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have moved downward in recent months.
<p class="s8">Summary:</p>
● Solana&rsquo;s (SOL) social engagements have plummeted by 53% in the past week
● Ethereum (ETH) is planning to launch the Dencun upgrade by the year-end
● Pomerdoge&rsquo;s presale tokens are selling out fast during Stage 1
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Solana (SOL) Sees Drop In Social Metric
<p class="s6">Amid the bullish market sentiments, Solana (SOL) has seen growth in a key metric. The total value locked (TVL) of Solana (SOL) has increased over the past few months. The rise in Solana&rsquo;s (SOL) TVL has been caused largely because of the increase in the LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives) vertical.</p>
<p class="s6">Data shows that Jito, an LSD protocol operating on Solana (SOL), has seen a massive uptick after the Shapella upgrade. However, social engagements on the Solana (SOL) network have dropped by 53% in the past week. Besides, social mentions for Solana (SOL) have tumbled by 47%. Thus, the market price of Solana (SOL) has fallen by 10% in the past week.</p>
<p class="s6">Subsequently, Solana (SOL) is trading at $22.53.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Set To Launch A New Upgrade
<p class="s6">The Ethereum (ETH) network has been on a roll to launch new updates. A few months ago, Ethereum (ETH) had launched its much-awaited Shapella upgrade.</p>
<p class="s6">Ethereum (ETH) has intensified its efforts on the upcoming Cancun-Deneb upgrade. However, the news regarding the Dencun upgrade has not caused any positive response for the price of Ethereum (ETH). Notably, the trading price of Ethereum (ETH) has tumbled by 3% in the past seven days. As a result, an Ethereum (ETH) token can now be traded at $1,826.29.</p>
<p class="s6">Also known as Dencun, the upcoming upgrade will improve the security and scalability of the Ethereum (ETH) network. Reportedly, Ethereum (ETH) may launch the upgrade by the end of 2023.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Makes Big Waves
<p class="s6">According to a report, the global blockchain gaming market can grow from $4.6 billion in 2022 to $65.7 billion by 2027. Thus, Pomerdoge has developed a new blockchain game that will disrupt the play-to-earn gaming arena. The new P2E game, named Pomergame, is equipped with many rich and unique features. Therefore, it has generated big market waves even before its launch in the market.</p>
<p class="s6">According to experts, Pomerdoge is different from meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe. Pomerdoge is a mix of fun and earning. Hence, you get paid for all the time you spend on the game. Its ecosystem consists of three major elements.</p>
<p class="s6">The first element is Pomergame, where you will be able to play, create, and level up your character to elite status. The Pomerplace is the second element, where you will get an opportunity to sell your custom in-game assets to other members, or battle with gamers across the globe. The last element is a unique collection of 7,777 NFTs.</p>
<p class="s6">Pomerdoge&rsquo;s business roadmap has revealed that it will launch POMD tokens on Uniswap after the presale round. At present, the presale of POMD tokens is in its first stage, and its price is $0.007. However, analysts have predicted that POMD&rsquo;s value can skyrocket by 1700% by the end of the presale round. So, hurry before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">The DeFi space is experiencing a surge of innovation and interest, with Tradecurve, Solana, and Chainlink at the forefront. Particularly eye-catching is Tradecurve, now in its presale phase where early investors can acquire tokens for just $0.025 before the predicted 50-fold rise. Let's take a closer look at these three DeFi projects and how they are revolutionizing the industry.</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV): 50-Fold Gains on the Horizon to Surge Past Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK)
<p class="s7">Traditional crypto exchange sign-ups can feel like walking through a maze: the invasive KYC checks, the complexity of user interfaces, the endless waiting &ndash; it all adds up to a stressful experience. Enter Tradecurve, a groundbreaking trading platform that's on a mission to turn the tables.</p>
<p class="s7">Tradecurve is all about simplicity and anonymity, doing away with the tedious KYC procedures that often hinder traders. All you'll need is an email address and a bit of cryptocurrency, and the diverse world of trading is yours to explore. Whether you're interested in cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, or stocks, Tradecurve's doors are open.</p>
<p class="s7">Whether you want to mimic successful trading strategies through copy trading, utilize AI-driven automation, or earn passive income with staking, Tradecurve's robust suite of advanced features ensures you have every tool to stay ahead in the trading game.</p>
<p class="s7">The magic key to all these exciting offerings is the TCRV token, Tradecurve's native digital asset. With TCRV, you can pay transaction fees, earn staking rewards, access top-tier trading tools, and much more.</p>
<p class="s7">During phase 5 of the ongoing presale event, early adopters can grab TCRV at the steal price of $0.025. With a flurry of activity that has already seen over 20 million tokens sold in just one week, this special price won't last long. Phase 6 will see the price rise to $0.029.</p>
<p class="s7">Experts predict that Tradecurve's journey is only beginning. As the platform's reputation grows and the demand for TCRV increases, its value could soar to $1.00 and even higher.</p>
Solana (SOL): Get Ready for a New Era of DeFi 2.0
<p class="s7">Solana has been riding a wave of bullish momentum, rebounding after a period of overselling tied to negative news and events. Traders and investors are once again taking note of its original potential that led to 10,000% gains in 2021.</p>
<p class="s7">This optimism is backed by technical analysis, as Solana broke free from a Symmetrical Triangle pattern to grow from $18.70 to $32 in just nine days. The price has since adjusted to a $25 support level and left Solana enthusiasts in suspense.</p>
<p class="s7">Platforms like Hxro Network and Crema are turning to Solana as a fertile ground for developing the next generation of decentralized finance applications. Ethereum is still too slow to handle the latest DeFi protocols, but Solana is more than capable of taking the lead.</p>
<p class="s7">While it is unlikely for Solana to outperform Tradecurve, the asset is still expected to break out of the current range toward $80 in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Chainlink (LINK): CCIP Protocol and Swift Partnership Leads to 20% Gains
<p class="s7">Chainlink is a strong contender to become the leading provider of blockchain oracles, allowing DeFi projects to connect smart contracts to real-world data. This has been further cemented by its collaboration with Google Cloud and other industry leaders.</p>
<p class="s7">And it just got better this week &ndash; Chainlink announced the launch of its Cross-Chain Integration Protocol (CCIP), allowing Swift to use Chainklink's technology to send data between various blockchain networks.</p>
<p class="s7">Chainlink has seen its value grow due to these developments, with a 20% price increase over a 7-day period. The price of Chainlink has since cooled off and returned to $7.09. Analysts note that Chainlink has been suppressed under the $10 resistance for over a year, so any further gains won't occur until it breaks past that barrier.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The ambitious social metaverse and Web3 startup Peer has hit a major milestone with the launch of its next-generation social app, available to download on iOS devices from today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Peer app is a novel social experience created using augmented reality technology and a proprietary ecosystem that enables people to explore and interact with the world around them in new ways, the startup explains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the world&rsquo;s a game and Peer makes everyone a player,&rdquo; said Peer founder and Chief Executive Tony Tran. &ldquo;Get ready for a new kind of social network that&rsquo;s all about fun, joy and gamification at its core.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Peer, the app combines geo-location technology with adaptive 3D maps to create a &ldquo;game-like experience&rdquo; of the physical world. With Peer, users will be able to customize and share maps of their own, unique social world, pinning their stories, memories and moments to real-world locations for others to find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand what Peer is really about, try to think of it as a social network experienced in AR graphics overlaid across the real world. With it, users will be able to explore their physical location and locate digital objects and information that&rsquo;s posted within their surroundings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peer will make it possible to overlay 3D graphics on top of the real world, integrating new experiences into our everyday lives. Unlike other social networks which simply focus on getting people to scroll through a newsfeed with their eyes glued to their device, Peer genuinely wants to get people out and about, interacting with real people and locations in the physical world. As part of this approach, users will be incentivized to post and explore digital content that&rsquo;s tied to specific geographic locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s feeling hungry will be able to use Peer to facilitate their search for a bite to eat. Simply open up the Peer map and look for nearby restaurants, and you&rsquo;ll find directions overlaid onto the real world to make it easier to find them. As that person arrives at their chosen eatery, they may be able to pick up a digital coupon posted outside by the owner of the business, giving them a 10% discount on their meal. At the same time, the user will be able to check reviews from previous customers, helping them to decide if they want to give the menu a try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses will be able to use Peer to enhance their marketing efforts in creative ways. As an example, Peer created a video showing how an aquarium or dinosaur museum might get the attention of visitors by creating marine animals that swim across the skies, or virtual dinosaurs that roam around outside, enticing people to come and take a closer look.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Peer explains, the Peer app is designed to enable discovery, community-building and other kinds of real-life activities. It will act as a creative canvas anyone can use to design and develop digital experiences that enhance our lives in the real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ambitious idea that has the potential to achieve one of the major promises of the metaverse, morphing digital elements into physical reality.</p>
<p>Peer said the Peer app is available to download on iOS devices now from the Apple App Store, and will be joined by an Android version that&rsquo;s due to launch later this year. The company is also reported to be working on an AR headset that will make it possible to experience Peer in the most immersive way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, iOS users can expect to see additional features arrive in Peer soon. &ldquo;In the coming months, we will deepen AI integration and deploy features that are sure to spark a new era of global interconnectedness,&rdquo; Tran promised. &ldquo;No social network puts the world in your hands like Peer.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The ambitious social metaverse and Web3 startup Peer has hit a major milestone with the launch of its next-generation social app, available to download on iOS devices from today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Peer app is a novel social experience created using augmented reality technology and a proprietary ecosystem that enables people to explore and interact with the world around them in new ways, the startup explains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the world&rsquo;s a game and Peer makes everyone a player,&rdquo; said Peer founder and Chief Executive Tony Tran. &ldquo;Get ready for a new kind of social network that&rsquo;s all about fun, joy and gamification at its core.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Peer, the app combines geo-location technology with adaptive 3D maps to create a &ldquo;game-like experience&rdquo; of the physical world. With Peer, users will be able to customize and share maps of their own, unique social world, pinning their stories, memories and moments to real-world locations for others to find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand what Peer is really about, try to think of it as a social network experienced in AR graphics overlaid across the real world. With it, users will be able to explore their physical location and locate digital objects and information that&rsquo;s posted within their surroundings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peer will make it possible to overlay 3D graphics on top of the real world, integrating new experiences into our everyday lives. Unlike other social networks which simply focus on getting people to scroll through a newsfeed with their eyes glued to their device, Peer genuinely wants to get people out and about, interacting with real people and locations in the physical world. As part of this approach, users will be incentivized to post and explore digital content that&rsquo;s tied to specific geographic locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s feeling hungry will be able to use Peer to facilitate their search for a bite to eat. Simply open up the Peer map and look for nearby restaurants, and you&rsquo;ll find directions overlaid onto the real world to make it easier to find them. As that person arrives at their chosen eatery, they may be able to pick up a digital coupon posted outside by the owner of the business, giving them a 10% discount on their meal. At the same time, the user will be able to check reviews from previous customers, helping them to decide if they want to give the menu a try.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) awaited fresh technical guidance early in the Asian session as the pair remained unable to sustain moves above the 29500 area and continues to battle with areas of technical resistance.&nbsp; &nbsp;The inability to revisit last month&rsquo;s multi-month high around the 31862 area has resulted in bearish momentum and has seen the pair orbit the 28960 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 19568.52 to 31862.21.&nbsp; &nbsp;Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>

<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29176.03 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29041.31.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The law firm representing FTX, Fenwick &amp; West, has been slapped with a class action lawsuit by a group of FTX customers for allegedly aiding in fraud. </p>
<p>Fenwick &amp; West, the law firm representing the fallen crypto exchange FTX, has been sued by a group of former FTX customers. The customers accused the firm of aiding in fraud via its legal advice to the exchange, Reuters reports.</p>
FTX Lawyers Face Class Action Lawsuit
<p>According to the complaint lodged on August 7, Fenwick &amp; West allegedly offered service to the exchange that &ldquo;went well beyond those a law firm should and usually does provide.&rdquo; The complaint states the firm&rsquo;s services included structuring transactions to avoid regulatory attention and setting up entities that helped FTX&rsquo;s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, and other exchange executives engage in fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>The current complaint is the second to be lodged against Fenwick concerning its dealings with FTX. Previous reports state that the firm Gibson Dunn was appointed to represent Fenwick on similar issues related to the exchange, including in the criminal case against SBF and a federal class action lawsuit.</p>
<p>According to the court filing, Fenwick acted as the primary outside legal representative for the now-bankrupt exchange and therefore had a unique insight into FTX&rsquo;s &ldquo;convoluted organizational structure, abject lack of internal controls, and dubious business practices,&rdquo; Reuters reports.</p>
<p>The dealings between Fenwick and FTX also extend to Daniel Friedberg. Mr Friedberg was a leading regulatory attorney for the exchange and joined FTX in 2020 from Fenwick. FTX&rsquo;s new management is now suing Friedberg.</p>
Fenwick Allegedly Helps Conceal FTX Executives&rsquo; Use of Customer Fund for Speculative Investments
<p>The complaint further alleges that Fenwick &amp; West assisted in setting up two entities used to hide exchange executives&rsquo; use of customer funds to make speculative investments and political donations.</p>
<p>The law firm allegedly also advised on transactions that helped the exchange obtain regulatory licenses without having to apply directly to the necessary regulators.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>According to Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett, the US government debt is predicted to rise to $50 trillion by 2033.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the astonishing and ridiculous state our financial system has got into, and the vast majority of US citizens will probably just shrug their shoulders and carry on.</p>
An unfair downgrade?
<p>That the US was recently downgraded from triple A to double A+ was heavily lamented in US government and banking circles. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called it &ldquo;puzzling&rdquo;, &ldquo;entirely unwarranted&rdquo;, and a &ldquo;flawed assessment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, said that the downgrade was &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t really matter&rdquo;, and that the markets would decide rather than the Fitch rating agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these heads of finance were hardly going to say that Fitch was absolutely right to make the downgrade, and so their hollow protests were probably to be expected. However, many will take them at their word and wonder why Fitch made this awful decision&hellip;</p>
Of course we can print money out of thin air, we&rsquo;re the US government
<p>So the already impossible and insurmountable US debt figure is set to rise from the current $32.5 trillion to around $50 trillion over the next 10 years. Given that this is a figure produced by a banker, perhaps the eventual figure might even be much higher.</p>
<p>In congress, there are those who revel in the special privilege that the US wields with the dollar as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency. Brad Sherman is a staunchly anti-crypto congressman, always using his power and influence to malign and demean Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When accusing &ldquo;crypto bros&rdquo; of printing $1 trillion from thin air during a key congressional committee, he speculated that these same people might accuse the US government of doing the same thing. He said &ldquo;perhaps we do&rdquo; and vindicated the act by saying &ldquo;we&rsquo;re the US government&rdquo;. When certain congressmen/women and senators have such a view, it is no wonder the US is in the impossible situation it is in.&nbsp;</p>
From the dollar sinking ship to the Bitcoin liferaft
<p>So, we know that the US is going to add to its debt mountain over the next 10 years at least, as it spends like a drunken sailor, injecting scandalous amounts of new currency into the system, leading to currency debasement on a massive scale and leaving its citizens to shoulder the cost.</p>
<p>Bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply built into its code. As its halving approaches in April of next year and its supply is cut in half, expect a tsunami of wealth to leave the sinking ship which is the dollar and climb aboard the Bitcoin liferaft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both of these heads of finance were hardly going to say that Fitch was absolutely right to make the downgrade, and so their hollow protests were probably to be expected. However, many will take them at their word and wonder why Fitch made this awful decision&hellip;</p>
Of course we can print money out of thin air, we&rsquo;re the US government
<p>So the already impossible and insurmountable US debt figure is set to rise from the current $32.5 trillion to around $50 trillion over the next 10 years. Given that this is a figure produced by a banker, perhaps the eventual figure might even be much higher.</p>
<p>In congress, there are those who revel in the special privilege that the US wields with the dollar as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency. Brad Sherman is a staunchly anti-crypto congressman, always using his power and influence to malign and demean Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When accusing &ldquo;crypto bros&rdquo; of printing $1 trillion from thin air during a key congressional committee, he speculated that these same people might accuse the US government of doing the same thing. He said &ldquo;perhaps we do&rdquo; and vindicated the act by saying &ldquo;we&rsquo;re the US government&rdquo;. When certain congressmen/women and senators have such a view, it is no wonder the US is in the impossible situation it is in.&nbsp;</p>
From the dollar sinking ship to the Bitcoin liferaft
<p>So, we know that the US is going to add to its debt mountain over the next 10 years at least, as it spends like a drunken sailor, injecting scandalous amounts of new currency into the system, leading to currency debasement on a massive scale and leaving its citizens to shoulder the cost.</p>
<p>Bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply built into its code. As its halving approaches in April of next year and its supply is cut in half, expect a tsunami of wealth to leave the sinking ship which is the dollar and climb aboard the Bitcoin liferaft.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a critical crossroads concerning ARK's application for a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). With the August 13 deadline on the horizon, the financial world watches closely for the SEC's decisive verdict.</p>
Potential Delay Until 2024
<p>ARK Invest&rsquo;s official Bitcoin ETF submission on May 15 kicked off the SEC's countdown clock. It was followed by another filing on June 15 which preset the deadline as August 15, by which the SEC must express its approval or disapproval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the SEC can prolong the waiting game by 240 days, pushing the final response to January 10, 2024, for ARK Invest&rsquo;s proposal and March 2024 for other applicants.</p>
<p>Speaking on the topic, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood noted that there is a high probability of the SEC delaying the matter further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked about the August deadline, Wood said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think you're probably right that Aug. 13 will come and go. I think the SEC, if it's going to approve a bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once."</p>

A Crowded Field of Aspirants
<p>ARK isn't alone in its quest for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Numerous organizations, including Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, First Trust Galaxy, and Fidelity Wise Origin, have entered the Bitcoin ETF fray. Grayscale also seeks to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. If the SEC greenlights any one of these applications, the call for fair and equal approvals among the other applicants will gain extra momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This wave of applications stands apart due to a "surveillance sharing" pact with exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe. The agreement's goal is to exchange market trading data, customer ID info, and clearing activity details. This move aims to curb market manipulation risks and protect investor funds against unauthorized use, addressing previous SEC concerns.</p>
SEC's Reserved Move - The Waiting Game
<p>Observers speculate that the SEC won't budge unless compelled. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's lawsuit serves as inspiration on how to tackle the agency and its unbudging stance on ETFs. The court case has prompted the SEC to clarify its stance, highlighting its approval of Bitcoin futures agreements with similar monitoring provisions. This legal tussle may lead to a more transparent decision-making process.</p>
<p>While optimism grows in the crypto community, doubts remain about the SEC's approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Critics recall the SEC's decade-long streak of rejecting such applications. Nevertheless, the approval of a leveraged Bitcoin ETF and a surge in Ethereum futures ETF applications hint at a shifting regulatory environment. Bloomberg Intelligence gives a 65% chance for approval, considering the Grayscale lawsuit and potential political influences.</p>

                    <description>
                        <![CDATA[<p class="s4">Nowadays, no one manually searches for crypto spreads anymore; everyone uses bots for cryptocurrency arbitrage. There are two types of arbitrage bots: automatic and manual.</p>
What are the differences?
<p class="s4">Automatic arbitrage bots are bots where you set limits on spreads, coins, and exchanges. The bots themselves place orders or buy cryptocurrencies. All automatic bots work through APIs. Due to this, the risk of using automatic bots is significantly higher since you are essentially granting access to your funds to a third-party application.</p>
<p class="s4">Manual arbitrage bots are bots that provide information on spreads through separate applications, messengers, or even SMS. You still choose the limits, coins, and exchanges.</p>
Today, we will review arbitrage bots and rank them based on the following criteria:
<p class="s4">1. Security</p>
<p class="s4">2. User reviews</p>
<p class="s4">3. Functionality</p>
<p class="s4">4. Prices</p>
<p class="s4">5. Additional features</p>
<p class="s4">We will evaluate each criterion on a 5-point scale and calculate the arithmetic mean to determine the best cryptocurrency arbitrage bot.</p>
ArbitrageScanner.io&nbsp;
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="s4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Let's start with the first-place bot - ArbitrageScanner with a rating of 4.8.</p>
<p class="s4">This service supports 60 CEX exchanges, 40 DEX exchanges, and more than 30 blockchains! The service even supports local exchanges in Turkey, Korea, and Latin America. Let's break down why it is ranked number one for cryptocurrency arbitrage scanning.</p>
1. Security: 5/5
<p class="s4">ArbitrageScanner is a manual cryptocurrency arbitrage bot. It sends you notifications about exchange rate differences on Telegram. This bot works without requesting API access, meaning all possible risks associated with your funds are eliminated. All exchanges connected to ArbitrageScanner have been verified and are safe to use.</p>
2. ArbitrageScanner.io reviews: 5/5
<p class="s4">We couldn't find any significant negative reviews online. There were a couple of users who were dissatisfied that the service wasn't working, but we verified that the project's official channels mentioned technical work, updates, and expanded functionality. Users' reviews in personal blogs are positive, and reviews from news resources are also positive.</p>
3. Functionality: 5/5
<p class="s4">The scanner works with a vast number of CEX, DEX, and blockchains. It is the most accurate scanner based on our measurements, always showing you the current cryptocurrency prices on exchanges. This alone gives it a high rating, but the service's development team has also created a screener for cryptocurrency arbitrage, which we'll discuss further in the Additional Features section.</p>
<p class="s4"></p>
4. Prices: 4/5
<p class="s4">The minimum tariff costs $70, but we recommend paying attention to the Expert tariff at $399. It is ideal for both beginner and expert arbitrage traders. Opting for a more expensive tariff provides increased limits, allowing you to set up 30 different coins simultaneously, 15 different Telegram channels, and more. What caught our attention the most is that this tariff includes free access to the second service we mentioned earlier - the Arbitrage Screener. Additionally, you gain access to an arbitrage trader community, where experienced specialists share successful strategies, insights, and current spreads that can be profitable. The price of $399 doesn't seem too high, especially when you are offered numerous earning opportunities. There is also a free trial available.</p>
5. Additional features: 5/5
<p class="s4">Under additional features, we consider what the service offers besides its main product. Arbitrage Scanner provides numerous additional functions.</p>
<p class="s4">- Closed chat for arbitrage traders, where both the scanner team and the community share cases and hot opportunities.</p>
<p class="s4">- Educational materials, providing training on how to use the scanner, real cases, how to find arbitrage opportunities, and how to set up the service.</p>
<p class="s4">- Screener: This is the second product available to users with Pro and higher subscriptions. It displays all possible spreads that you set up across different exchanges and coins. This tool complements the scanner perfectly. You configure the screener to find the exchanges and coins with the largest spreads at that moment. Then, you switch to the scanner, set the settings for those exchanges and coins, and it shows you the most current spreads. Perfect for those who want to earn profits!</p>
<p class="s4">- The website offers a free profitability calculator for arbitrage. Even if you don't have a subscription yet, you can calculate how much you can earn on arbitrage with a specific cryptocurrency.</p>
<p class="s4">- Some users have been given access to beta testing of another product called Telegram Scanner. This tool allows you to search for all mentions of your chosen cryptocurrency or topic in all Telegram chats. It sends all mentions of your keyword to a separate chat, and with a single click, you can respond to the original messages.</p>
3Commas
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="s4">In second place, we have 3Commas with a rating of 4.2.</p>
<p class="s4">This is one of the most popular automatic bots at the moment, suitable for cryptocurrency arbitrage. However, it has its small downsides:</p>
1. Security: 4/5
<p class="s4">While this bot has not been associated with fund theft or hacking, we cannot give it the highest rating. It uses APIs for operation, like all automatic bots, which poses a security threat to your finances.</p>
2. User reviews: 4/5
<p class="s4">User reviews are generally good, but there are negative reviews regarding the service's performance. Some users complain about the delayed support response, but we do not consider these to be critical drawbacks of the project.</p>
3. Functionality: 4/5
<p class="s4">The service offers automatic arbitrage, but only on a single exchange. Due to the large number of users, it is very difficult to automatically earn profits using this service as there is significant competition among arbitrage traders using the same bot. There is inter-exchange arbitrage available on 16 CEX exchanges, butcompared to the number supported by the first-place service in our ranking, this seems very limited. Moreover, 3Commas does not support DEX exchanges, which are now considered the new frontier for arbitrage opportunities.</p>
4. Prices: 5/5
<p class="s4">The service offers a 7-day free trial, which is much longer than its competitors. The tariff prices range from $29 to $99, which is quite competitive for the services provided.</p>
5. Additional features: 4/5
<p class="s4">This is the most interesting aspect, considering what additional features each product offers. 3Commas provides:</p>
<p class="s4">- 5 bots for manual trading and 9 for automatic trading, but most of them are available in the highest subscription.</p>
<p class="s4">- A demo account where you can try out your strategies.</p>
<p class="s4">- An internal portfolio rebalancer.</p>
Bitsgap
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="s4">In the third place in our ranking is Bitsgap with a rating of 3.6.</p>
<p class="s4">This is an automatic bot that supports 15 CEX exchanges.</p>
1. Security: 4/5
<p class="s4">As we mentioned before, automatic bots are not safe to use. Here, we encounter the first confirmation of this statement. Some users reported that funds went missing from their accounts. It could be malicious competition, but we cannot overlook these statements.</p>
2. User reviews: 3/5
<p class="s4">User reviews are mixed, with complaints about poor support, delayed bot performance, and some exchanges periodically not functioning. As mentioned before, there are also claims about missing funds. On the other hand, some users did not experience such issues. While we cannot recommend using this bot, we also cannot claim that it is developed by dishonest developers.</p>
3. Functionality: 4/5
<p class="s4">The functionality does not stand out among automatic arbitrage bots. It supports 15 CEX exchanges and lacks DEX exchanges. Otherwise, it duplicates or even lacks certain features compared to 3Commas.</p>
4. Prices: 5/5
<p class="s4">The minimum tariff is $23, and the maximum is $119. The difference between tariffs is minimal, and in the market, this is a relatively high price for the services provided.</p>
5. Additional features: 2/5
<p class="s4">The service offers an arbitrage profitability blog and knowledge base, and unfortunately, that's all the additional functionality it provides.</p>
Coinrule
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="s4">In fourth place on the list of arbitrage bots is Coinrule with a rating of 3.4.</p>
<p class="s4">This is an automatic bot for arbitrage that supports 10 CEX exchanges.</p>
1. Security: 2/5
<p class="s4">Once again, this is an automatic bot that uses API. There are also articles about users of this bot losing their funds, but we cannot vouch for the accuracy of this information. It could also be the work of competitors, but we cannot ignore these claims.</p>
2. User reviews: 3/5
<p class="s4">User reviews are mixed. Many find it challenging to work with, even for experienced arbitrage traders. There are also negative reviews about missing funds, as mentioned earlier.</p>
3. Functionality: 4/5
<p class="s4">The bot supports only 10 CEX exchanges, and configuring it requires significant effort. Its functionality does not stand out compared to other automatic bots we reviewed today.</p>
4. Prices: 5/5
<p class="s4">The price for this product is $30 - $450 per month, which is above average considering the intuitiveness of the service's management and prices for similar features among competitors.</p>
5. Additional features: 3/5
<p class="s4">- Marketplace of arbitrage strategies&nbsp;</p>
HaasOnline
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="s4">In the fifth place in our ranking is HaasOnline with a rating of 2.8.</p>
<p class="s4">It is also an automatic bot that shows spreads between four 24 exchanges.</p>
1. Security: 3/5
<p class="s4">Since it is an automatic trading service, security is at an average level. This service has not been involved in hacking or fund theft from its users. Like any other automatic bot, it also requires API access.</p>
2. User reviews: 4/5
<p class="s4">User reviews are mixed. Many share their success stories of earning with this service, but there are also users who claim to have lost their funds. Some even reported that they couldn't make their subscription profitable using this bot.</p>
3. Functionality: 2/5
<p class="s4">This bot supports only four of the most popular exchanges, resulting in high competition among arbitrage traders and users of the service. This makes finding good spreads more challenging.</p>
4. Prices: 2/5
<p class="s4">The price for this product is $9 &ndash; $149 for a month, a reasonably acceptable price for what this bot provides.</p>
5. Additional features: 3/5
<p class="s4">This service offers additional features available to users:</p>
<p class="s4">- A demo account where you can try out your strategies.</p>
<p class="s4">- Cloud server (it's not safe)&nbsp;</p>
Conclusion
<p>We have highlighted some arbitrage bots that we believe are the most comprehensive and reflect the cryptocurrency arbitrage market. We recommend trying out&nbsp;ArbitrageScanner, even if you have used other bots that are not in our top list. We believe it is truly a market leader that other services will adapt to</p>

2. User reviews: 4/5
<p class="s4">User reviews are generally good, but there are negative reviews regarding the service's performance. Some users complain about the delayed support response, but we do not consider these to be critical drawbacks of the project.</p>
3. Functionality: 4/5
<p class="s4">The service offers automatic arbitrage, but only on a single exchange. Due to the large number of users, it is very difficult to automatically earn profits using this service as there is significant competition among arbitrage traders using the same bot. There is inter-exchange arbitrage available on 16 CEX exchanges, butcompared to the number supported by the first-place service in our ranking, this seems very limited. Moreover, 3Commas does not support DEX exchanges, which are now considered the new frontier for arbitrage opportunities.</p>
4. Prices: 5/5
<p class="s4">The service offers a 7-day free trial, which is much longer than its competitors. The tariff prices range from $29 to $99, which is quite competitive for the services provided.</p>
5. Additional features: 4/5
<p class="s4">This is the most interesting aspect, considering what additional features each product offers. 3Commas provides:</p>
<p class="s4">- 5 bots for manual trading and 9 for automatic trading, but most of them are available in the highest subscription.</p>
<p class="s4">- A demo account where you can try out your strategies.</p>
<p class="s4">- An internal portfolio rebalancer.</p>
Bitsgap
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="s4">In the third place in our ranking is Bitsgap with a rating of 3.6.</p>
<p class="s4">This is an automatic bot that supports 15 CEX exchanges.</p>
1. Security: 4/5
<p class="s4">As we mentioned before, automatic bots are not safe to use. Here, we encounter the first confirmation of this statement. Some users reported that funds went missing from their accounts. It could be malicious competition, but we cannot overlook these statements.</p>
2. User reviews: 3/5
<p class="s4">User reviews are mixed, with complaints about poor support, delayed bot performance, and some exchanges periodically not functioning. As mentioned before, there are also claims about missing funds. On the other hand, some users did not experience such issues. While we cannot recommend using this bot, we also cannot claim that it is developed by dishonest developers.</p>
3. Functionality: 4/5
<p class="s4">The functionality does not stand out among automatic arbitrage bots. It supports 15 CEX exchanges and lacks DEX exchanges. Otherwise, it duplicates or even lacks certain features compared to 3Commas.</p>
4. Prices: 5/5
<p class="s4">The minimum tariff is $23, and the maximum is $119. The difference between tariffs is minimal, and in the market, this is a relatively high price for the services provided.</p>
5. Additional features: 2/5
<p class="s4">The service offers an arbitrage profitability blog and knowledge base, and unfortunately, that's all the additional functionality it provides.</p>
Coinrule
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="s4">In fourth place on the list of arbitrage bots is Coinrule with a rating of 3.4.</p>
<p class="s4">This is an automatic bot for arbitrage that supports 10 CEX exchanges.</p>
1. Security: 2/5
<p class="s4">Once again, this is an automatic bot that uses API. There are also articles about users of this bot losing their funds, but we cannot vouch for the accuracy of this information. It could also be the work of competitors, but we cannot ignore these claims.</p>
2. User reviews: 3/5
<p class="s4">User reviews are mixed. Many find it challenging to work with, even for experienced arbitrage traders. There are also negative reviews about missing funds, as mentioned earlier.</p>
3. Functionality: 4/5
<p class="s4">The bot supports only 10 CEX exchanges, and configuring it requires significant effort. Its functionality does not stand out compared to other automatic bots we reviewed today.</p>
4. Prices: 5/5
<p class="s4">The price for this product is $30 - $450 per month, which is above average considering the intuitiveness of the service's management and prices for similar features among competitors.</p>
5. Additional features: 3/5
<p class="s4">- Marketplace of arbitrage strategies&nbsp;</p>
HaasOnline
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="s4">In the fifth place in our ranking is HaasOnline with a rating of 2.8.</p>
<p class="s4">It is also an automatic bot that shows spreads between four 24 exchanges.</p>
1. Security: 3/5
<p class="s4">Since it is an automatic trading service, security is at an average level. This service has not been involved in hacking or fund theft from its users. Like any other automatic bot, it also requires API access.</p>
2. User reviews: 4/5
<p class="s4">User reviews are mixed. Many share their success stories of earning with this service, but there are also users who claim to have lost their funds. Some even reported that they couldn't make their subscription profitable using this bot.</p>
3. Functionality: 2/5
<p class="s4">This bot supports only four of the most popular exchanges, resulting in high competition among arbitrage traders and users of the service. This makes finding good spreads more challenging.</p>
4. Prices: 2/5
<p class="s4">The price for this product is $9 &ndash; $149 for a month, a reasonably acceptable price for what this bot provides.</p>
5. Additional features: 3/5
<p class="s4">This service offers additional features available to users:</p>
<p class="s4">- A demo account where you can try out your strategies.</p>
<p class="s4">- Cloud server (it's not safe)&nbsp;</p>
Conclusion
<p>We have highlighted some arbitrage bots that we believe are the most comprehensive and reflect the cryptocurrency arbitrage market. We recommend trying out&nbsp;ArbitrageScanner, even if you have used other bots that are not in our top list. We believe it is truly a market leader that other services will adapt to</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>In a groundbreaking move, video game commerce giant Xsolla has teamed up with cryptocurrency platform, Crypto.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integration of Crypto.com's checkout solution into Xsolla's Pay Station platform heralds a new era in the gaming world and is a bold move forward for Crypto.com in its quest to carve a niche in the gaming sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integration promises to offer game enthusiasts and developers a seamless way to embrace cryptocurrency payments, ensuring smoother transactions and an enriched user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the digital realm and metaverse grow, the partnership ensures gamers have plenty of payment options at their fingertips. Eric Anziani, the COO of Crypto.com, expressed his enthusiasm, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is significant potential in the convergence of gaming and Web3. By partnering with a global gaming leader like Xsolla and leveraging our respective assets and expertise, we are helping make that potential a reality &ndash; giving developers, publishers, and players a seamless way to engage and create value in the crypto economy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xsolla's Pay Station, already a powerhouse facilitating in-game purchases across a vast expanse of over 200 regions, is set to amplify its offerings with the Crypto.com Pay integration. This move is poised to broaden horizons for game developers, allowing them to connect with a diverse audience and explore untapped markets and revenue avenues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris Hewish, the head honcho at Xsolla, noted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gaming industry is rapidly evolving, and we must adapt to meet those changes. The integration of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment offers game developers and players an innovative payment solution that aligns with the global shift towards digital currencies. Our collaboration with Crypto.com marks a pivotal moment for the gaming industry, paving the way for a more inclusive and secure gaming ecosystem.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a similar note, Patrick Yoon, who oversees Crypto.com's operations in Korea, added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are tremendously excited to take this first step with Xsolla as part of a broader collaboration initiative in Korea and on a global level. We look forward to continuing to work with Xsolla in developing and advancing payment ecosystems and digital asset adoption.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This joint enterprise between Crypto exchange Crypto.com and global video game commerce company Xsolla offers much potential for further integration of crypto and gaming. The availability of crypto payments for gamers is likely to stimulate both sectors.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Crypto investing app Libertify is calling on retail investors to up their game with the launch of a new offering that provides free, AI-powered risk assessments and instant optimization proposals for their portfolios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify is the creator of an AI-powered app that uses intelligent algorithms powered by neural networks to recommend portfolio adjustments, with the goal being to optimize user&rsquo;s portfolios and hedge against any risk they might be exposed to. The startup believes it can provide a valuable service to investors, given the notorious volatility of the crypto market and the instability of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its new offering, Libertify says it will provide a free audit of the user&rsquo;s crypto portfolio, followed by an instant optimization proposal, with recommendations on the adjustments investors should make to hedge against risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offering works with just about any kind of digital wallet, including software wallets such as Binance, Coinbase and MetaMask, as well as hardware wallets like Ledger, Libertify said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify CEO Steve Rosenblum said last year&rsquo;s crypto winter shows that it&rsquo;s time for investors to learn from the past. The company&rsquo;s portfolio audits provide investors with a unique way to scan risk exposure, he explained. The launch of its offering is well-timed too, as the market for crypto retail investors is growing rapidly. Whereas there were around 200 million crypto investors globally in 2017, that number is expected to rise to more than 1.6 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an intriguing offering that will enable retail investors to benefit from the same kind of risk management solutions that were previously only available to the biggest banks and financial institutions, Libertify said. Until now, retail investors have always had to rely on their own insights and abilities to analyze the crypto market, but this approach is fraught with danger. As Rosenblum explains, by following their instincts, investors often make irrational choices, increasing the chance of them suffering considerable losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify&rsquo;s AI-powered recommendations and proposals enable crypto investors to better protect themselves against market volatility, while still holding onto the assets they believe in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crypto users buy tokens based on their beliefs and hopes, often forgetting that the crypto market is a turbo of volatility,&rdquo; Rosenblum said. &ldquo;Simple and efficient, our industry-first AI risk management solution brings new hope for all self-directed investors still shocked by the last crypto crisis.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The capabilities of Libertify&rsquo;s app were validated earlier this year when it was announced as the winner of the Paris leg of the Fast Track Hong-Kong FinTech, a prestigious annual contest for fintech and wealthtech startups that provides opportunities to secure funding and mentorships from some of Hong Kong&rsquo;s biggest financial firms. Having won that leg, Libertify will face off against 11 other startups in November&rsquo;s grand finale.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Yield Guild Games surged nearly 600% in less than a week, smashing through the top gainers charts before abruptly crashing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to reports, a new Binance trading product and an ongoing community gaming event have played a pivotal role in the incredible price rally of the YGG token.&nbsp;</p>
YGG Token Surges&nbsp;
<p>According to data from CoinmarketCap, the Yield Guild Games (YGG) token saw a dramatic surge over the past week, rising by 580% and reaching a peak of $0.93 on the 7th of August, 2023. However, the token abruptly crashed soon after reaching this price level and is currently trading at around $0.36. However, the token had hinted at a decline in price in its gradually dropping trading volume. The trading volume recorded a drop of 26% in 24 hours, falling under $500 million, while the market cap increased by $17 million, reaching $161 million.&nbsp;</p>
Why Did The YGG Price Rally?&nbsp;
<p>Observers attributed the surge in the YGG token&rsquo;s price to a couple of major factors. On the 3rd of August, Yield Guild Games announced the 4th season of the Guild Advancement Program (GAP). The Guild Advancement Program is a periodic gaming event that distributes rewards such as tokens to community members who successfully complete specified quests in participating in YGG-affiliated games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4th season of Yield Guild Games includes some of the biggest names in the space, such as Splinterlands, Skyweaver, and Axie Infinity. As a result, it should come as no surprise that the Yield Guild Games network usage saw a spike, reaching a one-month high of 192 active addresses. Yield Guild Games stated in its press release,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the community&rsquo;s most recent top picks are joining the fold this season, with all-new quests for guild members to dive into as they hone their skills and establish their web3 reputation. The season will officially begin on the 3rd of August, 2023, and will run until the 27th of September, 2023.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barely a day later, Binance announced plans to launch a YGG/USDT trading pair for perpetual contracts on its CEX platform, allowing up to 20x leverage. Available on-chain data suggests that the announcement brought in about $100 million worth of new capital into the YGG ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Whales Dumping Share Of YGG
<p>While the growth has been quite notable, reports have emerged of venture capital companies who initially backed the project, reportedly looking to sell their share of YGG on Binance. Data from LookOnChain sourced on the 7th of August shows that Bitkraft Ventures and DWF Labs have moved their YGG holdings to Binance and are most likely looking to sell. DWF Labs had received around 29 million YGG from the Yield Guild Games Treasury. However, on-chain data has suggested that most of these tokens have been moved to exchanges. Bitkraft Ventures also made large deposits on Binance using FalconX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another whale, Wintermute Trading, has reportedly deposited just over 11 million YGG worth $6.7 million to different exchanges over the past four days. It currently holds a further 2.5 million YGG, valued at around $1.5 million. LookOnChain also showed that Youbi Capital had deposited around 1 million YGG to Binance. The firm currently holds about 11 million YGG. Sfermion has also jumped on board the selling wagon, using FalconX to deposit its YGG tokens on Binance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large deposits generally signify an investor&rsquo;s willingness to exchange the token for other assets or sell them. This is also true of whales such as the ones mentioned earlier. Smaller investors generally tend to follow larger investors, copying their selling behavior.</p>

                    <description>
                        <![CDATA[<p>Steadefi has become the latest DeFi entity to be hit with an exploit, with the company stating in a tweet on X that all the funds it currently holds are at risk of becoming irrecoverable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent hacks have taken a toll on the space and have put considerable strain on public trust in DeFi apps.</p>
Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>News of the attack first became public on the 7th of August, when it emerged that the decentralized finance app was hit by an exploit of at least $334,000. While the attack was ongoing, the protocol&rsquo;s development team put out a message on X, stating that the attack had put all funds held on the platform at risk and they could become irrecoverable. As a result, the app&rsquo;s total value locked (TVL) fell off a cliff, according to data from DefiLlama. The team posted a message stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;NOTICE: Steadefi has been exploited, and all funds are currently at risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The team, while confirming the attack, posted a follow-up message on X and explained how the attack occurred. According to the message, the hacker managed to gain access to the private key of the team&rsquo;s deployer wallet and perform OwnerOnly functions. After gaining access to OwnerOnly functions, the hacker executed several OwnerOnly actions, such as allowing any wallet to borrow funds from lending vaults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team further stated that the attacker managed to drain all loanable funds. However, it assured users that all collateral held in vaults and not lent out was secure. This is because the app does not contain OwnerOnly functions to remove deposits. This means those users who deposited funds to the app&rsquo;s &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; vaults could withdraw some of their funds.&nbsp;</p>
Farming Contracts Stopped&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, the hacker also stopped farming contracts through an OwnerOnly function. This means all users who deposited svTokens or ibTokens to farms are currently unable to withdraw their funds. The post states that the funds are essentially stuck in the app&rsquo;s contracts, with token holders who deposited into the farms left in the lurch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to details currently available, the tokens transferred to the address in question include 130,429 USD Coin, 3.39 BTC, 6184 Avalanche (AVAX), and 15 Wrapped Ether (WETH). Apart from the Wrapped Ether, all other tokens were immediately swapped for WETH. The attacker then bridged 184 WETH to another network via the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
Steadefi Attempts To Negotiate With Hackers&nbsp;
<p>The development team also confirmed that it is attempting to negotiate with the hackers and has sent an on-chain message to the hacker&rsquo;s address, 0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc, on Ethereum. Blockchain data has revealed that the address saw a large number of inflows on the Avalanche Chain. The development team seems to have taken a leaf out of Curve Finance, Metronome, and Alchemix&rsquo;s playbook, offering 10% of the stolen funds as a bounty in return for the remaining 90%. The team also told the hacker that should they return the funds, there would be no involvement of law enforcement agencies or legal actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steadefi would like to discuss a bounty with any parties who were involved in the recent Steadefi exploit. We are offering a 10% bounty of any funds stolen, which are yours to keep if you return the remaining 90%.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, like Curve, in a stark warning, the team added that should the hackers refuse the offer, Steadefi would offer the 10% as a bounty to anyone in the public who could identify or supply information that leads to a conviction. Clearly, Steadefi hopes to see the funds return without any further complications. However, the platform is more than willing to fight for the funds should it need to. The offer expires on the 10th of August at 0800 UTC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues, etc. If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by the 10th of August at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law.&rdquo;</p>

DeFi&rsquo;s Hacker Headache&nbsp;
<p>Crypto and DeFi remain highly vulnerable to bad actors, even as the space looks for wider acceptance. Last month, Coinspaid fell victim to an attack orchestrated by the dreaded Lazarus Group, a North Korean-backed hacker group. An analysis showed how the breach occurred and found multiple vulnerabilities in Coinspaid&rsquo;s security. At the beginning of August, decentralized exchange LeetSwap suspended trading thanks to fears of a potential exploit. Bankrupt crypto platform Voyager also suffered a breach in the middle of its court-supervised recovery process. Another August heist saw a scammer steal around $20 million worth of USDT through a zero transfer phishing attack. However, Tether was quick to respond, freezing the attacker&rsquo;s address and blacklisting them.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Steadefi has become the latest DeFi entity to be hit with an exploit, with the company stating in a tweet on X that all the funds it currently holds are at risk of becoming irrecoverable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent hacks have taken a toll on the space and have put considerable strain on public trust in DeFi apps.</p>
Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>News of the attack first became public on the 7th of August, when it emerged that the decentralized finance app was hit by an exploit of at least $334,000. While the attack was ongoing, the protocol&rsquo;s development team put out a message on X, stating that the attack had put all funds held on the platform at risk and they could become irrecoverable. As a result, the app&rsquo;s total value locked (TVL) fell off a cliff, according to data from DefiLlama. The team posted a message stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;NOTICE: Steadefi has been exploited, and all funds are currently at risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The team, while confirming the attack, posted a follow-up message on X and explained how the attack occurred. According to the message, the hacker managed to gain access to the private key of the team&rsquo;s deployer wallet and perform OwnerOnly functions. After gaining access to OwnerOnly functions, the hacker executed several OwnerOnly actions, such as allowing any wallet to borrow funds from lending vaults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team further stated that the attacker managed to drain all loanable funds. However, it assured users that all collateral held in vaults and not lent out was secure. This is because the app does not contain OwnerOnly functions to remove deposits. This means those users who deposited funds to the app&rsquo;s &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; vaults could withdraw some of their funds.&nbsp;</p>
Farming Contracts Stopped&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, the hacker also stopped farming contracts through an OwnerOnly function. This means all users who deposited svTokens or ibTokens to farms are currently unable to withdraw their funds. The post states that the funds are essentially stuck in the app&rsquo;s contracts, with token holders who deposited into the farms left in the lurch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to details currently available, the tokens transferred to the address in question include 130,429 USD Coin, 3.39 BTC, 6184 Avalanche (AVAX), and 15 Wrapped Ether (WETH). Apart from the Wrapped Ether, all other tokens were immediately swapped for WETH. The attacker then bridged 184 WETH to another network via the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
Steadefi Attempts To Negotiate With Hackers&nbsp;
<p>The development team also confirmed that it is attempting to negotiate with the hackers and has sent an on-chain message to the hacker&rsquo;s address, 0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc, on Ethereum. Blockchain data has revealed that the address saw a large number of inflows on the Avalanche Chain. The development team seems to have taken a leaf out of Curve Finance, Metronome, and Alchemix&rsquo;s playbook, offering 10% of the stolen funds as a bounty in return for the remaining 90%. The team also told the hacker that should they return the funds, there would be no involvement of law enforcement agencies or legal actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steadefi would like to discuss a bounty with any parties who were involved in the recent Steadefi exploit. We are offering a 10% bounty of any funds stolen, which are yours to keep if you return the remaining 90%.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, like Curve, in a stark warning, the team added that should the hackers refuse the offer, Steadefi would offer the 10% as a bounty to anyone in the public who could identify or supply information that leads to a conviction. Clearly, Steadefi hopes to see the funds return without any further complications. However, the platform is more than willing to fight for the funds should it need to. The offer expires on the 10th of August at 0800 UTC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues, etc. If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by the 10th of August at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cypher Protocol, a decentralized futures exchange operating on the Solana blockchain, disclosed on August 7th that a significant security breach occurred on their platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The breach led to an estimated unauthorized transfer of assets valued at around $1 million. Swiftly addressing the event, Cypher Protocol informed its community of followers on X (formerly Twitter) and took immediate action by freezing its associated smart contract.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A statement from the firm emphasized their responsive action:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Cypher has experienced a security incident. The smart contract has been frozen. Investigations are ongoing. The team is currently working with individuals and investigating. To the hacker: We are writing to see whether you would be open to speaking with us about any potential next steps."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Data sourced from the Solana blockchain explorer, Solscan, has been invaluable in providing insights into the breach. It appears that the attacker or attackers absconded with a considerable 38,530 Solana (SOL) tokens in addition to $123,184 USD Coin (USDC). In sum, these unauthorized transactions amounted to roughly $1,035,203. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">What has raised eyebrows in the aftermath of the breach was the movement of the alleged funds. Within a short span following the exploit, a sum of 30,000 USDC from the contentious wallet was rerouted to Binance&rsquo;s specific Solana USDC address. The rapidity of these fund movements highlights the speed at which digital assets can change hands, emphasizing the need for robust security measures and real-time monitoring.</p>
Community Response and Calls for Accountability
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The aftermath of the exploit was punctuated by unique, digital-era responses. Members from the cryptocurrency community sent a series of NFTs to the suspected wallet. These weren&rsquo;t typical assets, but they bore messages &ndash; some of which appealed to the hacker's conscience to return the stolen funds. Among the various messages, one read:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Seriously though, you used Binance and KuCoin to fund and to try and get 30k out. People will find you. Please do the right thing and give the rest back."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The timing of this security breach was rather inopportune, as it coincided with Cypher Protocol&rsquo;s collaborative mtnDAO hacker house event, which they co-hosted with another Solana protocol, Marginfi. Ensuring clarity and dispelling doubts about their own security, Marginfi swiftly relayed via their Telegram channel that they remained unaffected by the breach and continue to maintain their operational independence from Cypher.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As of the time of reporting, no Solana-based funds have been detected as transferred to the Ethereum network, leaving the next steps of the alleged hacker unpredictable.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Incidents like these not only impact the entities directly involved but also reverberate throughout the crypto community. They underscore the persistent challenges in the realm of digital security and emphasize the need for continuous improvements in safeguarding digital assets.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Less than a day after PayPal&rsquo;s huge announcement, Ethereum became flooded by imposter tokens trying to ride the hype.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The digital payments and fintech giant announced the official launch of its very own Ethereum-based stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD) yesterday August 7. PYUSD is an ERC-20 token which will be pegged to the US dollar at a fixed rate of $1. It will be primarily used as a bridge between fiat currencies and web3, enabling conversion of any of the platform&rsquo;s listed digital assets to and from PYUSD. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch has been the result of PayPal&rsquo;s own exploration into stablecoins at least as far back as January 2022 but which was temporarily halted due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The launch might mean that an agreement has been made between regulators and PayPal&rsquo;s stablecoin issuer Paxos. Now, the launch has been received with much fanfare, with the stablecoin finally rolling out to customers &ldquo;in the coming weeks.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, this has not stopped scammers from riding the hype and launching fake PayPal stablecoins; which have since flooded cryptocurrency exchanges such as Uniswap. This was in part due to PayPal and Paxos&rsquo; own failure to include the official token address for PYUSD in their respective announcements. Users were then quick to inform PayPal about the problem. Finally, after more than a day since the PYUSD announcement, Paxos has released the official smart contract for PYUSD and the corresponding token address and GitHub repository. Currently, the max total supply of PYUSD sits at 26.9 million according to etherscan.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of PayPal&rsquo;s own stablecoin could send waves throughout the crypto industry in the United States. The fact that a stablecoin was released could mean that the current hostile environment for crypto in the country might start to somewhat cool down.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>PayPal has announced the launch of its native U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD (PYUSD) based on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
First Global Payments Company to Launch a Stablecoin&nbsp;
<p>On Monday, August 7, digital payments giant PayPal announced the official launch of its Ethereum-based stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. PayPal USD (PYUSD) will become available to the eligible U.S. customers in the upcoming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ERC-20 stablecoin can be used for transfers between PayPal and supported external wallets, person-to-person payments, funding purchases, and converting any of the platform&rsquo;s listed digital assets to and from PayPal USD.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar," commented Dan Schulman, president and CEO, PayPal. "Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD."</p>

<p>According to the company&rsquo;s statement, PYUSD will serve as a bridge between fiat and Web3 for consumers and merchants, will be available to external developers, wallets and web3 applications, can be seamlessly adopted by exchanges, and used as a driving force behind many experiences in the PayPal ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issuer of PayPal USD is Paxos Trust Company, a fully licensed New-York based financial institution specializing in blockchain. PYUSD reserves are fully supported by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal USD can be bought or sold at a fixed rate $1 per PYUSD via PayPal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting from September 2023, Paxos will be publishing a public monthly Reserve Report for PayPal USD, and a public third-party attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to building products and services that add utility to digital currencies, PayPal is focused on increasing consumer and merchant comprehension of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), while working closely with regulators as the industry evolves.&rdquo; reads the PayPal press release.&nbsp;</p>

PayPal Continues Integration of Crypto
<p>PayPal first confirmed its exploration of stablecoins back at the beginning of last year, although in February 2023 it reported to have halted the project due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The release of PYUSD might mean that the company and its stablecoin issuer Paxos have finally reached an agreement with its persecutors.</p>
<p>The prominent fintech company has been actively exploring and integrating crypto services for the last couple of years. PayPal has recently revealed that it&rsquo;s holding almost $1 billion worth of crypto on behalf of its clients.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Records of Trump&rsquo;s and his inner circle&rsquo;s crypto promotions could be used against him in court and the upcoming presidential race.</p>
First US President to Ever Be Indicted
<p>Former US President. Donald J. Trump is the first American leader to ever be indicted. Trump is currently facing numerous charges in connection with at least three criminal cases including hush money payments, mishandling of classified documents, and the January 6 insurrection case, an effort to overturn the 2020 election. The 45th President of the US pleaded not guilty to all of the counts. However, the investigation continues. Trump might also face charges related to the election interference in the state of Georgia in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for crypto, some suggest that Trump&rsquo;s and his inner circle&rsquo;s involvement in activities related to digital assets could add up to the criminal charges against the former president and decrease his chances of reelection.</p>
Trump Family Jumps into NFT Space
<p>Former first lady, Melania Trump, was the first one to release an NFT collection called &ldquo;Melania&rsquo;s Vision&rdquo;on the Solana blockchain back in 2021. However, Melania Trump was later accused of buying the winning bid of her NFT auction in an effort to inflate the price of the collection.</p>
<p>This year, Melania Trump launched another batch of NFTs titled &ldquo;The 1776 Collection&rdquo;, timed for the US Independence Day, which seemed to have rolled out smoothly. Yet, her most recent NFT collection with the theme of Apollo 11 may have got the former first lady in trouble with NASA! Apparently, the agency doesn't approve of its images being used in connection with NFTs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;NASA is not approving any merchandising applications involving Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), as they are not consistent with the categories of products the agency is approved to merchandise,&rdquo; the document on the NASA website reads.&nbsp;</p>

Donald Trump&rsquo;s Controversial NFT Collection
<p>Even though Doland Trump had previously spoken out against crypto, he later followed his wife&rsquo;s steps and dropped his own NFT collection, &ldquo;Trump Digital Trading Cards&rdquo;. The first batch of NFTs, priced at $99 each, was sold within just 12 hours, raising over $5 million in the process. However, the floor price of the collectibles quickly dipped after.</p>
<p>Ironically, what made the NFT collection surge in price again (by a whopping 462%!) was the news about the former president's indictment and his arrest in New York City. Following the sudden success of the collection, in April 2023, Trump decided to launch the second series of his &ldquo;Digital Trading Cards&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Trump-branded NFTs were widely criticized and ridiculed both in the political and crypto spaces. It was recently revealed that the 45th President had made somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million on the sale of his collection so far. It is not clear what Trump will use this money for. Some speculate that the sum is aimed at funding the former president&rsquo;s legal battles.</p>
<p>Donald Trump will be running for president again in the upcoming 2024 election, along with other pro-crypto candidates.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency (NCA) began advertising roles to expand its cryptocurrency investigation team. </p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency (NCA) is actively recruiting for senior roles to carry out cryptocurrency investigations.</p>
<p>The NCA seeks to expand its task force on digital asset investigations and has posted four job opportunities on its website. The NCA appoints four senior investigators to join its Complex Financial Crime Team (CFTC) to assist with digital asset-related crimes.</p>
<p>The CFTC &ldquo;conducts high-end proactive illicit finance investigations,&rdquo; and the newly advertised roles fall under the scope of its newly formed Digital Assets Team (DAT). The DAT will ensure &ldquo;complex investigations into Blockchain-enabled crime are fully in compliance with the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA).&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the NCA website,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It involves enquiries into criminal activity within virtual arenas, high end of high harm cryptocurrency and virtual assets fraud and money laundering offences carried out by significant organised crime groups and state actors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The positions require individuals to work alongside and collaborate with CPS, investigators, intelligence and analysis staff to ensure disclosure requirements are accordingly dealt with.</p>
UK Sets Up Investigative Unit to Deal With Illicit Crypto-Related Activities
<p>Along with the need for a more comprehensive need for crypto regulation, so too does the market exist for teams and agencies to investigate crypto-related activities. The UK&rsquo;s NCA established its digital asset team earlier this year due to the massive investor losses incurred by numerous scandals that shook the industry.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) undertook a mission to shut down all illicit crypto ATM sites and successfully put an end to 26 locations in July.</p>
<p>The UK has also made strides in crypto regulation. The UK Parliament passed a bill last month that could help authorities seize and freeze cryptocurrencies that have been used in criminal activities.</p>

It will be able to conduct much deeper, more granular market analysis through the application of technical indicators (such as the RSI and EMA) to aid traders and investors in their research. It has been tuned to track all major launchpad and IDO platforms, providing a more holistic view of the startup landscape. Initially having a surface level set of assets that were limited in scope, the upgraded chatbot has been plugged in to service over 5,000 coins/tokens (and will be constantly expanding).</p>
<p>As it pertains to the bug fixes, all minor and major points of friction for the users have been mended. Response times have been compressed, accuracy has been calibrated for higher contextual fidelity, and error potential has been minimized.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said it had reduced its stake in trading app operator Robinhood Markets by nearly 90%. </p>
<p>According to an SEC filing, Alphabet reduced its exposure to Robinhood Market by 90%.</p>
Google-Parent Company Dumps Robinhood Stock
<p>Alphabet cut its exposure to Robinhood Markets by nearly 90% as Robinhood experiences difficulties with a slowdown in its business. According to reports by Reuters, Alphabet invested in the trading app operators when it was still an unlisted startup. The company reportedly held over 4.9 million Robinhood shares by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Robinhood shares peaked in August 2021, and soon after its IPO, Alphabet&rsquo;s stake was worth approximately $419 million.</p>
<p>Since reaching their high in 2021, Robinhood&rsquo;s shares have dropped 86%. The company has struggled since its IPO after seeing a massive user surge during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Robinhood has, however, been very involved in the memecoin frenzy and retail trading outrage at payment for order flow, CNBC reports.</p>
<p>Robinhood recorded a profit last week for the first time since becoming a public company.</p>
Robinhood Undertakes Third Round of Layoffs in a Year
<p>The famous online brokerage firm announced in June that it would lay off around 150 full-time employees, around 7% of its workforce.</p>
<p>The most recent wave of job cuts marks Robinhood&rsquo;s third round in just over a year, reflecting the company&rsquo;s struggles with ongoing market fluctuations.</p>
<p>The company further recorded a 30% loss in Q1 2023. The trading app said its crypto business brought in $38 million in Q1, down 30% from $54 million in Q2 2022.</p>
<p>Robinhood struggles have been exacerbated after the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase and alleged specific crypto tokens were securities. In the days following the lawsuits, Robinhood removed Solana, Cardano, and Polygon from its platform.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Boredom reigns as regards the bitcoin price, as sideways and downwards movement enters its seventh week.</p>
Volatility will come
<p>Could it be that it is just because it&rsquo;s crypto that investors get so bored so quickly? If it were a major stock on the S&amp;P, such price action would be taken as perfectly normal and nothing to get vexed about.</p>
<p>However, in the world of crypto, investors are used to the volatility that cryptocurrencies usually provide, and even though bitcoin is easily the biggest of the cryptocurrencies, it still retains the ability to shoot up or down with a fair measure of velocity.</p>
<p>From a charting perspective moving sideways and downwards suggests a descending channel, which is a bullish formation. If this channel initiates after a spike to the upside, it becomes a bull flag - an even more bullish chart pattern.</p>
Three major supports await
<p>It might appear to be one of the less perfect bull flags, given that both candle bodies and wicks have on occasion escaped to the upside, before being drawn back into the channel, but a bull flag it still remains.</p>
<p>Look for volatility to come back as this bitcoin bull flag slowly approaches the point when it really needs to break, with three major supports waiting.</p>
<p>Support number one is the 0.618 Fibonacci for this latest move, followed by support two, in the form of the upwards trendline from the beginning of the year, and finally support three which is the 200-day moving average.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin is converging towards all three of these supports and therefore something has to give. The fact that it is in a bull flag would certainly give a lot more confidence to the bulls.</p>
Expect the unexpected
<p>However, from a trading perspective, it might appear just too easy for bitcoin to reach the supports and then make the expected surge to the upside. Trading generally doesn&rsquo;t follow the expectations of the herd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore there probably needs to be some kind of divergence from the script, and this might mean that bitcoin gets sent skyward before reaching the support, or it could fall through support before reversing back up.</p>
<p>Many other scenarios can also be taken into account. Whatever happens, traders should keep their wits about them.</p>
<p>For those who aren&rsquo;t watching the lower time frame charts, if bitcoin dips it might just be an excellent time to enter the market or buy more. However, all should follow a comprehensive risk management process and perhaps take expert advice. Trade carefully.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>The Indian government is using its time as president of the G20 nations to drum up support for globally coordinated regulation of crypto assets.</p>
Getting tough on digital assets
<p>The Indian government, along with its central bank, has been a harsh critic of cryptocurrencies for some time now. Therefore, it comes as little surprise that India is using its time as president of the G20 nations to try to implement coordinated regulations that will get tough on digital assets.</p>
<p>As India uses its influence to suppress cryptocurrencies, ably assisted by global financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) among others, it often resorts to claims that it is doing so in order to ensure monetary stability, and it continually refers back to the FTX collapse as a reason for doing so.</p>
Protecting the banking system?
<p>Ensuring monetary stability might well mean protecting a banking system that is on the verge of collapse - only able to support itself by printed money out of the magician&rsquo;s hat wielded by the US Federal Reserve. This &lsquo;money&rsquo; out of thin air is claimed to &ldquo;cost nothing&rdquo;, and for the Federal Reserve this may well be the case. However, for the vast majority of the world&rsquo;s citizens this means more currency flooding the economy and &lsquo;debasement&rsquo; of their purchasing power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the FTX debacle, which is used by those doing the bidding of the bankers to tarnish the entire crypto industry, there are many unanswered questions as to how Sam Bankman&rsquo;s empire grew out of nothing, and how such fraud was allowed to take place right under the nose of the SEC.</p>
Risks
<p>Be that as it may, India will go ahead and promote a &ldquo;Synthesis Paper&rdquo; which is being produced by the IMF and the FSB that will enable the perceived &lsquo;risks&rsquo; of cryptocurrencies to be dealt with.</p>
<p>These &lsquo;risks&rsquo; might include that the people use their fiat currencies to buy such assets as bitcoin (God forbid) in order to protect themselves from the crushing debasement that is taking place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The risks do include the possibility of a &ldquo;spillover&rdquo; from crypto into the traditional financial system. But how a fledgling ecosystem of around $1.2 trillion is going to affect the traditional financial system of $hundreds of trillions remains to be seen.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>OPNX, the newly launched crypto exchange by founders of the now-defunct Three Arrows Capital (3AC), has reportedly launched a bid to take over struggling crypto lender Hodlnaut.</p>
<p>If the bid is approved, the deal could see an injection of around $30 million worth of FLEX tokens into Hodlnaut.&nbsp;</p>
A White Knight Investor For Hodlnaut?&nbsp;
<p>According to a report in Bloomberg, the OPNX exchange has made an offer to acquire 75% of the struggling crypto lender. The bid comes at a critical time for Hodlnaut, which is undergoing a restructuring plan under the supervision of a Singapore court. The deal would see a significant capital injection into Hodlnaut and would partially cover outstanding claims and creditor payouts. If the deal is approved, creditors will receive 30% of their claims in FLEX tokens and other cryptocurrencies. This offer also gives them a direct stake in the future potential of the entity being acquired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, creditors also have the choice of opting for a pro-rata payment, allowing them to recover about 95% of the available corporate asset pool. According to OPNX, this option prioritizes the immediate financial recovery and stability of creditors. However, the bid is subject to approval from Hodlnaut&rsquo;s creditors, who effectively hold the fate of the acquisition in their hands. The creditors&rsquo; decisions could also have a significant impact on the larger crypto-lending ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Unclear If Deal Goes Through&nbsp;
<p>So far, it remains to be seen if Hodlnaut&rsquo;s creditors will accept the deal. Back in April, a significant majority of the struggling crypto lender&rsquo;s creditors indicated their desire to liquidate the company. In a letter from the interim judicial manager (IJM), users representing 55.38% of creditors having claims of around 228.3 million Singaporean dollars ($170 million) have indicated that they prefer liquidation rather than restructuring. However, at the time, there was no source of fresh capital for the company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There appears to be no indication of a white knight investor to date, and hence no prospect of any fresh capital injection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, only users with around 2.42% of claims supported looking into the restructuring option. However, all of these claims belonged to company directors. A mediation proposal was also opposed by the major creditors of the company, including Samtrade Custodian and SAM Fintech, and the Algorand Foundation. Algorand has a $35 million exposure to Hodlnaut.&nbsp;</p>
The Hodlnaut Fiasco&nbsp;
<p>Hodlnaut halted all withdrawals in August 2022, as the turmoil in the crypto markets led to a significant liquidity crisis for the crypto lender. Eventually, the company entered into judicial management, temporarily protecting it against legal action. Following this, the company entered into a court-based restructuring process, shedding light on the extent of its financial difficulties. The company had stated at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are aiming to avoid a forced liquidation of our assets as it [&hellip;] will require us to sell our users&rsquo; cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and WBTC at these current depressed asset prices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Hodlnaut struggling with the complexities of financial rehabilitation and creditor interests, founders Zhu Juntao and Simon Lee proposed selling the business as an alternative to liquidation, arguing it would result in a more favorable outcome for creditors. Furthermore, regulatory concerns have also compounded troubles, with figures associated with Hodlnaut and OPNX facing reprimands in Dubai for operating OPNX without the necessary local licenses.&nbsp;</p>
The OPNX Exchange And Its 3AC Connection
<p>The FLEX token is the native token of the CoinFLEX exchange, founded by Sudhu Arumugam and Mark Lamb. Arumugam and Lamb are also the co-founders of OPNX, a crypto claims trading marketplace. Other co-founders of OPNX include Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, who founded the now-bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Creditors are pursuing both Zhu and Davies in the US over bankruptcy proceedings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The legal team representing creditors filed a motion urging that Davies be held in contempt of court for wilfully ignoring a subpoena connected to the firm&rsquo;s bankruptcy proceedings. Creditors have alleged that Davies is purposely delaying asset recovery. However, the motion does not apply to co-founder Su Zhu, who, thanks to his Singaporean nationality, is not subject to the jurisdiction of US courts.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Web3 video games franchise WAGMI Games has announced a couple of new executive hires, enhancing its dynamic team with experienced talent from some of the biggest names in the gaming industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new hires include Esteban Gil, formerly of Garena Free Fire, and Brent Pease, who previously held a senior role at Electronic Arts, the legendary company behind the FIFA football franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WAGMI said it was delighted to be able to announce the new hires, who bring a wealth of expertise from established games developers to help transform the industry with the unique advantages of Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of WAGMI, it&rsquo;s essentially a video games studio that&rsquo;s focused on Web3 gaming. In Web3 video games, players are uniquely able to own in-game assets such as characters, weapons and skins, which are represented by non-fungible tokens that can be bought and sold at will. Web3 gaming also provides unique incentives for players with in-game rewards such as WAGMI tokens which can be earned for completing daily challenges and beating other players in head-to-head matches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WAGMI&rsquo;s flagship title is WAGMI Defense, a sci-fi themed tower defense game in the mould of Plants vs. Zombies or Kingdom Rush Vengeance. Players are required to strategically place their troops and set their traps in order to defend their tower from the enemy onslaught. They need to stand up to the assault for three minutes per match, and with each round they win they&rsquo;ll earn an in-game resource called NiFe that can be used to buy other items or traded for cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gil, who previously led Garena Free Fire and served as Lean Portfolio Management at Respawn and Apex Legends, is being hired to assume a similar role at WAGMI. In particular, he&rsquo;ll be tasked with overseeing the company&rsquo;s business strategy development, focused on driving demand for consumer-oriented products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a statement, Gil said he&rsquo;s excited to apply his skills and experience to Web3, and stated his belief that technologies such as NFTs can revolutionize the gaming industry. &ldquo;By leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, we can deliver even more engaging and immersive gaming experiences to our fans around the world,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Pease, he joins the company from EA, where he most recently served as its Director of Operations. As a highly experienced industry executive, he will assume a combined COO/GM role at WAGMIU, where he&rsquo;ll be tasked with overseeing the company&rsquo;s day-to-day operations and focus on the implementation of key growth strategies. Pease is said to be a widely respected figure in the video gaming industry, having previously founded Industrial Toys, which was later acquired by EA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'I am honored to have been asked to bring my 30 years of experience in building games and companies to this incredible team of passionate creators,&rdquo; Pease said. &ldquo;This is the most exciting vision for players I have seen and I look forward to making amazing games at WAGMI that thrill our ever-growing community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is certainly lots of room for WAGMI to grow. At present, Web3 games attract barely 3% of the estimated three billion video games players in the world. Yet WAGMI says the advantages of Web3 gaming are so compelling that if it&rsquo;s able to lower the barrier to entry by easing onboarding friction, this number will surely grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, is Web3 gaming is to really catch on, the industry will need to develop truly engaging games that can capture the imagination of millions of gamers, just as legendary titles from the Web2 gaming world, such as GTA and Fortnite, have done. This explains WAGMI&rsquo;s decision to go after talent with experience in the traditional video game industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To have AAA Talent like Brent and Esteban join our team is a real testament to what we are building,&rdquo; said WAGMI&rsquo;s chief executive Ian Bentley. &ldquo;They see clearly not only our vision as a franchise, but also this once in a lifetime opportunity to be a part of history in evolving the gaming space.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prominent crypto analyst and investor Adam Cochran has called into question the solvency of Huobi, the 12th largest cryptocurrency exchange globally by spot trading volume.In a series of recent tweets, Cochran pointed to significant discrepancies in Huobi's reported Tether (USDT) holdings, suggesting that the firm might be failing to meet its financial obligations. Cochran bases his assertions on a detailed examination of Huobi's balance sheets and the recent activities of Justin Sun, the founder of Tron. Despite these allegations, Huobi maintains that all operations are proceeding as normal.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Cochran's investigation, Huobi's own "Merkle Tree Audit" indicates a significant discrepancy in the exchange's held assets. He points out that while the audit lists that Huobi users hold $631 million worth of Tether (USDT), Huobi's actual holdings amount to only $90 million. This significant gap, Cochran alleges, is indicative of insolvency. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cochran further argues that Sun has been treating the exchange like a personal piggy bank, transferring funds to his decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and thus leaving the exchange unable to meet its obligations. Specifically, he alleges that Sun is inflating the yield on his DeFi apps to entice more deposits into Huobi.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Adding to the concerns, Cochran noted a substantial sell-off of Tether (USDT) on Binance, which he believes is connected to the solvency fears surrounding Huobi. He also raised questions about Sun's recently launched "stUSDT", a variant of USDT that Sun claims is backed by government bonds. Cochran alleges that the stUSDT does not have sufficient backing, which further compounds the potential risk.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cochran also pointed out that certain Huobi and Tron executives are reportedly under investigation by Chinese authorities, a development that has fanned the flames of these allegations. These apprehended individuals reportedly include key personnel from both organizations, adding more credibrility to the concerns about Huobi's financial stability.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Huobi has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that all operations are running normally. However, Cochran dismissed these assertions, stating that his source, a senior executive at Tron, confirmed that team members are indeed under investigation due to actions related to Huobi.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cochran's analysis, if accurate, paints a worrying picture for Huobi's financial health, adding fuel to rumors of the company's potential insolvency. If Huobi users begin to lose faith in the exchange's financial stability, it could lead to a mass exodus from the platform and significant upheaval in the crypto market.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Alchemix, a lending platform, has reported that all the funds stolen by the Curve Finance hacker from Alchemix&rsquo;s alETH-ETH pool have been returned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve Finance had fallen victim to a major heist on the 31st of July, leading to the hacker draining around $61 million from the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
Alchemix Announces Return Of All Funds&nbsp;
<p>The Curve Finance exploit had resulted in Alchemix losing around $13.6 million from its alETH-ETH pool. Apart from Alchemix, several other pools also saw their funds drained. These included JPEGd&rsquo;s pETH-ETH pool, which saw outflows of around $11.4 million, and Metronome&rsquo;s sETH-ETH pool, which saw the exploit drain about $1.6 million. The hacker had targeted several stable pools on Curve Finance using a reentrancy bug that impacted the Vyper programming language used on Curve Finance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, Alchemix has announced on X that the hacker has returned the stolen funds after accepting a bug bounty offer from Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are extremely happy to announce that all funds stolen by the hacker of the Alchemix @CurveFinance pool have now been returned.&rdquo;</p>

An Offer The Hacker Couldn&rsquo;t Refuse&nbsp;
<p>Alchemix, Metronome, and Curve Finance had offered the hacker a 10% bug bounty as a reward, asking them to return the remaining 90% of the stolen funds. The three entities had stated that if the hacker returned the funds, they would not face any further legal or law enforcement actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The offer comes with a guarantee of no further legal actions or involvement of law enforcement. We want to resolve this in a civilized manner. You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the three protocols also told the hacker to view their offer as a final warning, giving them until the 6th of August to accept their offer. They warned that if the hacker refused or ignored their warning, they would be expanding the bounty to the public, offering 10% of the funds to anyone who would help identify the hacker in a way that would lead to conviction in court. The stark warning stated that the hacker would feel the full force of the law should he fail to comply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by the 6th of August at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law.&rdquo;</p>

Hacker Accepts Offer And Returns Funds&nbsp;
<p>On the 4th of August, the hacker posted a message on the Ethereum network directed at Curve Finance and Alchemix development teams. In the not-so-pleasant message, the hacker stated that they would return the funds, but because they did not want to ruin the multiple projects impacted, and not because they were caught or because of the threat of legal action. The hacker stated in his on-chain message,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m refunding, not because you can find me. It&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t want to ruin your project.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At around 11:16 am UTC, the hacker returned 1 alETH to the Curve Finance deployer account. Following the success of the initial transaction, the hacker made three separate transfers two hours later, totaling around 4820.55 alETH, sent to the Alchemix development team&rsquo;s multisig wallet. The funds returned were around $8.9 million worth of crypto assets, making up around 15% of the stolen funds. Alchemix later reported that the hacker returned all of the stolen funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NFT protocol JPEG&rsquo;d, in a separate announcement, also confirmed that they had been refunded, with the perpetrators returning around 5495 ETH. As stated in the bounty offer, the NFT protocol will not be taking any legal action against the hackers. The JPEG&rsquo;d team stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>​​&ldquo;Any further investigations or legal matters against the entity will end. We view this occurrence as a white-hat rescue.&rdquo;</p>

DeFi Breathes A Sigh Of Relief&nbsp;
<p>The Curve Finance exploit had put considerable pressure on the larger DeFi ecosystem after the value of the protocol&rsquo;s CRV token plummeted after the hack. Several reports that emerged after the hack stated that Curve founder Michael Egorov had taken several loans, putting up CRV as collateral, putting Egorov&rsquo;s $168 million lending position at risk of liquidation. This put major DeFi protocols Aave, Abracadabra, and several others at risk as well, thanks to a potential domino effect.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has published its August 2023 reserve report, showcasing a reserve ratio well over 100% for all of its major cryptocurrency holdings.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The disclosure forms a part of Binance's ongoing commitment to maintain a Proof of Reserves (PoR) system, providing evidence that it holds sufficient funds to cover all customer deposits. The report is based on an audit for BTC Block Height 801130 from aggregated data updated to August 1st, 2023.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Proof of Reserves (PoR) is a transparency protocol that confirms the solvency of a cryptocurrency exchange. It functions as proof that the exchange possesses enough funds to cover users' assets on a 1:1 ratio. Essentially, when a user deposits a Bitcoin, Binance's reserves increase by at least one Bitcoin, thereby ensuring all client funds are fully backed. These figures don't include Binance's corporate holdings, which are kept separate.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance's PoR report demonstrates that the exchange's reserves are well above the customer net balance for all the reported cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Tether, BUSD, and USDC, with reserve rates ranging from 101.62% to 117.99%. This shows that the company has more than enough reserves to meet all potential customer withdrawals.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">PoR aims to increase transparency, safety, and user protection in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As such, it discourages exchanges from misusing user funds and promotes trust among users. In line with this, Binance users can verify their account's inclusion in the last PoR verification themselves, further emphasizing the exchange's commitment to transparency and user trust.</p>
How Proof of Reserves (PoR) Works with Merkle Trees
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To ensure that it holds all user assets 1:1, Binance has implemented a system that leverages Merkle trees. A Merkle Tree is a cryptographic tool that facilitates the condensation of large volumes of data into a single hash, called a Merkle Root. This root acts as a cryptographic "seal" that summarizes all the input data. Furthermore, Merkle Trees allow users to verify specific contents included within a particular set of sealed data.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the context of PoR, Binance uses the properties of Merkle Trees to verify that individual user accounts are incorporated within the liabilities report inspected by an auditor. Each user can verify their asset holdings using their unique generated Merkle hash/record ID.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:</p>
<ol class="ol-list" start="">
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Verify Ownership of Address: Binance first verifies that the ownership of wallets (both cold and hot wallets) used in the PoR process belong to the exchange.</p>
</li>
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Snapshot of User Balances: A snapshot of asset holdings within each customer's account is taken at a specific date and time. </p>
</li>
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Generation of Merkle Tree: Binance generates an underlying data block by linking the hashed user ID and balance of each user. Based on all users' data, a Merkle tree is then created. If any account ID or balance in the leaf node changes, the Merkle root will also change. Consequently, every user can verify whether their assets are included in the leaf node.</p>
</li>
</ol>
zk-SNARKs in the Verification Process
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Along with Merkle Trees, Binance also utilizes zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) in the verification process. A zk-SNARK is a proof protocol that allows one to prove that they know a value without revealing what that value is. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the case of Binance, the exchange uses a zk-SNARK to demonstrate that all the leaf nodes' balance sets (i.e., user account balances) contribute to the exchange&rsquo;s claimed total user asset balance. Each user can easily access their leaf node to see that it was included in the process. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The use of zk-SNARKs follows a few steps:</p>
<ol class="ol-list" start="">
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Verify Ownership of Address: Like in the previous process, Binance verifies the ownership of the wallets (both cold and hot wallets) used in the PoR process. </p>
</li>
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Snapshot of User Balances: Again, a snapshot of asset holdings within each customer's account is taken.</p>
</li>
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Generate zk-SNARKs Proof: zk-SNARKs proof files are generated for each user. This allows every user to easily access their leaf node and verifies that the total net balance of the user is greater than or equal to zero.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In addition to these self-verification methods, Binance also uses third-party audits to provide audit reports, further bolstering the security and transparency of the verification process.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve is offering a $1.85 million reward to anyone who can identify the exploiter responsible for draining over $61 million from its pools on July 30. This announcement was made after the deadline for the voluntary return of funds expired.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The exploiter used vulnerable versions of the Vyper programming language to launch reentrancy attacks on targeted stable pools, leading to significant losses. Following the attack, Curve and other affected protocols offered a 10% bug bounty to the exploiter, totaling more than $6 million.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In response, the hacker returned stolen assets to two projects, Alchemix and JPEGd, but did not refund other affected pools.</p>
<p>What is a reentrancy attack?A reentrancy attack, the method used by the exploiter in this case, is a common security vulnerability in smart contracts, especially those running on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. In a nutshell, a reentrancy attack allows an attacker to repeatedly call a functiorn in a smart contract while a previous call to that same function has not yet finished executing.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Vyper programming language, which was used to build the targeted stable pools in this case, is a contract-oriented language similar to Solidity, another popular language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum. While Vyper is designed with a stronger emphasis on security and simplicity, it is not immune to reentrancy attacks, which are a pervasive problem in the world of smart contracts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">During a reentrancy attack, an exploiter can drain funds from a contract by recursively calling a function that withdraws funds. In this case, the exploiter managed to drain more than $61 million from several of Curve's stable pools, illustrating the severity of the attack and the poterntial impact of these types of vulnerabilities in the DeFi space.</p>
<p>The incident underscores the importance of proper security practices and rigorous code review in the development of smart contracts. Despite the relative maturity of DeFi, the risk of smart contract vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks remains, necessitating ongoing vigilance and robust security measures from DeFi projects.What's at stake for Curve Finance?</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Curve has now extended its bounty to the public, promising a reward equivalent to 10% of the remaining exploited funds (currently $1.85 million) to anyone who can identify the exploiter in a way that results in legal conviction. However, the firm has stated that it will not pursue the issue further if the exploiter chooses to return the stolen funds in full.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prior to returning some of the funds, the exploiter had sent a message to the Alchemix and Curve teams, stating that they were refunding the money not because the teams could find them, but because they didn't want to ruin the projects.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The July 30 attack targeted several of Curve&rsquo;s pools, including those of Alchemix, JPEGd, and Metronome, resulting in significant losses. The exploit exposed vulnerabilities across DeFi projects and triggered industry-wide efforts to recover stolen funds.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>With Pepe (PEPE) coin being bearish and Shiba Inu (SHIB) trying to gain ground, Pomerdoge (POMD) gives new hope. A play-to-earn (P2E) game concept is now in the presale phase. For new investors in the upcoming months, analysts expect 40x returns. As a result, more investors from Pepe and Shiba Inu are quickly joining the project.</p>

Pepe (PEPE) Price Rally to $0.00000123? Chart Pattern Signals End of Correction&nbsp;
<p>Pepe (PEPE) is a deflationary meme-coin with a unique system that enacts a no-tax policy and a redistributive structure that rewards long-term investors. The frog-themed meme coin Pepe experienced a big decline, and its price has wobbled several times.&nbsp; From all indications, it seems traders are strictly following its pattern.</p>
<p>A close examination of the charts on the crypto market reveals the development of a bullish reversal. Pepe has been extremely bearish at the moment and may drop at any time. It continues to decline even as bitcoin prices rise.</p>
<p>At press time, the Pepe trading volume is $48.46 million in the last 24 hours and is trading at $0.00000123. Analysts believe Pepe coins price will continue its downward movement until its trend lines are intact.</p>
Significant DeFi Step for Shiba Inu (SHIB) with SSI Update
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is a decentralized blockchain currently accepted as payment at hundreds of establishments, either directly or through third-party intermediaries.</p>
<p>A Shiba Inu employee has disclosed the company&rsquo;s intention to introduce digital identity verification in its ecosystem&rsquo;s applications. According to Shiba Inu&rsquo;s lead developer Shytoshi Kusama, a decentralized digital ecosystem and a global identity verification system are being built.</p>
<p>This action intends to usher in a new era of increased faith and trust in systems. At the time of this writing, Shiba Inu's price is $0.000009, with a USD 24-hour trading volume of $215 million.</p>
The Pomerdoge (POMD) Token Will Bring 40xReturns
<p>Pomerdoge provides users with more utility and benefits than meme coins Pepe and Shiba Inu. As a Play-to-Earn (P2E) cryptocurrency game, Pomerdoge intends to take full advantage of the enormous potential of the blockchain gaming industry.</p>
<p>Pomerdoge aims to offer a platform for competitive gaming that will enable communication between gamers worldwide. The project also prioritizes user security and has gone through a thorough examination by SolidProof and Cyberscope.</p>
<p>In addition, holders of POMD tokens can utilize them to obtain rewards, incentives, and NFTs. Additionally, based on their token holdings, presale customers will be eligible for some of the game's earnings.&nbsp; Therefore, they will get access to a small collection of 7,777 NFTs.</p>
<p>For the project's early backers, these exclusive advantages significantly increase the value proposition. The token is currently selling for only $0.007. Analysts predict 40x gains for investors in the future.&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk has restated any rumours that Twitter or &ldquo;X&rdquo; will launch a crypto token. In a stern reply to a fellow Twitter user Musk dispelled talk of a token by saying, &ldquo;And we never will.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently dispelled rumours that Twitter (or &ldquo;X&rdquo;) would launch a crypto token. One Twitter user posted to the social media platform warning fellow users, saying:</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Elon Musk and 𝕏 never launched a crypto token. Be careful of such articles. ⚠️ pic.twitter.com/tZqfwMMm2X</p>
&mdash; DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) August 5, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Musk simply replied: &ldquo;And we never will.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">And we never will</p>
&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 5, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Links to articles calling the so-called token &ldquo;$X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Twitter token&rdquo; have made rounds in the news cycle, claiming incredible gains in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The rumours come amid a significant Twitter rebrand as Musk aims to make X the new &ldquo;everything app.&rdquo; Understandably, users would suggest the likelihood of a Twitter or X-related cryptocurrency given the &ldquo;chief Twit&rsquo;s&rdquo; affinity for popular memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>
<p>Musk, or the &ldquo;Dogefather&rdquo;, acquired Twitter for a staggering $44 billion and temporarily changed Twitter&rsquo;s iconic blue-bird logo for Shiba Inu, Doge&rsquo;s characteristic logo.</p>
<p>Musk&rsquo;s move earned himself a lawsuit for racketeering and insider trading worth $258 billion and allowed DOGE to soar by 20%.</p>
X-Token Surges After Twitter Rebrand
<p>Although no affiliation with Twitter, X, or Elon Musk, an altcoin called the X token surged a whopping 1000% after Musk&rsquo;s announcement that Twitter will rebrand itself to X.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The X token has no link to X.com and was part of a project started by X, a decentralised NFT marketplace operating across several chains.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p class="s5">Getting into a cryptocurrency before it explodes in value is essential for many market analysts and investors. By doing so, they can achieve the highest ROI. According to the on-chart data, three of the best altcoins that can explode in value during the current market include Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM), and Tradecurve (TCRV).</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Summary
● Litecoin to reach $177.22 by the end of the year
● The Stellar crypto to spike to $0.019
● Tradecurve on a bullish momentum and can spike by 100x
Litecoin (LTC) Future Value After Halving Event
<p class="s5">The Litecoin (LTC) cryptocurrency traded at $86.85 on August 3. 2023. Its halving event was completed on August 2, 2023, and since then, the cryptocurrency has been viewed as a solid opportunity for investors.</p>
<p class="s5">Getting into the project before the explosion in value due to the bigger scarcity can lead to better ROI. For example, in the past week, the Litecoin price saw its low point at $85.84, with its high point at $95.21. In the past year, the LTC crypto increased by 46.1%. </p>
<p class="s5">Litecoin now has a market cap of $6,381,509,379, and in the past 24 hours, its trading volume saw a decrease of 4.84% and is now at $741,291,650. According to a Litecoin price prediction, it can reach $117.22 by the end of the year following its halving event.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Stellar (XLM) Expected to Surge
<p class="s5">There&rsquo;s also the Stellar (XLM) crypto that trades at $0.042 as of August 3, 2023. The cryptocurrency has a market cap of $3,881,163,608 and a 24-hour trading volume of $144,774,383. </p>

In addition, during the past month, the Stellar crypto has been up in value by 34.9%. At this rate of growth, according to the current Stellar price prediction, it can reach a value of $0.19 by the end of the year.</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Still In Early Stages of Its Presale and Can Spike By 100x Rivaling Litecoin and Stellar
<p class="s5">Tradecurve (TCRV) is an innovative hybrid exchange that can completely change how people interact with DeFi by enabling borderless access not only to crypto but to derivatives trading as well.</p>
<p class="s5">On top of the exchange, anyone will be able to begin trading by creating an account, connecting their crypto wallet, and then using the deposited crypto as collateral. This also completely removes any requirement for FIAT currencies or KYC procedures.</p>
<p class="s5">In addition to all of that, there are advanced features like AI-driven trading bots and Copy Trader that work through a subscription model.</p>
<p class="s5">Traders can also enjoy high leverage starting at 500:1, protection against negative balances, a VIP account system, and a dedicated trading academy.</p>
<p class="s5">During the Stage 5 presale, TCRV trades at just $0.025. So far, the cryptocurrency has climbed in value by 150% since its starting price. Analysts are bullish on its future and predict an additional climb of 100x at launch. The team will also implement Proof of Reserves (PoR) and a dedicated Trading App for iOS and Android.</p>

<p>The sewer, a first in the crypto world, is not just a metaphorical nod to the token's name. The $SHIT team is literally investing in infrastructure, planning to build a state-of-the-art sewer system.

The team believes that every great project starts from the ground up, and in this case, even further below.</p>
<p>In addition to the literal sewer, $SHIT is also proud to announce the establishment of SHIT University. Unlike typical crypto education platforms, SHIT University will be a physical institution, complete with lecture halls, dormitories, and a dedicated faculty. The university aims to offer a curriculum that covers everything from the basics of blockchain technology to the philosophy of memecoins. The goal is to create a new generation of crypto enthusiasts who can appreciate the beauty of $SHIT and other memecoins.</p>
<p>These initiatives are set to launch in conjunction with the IDO of $SHIT on Blooprint. The IDO, scheduled to start on 31 July 2023, is a highly anticipated event in the crypto space. With a total supply of 420,690,000,000,001 tokens, $SHIT promises to offer a unique, straightforward, and fun investment opportunity.</p>
<p>The interest in $SHIT from leading venture capital firms such as a16z, Shima Capital, and Coinbase Ventures has already put this memecoin in the spotlight. With the announcement of the literal sewer and SHIT University, $SHIT is set to further disrupt the memecoin market and establish itself as a leader in community engagement and education.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) awaited a new directional bias early in the Asian session as the pair continued to trade technically following several sessions of relatively sideways trading.&nbsp; Buying pressure recently emerged around the 28477 area after a downward move that represented a test of a downside price objective related to selling pressure that strengthened around the 31862.21 and 30421.29 areas.&nbsp; The 29164.09 area continues to be a major level for BTC/USD, representing a previous downside price objective related to selling pressure that intensified around the 30350.70 area.&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28432, 28213, 28137, 27979, 27757, 27430, 27409, 27338, 27312, 27246, 26501, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp; Also, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historic depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Laura Swain, the Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District Of New York, has dismissed a class action lawsuit against USDT issuer Tether and its sister company Bitfinex.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawsuit was brought on by plaintiffs who alleged Tether was falsely advertising the USDT stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>
A Big Win For Tether And Bitfinex&nbsp;
<p>The ruling is being seen as a significant win for the two entities and was announced in a blog post published on Tether&rsquo;s official website. The post stated that the Chief Judge delivered a comprehensive and incisive 6-page decision, including an order to dismiss the class action lawsuit against the two entities, adding that it lacked merit. The post stated,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, Chief Judge Laura Taylor Swain of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District Of New York issued a comprehensive and incisive 6-page decision that included an order dismissing the meritless class action lawsuit filed by Matthew Anderson and Shawn Dolifka against Tether and Bitfinex companies in its entirety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawsuit was brought on by plaintiffs Shawn Dolifka and Matthew Anderson. The plaintiffs claimed that Tether had falsely advertised its USDT stablecoin being backed in a 1:1 ratio by the U.S. dollar. However, the court did not buy their argument. Tether added that the fact that the entirety of the lawsuit was dismissed at such an early stage showed that the allegation against it and Bitfinex were devoid of any merit.&nbsp;</p>
Tether And Bitfinex CTO Reacts&nbsp;
<p>The verdict sparked a wave of reactions from the crypto ecosystem. Paolo Ardoino, Tether, and Bitfinex CTO took to X (formerly Twitter) and expressed his satisfaction with the ruling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tether and Bitfinex Win Comprehensive Legal Victory as U.S. District Court Dismisses Class Action Lawsuit The Court correctly held that the plaintiffs&rsquo; complaint lacked any &ldquo;plausible allegations of injury&rdquo; because it includes no facts showing that &ldquo;USDT had a diminished actual value at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prominent Bitcoin lawyer Stuart Hoegner applauded the Tether team&rsquo;s efforts and broke down the court ruling in a long thread on X.&nbsp;</p>
The Court Ruling&nbsp;
<p>The court gave several reasons for throwing out the lawsuit. It stated that the plaintiffs had not provided sufficient facts in the case nor mentioned the buying or selling price of USDT for the plaintiffs. The court further added that market data showed that USDT still maintains its peg with the USD at $1, and even if there were misrepresentations from the defendant&rsquo;s side, there was no evidence that showed USDT had lost its value.&nbsp;</p>
The Complaint In Question&nbsp;
<p>The case stems from a complaint filed in 2021 when the plaintiffs, Shawn Dolifika and Matthew Anderson, claimed that Tether&rsquo;s statement that its USDT was backed by the U.S. dollar in a 1:1 peg was false. According to the complaint, Tether and Bitfinex did not maintain adequate reserves for the USDT in circulation. Furthermore, the complaint also alleged that the reserves did not contain USD as advertised but were a mix of assets such as overcollateralized loans and undisclosed commercial paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Defendants did not maintain the same amount of reserves as Tether tokens in circulation. At times, Defendants had no reserves whatsoever. Further, these reserves did not contain U.S. dollars, as Tether suggested, but were a mix of other assets, such as overcollateralized loans and other undisclosed commercial paper.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>London, United Kingdom, August 5th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Decentralized hedge fund VC Spectra has reported strong demand for its Stage 2 presale. The token sale has drawn considerable interest from early investors and underlined VC Spectra's potential to redefine the crypto industry.</p><p>Priding itself on democratizing access to investment opportunities, VC Spectra has carved a distinct niche for itself. The on-chain hedge fund extends the availability of early-stage investments to non-accredited investors, thereby bridging a significant market gap.</p><p>Investors opting for the SPCT token can leverage an array of unique benefits. These perks include quarterly dividends and buybacks, voting rights, and early access to initial coin offerings (ICOs).&nbsp;</p><p>The SPCT token, developed on the Bitcoin blockchain using the BRC-20 standard, provides a robust mechanism for decentralized trading, asset management, and transaction facilitation within the Spectra platform. The Spectra Token (SPCT) is the main currency within the Spectra ecosystem, enabling access to different services on the platform.</p><p>By implementing a deflationary model featuring a burn mechanism for the SPCT token, the decentralized hedge fund aims to decrease token circulation gradually. When coupled with VC Spectra's unique investment offerings, this novel approach further solidifies SPCT 's standing in the crypto market.&nbsp;</p><p>The Vc Spectra public presale is currently in Stage 2 and has already seen robust demand.

                        <![CDATA[<p>Miami Mayor Francis Suarez announced that he is officially accepting Bitcoin for his presidential campaign donations.</p>
Crypto-Friendly Mayer from Miami&nbsp;
<p>On Friday, August 4, Miami Mayer and Republican candidate for the 2024 Presidential Election, Francis Suarez, confirmed that his campaign would be accepting donations in Bitcoin. He clarified that his supporters can donate as little as 0.00034 BTC, equivalent to $1, at his website.</p>

<p>"Officially, my campaign is accepting Bitcoin," Suarez announced. "This is a process of developing technologies that are going to create democratizing opportunities for wealth creation and are not manipulated by a human being's ulterior motives, political goals, etc."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suarez heavily criticized the Biden administration for its approach towards cryptocurrencies which involves regulation through enforcement, without understanding the mechanisms of digital assets or setting clear rules.</p>

<p>"The biggest mistake that this administration has made is they don't understand crypto so they have gone to a regulated-by-enforcement mechanism as opposed to set the ground rules," Suarez explained. "You have to be able to classify certain digital products, you have to be able to have certain guidelines and rules that are clear with respect to the custody of assets."</p>

<p>The candidate also declared that, if elected the President, he would ban the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC):</p>

<p>"Nobody wants the federal government knowing where you have your money and how much money you have ... I don't think that there's anything particularly innovative about that."</p>

<p>Francis Suarez announced his candidacy for the upcoming presidential race in June 2023. He argued that the country needs a president who understands how cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Miami Mayer has long been a supporter of Bitcoin and digital assets in general. He already launched his own cryptocurrency MiamiCoin (MIA) in 2021, and promised to make Miami a Bitcoin hub.</p>
Presidential Candidates Against CBDC
<p>Francis Suarez is not the only presidential hopeful who spoke out against CBDCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The governor of Florida and presidential candidate for the Republican party, Ron DeSantis, criticized the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s new payments system, FedNow, and said that the Biden administration&rsquo;s efforts towards launching a CBDC are &ldquo;about surveillance and control&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Ron DeSantis and another presidential hopeful of the Democratic party, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., implied they would not support the launch and use of a CBDC in the country. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recently confirmed the purchase of BTC for his children, even though he had earlier denied investment in the digital currency.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders and Democratic Senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bob Casey, and Richard Blumenthal, are urging the Biden administration to initiate a crackdown on &ldquo;crypto tax evaders&rdquo;.</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Coinbase filed a motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuit in its entirety, seeking clarity in crypto regulation.</p>
Coinbase Makes a Major Move in SEC Lawsuit
<p>On Friday, July 4, Coinbase filed a new motion seeking to dismiss the lawsuit started by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) entirely, after hinting at the major move in yesterday&rsquo;s Shareholder letter on the platform&rsquo;s Q2 earnings.</p>
<p>In the filing, Coinbase claims that the regular is exceeding its authority by suing the cryptocurrency exchange because the platform does not offer &ldquo;investment contracts&rdquo;.</p>

<p>"The transactions over Coinbase&rsquo;s platform and Prime are not, and do not involve, contractual undertakings to deliver future value reflecting the income, profits, or assets of a business. They are commodity sales, with the obligations on both sides discharged entirely the moment the digital token is delivered in exchange for payment," the filing stated.</p>

<p>The crypto exchange also referred to the recent ruling partially in favor of Ripple in a similar case against the SEC, saying that the core facts were "substantially identical to those alleged here." However, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the court will consider this argument, because another crypto company Terraform Labs also recently tried to cite the Ripple&rsquo;s case but was rejected by Judge Rakoff.</p>
Ongoing Legal Battle Against SEC
<p>As it was recently revealed, before suing the exchange, the SEC first asked Coinbase to halt all crypto trading except that of Bitcoin, arguing that all other digital assets are viewed as securities. Coinbase decided to decline the SEC&rsquo;s request. The company&rsquo;s CEO Brian Armostrong explained why:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We really didn&rsquo;t [did not] have a choice at that point; delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way, is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US. It kind of made it an easy choice&hellip; let&rsquo;s [let us] go to court and find out what the court says.&rdquo; </p>

<p>In June, the regulator filed suit against Coinbase alleging the platform failed to register as a broker, clearing agency, or national securities exchange and traded at least 13 cryptocurrencies that could be considered securities.&nbsp;</p>
Seeking Regulatory Clarity
<p>Coinbase has repeatedly asked for more clarity regarding crypto regulation from the SEC but still hasn&rsquo;t responded. The regulator requested four more months to provide a response to the platform&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p>In its latest Shareholder letter, Coinbase highlighted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;despite our good faith efforts and transparency of our business to the SEC for years now, we were deeply disappointed that the SEC brought an unwarranted enforcement against us in June, and that ten states initiated proceedings about our staking services. We are confident in the work we have done to abide by all federal and state securities laws, and as we vigorously defend that work, we plan to use these proceedings as an opportunity to bring more clarity to our industry as a whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal expressed optimism regarding the case:</p>

<p>&ldquo;With respect to the litigation with the SEC, I want to be very clear. We do think we can win. We expect to win.&rdquo;</p>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Today, the DeFi space witnessed a groundbreaking moment as Maya Protocol announced its integration with the Dash blockchain. This milestone marks the first-ever opportunity for Dash users to engage in decentralized and permissionless trading, unlocking a new era of possibilities.</p>
<p>Maya Protocol, a decentralized liquidity platform, empowers users to exchange cryptocurrency assets across multiple networks while retaining complete control of their tokens in a permissionless manner.</p>
<p>Dash, renowned for its focus on speed, privacy, and self-governance, is among the oldest cryptocurrencies still in circulation. Its continuous technological advancements and growing adoption as a digital payment method make it a highly usable cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>By integrating Dash into Maya, a seamless connection is established, enabling frictionless exchange between Dash and other crypto assets without relying on centralized intermediaries. The synergy between Dash's attributes and Maya's mission of facilitating fluid cross-chain liquidity amplifies the benefits of both protocols.</p>
<p>Maya's ability to handle Dash transactions sets it apart from others, demonstrating its expertise in the decentralized ecosystem, particularly in terms of interoperability and composability. Dash represents the first unique integration for Maya, compared to Thorchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of this collaboration, Maya gains exposure to Dash's extensive user base, loyal community, and real-world use cases as digital cash.</p>
<p>Retail users stand to benefit from increased trading opportunities (Maya supports BTC, ETH, RUNE, USDT, and USDC) and yield generation with their Dash tokens by becoming liquidity providers.</p>
<p>Beyond individual growth, this integration reflects the evolution and progress of the decentralized finance ecosystem. It showcases the potential of DeFi in driving innovation and disrupting traditional financial models.</p>
<p>Maya and Dash exemplify their commitment to pioneering decentralized systems and reshaping the financial landscape. To delve deeper into this game-changing integration, visit the official web resources of both protocols.</p>

<p class="s6">This has caused a slump in the revenue of Bitcoin (BTC) miners. As per the data from IntoTheBlock, transaction fees on the Bitcoin (BTC) network have plummeted by 38% since March. However, Bitcoin miners are holding onto their tokens as they hope for a further increase in the price of BTC.</p>
<p class="s6">Meanwhile, the market value of Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a surge of 14% in the past 30 days. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) currently changes hands at $30,195.15.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Whales Sell Their Tokens
<p class="s6">The latest on-chain data has revealed that Ethereum (ETH) whales have aggressively sold off their tokens. For instance, an Ethereum whale recently sold 4,549 ETH tokens worth about $8.78 million.</p>
<p class="s6">The whale bought Ethereum (ETH) tokens on January 9 at a price of $1,319. According to market experts, the sell-off pattern indicates that Ethereum (ETH) whales want to cash out the benefits before any unforeseen market downfall in future. Interestingly, after the court&rsquo;s verdict in the SEC-XRP case, Ethereum (ETH) surged to approximately $2030. But since then, Ethereum&rsquo;s (ETH) value has suffered a drop of more than 5%.</p>
<p class="s6">At the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $1,910.38.</p>
Tradecurve's Momentum Aligns with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH): A Triumvirate Fueling Market Revival
<p class="s6">In a remarkable synergy with the established giants Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Tradecurve is infusing a fresh dynamism into the market, showcasing its potential to stand alongside the titans.</p>
<p class="s6">Crypto aficionados have long been looking for an exchange that could help them trade several assets with one account. To meet this growing demand, Tradecurve has entered the crypto arena. It is a comprehensive decentralized exchange that allows the trading of several assets on a single user interface. The asset classes available here include cryptocurrencies, stocks, Forex, bonds, and more.</p>
<p class="s6">Since the demand for decentralized exchange has surged to a new high, this new platform can soon become a market leader. CoinGecko&rsquo;s data showed that the growth rate of decentralized exchanges in Q1 2023 was more than 33%.</p>
<p class="s6">The platform enables people to trade a wide range of assets without relying on fiat payments. The platform ensures that the identities of its users are never revealed as traders need not go through any KYC verification process. This feature makes it more privacy-focused than existing exchanges, such as Bakkt and Revolut, where traders must submit their private details.</p>

Besides, it is equipped with a mechanism that ensures negative balance protection. The presale of the platform&rsquo;s native token, TCRV, is currently running at a price tag of $0.025.</p>
