Even if the cryptocurrency industry crashed in 2022, Bitcoin&#8217;s status as the &#8220;alpha coin&#8221; has remained remarkably stable. With a market capitalization of over $398 billion and a trading volume of $24,180,295, Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance in the last 24 hours has increased by 43%. According to market watchers, the BTC bull market officially began in 2023 and is expected to increase in value. In addition, the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) was issued earlier this week, showing that the U.S. dollar&#8217;s value is decreasing relative to other currencies. On the other hand, the CPI data gave the market the confidence it needed to follow inflation&#8217;s downward trend.

On Friday evening, the price of BTC surged beyond $18,000, then $19,000, and finally pumped to $20,000. The next hours saw a rise initiated by the bulls, which ultimately pushed BTC up to near $21,000 on Sunday.

Even if it has dropped from its local peak, the price is still well above $20,000. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s market valuation is close to $400 billion, with many investors hoping for a new bull run to begin any day. Fundstrat&#8217;s head of digital asset strategy Sean Farrell stated to Bloomberg: Cryptoassets performed well following the soft CPI print, suggesting that crypto’s correlation to macro is not going away anytime soon As Bitcoin Surges, Altcoins Retreat On yesterday&#8217;s daily charts, most altcoins showed gains, but those figures are now negative. After increasing by more than 35% in a day and nearly 70% in a week, it has turned bullish and is now moving in that direction. However, it is currently sitting below that level due to the daily decline of 4.5%. The top 10 daily cryptocurrencies that lost value are Dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot (DOT), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC). The value of alternative cryptocurrencies like ADA and DOGE have dropped, by 0.34% and 0.08%, respectively, from their respective 24-hour highs. The value of ADA and BNB has decreased marginally over the previous day. Both coins, however, have seen substantial gains during the past week, rising by more than 21% and 11%, respectively.
