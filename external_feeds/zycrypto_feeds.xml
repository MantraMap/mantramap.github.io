<p>Cryptocurrency borrowing and lending platform Nexo has <a href="https://nexo.io/blog/nexo-announces-gradual-departure-from-the-united-states">announced</a> that it is withdrawing its products from the United States over the ‘‘coming months’’ over regulatory challenges. The announcement was made through the company&#8217;s website on December 5.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Our decision comes after more than 18 months of good-faith dialogue with US state and federal regulators, which has come to a dead end,&#8221; the statement read. &#8220;Despite inconsistent and changing positions among state and federal regulators, Nexo has engaged in a significant ongoing effort to proactively provide requested information and modify its business in response to their concerns,&#8221;</em> it added.</p>



<p>The company said it had been forced to exit certain states in the US to comply with the regulators. &#8220;During 2021 and 2022, we have off-boarded clients from New York and Vermont and suspended new registrations for all US clients for our Earn Interest Product,&#8221; it noted.</p>



<p>According to the company, the Earn Interest Product will no longer be available for existing clients in Indiana, Maryland, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, California, Washington, and South Carolina from December 6, 2022. However, Nexo assured users that it was proceeding with processing withdrawals instantly.</p>



<h2 id="h-concerns-arise-over-the-sustainability-of-nexo-s-high-yield-bearing-accounts"><strong>Concerns arise over the sustainability of Nexo&#8217;s high-yield-bearing accounts</strong></h2>



<p>Nexo came under fire in November when users questioned how the company offered up to 10% in its high-yield bearing product amid a bearish market following the collapse of FTX. Market analyst Dylan LeClair commented on Twitter: &#8220;Ask yourself how Nexo is paying 10% on stablecoins while DeFi yields are 1% and short duration US Treasuries are 4.5%.&#8221;</p>



<p>The firm&#8217;s co-founders, Antoni Trenchev and Kalin Metodiev, defended their company, saying that the platform is solvent. Metodiev said, &#8220;insolvency, bankruptcy, is nowhere in Nexo&#8217;s reality, and we believe, we hope, we aspire,&#8221; while working hard to deliver a strong and sustainable future to the users.&#8221;</p>



<p>The comments were in response to a cease and desist order against the digital asset lender from the California Department of Financial Protection on September 26. The regulator accused the 4-year-old firm of &#8220;offering and selling securities without prior qualification, in violation of California Corporations Code section 25110.&#8221;</p>



<p>The announcement comes amid market volatility that has forced Nexo&#8217;s rivals, including BlockFi, Voyager Digital, Celsius, and Three Arrows Capital, out of business. The collapse of the crypto derivatives exchanges FTX also pushed regulators to enforce more compliance in the space.</p>

<p>Silvergate bank has defended itself against allegations that it could be facing a liquidity crunch due to its close relationship with cash-beleaguered crypto exchange FTX and lending firm BlockFi.</p>



<p>Following the collapse of the two crypto firms, rumours that Silvergate could be facing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-comes-clean-and-admits-that-it-owes-over-3-billion-to-its-50-biggest-creditors/">potential bank run</a> after some experts exposed some glaring transactions with FTX have been pouring out.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-really-happened"><strong>What Really Happened?</strong></h2>



<p>On November 30, CFA-issued accountant Genevieve Roch-Decter brought to the crypto community’s attention a report by Silvergate that as of September 30, 2022, its <em>“total deposits from all digital asset customers totalled $11.9 billion, of which FTX represented less than 10%.”</em></p>



<p>Although Silvergate had put out a statement saying that exposure to FTX was “minimal” and that it only had deposits with FTX and no loans, Genevieve noted that “less than 10%” of $11.9 billion was “still a LOT of money.” She also called out the bank for downplaying its relationship with BlockFi to which it had said it owed less than $20 million.</p>



<p>The accountant then raised concerns over the bank&#8217;s Bitcoin-collateralized loans. As ZyCrypto reported, Silvergate gave the famous $205 million Bitcoin-backed loan to Michael Saylor. “If Bitcoin’s price continues to slide, will the borrowers be able to make their payments?” she had asked, pointing to the $1.392 billion in outstanding loans reported by the bank at the end of Q3.</p>



<p>The pundit, whose worries reflect those of many other experts, also noted that in just three weeks since the FTX meltdown, Silvergate’s stock had fallen by over 50% raising further concerns about the bank’s future.</p>



<h2><strong>Silvergate Responds</strong></h2>



<p>With pressures mounting, Silvergate Capital Corporation, the bank&#8217;s parent company’s CEO Alan Lane came out on Tuesday to “set the record straight” about the bank’s financial health.</p>



<p>“<em>There has also been plenty of speculation – and misinformation – being spread by short sellers and other opportunists trying to capitalize on market uncertainty,”</em> Lane said in a letter to shareholders on Tuesday.</p>



<p>The CEO noted that they had conducted extensive due diligence on FTX and Alameda Research before and after conducting business with the firms. He also assured customers of their funds’ safety saying that “<em>while this has been a turbulent time in the digital asset industry, our customers’ deposits are, and have always been, safely held.”</em></p>



<p>That said, Silvergate’s response seems not to have convinced many who have already seen FTX’s “domino effect” take down other companies. Later on Tuesday, three US Senators, Elizabeth Warren, Roger Marshall and John Kennedy, ordered the bank to release all records relating to FTX transfers.</p>



<p><em>“Your bank’s involvement in the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda reveals what appears to be an egregious failure of your bank’s responsibility to monitor for and report suspicious financial activity carried out by its clients,”</em> the senators said in a letter. <em>“The public is owed a full accounting of the financial activities that may have led to the loss of billions in customer assets, and any role that Silvergate may have played in these losses.”</em></p>

<p>Attorney John Deaton, the founder of Crypto Law and staunch Ripple supporter, has pointed out what he opined to be the biggest threat to Ripple securing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-notches-another-legal-victory-as-judge-quashes-secs-latest-bid-to-strike-fair-notice-defense/">complete victory</a> over the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even as the case draws to an end.</p>



<p>According to Deaton, this threat is the possibility that Judge Analisa Torres, the presiding judge in the case, could &#8220;split the proverbial baby&#8221; by ruling partially in favour of Ripple and the SEC.</p>



<p>Judge Torres could rule that Ripple &#8220;offered&#8221; an unregistered security at some point but that the XRP token itself is not a security, nor are secondary market sales of the token an unregistered security offering, he noted.</p>



<p>The danger exists because securities laws do not need sales or transfer of an underlying asset to occur for a company to be liable for offering unregistered securities. Deaton added that he expects the SEC&#8217;s oral argument, if one should be conducted, to focus mainly on &#8216;offering.&#8217;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;[This] is the biggest danger to Ripple IMO. Application of the law doesn’t focus only on sales. In fact, a sale or transfer of the underlying asset doesn’t have to occur for a company to be liable. If there’s oral argument, I bet you hear the SEC lawyer focus a lot on the &#8216;offering.'&#8221; </em></p>



<h2 id="h-a-win-for-ripple-is-still-likely-and-is-vital-for-crypto-according-to-deaton"><strong>A win for Ripple is still likely and is vital for crypto, according to Deaton</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, Deaton also argues that an outright win for Ripple, in which the judge criticizes the SEC for pursuing the implausible theory that XRP is a security, is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/optimism-for-groundbreaking-ripple-win-against-sec-fuels-xrp-price-surge-as-whales-load-up-heavily/">still highly possible</a>. This ruling is also the most desired outcome for the crypto industry.</p>



<p>This is because any decision in the case will have a &#8220;huge impact practically and politically speaking.&#8221; A ruling favourable to Ripple would effectively halt the SEC chair Gary Gensler&#8217;s regulation by enforcement campaign against the industry. </p>



<p>A ruling in favour of the SEC&#8217;s argument would arm the regulator to go all out against other crypto firms and projects in the U.S.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the case has entered the final stages following the filing of final motions for summary judgment by both the SEC and Ripple. Both parties and the broader community are awaiting a decision from the judge. It is anticipated that the wait could last a few months. Market participants also expect the price of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-at-3-8-huge-price-milestone-highly-envisioned-if-ripple-wins-sec-case-but-theres-a-catch/">XRP to soar</a> when the case provides clarity for it.</p>

<p>Attempting to set the record straight, CZ, as he’s fondly called, has taken to Twitter to bare it all out.</p>



<p>Tweeting to his 7.9 million followers, CZ said;</p>



<p><em>“SBF perpetuated a narrative painting me and other people as the “bad guys”. It was critical in maintaining the fantasy that he was a “hero.” SBF is one of the greatest fraudsters in history, he is also a master manipulator when it comes to the media and key opinion leaders.”</em></p>



<p>Responding to the many speculations from onlookers, he notes how he’s recently been tagged the saviour of cryptocurrency. To this, he maintains that cryptocurrency needs no saving. He insists that no one crypto proponent is the centre of crypto but only a part of the “beauty of decentralization.” CZ is on a journey to support struggling projects, he adds.</p>



<p>Post-FTX’s crash, many have implied that CZ played a role in the firm’s collapse. CZ insists that the firm‘s fall results from billions of dollars stolen from users&#8217; funds.</p>



<p>The CEO also rejected claims that he tanked FTX’s price after his bearish tweet’s preceded the firm’s crash. Alameda’s CEO, Caroline Ellison, is instead credited for this, as he cited an <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1600083620013768704?s=46&amp;t=bSfOrRcOJn-qcj9YSC-UzA">article</a> from Bloomberg that explains how the FTT crash was primarily influenced by Ellison’s <a href="https://twitter.com/carolinecapital/status/1589287457975304193?s=46&amp;t=bSfOrRcOJn-qcj9YSC-UzA">tweet</a>. “She gave her floor price away,” he stated.</p>



<p>It is clear where CZ stands when it comes to SBF. The billionaire reveals his reputation, along with others linked to the saga, was dragged in the mud.</p>



<p><em>“SBF perpetuated a narrative painting me and other people as the “bad guys”. It was critical in maintaining the fantasy that he was a “hero.” SBF is one of the greatest fraudsters in history, he is also a master manipulator when it comes to media and key opinion leaders.” he explained</em>.</p>



<p>In a conclusive tweet, he had this to say about the comparison between Binance and other leading exchanges in the industry. </p>



<p>He’s quoted saying; </p>



<p>“<em>We don&#8217;t focus on competitors because it&#8217;s a waste of time and resources when the industry has only touched 6% of the population. We want multiple exchanges, multiple blockchains, multiple wallets, etc, to co-exist in the ecosystem.”</em></p>

<p>Bitcoin risks plummeting <a href="https://zycrypto.com/peter-schiff-predicts-bitcoin-crashing-to-10k-warns-hodlers-to-dump-before-its-too-late/">by another 70%</a> to $5,000 come next year, according to Eric Robertson, the Global Head of Research at Standard Chartered Bank.</p>



<p>In a Sunday statement, the pundit, also the bank&#8217;s chief strategist, warned of bitcoin pulling the “surprise move” come 2023, catching investors who believe the crypto market has bottomed unaware. The plunge could be caused by stringent interest rate hikes and more crypto “bankruptcies and a collapse in investor confidence in digital assets,” Robertsen added.</p>



<p>He further noted that a drop in Bitcoin’s price was likely to spur investor interest in physical gold, driving the precious metal’s price up by roughly 30% to $2,250 an ounce or more.</p>



<p>Robertson’s comments come even as Bitcoin continues to retrench on the back of a crypto winter spin-out caused by the collapse of FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research last month. Although the banker stressed that he wasn’t making predictions but intimating scenarios materially outside of current market consensus, he expressed concerns over tremors spreading from the FTX debacle toppling more crypto companies and crypto prices in 2023.</p>



<p>Despite Bitcoin plunging below $15,500 on the news of FTX’s liquidity crunch and its continued weakness as more crypto firms capitulate, concerns about the future of major crypto lending firms have continued to threaten the cryptocurrency’s price growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, reports have emerged that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/2-8b-crypto-focused-lending-firm-genesis-halts-withdrawals-fearing-a-ftx-induced-bank-run/">crypto broker Genesis</a> and its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), owe Gemini customers $900 million. On Saturday, the Financial Times reported that the Winklevoss twins&#8217; helmed crypto exchange was trying to recover the funds “after Genesis was wrongfooted by last month’s failure of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto group.”  Moreover, apart from halting crypto withdrawals and loan applications last month, reports have emerged that Genesis may have issued bulk unsecured loans raising fears that it could be next in line to bite the dust.</p>



<p>Furthermore, according to Robertson, the continued retrenchments in the crypto sector could also point towards tough days ahead. Recently, leading firms, including crypto exchanges Kraken, Coinbase and Bybit, have announced plans to conduct <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bybit-joins-leading-crypto-companies-to-offload-30-of-staff-ceo-makes-alarming-revelations/">significant lay-offs</a> due to poor market conditions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-76161" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, despite the negative outlook, Bitcoin has remained relatively steady, with prices oscillating between $17,250 and $16,900 in the past five days. As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $16,988 after a 1.74% drop in the past day. Notably, BTC has managed to lift off by 4.37% in the past week, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market is still nursing an ongoing decline, but market movement indicates that some altcoins are making up a list of bullish anomalies.</p>



<h2 id="h-chainlink-and-dogecoin-are-bullish-for-these-reasons"><strong>Chainlink and Dogecoin are bullish for these reasons</strong></h2>



<p>Chainlink (LINK) appears to be favoured by market players, particularly whales. Despite the collective price decline amongst leading altcoins, Chainlink whale addresses are surging on a weekly basis. A market report from Santiment revealed that LINK whales holding over 1,000 LINK coins have skyrocketed.</p>



<p>“Chainlink&#8217;s shark and whale address, holding between 1K to 1M LINK, have gone on an unprecedented surge of accumulation. These wallets have added a collective 26.8M LINK ($194.3M) in just 2 months, a 12.8% increase of coins to their bags.” &#8211; Santiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LINK&#8217;s price performance has also mainly been bullish, with the asset closing off in November with a spike in price value. On the 29th of November, Chainlink saw a 36% intraday surge, sending the price to $7.35. Although LINK is down 0.38%, the asset was amongst the few that retained its position and price point from November.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-76126" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">LINKUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LINKUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new year holds a handful of opportunities for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/chainlink-whales-hijack-market-boost-link-price-and-transactions-to-massive-highs/">Chainlink</a> as the web3 industry grows in popularity. The demand for decentralized financial applications is sure to influence the Oracle network, which allows for the development of Web3 applications.</p>



<p>Similarly, Dogecoin has also been an industry favourite for the most part of the year. The consistent support from Elon Musk, who recently restated his stance on DOGE. As always, the billionaire has remained bullish and maintained in a Twitter space yesterday that Dogecoin is still primed to go to the moon.</p>



<p>Musk made the statement after market players questioned the possibility of Twitter implementing cryptocurrency payments to its platform. If Dogecoin makes its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/doge-rallies-30-on-twitter-payments-anticipation-as-elon-musk-props-up-dogecoin/">way into Twitter</a>, market players are certain that the asset will surge in adoption, leading to a massive price revival. The possibility of Dogecoin hitting the $1 price mark is sure to heighten.</p>

<p>As the broader fintech market continues to cut down on its staff, cryptocurrency firms have followed suit. In an announcement yesterday, the CEO of the leading cryptocurrency exchange Bybit revealed that it would slash its staff number by nearly half the existing amount.</p>



<h2 id="h-bybit-attempts-to-push-through-market-volatility-with-an-alarming-staff-layoff"><strong>Bybit attempts to push through market volatility with an alarming staff layoff&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Ben Zhou, the CEO and Co-founder of the firm, took to Twitter to reveal where the company is headed in the long term. In a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/benbybit/status/1599275418502459392?s=46&amp;t=NaZyYLokGYvBMQWj1JkKnQ">tweets</a>. Zhou made it known that 30% of its staff would have to exit the company.</p>



<p>He made it known that the bear market requires Bybit to remain alert, as it appears to be still ongoing. He’s quoted saying ;</p>



<p>“<em>Difficult decision made today, but tough times demand tough decisions. I have just announced plans to reduce our workforce as part of an ongoing re-organisation of the business as we move to refocus our efforts for the deepening bear market.”</em></p>



<p>Like many other fintech firms, Zhou iterated that the move was deliberate. Recall that many fintech firms, including Twitter, cut down on staff numbers in November. Within the cryptocurrency industry, a similar move was made by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, as it laid off over 60 employees. Stripe, Microsoft and meta also took the same path, letting go of over 13,000 staff. </p>



<p>The move might largely benefit Bybit to remain in the market as many other exchanges battle the bearish tides. Although market players are mostly bearish, key players maintain that a recovery is in sight.</p>



<p>Conclusively, Zhou explains the company&#8217;s near-term goals, saying; </p>



<p>“<em>it&#8217;s important to ensure Bybit has the right structure and resources in place to navigate the market slowdown and is nimble enough to seize the many opportunities ahead.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>That way, we can continue to deliver the crypto ark to the world with even more drive and passion.” </em></p>



<p>The massive tech layoffs have been linked to the perceived recession. The United States is trying to prepare for a turbulent economic crisis. Although the fintech industry has been experiencing stability more than other traditional firms, the impact of inflation has shown itself inescapably.</p>



<p>In the meantime, market players remain optimistic about a recovery from cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has cast doubt on the figures being peddled by mainstream media regarding donations made to US democrats by Sam Bankman fried.</p>



<p>On December 3, the billionaire suggested that Fried’s donations towards the democratic party elections could have exceeded $1B. Musk was responding to Will Manidis, CEO of healthcare AI platform “ScienceIO” who had earlier written, <em>“SBF donating $40m to not go to jail for stealing $10b+ is one of the highest ROI trades of all time.”</em></p>



<p><em>“That’s just the publicly disclosed number. His actual support of Dem elections is probably over $1B,”</em> Musk replied adding<em>, “The money went somewhere, so where did it go?”</em></p>



<p>Musk’s comments come after the ex-FTX CEO admitted earlier this week to making “backdoor donations” to the democratic party in an interview with crypto journalist Tiffany Fong. Fried also stated that he had preferred to keep figures on the donations private to avoid backlash- a comment that seemed to confirm Musk’s doubts.</p>



<p>According to OpenSecrets, Fried reportedly gave more than $990,000 to candidates in both parties, plus an additional $38.8 million to outside groups in the recent election cycle, becoming the sixth largest individual donor of the 2022 mid-terms.</p>



<p>That said, as the crypto community continue to grapple with the collapse of FTX and its sister firm Alameda research, many have raised concerns over how various media outlets and politicians have been fawning over Bankman Fried.</p>



<p>Recently, the United States House Financial Services Committee chair Maxine Waters, a Democrat came under fire for applying a seemingly lenient language in summoning SBF to appear in an investigative hearing&nbsp;scheduled for Dec. 13. In a tweet on Friday, Waters said that they appreciated that Fried had been candid in his discussions about what happened at FTX.</p>



<p>“To that end, we would welcome your participation in our hearing on the 13<sup>th</sup>,” she added, sparking an uproar.</p>



<p>Major news outlets have also been scolded for attempting to water down the hoaxes that SBF and his associates committed via trading firms Alameda Research and FTX.</p>



<p>Earlier today, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong hit back at Fried for comments in a recent interview that he “mis-accounted” $8 billion after FTX user funds were wired to Alameda and FTX’s accounting system <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-complete-failure-of-corporate-control-says-new-ftx-ceo-as-he-unearths-even-more-dirt-leading-to-the-collapse/">counted the money twice</a> by crediting it to both companies. According to the crypto executive, people should not fall for Fried’s claims that an accounting error occasioned the said loss.</p>



<p><em>“I don&#8217;t care how messy your accounting is (or how rich you are) &#8211; you&#8217;re definitely going to notice if you find an extra $8B to spend. It&#8217;s stolen customer money used in his hedge fund, plain and simple,”</em> he said.</p>

<p>A recent attempt by the&nbsp;European Commission’s foreign aid department to get young people excited about the EU with a virtual party in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/metaverse-market-size-to-grow-by-107-06-billion-by-2027-asia-pacific-region-to-lead-report/">metaverse</a> backfired after only five attendees showed up.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Vince Chadwick, a reporter at Devex, tweeted that he was eventually the only person left after the other guests left mid-event, apparently after getting bored.</p>



<p>“<em>I’m here at the “gala” concert in the EU foreign aid dept’s €387k metaverse (designed to attract non-politically engaged 18–35-year-olds). After initial bemused chats with the roughly five other humans who showed up, I am alone,”</em> wrote Chadwick.</p>



<p>The virtual party on the sidelines of a climate change conference in Brussels was depicted in strange-looking avatars dancing to house music on a tropical island. A welcome message was also tucked on the right side of the screen saying, “<em>This is the perfect place to meet new people and enjoy some music. Step into the crowd and take a selfie. Also, did you know you can fly here? It might be useful to see that art installation from up close.” </em></p>



<p>Based on a <a href="https://twitter.com/vchadw/status/1597695719787200514/video/1">live chat</a> seen by ZyCrypto, a few participating online also seemed uninterested, with one complaining about the same DJ spinning the same music for too long. “Is anybody out there?” another asked, prompting a reply from one of the attendees, “<em>I’m still here wondering if I got the date wrong.”</em></p>



<p>The flop comes after the&nbsp;European Commission’s foreign aid department spent €387,000 to develop a metaverse platform aimed at helping promote its “Global Gateway” investment plan earlier last month. A source familiar with the matter reportedly said that the purpose of the metaverse was to “intrigue that audience, primarily on TikTok and Instagram, and to encourage them to engage with the broader substance of the campaign, which will increase awareness of what the EU does on the world stage among an audience that is not typically exposed to such information.”</p>



<p>That said, with the commission projecting to fork out €300 billion from aid grants by 2027 to help build new infrastructure around the world, the idea of a metaverse seemed to have been a bad idea for many who now hope the commission will change its communications strategy.</p>

<p>After causing great excitement upon its launch last year, El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment has come under fire, particularly with the Chivo wallet, which is said to have led to the loss of about $24 million in taxpayers’ money.</p>



<p>Months after making Bitcoin legal tender, El Salvador launched <a href="https://zycrypto.com/el-salvadors-wild-bitcoin-experiment-is-crumbling-bombshell-study-reveals/">the Chivo wallet</a> to serve as the de-facto hub for BTC payments. While the wallet’s launch was anything but smooth, its developer-Athena Bitcoin Global, would later hire ROI Developers, a Texas-based company, to help fix some bug-related issues in the wallet. Not long after taking the role, ROI sued Athena Bitcoin Global for failing to pay an invoice of over $80,000.</p>



<p>According to a recent report by Guatemala-based investigative journalism outlet No Ficción, the lawsuit would later light up some shocking details of massive fraud effected through Chivo. Per the report, although president Bukele had anticipated over 50,000 Chivo signups on launch day, the implemented know your customer (KYC) service crashed after only 150 signups.</p>



<p>However, despite the failure, the government opted to disable the KYC process for political reasons, enabling nefarious actors to create fictitious profiles with user photos of “a wall” or “potted plants” and receive the $30 BTC starter gift from the government. KYC is a process that enables financial institutions to verify the identity of users interacting with their systems in compliance with legal requirements. </p>



<p>Shaun Overton, the founder of ROI Developers, told the court that at least 400,000 accounts created in the first weeks of Chivo Wallet were fraudulent- meaning that US$12 million was stolen from State coffers.</p>



<p>According to him, “there was literally no supervision”,<em> </em>as anyone on the platform could sign up and get $30 and then “withdraw that money immediately” as long as they had a person’s name and their Documento Unico de Identidad (DUI) number. Overton’s statements <a href="https://zycrypto.com/el-salvadors-citizens-say-their-bitcoins-are-mysteriously-vanishing-from-their-chivo-wallet-government-keeps-silent/">echoed earlier complaints</a> by multiple users who claimed that their identity had been stolen to open accounts in Chivo Wallet. When they entered their DUI to register, they discovered that it already existed on accounts.</p>



<p>Overton added that top government officials thwarted attempts to resolve the problem, who warned against repairing the KYC service. By the time he left, the number of Chivo users had exceeded 4 million. He estimated that 10-20% of all registered users were fraudulent, placing the money lost through the wallet in the  US$12 million-US$24 million range. “<em>The Government of El Salvador is no longer able to recover those funds.”</em> He added.</p>



<p>Despite numerous complaints about Chivo and the overall Bitcoin experiment by Salvadorians, president Bukele has remained unyielding, often hitting out at western media for spreading “fake news”. Recently, the controversial leader announced that the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/el-salvador-shows-renewed-faith-in-bitcoin-with-its-1-btc-daily-purchase-plan/">country would buy</a> a single bitcoin daily. Later, a November 25 linked post by El Salvador-based law firm Torres Legal disclosed that the government of El Salvador had created a National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) aimed at managing all projects related to the cryptocurrency.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ankr was the victim of a hack that cost the project losses of over $5 million.</li>



<li>The team briskly patched the exploit within hours.</li>



<li>Ankr says it will compensate all users for their losses and discontinue the affected token to prevent future occurrences.</li>
</ul>



<p>A security breach nearly sent Ankr underwater, but the team&#8217;s timely intervention saved the day.</p>



<p>On Dec 1, Ankr identified a security breach on the project in which bad actors were able to gain internal access and steal tokens. According to a report by the team, the hackers were able to access the private developer key and modify the smart contract for aBNBc, Ankr’s BNB liquid staking token.</p>



<p>This modification gave the bad actors the power to create an unlimited amount of the token from thin air using an infinite bug. Over 60 trillion tokens were generated with the hackers converting the tokens to the USDC stablecoin.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-stitch-in-time-saves-nine"><strong>A stitch in time saves nine</strong></h2>



<p>$5 million worth of USDC was moved off Binance Smart Chain to Ethereum before the transactions were flagged, potentially saving the project a fortune. Ankr noted in their report that they “alerted known off-ramps to implement their emergency plans&#8217;” which halted trading.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ We will take a snapshot and reissue ankrBNB to all valid aBNBc holders before the exploit.<br><br>The ankrBNB token will continue to be redeemable, while aBNBc and aBNBb will no longer be redeemable.</p>&mdash; Ankr (@ankr) <a href="https://twitter.com/ankr/status/1598624445618393089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Extra steps were taken to mitigate the loss of funds, like using a new key to secure smart contracts and updating all systems to “temporarily pause the movement of the underlying collateral (BNB) to be safe.” The team noted that parties providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges supporting the affected tokens had been duly notified of the development.</p>



<p><em>“Ankr will purchase $5 million worth of BNB and use this to compensate the liquidity providers that have been affected by the exploit due to drainage of liquidity pools,” </em>said Ankr in a statement. <em>“We understand diluted aBNBc was speculatively traded after the exploit occurred, but we are only able to compensate LPs caught off guard by the event.”</em></p>



<p>Ankr says it will discontinue the affected tokens immediately, noting that it will use a snapshot to identify the affected liquid provider. The project allayed users&#8217; fears by confirming that funds and underlying assets are safe and users “will retain their positions from before.”</p>

<p>According to defence lawyer James K Filan, a summary judgement in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-new-dates-in-the-sec-vs-ripple-case-point-towards-a-final-court-verdict-in-q1-2023/">SEC vs Ripple</a> lawsuit might come sooner than expected.</p>



<p>This week, the former federal prosecutor noted that the Judge was likely to consolidate most of the pending issues for determination in one ruling. The court has to decide on three major issues before issuing the final verdict. These are the summary judgement motions, expert motion challenges and sealing issues regarding expert reports, the Hinman reports and other records presented by the SEC.</p>



<p>“<em>Why would Judge Torres slog through the expert motions and the sealing motions (including the sealing of the Hinman documents) separately before deciding what parts of them-if-any- are relevant to deciding the summary judgement motion?”</em> asked Filan.</p>



<p>“<em>I believe that she will decide everything together, and it won’t be until she rules on the motions for summary judgement, and it will be one big written ruling,</em>” he added, referencing a case involving Goldman Sachs where judge Torres addressed the same issues in one ruling. </p>



<h2 id="h-lawsuit-nears-end-as-parties-file-final-submissions"><strong>Lawsuit Nears End As&nbsp; Parties File Final Submissions</strong></h2>



<p>On Friday, December 2, both parties filed redacted replies to each other’s opposition to motions for summary judgment. According to Ripple&#8217;s motion, the SEC’s opposition brief confirmed that the defendant&#8217;s motion for summary judgment should be granted.</p>



<p><em>“The SEC cannot show that any offer or sale of XRP–much less everyone from 2013 to 2020, as it alleges and bears the burden to demonstrate –was an offer or sale of an“investment contract and, therefore, a security [under] the federal securities law,”</em> Ripple, which is sued alongside Bradley Garlinghoue and Chris Larsen argued.</p>



<p>Commenting on Friday’s filings, Ripple’s general counsel Stuart Alderoty said they were proud of having mounted a strong defence, suggesting that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-whales-are-super-bullish-on-xrp-as-the-ripple-vs-sec-case-nears-long-awaited-end/">a favourable outcome</a> for them would be a boon for the entire crypto industry.</p>



<p><em>“This is our final submission where we ask the court to grant judgment in our favour. We have always played it straight with the Court. Can’t say the same for our adversary.”</em> He wrote. His sentiments were supported by Ripple CEO Brand Garlinghouse who congratulated their defence team for its efforts. “<em>Ripple stood strong and withstood the SEC’s onslaught. I look forward to being on the right side of justice,”</em> he said.</p>



<p>That said, with Judge Torres now expected to make a ruling on the three issues no later than January 9 2023, according to Filan, a summary judgement in the long-drawn case is likely to come much faster.</p>

<p>Alibaba Cloud, a subset of Chinese e-commerce giant <a href="https://zycrypto.com/alibaba-rumored-to-have-bought-20-billion-in-bitcoin-will-this-come-to-fruition/">Alibaba</a> has expanded its line of cloud infrastructure technology and developer tools to the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-pundit-explains-why-avalanche-avax-is-positioned-to-grow-exponentially/">Avalanche</a> blockchain.</p>



<p>As per the official announcement, the partnership will enable Avalanche users to launch validator nodes, build products, and store and distribute resources through Alibaba Cloud’s suite of products in Asia. Thus, Avalanche developers looking to launch validators can leverage Alibaba Cloud’s readily available plug-and-play infrastructure as service (IaaS) to support their network. Application developers can also utilize the platform’s available infrastructure to improve their products and keep up in times of peak demand.</p>



<p>“<em>Alicloud’s infrastructure technology and intelligence tools provide greater access to computing, storage, and distribution resources for anyone to spin up a node on Avalanche, further boosting the decentralization of the network,” </em>Avalanche said in a tweet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the partnership, Alibaba cloud also run a special promotion offering Avalanche developers credit towards any of their services.</p>



<p>Launched in 2009, Alibaba Cloud operates in 28 regions and is the largest cloud service provider in the Asia-Pacific (APAC). Globally, it ranks third after Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS). As the cloud computing arm and a business unit of Alibaba Group, the platform hosts over 2800 nodes. It offers a wide range of cloud computing services to over 2.3 million customers globally. These include application services, databases, elastic computing, security, management, and large-scale computing, among other services.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Avalanche is a layer 1 open and programmable smart contracts platform for decentralized applications that is best known for its near-instant transaction time, low gas fees, and reliable network.</p>



<p>Presently the network boasts hosting over 1000 projects, including leading DeFi projects like Aave, Curve, Sushi and Chainlink. Moreover, Avalanche processes an average of two million transactions daily and has over 1,190 validators dedicated to securing the network. Industry-leading audit firm Delloite and the Lemonade Decentralized Anonymous Organization (DAO) are some enterprise-focused firms building on Avalanche.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, AVAX, the network&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, has been rallying on the back of the news surging by over 5% since Friday. As of writing, AVAX was trading at $13.67 after a 1.25% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, the 18<sup>th</sup> largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down over 90% from its all-time high, thanks to a brutal crypto winter.</p>

<p>Charles Hoskinson believes that algorithmic stablecoins are the way to go and that they have the ability to undermine the monopoly of government-issued fiat. In a recent tweet, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-reigns-as-the-most-developed-crypto-asset-as-ada-leaps-forward/">Cardano</a> co-founder expressed his support for the stablecoins, terming them as “the gold standard of the digital age” and eliciting mixed reactions from the crypto community.</p>



<p>“<em>The concept of algorithmic stablecoins is how we get nation states off of fiat currencies. It&#8217;s the gold standard of the digital age,”</em> he tweeted.</p>



<p>Stablecoins refer to special cryptocurrencies that are pegged to fiat currencies such as the dollar or euro on a 1:1 ratio. However, over the past two years, algorithmic stablecoins, a new form of stablecoin that differs in its collateralization, have emerged. These stablecoins are backed by an on-chain algorithm and another cryptocurrency that props them up. They include terraUSD(UST) frax(FRAX), and neutrino usd (USDN). </p>



<p>The debate around algorithmic stablecoins has been around for a while, most notably due to the allure of having a stablecoin that is not issued by a centralized entity or backed by fiat currencies. According to Hoskinson, using a deflationary cryptocurrency like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/santiment-ftx-collapse-to-benefit-bitcoin-in-the-long-term/">Bitcoin</a> or ADA to collateralize a stablecoin could help achieve that goal since both have adequate liquidity pools to protect stablecoins from losing value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, despite their ability to become the holy grail of next-generation Decentralized Finance (DeFi), the constant failure of algorithmic stablecoins has been troubling the crypto community. This fear has largely to do with the collapse of the Bitcoin-backed TerraUSD stablecoin in May, which saw well over $40 billion in investor money go down the drain.</p>



<p><em>“Respectfully- I disagree, Terra should be a prime example. After Terra, I would be hesitant to use an algorithmic concept. As we saw, crap can go off the rails quickly,”</em> one follower replied to Hoskinson’s tweet.</p>



<p>Another one wrote, “<em>I think that collateralizing with real-world assets makes more sense than volatile cryptocurrencies like BTC or ADA.If they&#8217;re refined in the future and also more stable then sure, but liquidations are a big issue.”</em></p>



<p>Already, DJED, a price-stable <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-unveils-djed-an-innovative-stablecoin-for-the-fast-growing-ecosystem-issued-by-coti/">algorithmic stablecoin</a> backed by ADA, has been in the works and is expected to go live in January 2023. Users who send ADA to a given smart contract address will receive the same dollar worth of DJED and vice versa. To cushion DJED against collapsing in the event ADA experiences a major downside, the smart contract will have a reserve currency SHEN that will maintain DJED’s peg by guaranteeing a collateralization rate of 400-800%.</p>
