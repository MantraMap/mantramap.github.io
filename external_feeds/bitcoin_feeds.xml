With thousands of customers and sellers worldwide, BuySellVouchers has become one of the most significant gift card marketplaces which accepts crypto payments. To further serve its diverse customer base, </span><a href="https://www.buysellvouchers.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BuySellVouchers marketplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continues to add new cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-Vouchers and e-Gift cards have grown in popularity as more and more people choose to do their shopping online. Recent events, like the COVID-19 outbreak, have accelerated the trend toward today&#x2019;s enterprises&#x2019; widespread use of online platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gift card trading industry continues to grow, which is now worth millions of dollars. The problem is that many of these online marketplaces need more user-friendliness and a more accessible environment. This also applies to the variety of payment methods and the size of commissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With BUSD as a payment option, BuySellVouchers has provided its customers with a one-of-a-kind buying experience that combines affordability and adaptability.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gift card trading is possible in a wide variety of categories: VoIP, Gift cards, Games, Prepaid Vouchers, Download / File hosting services, Mobile recharge, Software, E-books, Restaurants, and Other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#x2019;s no surprise that BuySellVouchers has gained in popularity; the site charges just 0.4% (for gift card buyers) and 0.3% (for gift card sellers).

The blog post notes that while Ethereum doesnt support account abstraction or delegable accounts, the financial services company implemented a delegable accounts solution on Starknet, the L2 blockchain network.</strong></p>
<h2>Visa Develops Account Abstraction Using the L2 Ethereum Scaling Solution Starknet, Payments Company Envisions a Future With Programmable Money</h2>
<p>On Dec. 19, 2022, Visa’s Crypto Thought Leadership blog published a <a href="https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto/auto-payments-for-self-custodial-wallets.html">post</a> written by Andrew Beams, Catherine Gu, Srini Raghuraman, Mohsen Minaei, and Ranjit Kumaresan. Visa&#8217;s subject brief is about “auto payments for self-custodial wallets,” and Visa shows that it is possible to leverage Ethereum to execute auto-payments from a self-custodial wallet solution. However, the concept utilizes account abstraction, a feature that Ethereum core developers are currently <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/86">debating</a>.</p>
<p>“Account abstraction (AA) is a proposal that attempts to combine user accounts and smart contracts into just one Ethereum account type by making user accounts function like smart contracts,” the Visa blog post details.</p>

<p>In order to bypass the issue that AA is currently not feasible using Ethereum’s layer one (L1), Visa crypto researchers have summarized how they can accomplish auto payments for self-custodial wallets with AA via the L2 scaling solution <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/makerdao-plans-to-integrate-ethereum-l2-solution-starknet-to-lower-dai-transaction-costs/">Starknet</a>. “With Starknet’s account model, we were able to implement our delegable accounts solution thus enabling auto payments for self-custodial wallets,” Visa explained. The company’s blog post adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see auto payments as a core functionality that existing blockchain infrastructure lacks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Visa blog post on the subject originally stems from a research paper that was published in Aug. 2022. The news follows Visa <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/visa-files-trademark-applications-covering-a-range-of-cryptocurrency-products-including-crypto-wallet/">filing trademark applications</a> at the end of Oct. 2022 and the trademarks covered a broad range of crypto products including a wallet. Being one of the world’s largest payment networks, Visa said the firm wants to help “make money and payments programmable.”</p>

<p>In addition to Visa, the second-largest payment-processing corporation worldwide and Visa’s competitor, Mastercard, is also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mastercard-focusing-on-5-key-areas-to-turn-crypto-into-an-everyday-way-to-pay/">working</a> to make cryptocurrency solutions more accessible. During the first week of Nov. 2022, Mastercard <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/7-startups-join-mastercard-program-to-make-cryptocurrency-more-accessible/">said</a>: “We’re welcoming a new cohort of startups to ease access to digital assets, build communities for creators and empower people to innovate for the future through Web3 technologies.”</p>
<p>Visa’s statements are akin to the same ideas and the auto-payments from a self-custodial wallet solution could provide a myriad of concepts. “We shared a novel solution that leverages the concept of account abstraction to provide self-custodial wallets with automatic recurring payments capability,” Visa’s blog post concludes. “Using the approach we have introduced, other real-world applications beyond recurring payments could be brought to the blockchain.”</p>

<h2>Peter Schiff&#x2019;s Bitcoin Outlook</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff shared his thoughts about the future of bitcoin and cryptocurrency in a series of tweets this week. He wrote Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact that bitcoin fell along with financial assets doesn&#x2019;t mean that it will rise once those markets turn.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Bitcoin isn&#x2019;t a financial asset. It&#x2019;s a collectable digital token,&#x201D; Schiff continued. &#x201C;The bitcoin bubble popped and collectors will be selling no matter what happens to financial assets.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The economist also believes that bitcoin is not scarce despite the cryptocurrency&#x2019;s 21 million supply cap. Responding to a tweet Tuesday stating that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is &#x201C;the scarcest and most desirable asset the world has ever seen,&#x201D; Schiff said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is hardly scarce and in no way desirable. If you want to lose your money there are plenty of ways to do it. You don&#x2019;t need to buy bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Replying to another tweet claiming that bitcoin is a risk asset rather than digital gold, Schiff claimed that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is &#x201C;More like a fool&#x2019;s asset.&#x201D; He asserted: &#x201C;So, as long as people are foolish enough to buy bitcoin, the price will go up. Unfortunately for bitcoin HOLDers though there are plenty of fools in the world, I don&#x2019;t think there are many left willing to buy bitcoin who don&#x2019;t already own it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Schiff is the founder and current chairman of Schiffgold, a precious metals dealer specializing in gold and silver bullion. He has long been a bitcoin skeptic, regularly bashing the crypto while promoting gold.</p>

<p>Commenting on the collapse of FTX and subsequent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasurys-yellen-says-crypto-doesnt-have-adequate-regulation-calls-ftx-collapse-a-lehman-moment/">calls for stronger crypto regulation</a>, Schiff tweeted Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s ironic that the big players in crypto are looking to government to save the industry with additional regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;This goes against the very core of the original promise of Bitcoin, which was to be the free market alternative to the corrupt government fiat monetary system,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>In November, Schiff warned that bitcoin has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-says-bitcoin-still-has-a-long-way-to-fall-values-btc-at-10k/">a long way to fall</a>, valuing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> at $10K. He also believes that the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-the-us-dollar-will-crash-says-were-going-to-default/">U.S. dollar will crash</a> and the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s actions will lead to a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-fed-action-could-lead-to-market-crashes-massive-financial-crisis-severe-recession/">massive financial crisis</a>.</p>

However, he acknowledged that banning crypto &#8220;is very difficult because it will go offshore and who knows how that will work.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Senator Sherrod Brown Suggests Banning Crypto</h2>
<p>U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, talked about cryptocurrency in an interview with NBC Sunday.</p>
<p>He stated that the Treasury Department and all the different regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), need to get together and assess any possible action related to the cryptocurrency market. Referring to the SEC and CFTC, the senator said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want them to do what they need to do. At the same time, maybe banning it, although banning it is very difficult because it will go offshore and who knows how that will work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week, the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee held a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-calls-sam-bankman-fried-to-answer-for-failure-of-ftx-and-alameda-research/">hearing</a> on the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The House Financial Services Committee also held a separate hearing on FTX a day prior.</p>
<p>FTX filed for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">bankruptcy</a> on Nov. 11 and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">arrested</a> and is now in jail in the Bahamas. He and his crypto firm are facing several <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">fraud charges</a> brought against them by the U.S. government and regulators. The U.S. is seeking Bankman-Fried&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried-faces-us-extradition-bankruptcy-court-says-top-execs-wont-be-compensated/">extradition</a>. However, SBF told the Bahamas court Monday that he will make a decision only after he has seen all the indictments against him.</p>
<h2>Senator Brown on Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>The senator from Ohio also said Sunday that the cryptocurrency market is a &#8220;complicated, unregulated pot of money&#8221; and the issue was much larger than FTX. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve got to do this right,&#8221; he stressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spent much of the last eight years and a half in this job as chair of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee,&#8221; Brown continued, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Educating my colleagues and trying to educate the public about crypto and the dangers that it presents to our security as a nation and the consumers that get hoodwinked by them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week, Senator Pat Toomey <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-cryptocurrency-cannot-be-stopped-ftx-collapse-isnt-an-indictment-of-crypto/">explained</a> in his opening remarks at the Senate hearing on FTX that the crypto exchange&#8217;s fallout does not justify banning or &#8220;pausing&#8221; crypto. &#8220;Some of my colleagues have suggested pausing cryptocurrencies before we can address it. This is profoundly misguided, not to mention impossible. Short of enacting draconian, authoritarian policies, cryptocurrency cannot be stopped. If we tried, the technology would simply migrate offshore,&#8221; he warned.</p>

The testing will be conducted under a special legal regime that’s currently under development. </strong></p>
<h2>Russia’s Central Bank to Explore Crypto Settlements Amid Financial Sanctions</h2>
<p>The Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) intends to trial international trade settlements with cryptocurrencies, the monetary authority’s First Deputy Chairman Olga Skorobogatova announced on Monday.</p>
<p>“We are now planning, within the framework of the experimental legal regime that we are preparing, to try the use of cryptocurrency for international settlements, that is, for foreign economic activity,” she said, quoted by the Tass news agency.</p>
<p>Speaking at the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, Skorobogatova detailed that the pilot project will be carried out with interested companies. However, she did not specifically name the market participants that will join in.</p>

<p>Government institutions in Moscow have been working to expand the regulatory framework for digital financial assets to cover decentralized cryptocurrencies. The central bank has been a strong <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-proposes-wide-ban-on-cryptocurrency-use-trade-mining/">opponent</a> to their legalization in Russia but has softened its stance amid Western restrictions over the invasion of Ukraine, that have limited the country’s access to global finances and markets.</p>
<p>In September, Deputy Minister of Finance Alexey Moiseev revealed that his department and the monetary policy regulator have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-cant-do-without-cross-border-crypto-payments-consensus-reached/">agreed</a> that, in the current conditions, it would be impossible for Russia to do without cross-border settlements in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the CBR maintains its position against allowing the free circulation of digital currencies like bitcoin under Russian jurisdiction, including domestic crypto payments. It recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amendments-to-russias-digital-asset-law-aim-to-allow-mining-ban-crypto-exchange-and-ads/">backed</a> legislation designed to regulate mining, provided the minted crypto is exchanged abroad or exclusively under special legal regimes inside Russia.</p>

According to the non-binding term sheet agreement, NYDIG will obtain 2.8 exahash per second (EH/s) of Greenidge&#x2019;s mining capacity, and Greenidge further entered into a hosting deal with NYDIG for the same 2.8 EH/s.</strong></p>
<h2>Greenidge Generation Enters Into a Deal With NYDIG, Board Is Actively Discussing the &#x2018;Potential for, and Timing of, a Voluntary Bankruptcy Filing&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Bitcoin miners have been hammered by financial problems in 2022 as the price of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) has dropped below the cost of production, and the network&#x2019;s mining difficulty is very high. Furthermore, a number of interconnected bitcoin mining operations have been dealing with loan defaults and bankruptcies that have caused a contagion within the mining industry. On Tuesday, the New York-based Greenidge Generation renegotiated a deal with NYDIG that concerns a loan worth $74 million.</p>
<p>Over the last six months, Greenidge (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GREE:NASDAQ">GREE</a>) shares have nosedived by 88.91% against the U.S. dollar. 35.58% has been lost during the last 30 days according to GREE/USD market data. Greenidge says it &#x201C;entered a non-binding term sheet with NYDIG&#x201D; and NYDIG will purchase 2.8 EH/s of the company&#x2019;s mining machines. Furthermore, the New York-based mining firm says it plans to enter into a hosting agreement with NYDIG.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Greenidge would enter into a hosting agreement with NYDIG for approximately 2.8 EH/s of mining capacity, which would result in a material change to Greenidge&#x2019;s current business strategy and result in Greenidge largely operating miners owned by NYDIG, rather than operating miners owned by Greenidge,&#x201D; the company detailed on Tuesday. In exchange, NYDIG has detailed its plans to reduce Greenidge&#x2019;s $74 million debt. Greenidge stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>In exchange for the purchased miners and transfer of mining infrastructure and credits to NYDIG, NYDIG would agree to a reduction of approximately $57 to $68 million of debt.</p></blockquote>
<p>NYDIG has been a big backer when it comes to lending to bitcoin mining operations as it has lent more than $300 million to firms like Stronghold, Greenidge, Argo Blockchain, Iris Energy, and Core Scientific. The loans were secured by the firms&#x2019; application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining machines.</p>

<p>In addition to the restructuring update on Tuesday, Greenidge also filed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844971/000162828022032258/gree_exhibit991x20222012.htm">documentation</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that notes Greenidge execs are in active discussions about the potential for, and timing of, a voluntary bankruptcy filing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The bitcoin mining operation says that bankruptcy could happen if Greenidge discovers it does not have available liquidity, its remaining capital depletes and cannot fulfill debt obligations, or if Greenidge defaults on any debts or contracts.</p>

For 38 days FTT remained above the $1 per unit area up until Dec. 19, as the token suddenly crashed below the $1 region during the mid-afternoon trading sessions, slipping to a low of $0.89 per FTT at 2:30 p.m. (ET).</strong></p>
<h2>Bankrupt FTX&#8217;s Exchange Token FTT Drops Below the $1 Price Range</h2>
<p>Ftx token (FTT), the crypto exchange ERC20 coin tied to the now-defunct exchange, FTX, broke below the $1 support line on Monday, Dec. 19, 2022. Interestingly, unlike the Terra collapse and the native token LUNA dive bombing to zero, FTT fell from $25.78 per coin on Nov. 5, 2022, to roughly $1.59 per unit on Nov. 14, three days after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>

<p>FTT tapped $1.92 per coin the following day on Nov. 15, and it would not see that price height again after that point. For 38 consecutive days since Nov. 12, FTT has been below $2 and above the $1 range, and it tapped a high of $1.88 per coin on Dec. 9. 11 days later, FTT markets are struggling and for the first time since the token was launched, it reached its all-time low Dec. 19.</p>
<p>The exchange token sunk to $0.894 per unit at around 2:30 p.m. (ET) on Monday afternoon. On Tuesday, at the time of writing, FTT is down 8.6% against the U.S. dollar. While FTT’s price remains below $1, a myriad of crypto assets on Tuesday have seen gains and FTT has not. FTT’s market cap rank is not applicable because the project’s contract deployer unlocked the locked FTT tokens into circulation last month.</p>
<p>Coin market cap aggregation sites like coingecko.com do not rank the crypto asset’s cap among the thousands of other crypto assets listed. It is assumed there’s a total supply of 328,895,112 FTT tokens in the wild today and during the last 24 hours, FTT has seen $7.26 million in global trade volume.</p>

<p>FTT trade volumes have dwindled a great deal since FTX’s collapse and today the most active FTT trading is taking place on Binance, Kucoin, and Sushiswap. While FTT has broken below the $1 support, the crypto asset has remained consolidated just below that region at prices between $0.89 and $0.98 per unit.</p>

<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) snapped a six-day losing streak on Tuesday, as prices rose by as much as 3%.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD moved away from a one-month low of $61.00, hitting a high of $65.60 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move came as bullish pressure intensified once the token hit a key support point of $63.50.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rose, moving away from its long-term floor of 33.50.</p>
<p>Since moving away from yesterday&#x2019;s six-month low, the index is now tracking at the 37.46 mark.</p>
<p>The next visible resistance seems to be the 46.00 level, and if hit, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> will likely be trading above $70.00.</p>

<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>

<p>Following a low of $5.75 to start the week, LINK/USD climbed to a peak of $6.10 earlier today.</p>
<p>This rally has pushed the token to its highest point since Friday, when it was trading at a top of $6.54.</p>

<p>Similar to litecoin, today&#x2019;s move saw prices move away from a four-week low, rising from a recent floor in the process.</p>
<p>LINK rallied at the $5.80 support, which came as the RSI rose above a ceiling at the 37.00 level.</p>

The Japanese central bank was one of the only banks worldwide to hold off on raising benchmark interest rates, as policymakers have kept the government bond yield rate close to zero since 2016.</strong></p>
<h2>Japanese Central Bank Lifts Rates for the First Time in 6 Years</h2>
<p>During the last two months, there’s been a lot of discussion surrounding the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, as the BOJ chief will be replaced soon by a successor. Kuroda, however, shocked global markets on Dec. 20, when he <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/yen-surges-as-bank-of-japan-surprises-by-letting-benchmark-rate-rise-11671510671?mod=home-page">detailed</a> that the BOJ would allow Japan’s 10-year bond yields to increase to 0.5% from the previous upper limit of 0.25%.</p>
<p>The move follows the yield curve control mechanism the Japanese central bank introduced in Sept. 2016. The BOJ <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/bank-of-japan-shocks-global-markets-with-bond-yield-shift.html">explained</a> on Tuesday that the change aims to “improve market functioning and encourage a smoother formation of the entire yield curve, while maintaining accommodative financial conditions.”</p>

<p>Representatives from Mizuho Bank told CNBC in an interview that the move reflected the belief that there will be a hawkish pivot from the BOJ going forward. However, these hawkish bets may not come to fruition the financial institution elaborated on Tuesday. “Popular bet does not mean that is the policy reality or the intended policy perception,” Mizuho Bank added.</p>
<p>Gold bug and economist Peter Schiff is betting that the BOJ will raise rates again. “The Bank of Japan blinked and pivoted in the opposite direction,” Schiff <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1605044558475055104?s=20&amp;t=-rzytrqawzzFGAtFOIhQ7Q">tweeted</a>. “After artificially holding the 10-year JGB yield at .25%, the BOJ just raised the target rate to .5%. More hikes are coming. In the U.S. this means the dollar and asset prices will fall and inflation will rise.” Hedge fund manager James Lavish <a href="https://twitter.com/jameslavish/status/1605066346357743616?s=20&amp;t=-rzytrqawzzFGAtFOIhQ7Q">said</a> the BOJ has attempted to make one last goal.</p>
<p>“At this point, the Bank of Japan has pulled the goalie and is hoping for a last-second tying goal,” Lavish tweeted. “Maybe get to overtime. Maybe somehow pull it out. Except they’re down 5-1. The game is over, and they just don’t know it yet.”</p>

<p>At 8:41 a.m. (ET), the Japanese yen was up 3.42% against the U.S. dollar during the last 24 hours and 4% higher over the last five days. 30-day statistics indicate the yen has gained 5.73% against the greenback as well. Six-month metrics show the yen is up 1.81% and year-to-date the yen is down 13.25% against the dollar.</p>
