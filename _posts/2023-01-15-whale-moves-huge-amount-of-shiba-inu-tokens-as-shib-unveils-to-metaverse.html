First, Shiba Inu&#8217;s developers said they want to unveil their new metaverse at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival 2023 in Austin, Texas. A virtual reality (VR) tour of the WAGMI Temple, one of 11 locations in Shiba Inu&#8217;s metaverse showcasing the Dogecoin (DOGE) competition, will be featured in the exhibition. Expanding The Scope Of Shiba Inu For the Ethereum-based Shiba Token Decentralized Community Project, millions of devoted SHIB supporters have organized themselves into a movement they call the #ShibArmy. As a result, the cryptocurrency is consistently placed in the top 15 by market cap. According To Shiba Inu Ecosystem‚Äôs Blog: The unique possibilities that will be in HUBs like WAGMI Temple make SHIB: The Metaverse stand out. ‚ÄúHUBs are epicenters of activity within the Metaverse, offering distinctive experiences rooted in each HUB‚Äôs theme,‚Äù explains Sherri Cuono, Metaverse Advisor to Shiba Token.‚Äú Each offers special attractions that may only be experienced in that hub. The common thread is extensive digital or digital-plus-IRL utility including activities, commerce, customization, expression, events, education, exploring and more.

It will soon deploy a layer-2 scaling protocol and promote Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) as the official virtual asset associated with the blockchain. Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world measured by volume, was prompted to stake an astounding 4 trillion Shiba Inu tokens as a result of this¬†move. At press time, the trading price of Shiba Inu was $0.00001032 with a 24-hour trading volume of $667.322 Million.
