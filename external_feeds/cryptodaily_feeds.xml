			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A newly filed lawsuit alleges that crypto exchange Coinbase improperly collected, stored, and distributed customers&rsquo; biometric data. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been slapped with a lawsuit filed with a District Court in California on May 1 for violating Illinois&rsquo; Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The suit alleges the exchange collected and improperly used its customers&rsquo; fingerprint and facial recognition data.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports plaintiff Michael Massel is seeking relief in the form of $5,000 in damages for each &ldquo;intentional and reckless violation&rdquo; of BIPA and an additional $1,000 for every violation Massel&rsquo;s legal representation can find.</p>
<p>According to Decrypt, the lawsuit accuses Coinbase of collecting biometric information through its KYC procedures and that this data was illegally obtained, used, stored, and disseminated. BIPA regulations require a company seeking to collect biometric data to inform a person in writing that it obtains such data and must specify the purpose and duration of the data&rsquo;s storage.</p>
<p>BIPA further requires written consent from a customer, and the company seeking to obtain such data must publish &ldquo;publicly‐available written retention schedules and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric identifiers and biometric information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Massel&rsquo;s legal team argues Coinbase does not comply with the regulations when it collects customers&rsquo; data before and after creating new accounts.</p>
<p>The suit alleges Coinbase&rsquo;s &ldquo;collection, obtainment, storage, and use&rdquo; of customers&rsquo; biometric data is &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; and opens clients up &ldquo;to serious and irreversible privacy risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legal document asserts:</p>

<p>If Coinbase&rsquo;s database containing facial geometry scans or other sensitive, proprietary biometric data is hacked, breached, or otherwise exposed, Coinbase users have no means by which to prevent identity theft.</p>

<p>The lawsuit further states that the exchange should have &ldquo;permanently destroyed&rdquo; such data after a customer created a Coinbase account, as the information was obtained solely to create an account.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The collapse of several banks - Silvergate, Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse, and First Republic - has left a significant number of people concerned about their deposits, questioning the strength of the existing financial infrastructure.&nbsp; This week Pac West bank stocks dropped in value more than 40%.</p>
<p>While once the domain of free-market capitalists and right-wing libertarians, the policies of quantitative easing and centralized banking are now queried by those of a more moderate disposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A systemic collapse could herald increases in the price of cryptocurrency and NFT tokens, but the effects could be catastrophic. Strategic thinking is still required to transfer from fiat to crypto in the safest manner possible, choosing the best possible projects and ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
The Banking Crisis - An Overview
<p>Silvergate Bank shut its doors in early March 2023. FTX was a major client of Silvergate and it was no real surprise that it ultimately went under, losing over $1 billion in a single quarter after intense customer withdrawals. But it was the start of a chain of banking failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) both collapsed, within days of one another. Both catered to technology startups, particularly in the sphere of cryptocurrency. In the case of SVB, what happened was that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, and a large number of depositors started to withdraw their money. This forced the bank to sell its bonds at a discount, ultimately rendering it insolvent. SVB ultimately misjudged its interest rate risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury Department, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to insure the deposits in excess of $250,000, even though there was no initial insurance for accounts. They also covered Signature Bank, which was taken over by the New York Department of Financial Services. Three major banks - &ldquo;SSS&rdquo; - all collapsed within 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 16th, First Republic Bank was bailed out in a private rescue plan from the major Banks. As of April 28th, there are even more talks about a second rescue plan for First Republic, a further cause of concern. Customers pulled over $100 billion in withdrawals amidst the crisis.&nbsp; Around May 1st,&nbsp; First Republic was seized by regulators and sold at a discount to JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>On March 19th, another bank failed, this time outside the USA, as Credit Suisse was rescued by UBS. Credit Suisse is a major international bank headquartered in Switzerland.&nbsp; With Credit Suisse, it was a $68 billion bank run on deposits that triggered the collapse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 4th, local Californian bank Pac West stocks dropped dramatically. It sank 45% in early trading and was halted for volatility. The bank management now doing everything to bring back shareholders&rsquo; value. So the trend of the traditional banks collapsing continue.</p>
Decreased Trust In The Banking Sector
<p>The bailouts came at an enormous cost. Guaranteeing deposit insurance at SVB and Signature Bank has cost the Federal Reserve $140 billion. The Swiss state has guaranteed $225 billion to UBS, the institution that took over Credit Suisse. Meanwhile, bank loans are at record highs in the USA. All this indicates a potential recession and severe difficulty in obtaining loans from banks, who will be more reluctant to lend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it can be made to sound very technical and complex, the reality is much simpler. When people lose faith in banks, for any reason, they withdraw their money quickly. The bank then has to liquidate assets (at a discount) to cover its existing positions, which accelerates the trend as customers withdraw even more. This is a typical bank run. Social media exacerbates this problem because news can spread so quickly in the modern era.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) does quite a lot to reassure people. Customer deposits are safe, possibly even in instances where the bank has no insurance (such as Signature and SVB). But with recent events, alongside customer frustration with banks and their fees, many are still turning to crypto and Web3 finance, which is proving more flexible, and yet more stable.&nbsp;</p>
Alternative Banking Options Via Web3 Solutions
<p>There are multiple alternatives to using the banking infrastructure and many ways to manage your funds. In fact, pretty much anything that can currently be done on the legacy architecture can be done on a faster, safer, more efficient blockchain. Thousands of industry professionals, analysts, and mathematicians can come together to make a more innovative and flexible solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stoic AI, for instance, supplies users with crypto trading bots that manage multiple portfolios based on risk tolerance levels, without any of the emotionality associated with retail investing. The app connects to Binance or Coinbase via API so funds never leave your account. The company behind the product, Cindicator, has been in operation since 2015 with over $130M in assets under management from 15,000+ customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much like Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) within the capital markets industry, Stoic can tune your portfolio to the risk level you are comfortable with. Current portfolio options include conservative, balanced, and volatile, each containing its own set of strengths. Only the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap are traded. All of this is done through emotionless automation at a fraction of the cost of traditional hedge funds and with much greater APY potential.</p>
<p>And this example only applies to portfolio management. There are a plethora of Web3 options that cater to various industries including crypto lending, collateral, mortgages, house rentals, yield farming, insurance, international finance, microfinance, charitable donations, privacy-based tokens, and more. And all of this can generally be achieved with less red tape and more efficiency as compared to the centralized banking model.&nbsp;</p>
All Paths Point To A Crypto Price Increase &amp; Renewed Interest
<p>Ultimately, even if a systemic crisis is averted, it will still result in a rise in cryptocurrency (the price has already risen significantly). This is due to the fact that commercial banks are only being saved with money printed by central banks, resulting in even more inflation, which encourages more people to purchase commodities and cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bailouts can only be done for so long before the system crashes completely as it continually devalues the currency. A &ldquo;saved&rdquo; bank comes at a huge cost. This cost is acceptable now and again, but if a multitude of banks has to be propped up, the end result is a government-dominated state with a poor economic climate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this can only lead to a renewed interest in cryptocurrency products and services, as existing institutions fail to provide adequate financial safeguards for the population. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Looking for the best crypto coins in 2023? Below, we&rsquo;ll introduce you to Ethereum (ETH), Cosmos (ATOM) and Collateral Network (COLT) and the reasons why experts believe that these three cryptocurrencies are set to explode in 2023. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Collateral Network (COLT)</p>
<p class="s11">Collateral Network (COLT) has a rather different approach, as this blockchain-based platform appeals directly to everyday investors and individuals. </p>
<p class="s7">When in need of cash, many people sell their expensive belongings, such as luxury watches or fine art, to raise money. Collateral Network (COLT) is the first platform on the blockchain where borrowers can use these assets as collateral for loans instead of selling them. The Collateral Network (COLT) platform appraises the asset and mints an asset-backed NFT representing the physical asset. The holder of the asset, the borrower, unlocks cash, while numerous lenders can earn passive income by investing their capital in portions of these fractionalised NFTs.</p>
<p class="s7">Indeed, Collateral Network (COLT) is a nurturing environment for lenders, who provide liquidity to the ecosystem and are rewarded with fixed interest rate payments and the ability to trade their loan portfolios for additional income.</p>
<p class="s7">Collateral Network (COLT) is a new project with a huge potential to increase 35 times before it hits the exchanges. Priced at only $0.014, the Collateral Network (COLT) token has already increased by 40% and is estimated to reach as high as $0.35 in the near future, providing early investors with 3500% returns. </p>
<p class="s7">If you wish to purchase the $COLT token for only $0.014, follow the links below and take advantage of this unique opportunity to earn an extra 40% purchase bonus on your investment!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Ethereum (ETH)</p>
<p class="s11">The case for Ethereum (ETH) is quite simple &ndash; it has had an excellent price performance so far in 2023. Despite many new projects competing with it, Ethereum (ETH) remains the champion when it comes to the DeFi space. </p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) has increased by nearly 60% year-to-date, which could make some people reluctant to buy, thinking it may be overpriced. However, it&rsquo;s worth noticing that Ethereum (ETH) still trades about 50% below its all-time high, so it has a high chance of exploding this year. </p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) is a market leader and its continuous developments keep it at the forefront. The main challenges of the network are cost and speed. But one of its co-founders, Vitalik Buterin, stated that Ethereum (ETH) currently operates at only half of its potential, indicating that more upgrades down the road are to address these main issues. </p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Cosmos (ATOM)</p>
<p class="s11">Dubbed the &ldquo;internet of blockchains&rdquo;, Cosmos (ATOM) aims to solve a major issue that has always been plaguing the crypto world. Interoperability means that blockchains can communicate with each other, such as sending one asset to another &ndash; and this is the thesis put forth by Cosmos (ATOM). </p>
<p class="s7">If Cosmos (ATOM) manages to solve the interoperability issue, the year 2023 could prove crucial for the company. Although competition is fierce in the crypto industry, Cosmos (ATOM) is specially built on the idea of scalability &ndash; such as allowing developers to create new blockchains and plug them into the &ldquo;Cosmoverse&rdquo; to communicate with other blockchains. </p>
<p class="s7">Still relatively a small project, many investors probably have not heard of Cosmos (ATOM) just yet. However, if it manages to expand, Cosmos (ATOM) could explode in 2023. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Summary</p>
<p class="s11">If you are looking for new crypto projects to add to your portfolio, Ethereum (ETH), Cosmos (ATOM) and Collateral Network (COLT) are well worth your attention. With high potential and sturdy underpinning concepts, these three projects have the potential to be market leaders this year. </p>

<p class="s7">Still relatively a small project, many investors probably have not heard of Cosmos (ATOM) just yet. However, if it manages to expand, Cosmos (ATOM) could explode in 2023. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Summary</p>
<p class="s11">If you are looking for new crypto projects to add to your portfolio, Ethereum (ETH), Cosmos (ATOM) and Collateral Network (COLT) are well worth your attention. With high potential and sturdy underpinning concepts, these three projects have the potential to be market leaders this year. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Across the Web3 space, projects are consistently battling to reach the top spot in regard to market capitalization and to truly provide investors and traders with a lot of value, both in regard to their native cryptocurrency as well as the overall project's offering.</p>
<p class="s6">With the recent decrease in the value of Axie Infinity (AXS) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR), investors and traders have begun eyeing the presale of Yachtify, the first platform where anyone can buy, sell, rent or own a timeshare in anything from a Jetski to a Sunseeker Yacht. Let&rsquo;s dive in to see what makes this project truly stand out.</p>
<p class="s8">Axie Infinity (AXS) Dips By 20.6% Despite Updates</p>
<p class="s6">The Axie Infinity (AXS) Twitter page made waves in April when they announced the player experience updates as well as the AXS and Seasonal Achievement Rewards.</p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, on May 3, 2023, Axie Infinity (AXS) announced the Extreme Home Makeover: Lunacian Edition and gained a lot of momentum.</p>
<p class="s6">However, despite the developments and momentum, the value of the Axie Infinity (AXS) cryptocurrency has been in decline. As of May 3, 2023, Axie Infinity (AXS) traded at $7.64. Within the last 30 days, Axie Infinity (AXS) decreased by 10.4%, and in the last two weeks, the overall decrease of the cryptocurrency was by 20.6%.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Decreases by 23.2% Despite New Partnership</p>
<p class="s6">PipeFlare made an announcement that they joined forces with NEAR Protocol (NEAR) in order to make onboarding an easier procedure. This means that the NEAR Protocol (NEAR) ecosystem has experienced a high level of growth.</p>
<p class="s6">This, however, did not translate to an increased value of the NEAR Protocol (NEAR) cryptocurrency. On May 3, 2023, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) traded at $1.80. Within the last 30 days, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) saw a decrease of 6.3%, and in the last two weeks, the decrease was by 23.2%.</p>
<p class="s8">Yachtify (YCHT) To Change The Way Investors Earn Revenue</p>
<p class="s6">Yachtify will be a marketplace in which every investor will gain the opportunity to earn passive income through making investments in and having ownership over fractions of boats.</p>
<p class="s6">Specifically, when the boat that they have ownership over gets lent out, they can earn a portion of the rental based on their overall share of the boat.</p>
<p class="s6">So if an investor had fractional ownership of 30% of a specific boat, they would then earn 30% of the income generated from renting it, aside from the trading fees.</p>
<p class="s6">The YCHT cryptocurrency is currently undergoing stage one of its presale, where its value is at just $0.10.</p>
<p class="s6">Experienced investors know that significant gains can be made when they get into the early stages of a project that can become a dominant force in the Web3 space. The Yachtify network has been audited by InterFi network, and the liquidity will be locked for life, which means that it will be completely safe for investors. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Across the Web3 space, investors and traders are consistently on the lookout for projects that can provide them with a lot of value. </p>
<p class="s6">With the decrease in value of well-established projects, such as Dash (DASH) and GMX (GMX), it has become clear to many that the true value can be found in projects that are undergoing their presale stage. One of the most notable presale-stage projects to grab the attention of investors and traders is currently Yachtify, and today, we will go over why it has captured so much attention.</p>
<p class="s8">Dash (DASH) Dips in Value by 20.7%</p>
<p class="s6">The Dash (DASH) project made waves across social media when the team discussed how its partnership with NOWPayments can benefit investors and traders. Additionally, they also went over their partnership with HitBTC. Based on this, it is clear that the Dash (DASH) ecosystem has been growing.</p>
<p class="s6">When we go over the value of the ​​Dash (DASH) cryptocurrency, however, on May 3, 2023, it traded at $47.37.</p>
<p class="s6">Within the last 30 days, Dash (DASH) saw a decrease in its value by 17.1%. In the last two weeks alone, Dash (DASH) saw an additional decrease in its value by 20.7%, and this has left investors worried about its future.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">GMX (GMX) Sees a Decrease of 23.7% Despite Updates</p>
<p class="s6">GMX (GMX) published a Tweet on May 3, 2023, where they went over how the network collected $3,783,115.98 within the last seven days in the weekly rewards. </p>
<p class="s6">Additionally, the GMX (GMX) team also published updates in the referral page UI for GMX V2 and added the option to claim rewards for affiliates alongside adding the subgraph for V2 referral stats.</p>
<p class="s6">When we go over the value of the GMX (GMX) cryptocurrency, however, on May 3, 2023, the cryptocurrency had a value of $67.95. Within the last 30 days, GMX (GMX) saw a decrease in its value by 8.8%. In the last two weeks, the value of GMX (GMX) decreased by 23.7%.</p>
<p class="s8">Yachtify (YCHT) To Change The Way People Earn</p>
<p class="s6">The Yachtify platform will enable a new way through which users can earn by gaining access to fractional private yacht ownership that can provide them with a unique opportunity.</p>
<p class="s6">Specifically, through the usage of the native YCHT token, investors can buy fractional non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The underlying yachts are insured and stored in ports across the globe. </p>
<p class="s6">Every NFT, as a result, enables investors to earn/ FOr example, if an investor has 25% ownership over a specific boat, they can earn 25% of the income generated from it getting rented, aside from the trading fees that occurred.</p>
<p class="s6">At the level one presale stage, the YCHT token trades at a value of just $0.10. Analysts predict a high level of growth for this altcoin, especially since it has already been audited by the InterFiNetwork.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>X.AI, an advanced AI model specialised in crypto and blockchain, announced its official launch. Elon Musk serves as its director. </p>
<p>X.AI, an advanced artificial intelligence system designed for cryptocurrency and blockchain, officially announced its launch on May 3. The company debuted X.AI GPT, an AI system based on machine learning and natural language processing designed to understand context and generate text for crypto use cases.</p>
<p>News of X.AI was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which said the company was incorporated in March, and Elon Musk serves as a company director. Jared Birchall, the director of Musk&rsquo;s family office, is listed as X.AI&rsquo;s secretary.</p>
<p>Martin Winward, CEO of X.AI, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are excited to introduce X AI GPT to the blockchain community. This AI model has been trained on massive datasets to gain a deep understanding of cryptocurrencies, DeFi, NFTs, and the metaverse. Developers and businesses can now leverage the power of AI to elevate their crypto products and services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>X.AI GPT is built on OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-3 language model and uses a technique called self-attention to analyse the relationship between words in a sentence. The model identifies patterns and understands context, and uses its abilities to create coherent and meaningful text. According to its press release, X.AI has customised its GPT model with domain-specific datasets in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Winward also said:</p>

<p>GPT-3 demonstrated the possibilities of generative AI, but it lacked the crypto-native knowledge and context awareness for blockchain applications. With X.AI GPT, we have built an AI that understands crypto inside and out, so it can generate content that resonates with the blockchain community.</p>

<p>The company&rsquo;s CEO added, &ldquo;Crypto is an ideal space for AI to make an impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>X.AI has identified several use cases for its AI system, including AI writers and communicators, smart contract generators, DeFi tools, NFT creators, and conversational AI bots for crypto customer support. The company said developers could access X.AI GPT API and build their own apps atop the AI model.</p>
Musk Openly Opposes OpenAI
<p>Elon Musk opened up on views against OpenAI, the AI organisation he co-founded in 2015 with Sam Altman, CEO of Y Combinator, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel. Musk stepped away from the ChatGPT creator in 2018.</p>
<p>Since ChatGPT launched, Musk has openly disputed with Altman over the censorship of ChatGPT&rsquo;s responses with what OpenAI deems harmful prompts, Forbes reports.</p>
<p>As an advocate for free speech, Musk tweeted saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The danger of training AI to be woke &ndash; in other words, lie &ndash; is deadly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Twitter CEO even went as far as to sign a letter demanding a pause on &ldquo;giant AI experiments,&rdquo; according to reports by The Verge.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">The crypto market has recently become volatile, with investors being on the lookout for smarter investment choices that can withstand the market downtown while delivering higher returns.Sparklo is one of the popular blockchain technologies that seems to attract the attention of different investors.</p>
<p class="s3">However, in a downtrend market, making the right decisions is crucial. This will not only protect your assets but also maximise all your gains. This piece will dig deep to understand why Sparklois a wise investment option compared to Casper (CSPR) and Flare (FLR) for individuals seeking growth and stability in the crypto market.</p>
<p class="s3">Why Sparklo (SPRK) Is a Better Choice?</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo being on its initial presale stages has a bright feature, owing to its uniqueness. First, SPRK features a unique technology that guarantees faster and more scalable transactions unlike the traditional blockchain technology. This ensures a reliable yet smooth user experience, making SPRK an attractive option for businesses and investors looking to streamline financial operations.</p>
<p class="s3">Additionally, SPRK's fractional precious metals investing, including gold, platinum and silver, allows investors to easily diversify without the need to acquire a significant investment capital. With fractional investing, people are empowered to retain and obtain manageable portions of the physical metals&mdash;providing good exposure to these precious metals markets while eliminating the complexity that comes with acquiring entire bars and coins.</p>
<p class="s3">SPRK will also allow investors to acquire its tokens during the presale at an attractive discounted price of up to 30%, with the tokens going for just $0.015 per token. This offer not only provides early investors with an excellent opportunity to benefit from the potential growth of the tokens, which is expected to rise to $0.017 by the end of the week but also lays a strong foundation for SPRK's long-term success.</p>
<p class="s3">SPRK's partnership with leading blockchain technology giants will ensure long-term growth potential and viability&mdash;a reason why it's high time you grab this opportunity and make the investment.</p>

<p class="s3">Does Casper (CSPR) Have a Future in the Volatile Crypto Market?</p>
<p class="s3">Many investors consider Casper (CSPR) as just another project within the blockchain platform. It doesn't have the potential to be considered as a sleeping giant. In fact, Casper (CSPR) is a hyped-up version of ETH.</p>
<p class="s3">As much as the Casper (CSPR) team is trying to market the coin as being a better version of Ethereum (ETH), it doesn&rsquo;t have what it takes to penetrate the market and outdo ETH. This is because nothing special makes Casper (CSPR) worth the investment&mdash;even after using famous people like Tim Draper aiming to try and pump Casper's (CSPR) price, it still fails to attract the needed attention.</p>
<p class="s3">Flare (FLR) on the Receiving End</p>
<p class="s3">January 9th wasn&rsquo;t a good day for Flare (FLR) investors as the keenly anticipated FLR token airdrop occurred, leading to a significant drawdown of 83% within 24 hours.</p>
<p class="s3">Flare (FLR) started its operation in January 2021. It managed to grow, reaching an all-time best of $2.26 by May 1st within the same year. However, since then, Flare (FLR) has been taking a macro-downtrend that corresponds to some of the larger market events like the FTX sell-off.</p>
<p class="s3">The first Flare (FLR) trouble sign was witnessed on January 8th, where Flare (FLR) dropped by 18%, ending the day at only $0.451838. This was followed by another drop on January 9th, resulting in a day loss of 42%. Currently, FLR continues to dip to -0.48%.</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK): The Trendsetter</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Despite Aptos (APT) experiencing a 12.84% price drop in the last week following the Node v1.2.4 release, experts are shifting their focus towards a new, innovative crowdlending platform. It has made headlines as the first blockchain platform for peer-2-peer Lending tapping into the trillion-dollar lending market. In comparison to Aptos (APT), Collateral Network is set for greatness, as Web3 meets asset-backed lending.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Aptos (APT)</p>
<p class="s7">Aptos (APT), dubbed the &lsquo;Solana Killer,&rsquo; is a Layer 1 blockchain that integrates Block-STM Technology. Despite the latest Node v1.2.4 release, Aptos (APT) has dropped 12.84% in the last week. Aptos (APT) has maintained VC interest because of its relationship with Diem, a project by Meta. Former Meta researchers, engineers, UX designers, and strategists make up the Aptos (APT) team.</p>
<p class="s7">Currently, 84% of Aptos (APT) tokens are locked, and each Aptos (APT) unlocking event is likely to result in an Aptos (APT) price drop. However, a 4.5 million Aptos (APT) token, worth about $50 million, was unlocked on April 12, increasing the circulation supply by 0.5% to 186 million Aptos (APT). As a result, the token&rsquo;s price decreased to $9.01 the same day.</p>
<p class="s7">Despite Aptos (APT) delivering mainnet support for high-precision integers, which are critical for DeFi applications, anxiety and uncertainty continue to plague Aptos (APT) holders.</p>
<p>Aptos (APT) is now trading at $10.80 per share, with a 24-hour trading volume of $439.99 million and a market size of $2.02 billion. Aptos (APT) peaked at $19.86 on January 30, 2023, and is currently down 45.59%. Aptos (APT) still has room for development and innovation within the blockchain sector.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Revolutionizing The Lending Process Leveraging The Blockchain</p>
<p>The debut of Collateral Network (COLT), a Web3-based crowdlending network, is intended to transform the worldwide credit market. Collateral Network (COLT) allows users to borrow against off-chain physical assets. As collateral, the platform turns real-world assets into asset-backed NFTs, which are subsequently fractionalized.</p>
<p>Lenders, on the other hand, may contribute to fund loans on the platform by buying NFTs&rsquo; fractions in exchange for a set weekly income and various other incentives. This way, lenders can fund several loans with small amounts, building their own diversified portfolios. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Collateral Network (COLT) Provides Liquidity Like No Other</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) accepts real estate, fine art, luxury watches, rare whiskeys, jewelry, gold, and many more off-chain assets. </p>
<p>To bring these assets on-chain, Collateral Network (COLT) mints an NFT 100% backed by the asset in question, which the owner can use to access crowd-sourced liquidity on the platform.</p>
<p>Fractionalized NFT lending means that lenders can earn passive income on Collateral Network (COLT), and borrowers can access liquidity in assets they already own without selling them and thus can still benefit from long-term appreciation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Analysts Expect Massive Returns From Collateral Network (COLT)</p>
<p>The Collateral Network (COLT) token (COLT) will serve as the ecosystem's backbone, giving its holders access to the network's main features, including voting, staking incentives, exclusive VIP clubs, and auctions for foreclosed assets.</p>
<p>With the big 40% deposit bonus available right now, you can get some Collateral Network (COLT) for only $0.014. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As the presale progresses, analysts expect the price to rally to $0.35, yielding a massive 35x return. Regarding the next-gen of DeFi financing, the name to know is Collateral Network (COLT). </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As Avalanche (AVAX) leaves investors wondering about its future price, analysts are pointing to Cosmos (ATOM) and Collateral Network (COLT) as projects worth investing in. But which one takes the crown? </p>
<p>Well, that would be COLT, currently in its public presale, expected to deliver 3500% gains to its holders before the presale ends! &nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Collateral Network (COLT)</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) is the world&rsquo;s first Web3 decentralized lending platform for real world-assets on the blockchain. These assets include luxury watches, rare collectibles, gold, and vintage cars. </p>
<p>The way it works is simple. To get the funds you need, you send your asset to Collateral Network (COLT), where the team uses AI to evaluate it and stores it in its highly-securevault. Then, Collateral Network (COLT) mints an NFT of the asset and fractionalizes it to allow multiple lenders to fund the loan and receive weekly fixed-interest payments. </p>
<p>Once the borrower pays off the loan, Collateral Network (COLT) will burn the 100% asset-backed NFT and redeem the asset from the vault.</p>
<p>Additionally, Collateral Network (COLT) will hold online private auctions where lenders can buy distressed assets below market value, ensuring that even if a borrower defaults, Collateral Network (COLT) investors can recover their funds.</p>
<p>Currently, the Collateral Network (COLT) is in its public presale, and the Collateral Network (COLT) token price is $0.014. However, experts say the token has a 3500% growth potential, delivering 35x gains to Collateral Network (COLT) holders along with benefits like staking, governance rights and more!</p>
<p>If you wish to purchase the $COLT token for only $0.014, follow the links below and take advantage of this unique opportunity to earn an extra 40% purchase bonus on your investment!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Avalanche (AVAX)</p>
<p>April has been an overall good month for Avalanche (AVAX). Namely, Avalanche (AVAX) has seen growth in the Avalanche (AVAX) daily users, which soared to a six-month high.</p>
<p>However, as April ends, the Avalanche (AVAX) token shows both bullish and bearish indicators, currently consolidating around the $17 price level.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Avalanche (AVAX) token is trading at $16.98, with a 0.17% price increase in the last 24 hours. However, the Avalanche (AVAX) trading volume decreased by 1.06% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>As for the future of the Avalanche (AVAX) price, analysts believe that the Avalanche (AVAX) token will move sideways before decreasing to $16.00 per Avalanche (AVAX) token, continuing the downtrend.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s9">Cosmos (ATOM)</p>
<p>As the Cosmos (ATOM) token drops to key $10.58 support, experts believe that Cosmos (ATOM) bulls can take charge and spark a Cosmos (ATOM) price recovery. However, Cosmos (ATOM) sustained fluctuating funding rates in the past week, leading analysts to expect wavering demand in the future markets.</p>
<p>However, experts believe that a potential Cosmos (ATOM) recovery is still viable, as the Cosmos (ATOM) RSI 40-mark rejection points to higher buying pressure.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Cosmos (ATOM) token is trading at $10.76, with a 0.04% decrease in the last 24 hours. Additionally, the Cosmos (ATOM) trading volume decreased by 8.17% over 24 hours.</p>
<p>Still, due to the buying pressure, analysts say that the Cosmos (ATOM) price could break through the technical resistance at $15.5 and aim for the $26 price mark before 2023 ends.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Source: Depositphotos</p>
<p>The travel industry has just received a massive gift in the shape of its very own blockchain network, courtesy of a Swiss startup called Chain4Travel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new blockchain is called Camino Network, and its creator has just announced the soft launch of its mainnet powered by a select group of validators from the travel industry it&rsquo;s designed to serve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain technology promises to play a key role in the travel industry&rsquo;s digital transformation. According to Statista, the travel industry is one of the biggest in the world, contributing an incredible $5..81 trillion to the global economy in 2022. Yet despite its massive size, it&rsquo;s an industry where innovation proceeds at a snail&rsquo;s pace. As Chain4Travel explains in its press release, most travel companies are reliant on decades-old, proprietary technology platforms. This aging infrastructure ensures that innovation in the sector proceeds at a glacial pace, and this is precisely where blockchain can make a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camino Network provides travel industry participants with an advanced platform for building decentralized, Web3-enabled applications that can transform the travel industry while enabling more efficient, peer-to-peer payments and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain has dozens of potential applications in travel, ranging from faster, more secure and reliable payments for hotel bookings, flights, car rentals etc. It could provide a way for travellers to securely store personal information such as their passport details, travel preferences and loyalty program memberships. Other applications include better matching travelers with personalized itineraries and activities, eliminating the need for intermediaries such as travel agents, new business models such as sharing rental cars and vacation homes, baggage handling and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The potential of blockchain in the travel industry is not lost on its participants, which explains why Camino Network has been able to attract an impressive number of partners. More than 120 of the world&rsquo;s biggest travel brands are backing the project, including Lufthansa, Eurowings, Hahn Air, TUI, DER Touristik, and Sunnycars, to name just a few.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also clear that the travel industry can benefit from having its very own blockchain. Rather than building on a global network like Ethereum, which is known for its high gas fees and sometimes slow transactions, brands will be able to leverage a purpose-built infrastructure that&rsquo;s designed to scale as they grow. What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s controlled by travel industry participants themselves, with each validator gaining equal voting rights.</p>
<p>Camino Network is ready for prime time, having been up and running in testnet since the second quarter of last year. Its code and smart contract components have been fully audited by Hexens, and a bug bounty program has been put in place.</p>
<p>More than 80 travel industry brands have signed up to act as validators for the Camino Network, staking 100,000 CAM for the privilege of doing so. As part of the soft launch, an initial group of validators will test and validate the network before the rest are onboarded in a process that should be complete by next month.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Following on the heels of First Republic Bank, PacWest Bancorp looks to be the next domino to fall. Bitcoin eyes breakout above $30,000.</p>
Banks keep falling
<p>Only a short time after the First Republic Bank failure, the 2nd biggest bank to fall in US history, PacWest Bancorp could be the next bank to stagger into the arms of FDIC receivership.</p>
<p>The usual platitudes and reassurances are issuing from PacWest along the lines that investor deposits are safe. However, PacWest shares have fallen 37% just since First Republic went down.</p>
<p>The price of PacWest was around $30 back in late January, but since then it has fallen to $6.40 today, having fallen as low as $3.05 at yesterday&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>PacWest does not deny that it is in discussions with potential buyers. In the same vein First Republic was purchased by JP Morgan for pennies on the dollar - a sign of the growing monopolisation of the banking industry.</p>
<p>Western Alliance is yet another regional bank that is concerning investors, although the bank has maintained that it has not experienced any unusual deposit outflows recently.</p>
<p>According to billionaire investor and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, the regional banks are unable to survive bad data or bad news, while the GSIBs (Global Systemically Important Banks) are fine because the Federal Reserve will backstop them.</p>
Bitcoin oblivious to banking woes
<p>All the while, Bitcoin is maintaining its strong uptrend and looks as though it could break out above the $30,000 resistance as soon as this week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that the Biden Administration is cracking down on Bitcoin and crypto. As more banks fail, and those that remain offer little or no benefit to their depositors, the continual rise of Bitcoin is likely to impel&nbsp; many retail investors into withdrawing at least some of their deposits and putting them into the obvious Bitcoin hedge.</p>
<p>Mainstream media carries the government and central bank narrative to the people, and therefore the vast majority of retail are scared of crypto, and are also taken in by government assurances that everything is fine in the monetary system, even though it's patently obvious that it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The current banking crisis is likely to be the worst in history. If the average person passively ignores this, the repercussions for them could possibly be life changing.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday afternoon, the highly anticipated crvUSD stablecoin was finally deployed on the Ethereum mainnet.</p>
crvUSD Live On ETH Mainnet&nbsp;
<p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, Curve Finance, has finally launched its much-awaited native stablecoin on the Etheruem mainnet. The token crvUSD is a collateralized-debt-position (CDP) stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. The launch of the stablecoin token has had a direct positive impact on the protocol&rsquo;s governance token. CRV has had a 7% hike and has reached the price tag of $0.97 in just a day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The news was first hinted at when blockchain data firm Etherscan revealed that a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain had minted a total of $20 million worth of crvUSD tokens across five transactions in under five minutes. The Curve.Fi Team wallet soon after created a $1 million crvUSD loan using $1.8 million of frxETH, which in turn was issued by another DeFi protocol Frax Finance.&nbsp;</p>
Team Announces Deployment, Addresses Community Concerns
<p>The official confirmation of the matter happened later on Twitter, where the Curve team tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As many figured - deployment of crvUSD smart contracts has happened! This is not finalized yet because UI also needs to be deployed. Stay tuned!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The team also conducted a peer review of the deployed crvUSD tokens after a community member pointed out that veCRV was receiving zero fees. The team conducted a peer review, which unveiled an error in the deployment script. The team was transparent about this error on Twitter, even thanking the community member who had first pointed out the bug and decided to redeploy the crvUSD tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The community wanted more information about the deployed tokens, mainly how many of them were in circulation. However, the Curve.Fi team avoided answering that question directly, claiming that the total supply of crvUSD also included tokens that have not been released yet.&nbsp;</p>
The Long-Awaited Stablecoin
<p>The public has been waiting a long time for the protocol&rsquo;s native stablecoin as it is one of the largest decentralized marketplaces, which focuses primarily on stablecoins. The company had announced its decision to develop its own dollar-pegged stablecoin last year, and ever since, the community has been anticipating the crvUSD. However, the stablecoin has not yet been integrated into the protocol&rsquo;s user interface. As a result, the general public will not be able to access it just yet. According to someone in the know, the public release of the crvUSD stablecoin is &ldquo;waiting on the front end,&rdquo; which they said would happen soon.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Layer-1 blockchain Sui has announced the launch of its mainnet on Wednesday as it gears up to take on other decentralized finance (DeFi) heavyweights such as Aptos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sui network was developed by Mysten Labs, founded by ex-Meta executives, and uses the Rust-based Move programming language.&nbsp;</p>
Sui Mainnet Goes Live&nbsp;
<p>The launch of the high-performance blockchain comes after months of testing, with the team announcing the launch through a press release. The press release stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sui Foundation announced today that Sui Mainnet is now live. Sui is a first-of-its-kind Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract platform designed from the bottom up to make digital asset ownership fast, private, secure, and accessible to everyone. The Sui Foundation is the independent organization whose mission is to support the advancement of the Sui ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The press release states that Sui offers several advantages over current blockchains, with its object-centric model enabling parallel transactions, sub-second finality, and rich on-chain assets. Thanks to horizontally scalable processing and storage, Sui is able to support a vast array of applications at low costs and unrivaled speeds. At the time of launch, transaction speeds on the network were around four transactions per second. However, this figure kept increasing during the day, eventually reaching 18 transactions per second. In comparison, Aptos offers speeds of around 9 transactions per second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the network did face some issues, especially on the decentralization front. Currently, the Sui network has over 2100 nodes. However, most of these nodes are located in Germany and the United States, with a few others located in Asia and Eastern Europe. However, the network is still in its infancy, and validators may eventually become more evenly distributed.&nbsp;</p>
A Highly Scalable Blockchain&nbsp;
<p>The Sui network and blockchain were developed by Mysten Labs, founded by ex-meta employees and executives. Back in September 2022, Mysten Labs raised $300 million in a series B funding round, putting the project&rsquo;s valuation at $300 million. The Sui blockchain has been designed to be highly scalable. Unlike current blockchains that rely on Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, Sui utilizes a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) consensus mechanism. In this type of consensus mechanism, network users can elect and vote on delegates to confirm the next block.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sui has been created on Move. Move is a Rust-based programming language originally designed at Meta. However, Meta subsequently shuttered its Diem project. The team at Sui has stated that over 200 decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from gaming and social media to NFTs and DeFi, were waiting in the wings to go live on the network. Furthermore, they added that another 100 projects were ready to build on the new network.</p>
The SUI Token&nbsp;
<p>The protocol&rsquo;s native token, SUI, has already been listed on several major cryptocurrency exchanges right after the platform&rsquo;s mainnet launch. Crypto exchanges that have listed the token include ByBit, Binance, KuCoin, and OKX. The token opened at a price of $2.16. However, it quickly experienced a staggering 40% drop from its initial launch price. According to data from CoinGecko, the token is currently trading at $1.37. However, this figure represents an astronomical increase from its pre-sale price of $0.03 and its public sale price of $0.10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in April, Sui disappointed many community members after it revealed that it would not be conducting an airdrop. Instead, it stated that the SUI token would be available to community members at a price of 3 cents per token during an early sale.</p>

Unlike current blockchains that rely on Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, Sui utilizes a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) consensus mechanism. In this type of consensus mechanism, network users can elect and vote on delegates to confirm the next block.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sui has been created on Move. Move is a Rust-based programming language originally designed at Meta. However, Meta subsequently shuttered its Diem project. The team at Sui has stated that over 200 decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from gaming and social media to NFTs and DeFi, were waiting in the wings to go live on the network. Furthermore, they added that another 100 projects were ready to build on the new network.</p>
The SUI Token&nbsp;
<p>The protocol&rsquo;s native token, SUI, has already been listed on several major cryptocurrency exchanges right after the platform&rsquo;s mainnet launch. Crypto exchanges that have listed the token include ByBit, Binance, KuCoin, and OKX. The token opened at a price of $2.16. However, it quickly experienced a staggering 40% drop from its initial launch price. According to data from CoinGecko, the token is currently trading at $1.37. However, this figure represents an astronomical increase from its pre-sale price of $0.03 and its public sale price of $0.10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in April, Sui disappointed many community members after it revealed that it would not be conducting an airdrop. Instead, it stated that the SUI token would be available to community members at a price of 3 cents per token during an early sale.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The White House recently put out a blog post seeking to justify 30% electricity taxes to be levied on crypto miners.&nbsp;</p>
Punishing crypto miners
<p>In line with the suppressive US government measures already applied to the cryptocurrency industry, the White House has now proposed what it calls the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax, to be included in the new budget for this year.</p>
<p>In a blog post on the White House government website, it was laid out how the tax would be a punitive measure that would oblige crypto miners to &ldquo;pay the full cost they impose on others&rdquo;, and this cost was perceived to be more environmental pollution, higher energy prices, and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
High energy use?
<p>The White House blog post estimated that the energy used by the 34 biggest crypto mining operations used the same energy as 3 million residential homes that surround them.</p>
<p>Also, the electricity usage of crypto miners was said to be similarly equivalent to that of all home computers or the total of all lighting for homes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Source: Whitehouse.gov</p>
<p>The blog post made sure to tug at the heartstrings of the US people by suggesting that the energy consumption of crypto miners led to pollution that was felt disproportionately by &ldquo;low-income neighbourhoods, and communities of colour&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The blog post also addressed the concern that the crypto mining industry would just move offshore, by stating that other countries, including China, had also restricted crypto mining.</p>
Opinion
<p>Huge strides have been made in the crypto mining industry in the switch to alternative and greener forms of energy. However, even if crypto mining were actually more energy consuming, and dirtier, it would still be worth the price to pay in order to have the likes of Bitcoin, which is the people&rsquo;s currency, and not able to be manipulated by governments or banks.</p>
<p>The US government is putting out a narrative that cryptocurrencies are bad. Why? The current monetary system is run by the central banks. It is becoming obsolete, the banks are failing, and inflation is rife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the people figure out that there is a way to escape all of this, there will be huge inflows into the likes of Bitcoin, and fiat currencies will speed towards zero value at an even faster rate than they are already doing.</p>
<p>Crypto mining energy consumption will decrease as technology evolves. However, the Federal Reserve and other central banks will continue to try and print their way out of debt, at massive life-changing cost to the same poor communities mentioned in the White House blog post. Educating oneself on the issues is the only way to arrive at this conclusion.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A crypto educational project, XIRTAM, recently conducted a rug pull, with the project team pulling nearly 2000 ETH out of the raised funds on the 3rd of May.&nbsp;</p>
The XIRTAM Rug Pull
<p>Details about the rug pull were shared by crypto journalist Wu Blockchain, who shared details on their Twitter handle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;XIRTAM rug pulled, an educational project that raised 2,000 ETH recently. The project was previously funded by CultDAO. AscendEX exchange also announced the launch of XIRTAM spot trading. Binance has frozen the funds transferred to Binance by the project. Investors need to be careful about meme coin security.&rdquo;</p>

<p>XIRTAM is a reputation-building platform that does not require KYC. Instead, the platform advocates users building their digital reputation through the XIRTAM ecosystem in an anonymous and decentralized manner. As users build their reputation, they become eligible to earn rewards by participating in activities in the XIRTAM ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Funds Frozen&nbsp;
<p>After the project team orchestrated the rug pull, they did not take the typical route of adding the funds to a crypto-mixing service. Instead, the team deposited the rug pull funds directly on Binance. Exasperated users reached out to Binance, with the crypto exchange responding to appeals from XIRTAM users, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far, we have received multiple feedbacks on the XIRTAM incident. We understand the seriousness of this issue and have launched an investigation into the incident as soon as possible. Currently, the funds transferred to the Binance account address suspected of fraud have been frozen. If necessary, we will fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in the investigation. In the meantime, we strongly recommend that you contact the law enforcement agency in your jurisdiction and report this incident, as they can handle such situations and provide any additional assistance that may be needed.&rdquo;</p>

Cult DAO Clarifies Position&nbsp;
<p>Cult DAO previously funded XIRTAM, while AscendEX had also announced the launch of XIRTAM spot trading services. In an update shared by Cult DAO, the protocol stated that it was extremely disappointed with how the XIRTAM team had conducted its affairs. Cult DAO stated that it had made a 13 ETH investment into the project. Cult DAO stated that it believed the project to be genuine, with the team behind the project answering all questions and clarifications about the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cult DAO also stated that the decision to invest in XIRTAM was made after the proposal received a whopping 84% votes in favor. The protocol added that XIRTAM overpromised and underdelivered, having liquidity of 24 ETH at the time of launch, despite its valuation being around $40 million. With the founding team maintaining radio silence, Cult DAO faces a dilemma about whether it should sell off its investment in the protocol or wait until the issues are addressed.&nbsp;</p>
Alarm Bells Around Meme Coins&nbsp;
<p>XIRTAM is the latest example of the hype the digital currency ecosystem is facing when it comes to new, unproven, and highly volatile meme coins. With meme coins such as PEPE and several others driving the surge, user interest is at an all-time high. Meme coins do hold promise, giving early investors staggering profits. However, most end up buying when the token price is high and end up making losses when the eventual price correction sets in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the popularity of meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) indicates that the meme coin hype is not going away anytime soon. However, crypto experts have appealed to users to exercise caution when dealing with newer, unproven meme coins, lest they also orchestrate a rug pull.&nbsp;</p>
