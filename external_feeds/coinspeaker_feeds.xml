<p>The price of Bitcoin is struggling to maintain momentum and has succumbed to several macroeconomic factors over the last week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-price-oversold-level/">Bitcoin Price Falls 11% while Key Indicator States BTC Is at Most Oversold Level since Covid 2020 Crash</a></p>
<p>The price of Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) has fallen by more than 11% over the last 7 days as the king coin struggles to maintain the $26,000 level. Unfortunately, a key indicator suggests a continuous bearish trend for the king coin.</p>
<p>The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) for the world’s largest cryptocurrency has fallen below 30, signifying that Bitcoin is oversold. The RSI ranges between 0 and 100 and reflects an asset’s price movement compared to the price trajectory over a specified period. The 14-day period used here revealed Bitcoin’s RSI is at its lowest level since March 2020 when the Covid pandemic caused a crash.</p>
<p>Generally, an RSI score above 70 shows an asset is in overbought territory, while one below 30 indicates oversold conditions. However, the RSI levels may not necessarily indicate any projections of price swings in the near future as many sometimes believe. According to FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich, Bitcoin’s current trajectory is bearish. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Bitcoin closed the [last] week with a notable drop below its 200-week and 200-day moving averages, signaling a shift to a bearish trend. From current levels near $26,000, the following area of decline appears to be the last pivot area at $24,700.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Factors Causing the Plunge in Bitcoin Price</h2>
<p>Reports from Glassnode and Coinshares suggest a reason for the plunge in Bitcoin’s value. According to these firms, the past week recorded reduced interest from the crypto market. Most major exchanges saw fallen trading volumes suggesting that investors are holding off on spending more money purchasing Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Coinshares also notes that the price of Bitcoin is not swinging as much as it used to. The firm’s head of research, James Butterfill, <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/why-bitcoin-just-plummeted-8394421093da?gi=1b99e97bda02" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">suggests</a> that this occurrence could end in a sharp rise or plunge in the price of the king coin:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In recent months, volatility has decreased, reaching levels comparable to the all-time lows observed at the start of the year. Historically, such levels have often marked turning points for significant price swings, either upward or downward.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There is also the possibility that the SEC’s targeted action against major crypto exchanges in the US is causing problems for Bitcoin. Another factor is a gradual but continued depreciation in the dollar’s strength. This has also affected interest in USD stablecoins, with these assets losing market share from 70% to 50%.</p>
<p>The market also seems to be waiting for the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>’s decision on a spot Bitcoin ETF. While this is unlikely, based on precedence, it is clear that investors always pay close attention to the regulatory landscape, which usually informs their decisions.</p>
<p>In addition to these problems, there are also a few concerns about the economic situation in China. For instance, China’s property and real estate industry is experiencing debt problems, with developers increasingly defaulting on payments. While this may not completely tank the country’s economy, it is a serious enough situation that could lead to a further meltdown. However, Bitcoin may benefit from this plunge if enough people consider it a strong enough hedge.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/baidu-2023-q2-revenue/">Baidu Records 15% Growth in Q2 2023 Revenue, CEO Attributes Increase to Advertising</a></p>
<p>Popular China&#8217;s tech company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/baidu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baidu</a> has reported a significant increase in its Q2 2023 revenue. A report filed on Tuesday showed that the company recorded a 15% increase in its year-on-year revenue. Consequently, its traded shares surged by more than 4% in pre-marketing trading.</p>
<p>According to Refinitiv data, the Q2 2023 revenue growth represents the fastest quarterly year-on-year growth pace Baidu has recorded over the past two years. The data also estimated that Baidu would record $4.5 billion in revenue last quarter. Surprisingly, the tech company did better than expected, pulling in $4.7 billion instead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this significant rise in the Q2 revenue is influenced by a persistent rise in its advertising engagements. The firm recorded a huge upsurge in advertising. Further insights into the financial report also showed that the online marketing revenue of Baidu went up by 15% to about $2.6 billion in the second quarter of the year. Also, the non-online market revenue saw a 12% rise, amounting to $932 million.</p>
<h2>Baidu CEO Gives Details about Factors Driving Baidu’s Growth in 2023</h2>
<p>The CEO and co-founder of Baidu, Robin Li, emphasized how the growth in advertising contributed to the increase in the tech company&#8217;s revenue. In a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baidu-announces-second-quarter-2023-results-301906547.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">release</a>, Robin Li disclosed that Baidu saw accelerated revenue and profit growth in the Q2 of 2023 due to the good performance of the online marketing business and operating leverage.</p>
<p>Li added that generative AI and large language models have enormous influence across different sectors, stressing that the situation has presented a momentous market opportunity for Baidu. This submission undoubtedly reflects Baidu’s commitment to the AI market.</p>
<p>In recent months, the tech company has made noticeable progress with its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/baidu-ernie-3-5-chatgpt-gpt-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ernie bot</a>, a Chinese-language ChatGPT alternative. Recall that Baidu launched the project in March 2023 in response to the regulatory constraints placed on ChatGPT in China. Its strong attention to AI birthed the launch of five Ernie bot plugins. Baidu is aiming to lead the emerging AI landscape and has kept the ball rolling with the launch of its new AI-powered assistant last week. The AI assistant solution is designed to help users book meetings, tickets, and hotels.</p>
<p>Since the relaxation of the COVID-19 restrictions, companies have been pumping heavily into virtual advertising. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the investment proceeds have tremendously impacted Baidu in 2023 Q2. Similarly, its engagements in the evolving AI sector have also been instrumental.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-salary-expectations-heights/">US Salary Expectations Reach New Heights, Raising Inflation Concerns</a></p>
<p>A recent employment survey conducted by the New York Federal Reserve has revealed an astonishing surge in US salary expectations for new job opportunities, raising red flags about potential inflationary pressures within the labor market.</p>
<p>According to the survey <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2023/20230821" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">released</a> on August 21, the minimum wage respondents are willing to accept for new employment has surged to $78,645 for the quarter ending July, marking a substantial escalation from $72,873 in the same month in 2022.</p>
<p>The new salary expectation also showed an even larger leap from the pre-pandemic figure of $62,194 in July 2019. Notably, this surge is most pronounced among individuals aged 45 and above, with men seeking an average of $91,048 while women expressed an average expectation of $66,068.</p>
<h2>A Gap between US Salary Expectations and Reality</h2>
<p>Wage growth has become a focal point in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s efforts to curb inflation. Fed Chairman <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jerome-powell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerome Powell</a> emphasized that controlling wage inflation is pivotal to achieving the targeted 2% inflation rate. However, with July&#8217;s consumer price index rising to 3.2% from the previous month&#8217;s 3%, concerns over inflation&#8217;s impact on the economy are growing.</p>
<p>The New York Federal Reserve survey highlights a notable disparity between the ambitious salary expectations of $78,645 and the actual average annual earnings of $69,475 over the past four months. Despite this difference, employees are faring considerably better than the previous year&#8217;s average of $60,764.</p>
<p>Economists posit that as businesses&#8217; expenses increase due to higher wages, they often respond by raising prices. This price increase, in turn, prompts workers to demand higher salaries to maintain their spending power, thus fueling a &#8220;wage-price spiral&#8221;.</p>
<p>While wage growth is imperative, Powell emphasized that it must be maintained at levels consistent with the desired 2% inflation rate.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/21/american-workers-are-demanding-almost-80000-a-year-to-take-a-new-job.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CNBC</a>, the survey aligns with the observations of the Atlanta Fed&#8217;s wage growth tracker, which reports a 6% annual increase in wages across various sectors.</p>
<p>However, individuals switching jobs are experiencing even higher gains of 7%. In response, employers have been striving to keep pace with these demands, leading to a 14% surge in the average full-time job offers, now at $69,475.</p>
<p>The steep rise in wage expectations intensifies concerns about inflation, prompting speculation about the Federal Reserve&#8217;s future policy actions. Signals of a tight labor market bolster the likelihood of prolonged higher interest rates. The July meeting minutes indicate that wage growth remains above levels aligned with the 2% inflation target.</p>
<h2>Mixed Labor Market Indicators</h2>
<p>Aside from wage-related data, the survey also presents mixed patterns in the labor market. Job seekers have declined to 19.4% from the previous year&#8217;s 24.7%, and job openings also fell by 738,000 to 9.58 million.</p>
<p>The likelihood of changing jobs and expectations of being offered new positions have also dipped, reflecting a potential cooling trend. Additionally, respondents foreseeing unemployment increased to 3.9%, the highest level since March 2020.</p>
<p>As wage expectations surge to unprecedented heights, economists and policymakers keep a vigilant eye on the broader implications for inflation and monetary policy. The data underscores the delicate balance between promoting wage growth and maintaining price stability in a dynamic economic landscape.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/european-stock-markets-positive-start/">European Stock Markets Show Cautious Gains after Positive Weekly Start</a></p>
<p>European stock markets displayed a cautious optimism earlier today, building on modest gains that marked the beginning of the trading week.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/european-markets-open-to-close-treasury-yields-ftse-100-dax.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, the Stoxx 600 index (INDEXSTOXX: SXXP), a broad measure of European stock performance, advanced 0.68% in early trade. While not a spectacular surge, this upward movement indicates a hopeful sentiment among investors, underpinned by a strong showing across most sectors.</p>
<p>The positive trend was widespread across sectors, with the notable exception of oil and gas which experienced a minor dip of 0.1%. However, it was the technology sector that truly stole the spotlight, surging ahead with a remarkable gain of 1.78%.</p>
<h2>Ubisoft’s Outstanding Leap</h2>
<p>A notable highlight in the recent European stock market activity was the 6% rise in shares of French game publisher Ubisoft Entertainment SA (EPA: UBI). This significant jump was primarily attributed to an <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microsoft-agreement-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> from <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Corp</a> (NASDAQ: MSFT) regarding its strategic plans in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Microsoft revealed its intention to divest several gaming rights to Ubisoft Entertainment as part of a novel deal aimed at securing regulatory approval for its impending takeover of gaming giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activision Blizzard Inc</a> (NASDAQ: ATVI).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the global financial landscape experienced a notable shift during overnight trade as bond selling drove the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note yield to levels last seen in 2007. In parallel, the 30-year yield reached its highest point since 2011.</p>
<p>This surge in bond yields has sparked discussions about its potential ramifications for equity markets. Traditionally, higher bond yields are accompanied by lower stock prices, and market experts are closely observing the developing situation to gauge its impact on investor sentiment and trading strategies.</p>
<p>Rupert Thompson, Chief Economist at Kingswood Group, highlighted the potential risk that elevated bond yields pose to equities in the coming months. Thompson stated his thoughts on the situation, stating that the increasing yield on cash and short-term bonds (both about 5%) has created fair competition for equities.</p>
<p>Thompson further explained that the movements in the bond market reflect a market pushback on expectations for substantial Federal Reserve rate cuts in the upcoming year.</p>
<h2>European Natural Gas Prices Experiences Surge</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, investors are closely eyeing the natural gas market, where prices experienced a significant surge on Monday. The cause of this price increase is the looming threat of strike action in Australia, which has the potential to disrupt a substantial portion of the world&#8217;s Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) flows.</p>
<p>Reports suggest that up to 10% of global LNG flows could be affected if the strike were to take place. However, Meg O’Neill, CEO of Woodside Energy, shared insights with CNBC, expressing a cautiously optimistic view that substantial industrial action might be avoided.</p>
<p>Geopolitical developments are also capturing the attention of investors as the leaders of Brazil, Russia, China, India, and South Africa convene in Johannesburg for the BRICS summit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/komainu-nomura-coinshares-dubai/">Komainu, Nomura&#8217;s Crypto Joint Venture with Coinshares and Ledger, Wins Dubai License</a></p>
<p>Komainu, a crypto joint venture between Nomura, CoinShares and Ledger, has recently secured a full operating license from Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA). Last year in November 2022, the joint venture only secured a temporary MVP license from VARA.</p>
<p>The full license unlocks more opportunities for Komainu to expand its crypto services. As a result, Komainu will be able to offer its full suite of custody services, including collateral management and institutional staking via its Komainu Connect platform to clients in the Emirate.</p>
<p>The United Arab Emirates has embraced cryptocurrency innovations, facilitated by federal grants and crypto-friendly regulations designed to support entrepreneurs. Acquiring a VARA license in Dubai follows a three-stage procedure, requiring crypto exchanges to secure provisional approval, an MVP license for a minimal viable product, and ultimately a full market product license.</p>
<p>Among the notable crypto exchanges that have previously attained similar operational status are <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, Bybit, Laser Digital Middle East, BitOasis (currently suspended), OKX, Crypto.com, FTX (license revoked), and Huobi.</p>
<p>Komainu is also under the regulatory oversight of the Jersey Financial Services Commission and maintains its headquarters in Jersey. Speaking on the development, Sebastian Widmann, Head of Strategy at Komainu, <a href="https://financefeeds.com/komainu-secures-vasp-license-from-dubais-vara/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see tremendous opportunities to scale our business here amid a significant boom in assets driven by fund formation and exchange launches. Dubai has a vibrant digital asset ecosystem and impressive talent pool, and we are proud to contribute to the growth of this innovative financial hub. Our presence and desirable regulatory status in the region marks another differentiator for us as we execute the next phase of our business.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>More About Komainu</h2>
<p>Introduced in June 2020, Komainu presently oversees the safekeeping of assets for various entities, including exchanges, financial institutions, asset managers, corporations, and governmental agencies.</p>
<p>A notable collaborator of Komainu is the digital Prime Brokerage GCEX. In February 2023, GCEX partnered with Komainu to enhance its selection of regulated custodians for its institutional and professional clientele, amplifying the range of trusted custodial services available.</p>

<p>Popular K-pop girl group Blackpink is teaming up with Roblox, the online gaming platform, to create a unique experience for their fans. The group unveiled plans to launch the Blackpink Palace, a virtual space where fans can explore and interact with scenes from Blackpink&#8217;s iconic music videos and other content.</p>
<p>British Metaverse studio Karta built Blackpink Palace in conjunction with YG Plus. The duo will ensure the fans who visit the place can enjoy new content throughout the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look forward to welcoming fans from all over the world to a beautiful virtual palace where they can party, connect, and experience everything Blackpink,&#8221; said Hyojung Lee, Head of IPX Division at YG Plus, in a statement.</p>
<h2>About the Blackpink Palace</h2>
<p>The Blackpink Palace provides a new way for Blackpink fans (BLINKS) to interact with their favorite band. It features caverns where BLINKS can mine in-game currency by smashing crystals with a replica of Blackpink&#8217;s light stick. These can be used to decorate and host Blackpink-themed parties for friends.</p>
<p>Also, fans will be able to take pictures with the in-game avatars. Likewise, the fans will also be able to purchase the band&#8217;s Pink Venom outfits and emotes for their avatars.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the palace will be open for exploration from August 25. Fans who access the virtual space within 24 hours of launch will receive a special badge that can be displayed on their Roblox profiles.</p>
<h2>K-Pop Groups See Potential in Virtual Communities</h2>
<p>In March 2023, Blackpink became <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/blackpink-most-streamed-girl-group-on-spotify/#:~:text=BLACKPINK%20has%20officially%20become%20the,according%20to%20Guinness%20World%20Records." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the most streamed girl group on Spotify</a>, boasting over 8.8 billion streams on the service. Earlier in 2019, the group became the first K-pop group to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/blackpink-historic-headliner-coachella-2023-recap-1235302813/#:~:text=In%202016%20BLACKPINK%20debuted.,act%20to%20headline%20the%20festival." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">perform at Coachella</a>. Despite these firsts, they are not the first K-pop group to host an interactive hub for its fans on Roblox.</p>
<p>Last year, K-pop stars Stray Kids and Sunmi launched Spotify’s Roblox Island with meet-and-greet events and virtual merch. More recently, NCT 127 and Twice opened NCT 127 World and Twice Square respectively on Roblox.</p>
<p>Already, Twice Square has had 60 million visits. Given Blackpink’s fan base (over 2.6 million subscribers on YouTube), the group may quickly become an even bigger sensation. Undoubtedly, there is a huge potential for virtual fan communities on Roblox. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/youtube-universal-music-ai/">YouTube Partners with Universal Music Group for AI Music Incubator</a></p>
<p>Universal Music Group has partnered with video streaming platform YouTube to launch the YouTube Music AI incubator, a program aimed at fostering creative expression while protecting the interests of artists on the platform.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/youtube-announces-ai-music-principles-and-launches-youtube-music-ai-incubator-with-artists-songwriters-and-producers-from-universal-music-group-301905605.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from Universal Music dated August 21, the incubator was launched with artists, songwriters, and producers from its ranks taking part. The multi-genre list includes Anitta, Björn Ulvaeus, d4vd, Don Was, Juanes, Louis Bell, Max Richter, Rodney Jerkins, Rosanne Cash, Ryan Tedder, Yo Gotti, and the Estate of Frank Sinatra.</p>
<p>YouTube CEO Neal Mohan outlined the platform’s AI music principles and shared his vision for enhanced creative expression in a safe environment. The principles, in summary, acknowledge the emergence of AI, a technology that the platform believes is “ushering in a new age of creative expression” but must be embraced responsibly. They also stress the need for appropriate protections and opportunities for members of the music industry to balance creativity and protection. YouTube also plans to invest in trust and safety and has also pledged to build on existing trust and safety policies to ensure that viewers and creators are protected even as the use of AI continues to grow.</p>
<p>Universal Music Group Chairman and CEO Sir Lucian Grainge, who played a key part in shaping the principles, stated that the music industry’s best bet for success in the face of AI was an artist-centric approach to generative AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our challenge and opportunity as an industry is to establish effective tools, incentives and rewards – as well as rules of the road – that enable us to limit AI&#8217;s potential downside while promoting its promising upside. If we strike the right balance, I believe AI will amplify human imagination and enrich musical creativity in extraordinary new ways,&#8221; the CEO commented.</p>
<p>He also went on to address concerns that the technology would negatively impact the industry:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Artificial Intelligence is built to empower human creativity, and not the other way around.  AI will never replace human creativity because it will always lack the essential spark that drives the most talented artists to do their best work, which is intention. From Mozart to The Beatles to Taylor Swift, genius is never random.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With the increased use of AI in the creative process in various forms of art, it goes without saying that current intellectual property and copyright concepts will need to be revised. Christian Mammen, partner and chair of Womble Bond Dickinson&#8217;s US Intellectual Property Litigation Group <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/commercial-payments/2023/automation-enhances-ap-ar-workflows-as-cfos-urged-to-embrace-advanced-tech/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that we need a full-blown overhaul of the laws just to accommodate this new technology. But there may be some places where it&#8217;s worth having a conversation about tinkering with the law or modifying the law in certain ways.”</p></blockquote>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/unknown-bitcoin-wallet-holder/">Unknown Bitcoin Wallet Is Third-Largest BTC Holder in World after Collecting More than $3B Worth in Less than 4 Months</a></p>
<p>An unknown <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> wallet has become the world’s third-largest BTC holder in only over three months. Members of the entire crypto community are now curious about who owns the wallet and why they amassed that much Bitcoin in such a short time.</p>
<p>The mysterious wallet began to collect Bitcoin on the 8th of May, according to BitInfoCharts <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/bc1ql49ydapnjafl5t2cp9zqpjwe6pdgmxy98859v2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a>. After collecting Bitcoin for three and a half months, the unknown wallet had received $3.08 billion worth of the king coin, a total of 118,000 BTC.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there are a few theories on how the wallet collected that much Bitcoin. While some suggest that the funds belong to a major crypto exchange moving their money around, others believe that BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), the world’s largest asset manager is the likely owner. According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/crypto_div/status/1693738671046885688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1693738671046885688%7Ctwgr%5E408fad4a5c8bb8a1104c133aa1d38476a301253f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbitcoin-whale-wallet-becomes-third-largest-holder-three-months" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a>, the BlackRock suspicion is because the asset manager filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF almost exactly a month after the first major transaction on the 16th of May.</p>
<p>The unknown wallet is now the third-largest, followed by a Binance cold wallet. According to a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-bitcoin-rich-list-an-in-depth-look-at-the-largest-bitcoin-wallets-in-existence-since-2014/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, Binance also holds the world’s largest Bitcoin wallet and has been in the number 1 position since March 2021. As of June, the wallet held 248,597, 1.28% of Bitcoin’s total supply. However, <a href="https://river.com/learn/who-owns-the-most-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">another report</a> estimates that Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto is the largest holder, with more than 1 million BTC across several thousand addresses. Satoshi’s identity is still unknown.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Movement and Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p>BlackRock surprised both the traditional and crypto industries when the company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submitted</a> an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June. BlackRock applied for the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, naming crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> (NASDAQ: COIN) as the Bitcoin custodian and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bny-mellon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bank of New York Mellon</a> (NYSE: BK) as the custodian for cash.</p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has never approved a spot Bitcoin ETF. However, many believe several factors, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xrp-price-ripple-win-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple’s recent win</a> and the introduction of a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cboe-ark-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bilateral surveillance sharing agreement</a> (SSA), augur well for the crypto industry and the chance of approval. In addition, some analysts believe the SEC may be willing to approve BlackRock, a traditional finance giant, over crypto companies.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is currently trading above $26,000 even though the market is experiencing a widespread sell-off. According to Material Indicators cofounder Keith Alan, Bitcoin’s price may eventually hit $25,000 before an upward rally toward $28,000 or $29,000.</p>
<p>After rising above $27,000 last week, the king coin <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-26k-tests-investor-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit the $26,000 range</a> last Friday. Analysts believe that the plunge came from BTC ETF approval uncertainty and the rise in US interest rates. The 30-year Treasury bond hit 4.42%, the highest point since 2011.</p>
<p>Another factor thought to be affecting Bitcoin is the recent $373 million writedown of SpaceX’s Bitcoin holdings. The company also reportedly sold some of its Bitcoin.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microsoft-agreement-activision-blizzard/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microsoft-agreement-activision-blizzard/">Microsoft Submits Restructured Agreement for Activision Blizzard Acquisition amid Regulatory Challenges</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> has submitted a revised agreement to the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for the acquisition of Activision Blizzard after the initial proposal faced rejection.</p>
<p>In January 2022, Microsoft put forth a proposal to acquire <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activision Blizzard</a> for $69 billion. However, this announcement triggered regulatory moves from authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe, leading to a more complex approval process. Particularly, the UK Competition and Markets Authority declined Microsoft&#8217;s initial takeover proposal, expressing concerns about potential consequences for competitors.</p>
<p>In response to the initial rejection, Microsoft has introduced a new proposal that both companies have mutually accepted. The terms of this agreement have been adjusted to align with the stipulations of the United Kingdom regulatory body.</p>
<p>The CMA is now set to initiate an inquiry into the revised agreement, with the final decision to accept or reject the proposal slated for October 18. However, Brad Smith, Microsoft&#8217;s Vice Chairman and President, anticipates the possibility of concluding the process prior to the 90-day extension. Furthermore, he voiced his confidence in the positive impact that the new proposal could have on gamers and the gaming industry, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/microsoft-submits-new-activision-blizzard-takeover-deal-to-uk.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stating</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;We are convinced that this development holds promise for players, the evolution of the cloud game streaming market, and the overall expansion of our industry. As we continue to navigate the review process with the CMA, our commitment remains steadfast in delivering the remarkable advantages of this acquisition to players, developers, and the industry at large. Today’s development signifies a significant stride towards delivering the joy of gaming to enthusiasts worldwide.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Some Amendments Made in the New Microsoft-Activision Blizzard Agreement</h2>
<p>The revised agreement grants Microsoft a more limited set of privileges. Among the changes is the transfer of cloud streaming rights for all existing and upcoming Activision Blizzard games over the next 15 years to Ubisoft Entertainment. This move enables Ubisoft to explore diverse business models and pricing strategies for its games. In return for these rights, Ubisoft will compensate Microsoft with a one-time payment and other benefits over time.</p>
<p>With this restructured agreement, Microsoft will not have the exclusive right to release Activision Blizzard games on its own Xbox cloud gaming service. Consequently, these games will not be confined to the Microsoft ecosystem and can also be accessible on other gaming platforms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Microsoft won&#8217;t have sole control over how other gaming services can use Activision Blizzard games. This way, the Redmond tech giant won&#8217;t have the power to dictate the terms and conditions for licensing the games to its competitors.</p>
<p>The new agreement is intended to promote fair competition and make sure that Microsoft does not have the power to restrict the availability of these games to its own service or control other gaming platforms using its games.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/snapchat-generative-ai-dreams/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/snapchat-generative-ai-dreams/">Snapchat Dives Deeper into Generative AI with &#8216;Dreams&#8217;</a></p>
<p>After the successful <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/snapchat-launches-a-new-generative-ai-feature-my-ai-snaps-for-paid-subscribers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">launch</a> of My AI chatbot, Snapchat is all set to introduce a brand-new feature known as &#8220;Dreams&#8221;. This upcoming addition takes Snapchat&#8217;s AI game up a notch, allowing users to blend their own imagery with AI-generated landscapes.</p>
<p>Unlike the chatbot, which was recently upgraded to respond to users&#8217; queries using a snap instead of texts, the company&#8217;s new AI endeavor aims to bring out users&#8217; creativity, where you and your friends can be placed in an imaginative background.</p>
<h2>Snapchat Dives Deeper into the World of AI</h2>
<p>According to app researcher and developer Steve Moser, the company has been working on new AI features, allowing users to snap selfies or upload their favorite pictures directly on the platform. The app&#8217;s creative engine comes alive in response, generating innovative images that place them in imagined scenarios.</p>
<p>This idea shares similarities with the functionalities already offered by a range of AI-driven photo applications accessible on the App Store.</p>
<p>Last month, one such app called Remini gained immense popularity on TikTok. Remini took users by storm after discovering they could upload their selfies on the app to generate a collection of polished, professional-grade headshots tailor-made for LinkedIn without needing an expensive professional photoshoot.</p>
<h2>Extraordinary Imaginative Scenes</h2>
<p>However, the company&#8217;s vision for Dreams goes beyond creating professional headshots. According to Steve Moser&#8217;s research, its plan for the product includes using AI-generated self-portraits to put users in extraordinary, imaginative scenes. To achieve this, Snapchat would require clear and unobstructed self-portraits to generate these images effectively.</p>
<p>In addition to immersing in these AI-crafted &#8220;Dreams&#8221;, Snapchat is in the works to introduce another feature &#8220;Dreams with Friends&#8221;. As Steve Moser&#8217;s probing uncovered, this functionality allows users to share the joy of crafting AI-generated &#8220;dream&#8221; images with their pals. He also hinted at the possibility of buying &#8220;Dream Packs&#8221; within the Snapchat app, suggesting that this feature might become a future monetization avenue.</p>
<h2>Snapchat Users Frightened with AI Malfunctionality</h2>
<p>Snapchat&#8217;s impending launch of Dreams follows closely on the heels of a recent incident that left some users baffled and concerned. The unexpected glitch that occurred a few days ago led to an outcry from users who experienced a temporary malfunction of the platform&#8217;s features. Specifically, the company&#8217;s AI assistant posted a live update to its profile last week and abruptly ceased responding to user messages.</p>
<p>The My AI feature, which relies on the widely known AI chatbot tool <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT,</a> is designed to provide recommendations, answer inquiries, and engage in conversations with users. However, the unexpected act of posting a live Story &#8211; a short video showcasing what appeared to be a wall &#8211; caught users off guard.</p>
<p>Usually reserved for human users, this action was a departure from the norm and drew attention for its unusual nature.</p>
<p>Perturbed by the situation, Snapchat users turned to social media platforms to voice their confusion. One user asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Why does My AI display a video of the wall and ceiling in their home as their story? This seems highly unusual and genuinely unsettling.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to the incident, a Snapchat spokesperson clarified that the unexpected behavior was not a deliberate attempt to enhance the realism of its My AI tool. Instead, it was a result of a glitch.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ibm-ceo-impact-ai-jobs/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
