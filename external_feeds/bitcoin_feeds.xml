According to statements from IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, this would avoid the underutilization of CBDCs for domestic purposes.</strong></p>
<h2>IMF Working on CBDC Cross-Border Integration Platform</h2>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is building a solution to integrate and support cross-border payments among central bank digital currencies (CBDC). According to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, this would prevent underutilization of these currencies, expanding their usage to international markets.</p>
<p>At a <a href="https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/1670758550388322306?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conference</a> in Morocco, Georgieva reinforced the need for interoperability. She <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/pzEGgpLpt7E?feature=share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CBDCs should not be fragmented national propositions. To have more efficient and fairer transactions we need systems that connect countries: we need interoperability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Georgieva also remarked on the need for CBDC regulation on a global scale to support this interoperability use case. The failure to reach agreements on this subject would lead to the growth of cryptocurrencies as a substitute for the void created, Georgieva explained.</p>
<p>The official added that 114 central banks were involved in CBDC exploration projects, with ten already arriving at the finish line.</p>
<p>Some CBDC projects are already live. China is already using its CBDC, the e-yuan, to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-pushes-digital-yuan-for-wage-payments-in-changshu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay</a> salaries in some regions of the country, while the Venezuelan petro, a state-issued digital currency, is facing a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-indicate-venezuela-is-preparing-to-liquidate-the-petro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liquidation</a> amidst a cryptocurrency corruption probe, according to recent reports.</p>
<p>Also, the European Central Bank (ECB) is in its final phases of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecbs-panetta-reinforces-digital-euro-focus-on-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deciding</a> on issuing a digital euro that would be focused on providing payment rails to Europeans.</p>

<h2>A Case for CBDCs</h2>
<p>Georgieva <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/06/19/sp061923-md-press-statement-high-level-policy-roundtable-on-central-bank-digital-currencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stressed</a> the benefits that the issuance of CBDCs might bring to countries adopting them, stating that if implemented currently, they might &#8220;help to increase inclusion&#8221; and &#8220;strengthen the resilience and efficiency of payment systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The executive also commented that CBDCs could &#8220;make cross-border payments and remittances cheaper,&#8221; as the cost of transferring money across borders stands at 6.3%, an industry that brings service providers $44 billion annually.</p>
<p>Georgieva, who has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-calls-for-more-crypto-regulation-says-banning-should-be-an-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocated</a> for anti-crypto regulation in the past, established differences between cryptocurrency assets and CBDCs, clarifying that, for her, the latter should be backed by assets. Furthermore, she stated that cryptocurrencies backed by assets could be considered investment opportunities, calling unbacked cryptocurrencies &#8220;speculative investments.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The Risks of De-Risking From China</h2>
<p>The founder of the Schiller Institute, Helga Zepp-LaRouche, expressed concerns about the adverse consequences of Western countries&#8217; efforts to de-risk from China in an interview with Global Times reporter Li Xuanmin, published on Monday. The Schiller Institute is a German-based political and economic think tank with stated members in 50 countries.</p>
<p>“The politicians pushing for ‘de-risking’ don&#8217;t seem to understand what every competent industrialist knows, that it is not possible to instantly replace China&#8217;s trade and investment partnership, since China offers very well-built infrastructure and a qualified labor force, which still has to take years to be built up in other countries,” she explained, cautioning:</p>
<blockquote><p>So the &#8216;de-risking&#8217; policy is prone to hurt its originators more than it could hurt China, as we have seen already with the blowback coming from the sanctioning policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Schiller Institute founder was further asked whether the G7 countries could push their de-risking strategy with China. “The G7 countries will only do so at the expense of their own economies,” she replied, adding: “We have this year the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and there are presently 151 countries and 30 major international organizations who are cooperating with China under the initiative, which has become one of the major locomotives of the world economy.”</p>
<p>She noted: “Extremely belatedly the G7 discovered this at their recent summit in Hiroshima, Japan, and they said: &#8216;Oh, we should talk more to the so-called &#8216;swing&#8217; states, like Brazil, Indonesia, and India.'&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Zepp-LaRouche pointed out that the G7 “obviously overlooked that some of them are already members of the BRICS, and the other has reportedly also applied for membership in the BRICS.” The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. More than 19 countries have either <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">applied</a> to join the economic bloc or have expressed interest in joining.</p>
<p>Zepp-LaRouche concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>The attempt to &#8216;de-risk&#8217; from China will only lead to the self-destruction of the economies of the West, and threatens to lead to the absolute sidelining of the European continent in terms of world history.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the House Financial Services Committee that ceasing trade with China would be &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-yellen-decoupling-from-china-would-be-a-big-mistake/">a big mistake</a>&#8221; for the U.S. However, she emphasized: “De-risk? Yes. Decouple? Absolutely not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zepp-LaRouche argued that &#8220;the &#8216;decoupling&#8217; and the &#8216;de-risking&#8217; push are just the same,” adding: “Behind it is the geopolitical intention to contain China&#8217;s economic rise by cutting it off from certain advanced technologies.” The think tank founder stressed: “But that train has left the station already, given the fact that China is leading the world in terms of numbers of patents, as well as key areas of science and technology, such as 5G technology.”</p>

His recommendations followed a series of enforcement actions by the securities watchdog, which included charging the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase.</strong></p>
<h2>Mark Cuban&#8217;s Suggestions for SEC&#8217;s Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Shark Tank star and the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, has engaged in a lengthy discussion on Twitter about how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could regulate the crypto sector. The discussion followed a series of enforcement actions taken by the SEC against a number of prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, including  and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a>.</p>
<p>Citing how the securities watchdog went after the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase for securities law violations as an example, the billionaire described in a tweet Saturday that the current non-crypto-specific registration process offered by the SEC &#8220;doesn&#8217;t deal with how the token will be traded after the fact.” He suggested:</p>
<blockquote><p>By doing a crypto-specific registration process, the transparency for the enterprise could increase dramatically. They could eliminate anonymity. Require disclosure on how wallets are secured and maintained. What the wallet addresses are. How and where the token will be traded. Etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase and several other crypto firms have insisted that they tried to register with the SEC but were unable to. &#8220;There is no path to ‘come in and register’ — we tried, repeatedly,&#8221; Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-ceo-responds-to-sec-lawsuit-accusing-crypto-exchange-of-securities-law-violations/">stated</a> after the SEC filed charges against his crypto trading platform.</p>
<p>Cuban also responded to a tweet by lawyer John E. Deaton, who described Saturday: &#8220;If you read the Hinman speech still on the SEC website, it states &#8216;strictly speaking, the token — or coin or whatever the digital information packet is called — all by itself is not a security, just as the orange groves in Howey were not.&#8217; Jay Clayton wrote a letter to Ted Budd in 2019 publicly agreeing with Hinman that the investment contract does not &#8216;strictly inhere to the asset&#8217; and it&#8217;s only about how the asset is packaged and offered.&#8221; However, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has said on multiple occasions that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a>, other than bitcoin, are securities.</p>
<h2>Regulating Multi-Function Crypto Tokens</h2>
<p>The Dallas Mavericks owner tweeted on Sunday in reply to Deaton: &#8220;I think the other common element of all the assets mentioned in Howey is that they are single function. There has never been a test of the multi-function utility of a token. When an asset is multi-function, it&#8217;s impossible to determine the intent of the owner, buyer, or seller, which is why the SEC needs to offer a registration process that is specific to crypto tokens and future multi-function digital assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cuban added: &#8220;Thinking more of the need for a different form of registration for multi-function tokens by the SEC, there is a legal precedent. Look at content. There are trademark, copyright, clearance permissions, music licensing for live, music licensing for on-demand or for sale, video licensing rules, public domain, and more. All content is now digital. All will remain digital.” The Shark Tank star opined:</p>

The platform offers the trading of four cryptocurrencies.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>EDX Crypto Exchange Launches</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
EDX Markets announced Tuesday &#x201C;the successful launch of its digital asset market and the completion of an investment round with new equity partners.&#x201D; According to the announcement and the new exchange&#x2019;s website:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Products traded on EDX include bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>), and bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>).</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
EDX offers &#x201C;a unique, non-custodial model designed to mitigate conflicts of interest,&#x201D; the announcement adds. In addition, the platform has &#x201C;introduced a retail-only quote to the crypto markets, allowing participants the benefit of better pricing for retail-originated orders&#x201D; and plans to launch EDX Clearing later this year &#x201C;to settle trades matched on EDX Markets.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The company also recently closed a funding round with the participation of new strategic investors, including Miami International Holdings, DV Crypto, GTS, GSR Markets Ltd., and HRT Technology. The firm&#x2019;s founding investors include Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, Paradigm, Sequoia Capital, and Virtu Financial. Bitcoin.com News first reported Schwab, Citadel, and Fidelity <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/citadel-charles-schwab-fidelity-join-forces-to-build-cryptocurrency-trading-platform/">planning</a> to launch a cryptocurrency trading platform in June last year.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
EDX Markets launched at a time when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on unregistered cryptocurrency trading platforms and securities tokens. The securities regulator has charged the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a> with several securities law violations. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has also stated that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a>, other than bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), are securities.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Supporters of EDX Markets are not the only ones remaining bullish about the U.S. crypto industry despite regulatory uncertainty. Blackrock, the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager, filed to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">launch</a> a bitcoin trust with the SEC last week. This move is widely regarded as an application for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which the SEC has so far rejected all applications for.&#13;<br />

The move comes as the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange takes steps to focus on fewer European markets amid increased scrutiny from regulators and ahead of Europe’s new crypto rules. </strong></p>
<h2>Binance No Longer Authorized to Provide Regulated Activities and Products in the U.K., FCA Says</h2>
<p>Binance’s subsidiary in Britain, Binance Markets Limited (BML), has recently filed a cancellation request for its regulatory authorization. On June 7, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the request was completed on May 30, 2023.</p>
<p>According the FCA’s Financial Services Register, the entity, which was previously authorized by the regulator, “can no longer provide regulated activities and products.” In an <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/consumer-warning-binance-markets-limited-and-binance-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> on its interactions with the company, the Authority stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following the completion of the cancellation of permissions the firm is no longer authorized by the FCA.</p></blockquote>
<p>No other entity in the Binance Group, except Binance Markets Limited, holds any form of authorization or registration to conduct regulated business in the United Kingdom, according to the exchange’s listing on the FCA website.</p>
<p>Even before the cancellation, BML was not operating in the U.K. as on June 25, 2021 the FCA imposed certain requirements which prohibited the company from carrying out any regulated activities without its prior written consent.</p>
<p>At the same time, “the Binance Group appear to be offering U.K. customers a range of products and services via a website, Binance.com,” the Authority remarked in its <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/supervisory-notices/first-supervisory-notice-binance-markets-limited.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supervisory notice</a> two years ago. It has since warned Brits against trading on the exchange.</p>
<h2>Binance’s U.K. Move Coincides With Exit From the Netherlands, Cyprus</h2>
<p>The news of the cancelled license comes when the world’s largest crypto exchange finds itself under increased scrutiny by regulatory bodies in various jurisdictions. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">sued</a> the entities operating its American subsidiary for violating securities laws. Binance US recently avoided the freezing of its assets thanks to a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-cz-agree-to-repatriate-us-customer-assets-sec-secures-court-order/">deal</a> with the SEC.</p>
<p>In Europe, Binance has been taking steps to reduce its footprint in terms of maintaining a number of subsidiaries seeking regulated status in multiple jurisdictions, ahead of the implementation of the European Union’s newly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-parliament-greenlights-markets-in-crypto-assets-law-tracing-rules/">adopted</a> Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation. The exchange said it intends to focus on some regulated units in EU countries such those in France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>Last week,  announced it’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-pulls-out-of-netherlands-seeks-to-deregister-cyprus-unit/">exiting</a> the Dutch market as it has been unable to register as a crypto service provider. It had been fined by the central bank of the Netherlands for operating without registration. Earlier, Binance’s entity in Cyprus applied to be removed from the country’s register of digital asset service providers.</p>

Moreover, the number of individual buyers purchasing NFTs in the past seven days has jumped 95.20%, reaching a total of 664,096 buyers.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>This Week&#x2019;s NFT Sales See a Modest Rise of More Than 11%, Bitcoin-NFTs Still Hold Second Position</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
According to <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">data</a> from cryptoslam.io on June 20, 2023, the past week has seen a modest increase in NFT sales, with a recorded total of just over $146 million. This marks an approximate rise of 11.60% compared to the previous seven days.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite a slight dip of 1.99% in the number of NFT transactions, which amounted to 2,271,293 last week, there has been a surge of over 95% in the number of NFT buyers. Statistics show approximately 664,096 buyers have been recorded in the past seven days.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Out of the total NFT sales amounting to $146 million, a significant portion of $85.43 million was attributed to ETH-based NFTs, while $21.38 million came from BTC-centric NFTs. It is worth noting that Bitcoin-based NFTs have consistently maintained their second position among blockchains in terms of sales for several consecutive weeks.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Notably, ETH-based NFT sales experienced a spike of 18.11% within a week, whereas BTC-based NFT sales saw a jump of 10.84% compared to the previous week. Rounding out the top five blockchains for weekly NFT sales, we have Solana, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain, and Mythos following behind <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This week, the leading position for NFT sales belongs to the collection called <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/uncategorized-ordinals">Uncategorized ordinals</a>, which amassed $12.18 million in sales. Following closely behind is the <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/the-grails-ii">Grails II</a> collection sold by the luxury auction house <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sothebys-to-auction-3acs-nft-collection-including-larva-labs-zombie-punk-and-dmitri-cherniaks-golden-goose/">Sotheby&#x2019;s</a>, which generated approximately $7.67 million in sales.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

The British-American ex-kickboxer, who gained a significant online presence, was charged with grave offenses of human trafficking and rape on December 29, 2022. Despite the charges, Tate vehemently denies all accusations leveled against him and his associates.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Luxury Cars, Watches, and Bitcoin: Prosecutors Target Andrew Tate&#x2019;s Assets in Ongoing Legal Battle</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
According to a <a href="https://www.diicot.ro/mass-media/4082-comunicat-de-presa-2-20-06-2023">press release</a> issued by Romania&#x2019;s Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism on June 20, 2023, Andrew Tate, along with three co-defendants, has officially been indicted.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Tate, a polarizing personality recognized as a former world kickboxing champion, garnered attention as a prominent social media influencer on platforms like Twitter and Tiktok.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
His involvement in a high-profile case emerged in December 2022 when he was apprehended as a suspect in a complex legal matter involving human trafficking and rape. The charges against him also encompassed the accusation of leading an organized crime group.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On April 3, 2023, Andrew Tate and his cohorts were released from incarceration and placed under house arrest. Presently, Romanian prosecutors have formally levied charges against Tate, accusing him of &#x201C;committing the crimes of constituting an organized criminal group, [and] human trafficking.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to the allegations, Tate and his associates are purported to have deceitfully lured women into the sex trade, operating not only within Romania but also extending their activities to other nations.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The prosecutors are seeking the court&#x2019;s authorization to confiscate Andrew Tate&#x2019;s stash of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, estimated to be approximately 21.080 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, valued at just over $563,000 based on current exchange rates.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In addition to the crypto assets, law enforcement aims to seize a considerable number of luxury automobiles and watches, four of Tate&#x2019;s operating companies, and multiple caches of cash consisting of U.S. dollars, European euros, and British pounds.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Furthermore, the prosecutors requested that Tate and his enterprise contribute upfront to cover some of the legal expenses. As part of the ongoing legal proceedings within the Bucharest court, prosecutors strongly advised that Tate and his associates remain under house arrest.&#13;<br />

CME&#8217;s Fedwatch tool indicated on Tuesday that market predictions imply a 25bps increase during the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting set for July 25 and 26.</strong></p>
<h2>Federal Reserve Pauses, but 2 Rate Hikes Loom, 76.9% Probability of a 25bps Increase in July</h2>
<p>Consequent to ten uninterrupted rate hikes since March 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">halt in June</a> but acknowledged that additional increases were anticipated in 2023. Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that &#8220;nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year.&#8221; Currently, the federal funds rate is at a 16-year peak, and although there was no rise in June, the impact of the previous ten is evident among market participants.</p>
<p>Inflation in the U.S. has decelerated for 11 consecutive months but remains <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-inflation-cools-to-4-annual-rate-setting-stage-for-feds-decision-on-interest-rates/">elevated at 4%</a>, while the interest rate for a 30-year mortgage ranges between <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/30-year-mortgage-rates/">6.99% and 7.14%</a>. The countrywide average for a 30-year loan term is 7.08%. This implies that for every $100,000 borrowed, debtors must pay $660 to $685 monthly in interest. With the federal funds rate at 5% to 5.25%, an extra two rate hikes totaling 50bps would likely push lending rates higher, making credit in the U.S. considerably tighter.</p>
<p>During the last FOMC meeting&#8217;s press conference, Powell mentioned that Fed board members did not reach a consensus on July. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t make a decision about July,&#8221; Powell <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20230614.pdf">informed</a> reporters last Wednesday. &#8220;I do expect that it will be a live meeting. It may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace, but we have made no decision about a hike or pause at the July meeting.”</p>
<p>Despite earlier forecasts of a shift, most market analysts do not foresee a rate reduction this year. Asawari Sathe, Vanguard&#8217;s senior economist, expresses skepticism that the federal funds rate will be lowered in 2023. “We believe inflation will continue to moderate but remain above 3% through year-end, and unemployment will trend higher to a still reasonable 4.5%,” the Vanguard economist <a href="https://advisors.vanguard.com/insights/article/whythefedwillnotcutratesthisyear">penned</a>. Vanguard&#8217;s machine learning prediction tool also anticipates that the Fed will not reduce rates until the following year. Sathe stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vanguard&#8217;s model anticipates that the Fed won&#8217;t be in a position to cut rates until the middle of 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>On Tuesday, CME&#8217;s Fedwatch presented a <a href="https://archive.ph/3o5gI#selection-2527.0-2527.5">76.9% probability</a> of the Fed raising the rate by 25bps at the July FOMC meeting. Approximately 23.1% expect no alteration to transpire in July and that the rate will stay unchanged at 5% to 5.25%. Should the 5.6% threshold be attained within this year, it will surpass the Federal Reserve&#8217;s previous March prediction by a notable 50bps.</p>
<p>However, by the conclusion of May, numerous economists started asserting that the central bank would undergo a significant shift in its approach. “Chair Powell right now does not want to talk about (reducing rates),” <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/05/19/fed-says-wont-lower-rates-recession/70230496007/#:~:text=Fed%20says%20it%27s%20unlikely%20to,Markets%20don%27t%20buy%20it&amp;text=If%20the%20U.S.%20economy%20slips,love%20instead%20of%20a%20lifeline.">conveyed</a> Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, to his clients just last month. The Pantheon executive added:</p>
<blockquote><p>But that will change; the Fed will do what the data tell them to do, and the data are heading south.</p></blockquote>

A Deutsche Bank executive explained that the digital asset move is part of the giant lender&#8217;s broader strategy to boost fee income. </strong></p>
<h2>Deutsche Bank Applies for Digital Asset License</h2>
<p>Germany’s largest bank by total assets, Deutsche Bank AG, has submitted an application to the country’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) seeking regulatory approval to offer custody services for digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>“We’re building out our digital assets and custody business,” David Lynne, head of Deutsche Bank&#8217;s commercial banking unit, said at a conference Tuesday. The executive added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We just put our application into the Bafin for the digital asset license.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lynne further shared that the move is part of the giant lender’s wider strategy aimed at boosting fee income within Deutsche Bank&#8217;s corporate bank. Additionally, it reflects similar efforts by Deutsche Bank&#8217;s asset management arm, DWS Group, to enhance revenue through digital asset-related offerings, the publication conveyed.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank&#8217;s corporate bank division initially indicated a plan to offer digital asset custody in late 2020 without providing a specific timeline for the service&#8217;s launch. At that time, the division was under the leadership of Stefan Hoops, who later joined DWS as CEO, and Lynne took over the division a year ago.</p>
<p>In Germany, Bafin is responsible for issuing licenses to entities wanting to offer crypto services in the country. The new Germany Money Laundering Act, which went into effect at the beginning of 2020, allows financial institutions to offer crypto products to their customers alongside traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds. At the time, Bafin reportedly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/banks-germany-crypto/">received</a> more than 40 &#8220;expressions of interest&#8221; from banks for approval to operate a crypto custody business in the future.</p>

Bullish sentiment continues to make a gradual return, following recent market weakness. Ethereum remained over the $1,700 level during today&#x2019;s session.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin rose to a two-week high on Tuesday, as bullish sentiment made a gradual return to the marketplace.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $26,338.54 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to an intraday high of $27,147.47 on Tuesday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of the surge in price, bitcoin rose to its strongest point since June 7, when it peaked at $27,402.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
From the chart, it appears that today&#x2019;s rally coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) also breaking out of a ceiling of its own at the 50.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Price strength now stands at 51.71 at the time of writing, with the next visible resistance level at 57.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the event bulls are able to send the index to this point, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will be above $27,500.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was marginally in the green in today&#x2019;s session, with price hovering close to a recent support point.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit an intraday peak of $1,748.64 earlier in the day, before retreating to a low less than 24 hours after climbing from a floor at $1,705.81.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Since this earlier high, ethereum has slipped back to a support point at $1,725, a point where it has consolidated for the past four days.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, this retreat occurred as the RSI ran into a ceiling of its own at the 44.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, the index now sits at the 42.21 mark, and appears to be heading to a lower floor at 40.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should strength fall below that mark, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will drop below $1,700 in the coming days.&#13;<br />
