<p>The statement comes after the crypto community went viral on Twitter, alleging that the exchange is experiencing insolvency due to an alleged connection between it and the cross-chain router protocol Multichain (MULTI).</p>



<p>The Gate.io team said &#8220;the company&#8217;s operations are going well&#8221; and that it is focusing on setting up an affiliated trading platform in Hong Kong called Gate.HK.</p>



<p>Rumors of Gate.io insolvency broke out after several events related to Multichain. On May 24, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence posted data showing a large MULTI inflow into Gate.io, which the Multichain project team &#8220;is said to have been captured in Shanghai&#8221; along with associated wallets about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in controlled money.</p>

<p>After seeing multiple MULTI and Fantom deposits into Gate.io, some Twitter users suspected that the exchange could be affected by Multichain.</p>



<p>Although the team at Gate.io has denied these rumors, saying that the exchange is processing all withdrawals and operating normally, it can still not prevent users from panicking to withdraw money to avoid risk.</p>

<p>According to Colin Wu, an independent cryptocurrency reporter, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency by trading volume plans to let off 20% of its staff next month. Nonetheless, this news comes after the crypto exchange had said that it would not lay off any of its employees.</p>



<p>CZ has <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1663945939482968075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> to Twitter to address the problem and deny the statements made in Wu Blockchain&#8217;s Twitter thread concerning layoffs at Binance. The reports were described as FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) by CZ, who emphasized the company&#8217;s steadfast commitment to talent and profitability.</p>



<p>According to Wu Blockchain, the overall number of Binance workers is about 8,000, with market rumors indicating that the company may lay off nearly 20% of its workforce next month.</p>



<p>Binance CEO added that the exchange conducts a continual &#8220;bottom-out&#8221; approach, which entails saying goodbye to employees who may not be compatible with the company&#8217;s unique culture or position. He provided a brief example of Work From Home (WFH) and noted that it is not suitable for everyone.</p>



<p>CZ emphasized that the &#8220;bottom-out&#8221; approach is ongoing and that he promotes it on a weekly basis. He said that the corporation must fire no more than % of its employees.</p>

<p>Additionally, Binance CEO reiterated his commitment to cost-cutting efforts such as optimizing server, airline, and food charges, among others. This dedication to efficiency has been critical to Binance&#8217;s success, allowing the firm to remain profitable since its fourth month of existence in October 2017, even amid difficult moments in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Patrick Hillmann, Binance&#8217;s Chief Communications Officer, reinforced CZ&#8217;s views in an earlier answer to Wu Blockchain, putting light on the volatile nature of the crypto business and the necessity for enterprises to stay disciplined and agile. He stressed the significance of reallocating resources internally and maintaining a pipeline of creative candidates to fulfill consumers&#8217; and the regulatory landscape&#8217;s continually changing expectations.</p>



<p>Binance is currently facing tough regulatory issues across regions with strict crypto policies, specifically the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191286-binance-pressured-by-canadian-regulators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian authorities</a>. </p>



<p>The exchange also <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191211-binance-stops-trading-of-privacy-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that it would delist privacy currencies for customers in certain regions beginning June 26. The action comes as the European Union continues to implement its groundbreaking Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191285-mica-is-now-signed-into-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MiCA</a> would specifically prohibit exchanges from offering privacy cryptocurrencies unless currency holders&#8217; identities were confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>On May 31, Cowen, an investment bank, announced the closing of its digital asset section.</em></li>



<li><em>The digital asset unit was established in March 2022 in order to attract institutional customers.</em></li>



<li><em>The debut of Cowen Digital was part of a larger wave aimed at attracting institutional involvement.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-31/td-cowen-closes-digital-unit-that-focused-on-cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, Cowen Digital, the digital asset subsidiary formed last year by investment bank Cowen, is shutting down.</strong></h5>

<p>Cowen offers investment banking, research, sales, and trading. Its digital asset segment, created in 2022, was a bold step that included 16 digital assets among the assets supplied to its consumers, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.</p>



<p>Cowen Inc. was acquired by TD Bank Group, one of North America&#8217;s major banks, in March 2023, prompting the closure. According to an email shared with Bloomberg, the bank&#8217;s digital assets unit included at least ten workers and one intern.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Our entire team believes strongly in the need for trusted counterparties who understand the needs of institutional investors – through white-glove high and low touch execution, deep knowledge-driven content, corporate access and group educational events. We will continue to try and fulfill that endeavor, but will have to do so in a different home,” the email stated.</p>

<li><em>Moreover, a Treasury official said that Chinese drug manufacturing finds cryptocurrency payments &#8220;appealing.&#8221;</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US Senator Elizabeth Warren called for a stop to crypto-funded fentanyl manufacture at a Senate hearing on Wednesday.</strong></h5>

<p>According to the investigation, over 90 Chinese firms that provide fentanyl precursors accept cryptocurrency payments. After that, in evidence at the hearing, US Treasury Department Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Rosenberg acknowledged the link between illegal trade and digital assets.</p>



<p>Moreover, Rosenberg said that payments in cryptocurrency is &#8220;appealing&#8221; to Chinese pharma producers, citing Elliptic research.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Unfortunately, that is a mode that some of these precursor manufacturers and illicit drug organizations have used – the receipt of bitcoin payments in wallets, cryptocurrency wallets. The reason why they would find this appealing is the same reason that other financial criminals would find it appealing, which is to say there&#8217;s an element of pseudonymity that they seek,” said Rosenberg.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Overdoses using fentanyl have become the main cause of death in the United States for those aged 18 to 45. Chemicals required to make the hazardous drug are often imported from China and travel over numerous countries on their way to U.S. consumers of the synthetic opioid, which the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) claims are 100 times more strong than morphine.</p>

<p>Warren said that the Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act might aid in the abolition of the disease. She then said that the proposal would be reintroduced in Congress.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Crypto is helping fund the fentanyl trade, and we have the power to shut that down,” Warren said.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Multichain, one of the most important bridge protocols in the crypto sector, said Wednesday that it was stopping cross-chain routes and that its CEO, Zhaojun, could not be reached.</strong></h5>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;In the past two days, the Multichain protocol has experienced multiple issues due to unforeseeable circumstances. The team has done everything possible to maintain the protocol running, but we are currently unable to contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for maintenance,&#8221; the Multichain team said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Without server access, the surviving team <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1663941611380965376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indicated</a> that it could not maintain Kekchain, PublicMint, Dyno Chain, Red Light Chain, Dexit, Ekta, HPB, ONUS, Omax, Findora, and Planq bridges operational.</p>



<p>Following days of speculation, the revelation of Multichain&#8217;s server access difficulties confirmed that at least one important team member had gone missing.</p>



<p>The protocol&#8217;s issues were connected to its routers, which facilitate connections across chains. Routers 2 and 5, as well as Router 5, are impacted, affecting the connectivity between chains such as Kava, zkSync, and Polygon zkEVM.</p>

<p>The newest vulnerability, revealed today, impacts a number of chains, according to the team, who also highlighted that this problem is beyond the team&#8217;s present rights and capabilities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;In order to protect the interests of our users, we have decided to suspend the corresponding cross-chain service for the affected chain on the UI. Last week, the same issue happened on Router2,&#8221; the team added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191188-multichain-founder-arrested-in-shanghai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, the crypto world is abuzz with claims that Chinese authorities have jailed Multichain&#8217;s executive team and threatened to disrupt operations. Soon after this announcement, a number of wallets sold a big quantity of MULTI, while the Fantom Foundation removed a significant amount of liquidity from the pools due to worries about damaging the system. Multichain subsequently verified that the issue was caused by force majeure but provided no other details.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The EU has finally signed into law its groundbreaking MiCA rule.</em></li>



<li><em>The legislation was signed by Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament, and Peter Kullgren, Minister of Rural Affairs of Sweden.</em></li>



<li><em>MiCA will go into effect a few weeks after it is published in the EU&#8217;s official journal, which is expected in June.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The important Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) proposal seeks to standardize all cryptocurrency legislation throughout the EU&#8217;s 27 member states. According to the most recent reports, the European Union officially signed into law its MiCA legislation on Wednesday.</strong></h5>

<p>The legislation was signed by European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and Swedish Rural Affairs Minister Peter Kullgren, coupled with a second anti-money laundering bill requiring crypto providers to authenticate their clients&#8217; identities before transferring payments.</p>



<p>The council has already given final approval to the MiCA rule. The ground-breaking law attempts to integrate crypto throughout the EU. It was, however, postponed until February. It has now received final clearance.</p>



<p>The announcement was made on Twitter by the Swedish government, which is presiding over legislative discussions as the EU president. </p>

<p>On April 20, the European Parliament passed the European Union&#8217;s (EU) MiCA encryption rules. This remarkable move brings Europe one step closer to being the first area to enact comprehensive laws for the booming cryptocurrency industry. The enforcement phase will begin in June 2023 after the fulfillment of a few remaining administrative procedures.</p>



<p>Its regulations, which provide crypto exchanges and wallet providers permission to operate within the 27-nation bloc and require stablecoin issuers to keep enough reserves, will go into effect between 12 and 18 months later.</p>

<p>MiCA was initially suggested by the European Commission in 2020, and it sparked debate when legislators were on the verge of including ecologically friendly requirements that may have amounted to a ban on Bitcoin&#8217;s proof-of-work algorithm.</p>



<p>This achievement marks a big step forward in tackling the issues connected with the growing use of digital assets.</p>



<p>Although the rules were widely applauded, the industry&#8217;s focus has now shifted to the next stage of EU crypto legislation, with future regulations possibly addressing themes like staking, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized financing. When it is implemented, MiCA will put crypto-asset services and activities within EU regulatory jurisdiction.</p>



<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191269-eba-raises-vigilance-against-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began</a> a public consultation on proposed changes to its Guidelines on money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk factors. This is also seen as a move to strengthen the comprehensive system for digital assets across the EU in the near future.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Despite the fact that Binance has exited the local market, the Ontario Securities Commission is examining it.</em></li>



<li><em>The Canadian Securities Commission is looking into the exchange for suspected securities law violations.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance has subsequently been summoned by the OSC to provide documentation for the probe.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A document published by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) suggests Canada&#8217;s biggest watchdog is examining Binance&#8217;s activities in this nation, weeks after the global crypto behemoth announced its withdrawal from Canada because it did not agree with new restrictions imposed by the country&#8217;s authorities.</strong></h5>

<p>The OSC issued an investigative order to the world&#8217;s biggest digital asset exchange on May 10, according to a filing this month with the Capital Markets Tribunal. Binance announced its withdrawal from the market two days later, citing new regulatory instructions on stablecoins and investment limitations.</p>



<p>According to the petition, the OSC&#8217;s ruling ordered &#8220;an exceptionally wide examination into whether Binance may have taken efforts to evade Ontario securities legislation and compliance procedures in regard to Binance.com or engaged in conduct contrary to Ontario securities law and/or the public interest.&#8221;</p>



<p>The exchange has been subjected to increased regulatory and legal attention in a number of places in recent years, most notably by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which has filed a lawsuit against the company and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Although the order&#8217;s specifics were not immediately accessible, Binance said that the OSC was motivated by the CFTC&#8217;s action.</p>



<p>When questioned why Binance chose to exit the Canadian market, Zhao, a Canadian citizen, said in a Twitter Post on Wednesday that he no longer thought it was feasible to run a profitable company there due to the new rules.</p>

<p>The OSC has subsequently summoned Binance to provide papers for the probe, which the exchange stated earlier this month it could not comply with because the summons was not detailed enough. According to a petition issued on Monday, the Capital Markets Tribunal ordered the exchange to comply with the summons at a hearing on May 26.</p>



<p>Despite its attempts to expand globally, including launches in areas like the UAE and Thailand, Binance has recently faced increased regulatory and legal scrutiny across various jurisdictions. The transaction has been the subject of litigation, investigations, and heightened regulatory supervision. The OSC&#8217;s investigative order adds to the exchange&#8217;s long list of legal difficulties.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s departure highlights the problems created by Canada&#8217;s enhanced cryptocurrency regulations, which were implemented in reaction to the bankruptcy of crypto behemoth FTX last year. Several large exchanges, like OKX and Bybit, have also left the Canadian market, while Coinbase Global Inc. has decided to remain and seek registration under the new legislation.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the European Banking Authority <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191269-eba-raises-vigilance-against-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> draft guidelines advising crypto businesses to keep an eye out for consumers utilizing privacy coins in order to detect suspected money laundering activities. As a result, Binance plans to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191211-binance-stops-trading-of-privacy-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delist privacy coins</a> in France, Italy, Poland, and Spain.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The European Banking Authority (EBA) wants to expand money laundering guidelines to cryptocurrency businesses and banks that do business with them.</em></li>



<li><em>The intentions come after a string of crackdowns on crypto technologies, which politicians fear may be used to conceal illegal or terrorist funds.</em></li>



<li><em>Money laundering concerns may increase for providers of crypto asset services such as exchanges and wallets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The European Banking Authority (EBA) <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-consults-amendments-guidelines-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing-risk-factors-include" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began</a> a public consultation today on proposed changes to its Guidelines on money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk factors.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1752-1024x513.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="513" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1752-1024x513.png" alt="EBA Raises Vigilance Against Crypto Money Laundering" class="wp-image-191279" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1752-1024x513.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1752-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1752-768x385.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1752-1536x770.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1752-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1752-750x376.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1752-1140x571.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1752.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="EBA Raises Vigilance Against Crypto Money Laundering 30"></a></figure></div>


<p>The ideas, which are out for public comment until August 31, come after a succession of crackdowns on crypto technologies that may improve internet anonymity but that politicians fear might be used to conceal illegal or terrorist money.</p>



<p>The proposed amendments broaden the scope of these Guidelines to include crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). The consultation will be open until August 31, 2023.</p>



<p>CASPs, like other credit and financial institutions, are vulnerable to ML/TF concerns. These risks may be heightened for CASPs as a result of, for example, the adoption of novel technology, quick transfers of crypto assets throughout the globe, and services with privacy-enhancing features.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The EBA is proposing to amend its ML/TF risk factors guidelines to set common, regulatory expectations of the steps CASPs should take to identify and mitigate these risks effectively,” according to the EBA.</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1754-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1754-1024x576.png" alt="EBA Raises Vigilance Against Crypto Money Laundering" class="wp-image-191281" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1754-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1754-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1754-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1754-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1754-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1754.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="EBA Raises Vigilance Against Crypto Money Laundering 31"></a></figure></div>


<p>The use of mixers and tumblers, zero-knowledge proofs, and privacy coins suggests a greater risk, according to the guidelines. Customers that have several accounts and make transactions to self-hosted wallets that are not run by a regulated CASP or are situated in ostensibly unregulated abroad countries face the same risks.</p>



<p>The changes include new sector-specific guidelines for CASPs that emphasize variables that may indicate a CASP&#8217;s exposure to greater or reduced ML/TF risk. CASPs should consider these aspects when assessing the ML/TF risk of their company and clients at the start and during the business relationship. The Guidelines also outline how they should modify their customer due diligence (CDD) to account for such risks. Additionally, the amendments provide advice to other credit and financial institutions on the risks to consider when entering into a commercial partnership with a CASP or otherwise being exposed to crypto assets.</p>



<p>Banks interested in accepting crypto customers should also evaluate their regulatory licensing and ownership, according to the advise.</p>



<p>In recent months and years, the European Union has attempted to address money laundering threats associated with covert crypto transactions. New money laundering regulations may limit transactions using self-hosted wallets where the owner cannot be recognized and may even outright prohibit anonymous currencies. The EBA also underlined additional dangers for organizations that adopt crypto-style distributed ledger technology in a March recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Tether has announced an expansion of its footprint in Georgia with an investment in CityPay.io.</em></li>



<li><em>Tether is the first stablecoin to invest in CityPay.io, marking a major milestone for the payment processing sector.</em></li>



<li><em>Around 3% of Georgians possess cryptocurrencies.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a press statement <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-expands-its-presence-in-georgia-with-investment-in-citypayio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> on Wednesday, Tether, the $83 billion USDT stablecoin&#8217;s issuer, has invested an unknown sum in the payment processing company CityPay.io.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1750-1024x535.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1750-1024x535.png" alt="Tether Supports CityPay.io With Georgia Expansion Strategy" class="wp-image-191274" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1750-1024x535.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1750-300x157.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1750-768x401.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1750-750x392.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1750-1140x596.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Tether Supports CityPay.io With Georgia Expansion Strategy 34"></a></figure></div>


<p>The move is seen as a &#8220;major milestone&#8221; for the payment processing business, benefitting clients across Georgia and the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>



<p>CityPay.io has enabled USDT as a payment option for users at over 600 establishments in Georgia, including restaurants, stores, and hotels. Tether sent out a tweet. The company partnered with Binance Pay, the payment arm of the world&#8217;s biggest crypto exchange, early this year, enabling cryptocurrency purchases.</p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s investment is part of a new initiative to spend a portion of its surplus income on Bitcoin (BTC) and infrastructure, payments, and communication projects.</p>



<p>During the first quarter, the corporation posted a net profit of about $1.5 billion. Tether also announced an investment in sustainable energy generation and bitcoin mining in Uruguay earlier this week.</p>



<p>Georgia has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s most crypto-friendly nations, with an increasing interest in crypto. Presently, 2.89% of Georgians possess some type of cryptocurrency, demonstrating the country&#8217;s extensive acceptance of digital assets.</p>

<p>Almost 130 crypto ATMs are located throughout the nation, making it easier for consumers to conduct transactions. In fact, a July 2022 survey done by Forex Suggest rated Georgia fourth on the list of the world&#8217;s most crypto-ready countries.</p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s investment in CityPay.io intends to improve the efficiency and ease of Georgia&#8217;s payment business, eventually benefitting consumers across the nation and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).</p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s Chief Technical Officer, Paolo Ardoino, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Tether is committed to supporting companies that share our vision of building a more connected and accessible financial system. This investment in CityPay.io is an important step towards achieving that goal.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new development comes only one day after the stablecoin issuer revealed plans to invest in energy generation and operate sustainable Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay.</p>



<p>Tether <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188151-tether-uses-net-profits-purchase-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> intentions earlier this month to invest 15% of its net realized operational earnings in Bitcoin, including regular purchases of BTC and supporting infrastructure.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies, cryptocoins, payment tokens, exchange tokens, and convertible virtual currencies are examples of virtual assets.</p>



<p>The new restrictions will be implemented in one month. It will have an impact on Licensed Financial Institutions in the UAE, including banks, financing firms, exchange houses, payment service providers, registered hawala providers, insurance companies, agents, and brokers.</p>



<p>His Excellency Khaled Mohamed Balama, Governor of the CBUAE, in a written statement, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The new guidance related to the virtual assets sector contribute to strengthening the supervisory and regulatory frameworks of the Central Bank to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The UAE was added to the FATF&#8217;s &#8220;grey&#8221; list of nations subject to heightened surveillance in March 2022. The UAE reacted by pledging to work closely with the FATF to improve.</p>



<p>Dubai&#8217;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) proposed a new virtual asset framework in February this year with the goal of requiring players to comply with AML rules.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/175948-uae-central-bank-expands-cbdc-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UAE Central Bank</a>, the new guideline includes customer due diligence and expanded due diligence for LFIs toward prospective VASP clients and counterparties, with the goal of de-risking and assisting them with training programs, a governance structure, and record-keeping systems.</p>
