David Puell, an on-chain researcher at Ark Invest, today shared his insights in a detailed report, offering a nuanced perspective on Bitcoin&#8217;s current standing and future prospects. The report, titled &#8220;The Bitcoin Monthly: July 2023,&#8221; addresses several key topics that are central to understanding the current state of Bitcoin. These topics include a comprehensive market summary, an analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s low volatility and whether it indicates a potential breakdown or breakout, as well as a discussion on the impact of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s tightening policy as a leading indicator of price deflation. Ark Invest’s Near-Term Bitcoin Price Prediction Puell&#8217;s analysis reveals a mixed, but mainly bullish outlook for Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency ending July at $29,230, above its 200-week moving average and its short-term-holder (STH) cost basis of $28,328. This suggests a strong support level for Bitcoin, indicating a potential upward trend, notes Puell. However, Bitcoin&#8217;s 90-day volatility, which dropped to 36% in July, a level not seen since January 2017, presents a neutral outlook. Puell explains, &#8220;Based on its low level of volatility, we believe the Bitcoin price could be setting up to move dramatically in one direction or the other during the next few months.&#8221; This could mean a significant price movement, but the direction &#8211; up or down &#8211; is uncertain.

Miner capitulation is typically associated with oversold conditions in BTC price, hinting at a potential bullish reversal. The &#8220;liveliness&#8221; metric, which measures potential selling pressure relative to current holding behavior, also suggests a bullish trend. The analyst notes, &#8220;In July, liveliness dropped below 60%, suggesting the strongest long-term holding behavior since the last quarter of 2020.&#8221; This indicates that more holders are keeping their coins rather than selling them, which could drive the price up. ARK&#8217;s own short-term-holder profit/loss ratio, which ended July at ~1, is also seen as a bullish sign. Puell explains, &#8220;This breakeven level correlates both with local bottoms during primary bull markets and with local tops during bear market environments.&#8221; However, the future of Binance&#8217;s BNB token, which is facing increased regulatory pressure, looks bearish according to Puell. He warns, &#8220;As regulatory pressure increases on crypto exchange Binance, its native token, BNB, could be on the threshold of significant turbulence.&#8221; If BNB breaks down, it could potentially impact the overall stability of the crypto market, including BTC. Macro Outlook On the macroeconomic front, Puell discusses the potential impact of the Fed&#8217;s 22-fold increase in interest rates, which he views as bearish for Bitcoin and the broader economy. He states, &#8220;According to renowned economist Milton Friedman, monetary policy works with &#8216;long and variable lags&#8217; that last 12-18 months, suggesting that the full impact of the Fed’s 22-fold increase in interest rates has yet to hit.&#8221; Related Reading: DOJ Action Against Binance: A Hidden Blessing For Bitcoin And Crypto Markets? The Zillow Rent Index, which leads the Owners&#8217; Equivalent Rent (OER) by roughly nine months, suggests that Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation could decelerate significantly below 2% by year-end. Puell views this as a bullish sign for Bitcoin, as it could potentially increase the attractiveness of non-inflationary assets like Bitcoin. Lastly, Ark Invest takes a neutral stance on the falling US import prices from China, despite the yuan&#8217;s depreciation by ~12% since February 2022. He notes, &#8220;All else equal, China exporters should have increased prices to offset the depreciation of the yuan. Instead, they have cut prices, harming their profitability.&#8221; In conclusion, Puell&#8217;s report presents a complex picture for Bitcoin. While there are a lot of signs for a potential bullish trend, there are also significant risks and uncertainties that could lead to bearish outcomes. At press time, the BTC price was at $29.152. The most crucial resistance at the moment lies at $29.450. If BTC can overcome this resistance, a breakout from the multi-week downtrend might be possible.
