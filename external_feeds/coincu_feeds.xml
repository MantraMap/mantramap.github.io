<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Former CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad said that the government must build a new trading structure for crypto if the company is to survive.</em></li>



<li><em>According to Massad, money laundering accounts for between 50% and 90% of crypto transactions.</em></li>



<li><em>He said that he and Fed Chair Jay Powell have been calling for short-term measures to safeguard investors.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/06/former-cftc-chairman-says-crypto-needs-a-new-framework-and-protections.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em>, Timothy Massad, former chairman of the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), said in an interview that the government&#8217;s recent litigation against cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase will determine the future of cryptocurrencies.</strong></h5>

<p>According to Massad, the government and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must establish a new industry structure to safeguard investors, prevent fraud and manipulation, and ultimately address the contentious issue of whether digital tokens are securities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“A lot of what goes on in the crypto world does just revolve around itself, you know, it’s a very interesting technology — the practical use cases that connect to the real economy, frankly, are still few and far between. The question is, how do we create a framework where that innovation can still take place, and maybe lead to things of real value, but protect investors at the same time,&#8221; Massad said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the most serious problems in crypto is wash trading, which occurs when someone trades with oneself or affiliates to deceive others about stock performance. According to Massad, this fraud accounts for 50% to 90% of cryptocurrency transactions.</p>



<p>He went on to say that he and Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell have been calling for short-term measures to safeguard investors as the government works to build a completely new framework model.</p>



<p>The SEC charged Binance, the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, with comingling billions of dollars in customer cash and sending them to a European business owned by Zhao.</p>



<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a complaint against the New York-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase for marketing unregistered securities.</p>

<p>The complaint also claims that Coinbase has operated as an unlicensed securities broker since 2019, almost two years before its IPO in April 2021.</p>



<p>According to the SEC, Coinbase&#8217;s staking program comprises five stacking crypto assets, making it an investment contract and hence a security. Despite Kraken earlier settling with the SEC and shutting down its staking services in the United States, Coinbase was already conducting a staking dispute with the SEC, saying its staking products do not constitute securities.</p>



<p>According to some industry analysts, the SEC&#8217;s recent proceedings against US-based <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192841-coinbase-resolutely-against-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> and Cayman Islands-based Binance may be a net good for firms operating in the US long-term due to the legal clarity they may provide. Yet, in the short to medium term, these steps may push these companies to redirect their attention elsewhere.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Optimism, a Layer 2 network built on top of Ethereum, successfully completed a scheduled upgrade. </strong></h5>

<p>This upgrade, <a href="https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/" rel="noreferrer noopener">known as the Bedrock upgrade</a>, is expected to bring several improvements to the network. One of the most significant improvements is the reduced transaction costs.</p>



<p>According to an explainer post, the Bedrock upgrade advances a series of improvements. However, it is important to note that reducing transaction costs is the most notable improvement. This is particularly important because high transaction costs have been a major concern for Ethereum users.</p>



<p>The upgrade process began just after 12 p.m. ET. The network&#8217;s status page announced that the upgrade was complete around 3 p.m. ET. According to a status page run by OP Labs, most of the core functions have already returned to the network. This is great news for users of the network who have been eagerly waiting for the upgrade to be completed.</p>

<p>However, some parts of the upgrade process have taken longer than expected. According to the Optimism team, &#8220;Due to the size of the archival data disk, it is taking longer than anticipated for the legacy-geth archival datadir to be available.&#8221; Despite this, the upgrade status page announced that the network&#8217;s public endpoint was back online just before 6 p.m. ET.</p>



<p>The completion of the Bedrock upgrade is a major milestone for Optimism and Ethereum. It is expected to bring several improvements, including reduced transaction costs. Despite some delays, the upgrade process was successful, and most of the core functions have already returned to the network. This is great news for users who are looking forward to using the updated network.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>a16z&#8217;s Head of Policy argues that the recent action taken by the SEC is part of a troubling trend of irresponsible enforcement methods.</em></li>



<li><em>According to him, the SEC should work with crypto companies to update the rules.</em></li>



<li><em>The agency has recently taken its stance on the crypto industry.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Brian Quintenz, the Head of Policy at a16z, the recent action taken by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is part of a troubling trend of irresponsible enforcement methods that negatively impact entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1x-1-1-1024x682.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1x-1-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="a16z&#039;s Head of Policy: The SEC Is Irresponsibly Enforcing Regulations" class="wp-image-192894" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1x-1-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1x-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1x-1-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1x-1-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1x-1-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1x-1-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1x-1-1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="a16z&#039;s Head of Policy: The SEC Is Irresponsibly Enforcing Regulations 10"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brian Quintenz</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Quintenz stated that this approach could also hinder innovation and cause responsible companies to leave the US. Coinbase has been a responsible industry player for over a decade and has helped advance Web3 in the US. Despite repeated attempts to register with the SEC and calls for sensible regulation, the company has not received a response.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ The SEC’s actions today continue the pattern of an irresponsible regulation-by-enforcement approach that hurts entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers while threatening to stifle innovation and drive responsible companies away from the US.</p>&mdash; Brian Quintenz (@BrianQuintenz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianQuintenz/status/1666194079636414468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>He believes that the agency should collaborate with market participants to update the rules and provide clarity on their application in a responsible manner that aligns with their stated mission.</p>



<p>The Head of Policy warns that unilateral decisions like this could have significant consequences. Blockchain technology and Web3 have the potential to democratize various industries, but this innovation requires clear rules from the government, not just lawsuits.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been four years since the SEC provided any meaningful guidance related to encryption, and it&#8217;s ironic that this action comes after a proposal in Congress that would provide clear rules to protect Americans and root out bad actors in the industry, according to him.</p>

<p>Quintenz suggests that the SEC should work with Congress and responsible cryptocurrency companies in the US to provide clarity and avoid further confusion.</p>



<p>The SEC took aim at the most dominant force in the world of cryptocurrencies on Monday, following months of debates, threats, and warnings. One day later, the SEC charged <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192841-coinbase-resolutely-against-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> with endangering clients by acting as an unlicensed broker, exchange, and clearing agency.</p>



<p>The US agency sought a federal judge to seek a temporary restraining order to freeze assets held by Binance, the world&#8217;s most popular crypto exchange, only hours after announcing the Coinbase action. </p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum&#8217;s price found support near the $1,775 zone after a major decline and started a fresh increase above the $1,800 resistance zone, similar to Bitcoin. </em></li>



<li><em>A clear move above the $1,840 and $1,850 resistance levels, and a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,865 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. </em></li>

<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ethereums-Downtrend-Resistance.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="740" height="492" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ethereums-Downtrend-Resistance.jpg" alt="Ethereums Downtrend Resistance" class="wp-image-192898" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ethereums-Downtrend-Resistance.jpg 740w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ethereums-Downtrend-Resistance-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" title="Ethereum&#039;s Downtrend Resistance Holds Strong Despite Price Gains 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This trend has been similar to that of Bitcoin, which has also seen a recent increase in price. Ethereum&#8217;s current price is around $1,850 and is trading above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.</p>



<p>In the hourly chart of ETH/USD, there was a clear move above the $1,840 and $1,850 resistance levels. Furthermore, a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,865 was broken, indicating a potential upward trend in the near future. The price then formed a high near $1,898 and is currently consolidating gains.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-454.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="582" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-454-1024x582.png" alt="image 454" class="wp-image-192896" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-454-1024x582.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-454-300x171.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-454-768x437.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-454-1536x874.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-454-750x427.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-454-1140x648.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-454.png 1950w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ethereum&#039;s Downtrend Resistance Holds Strong Despite Price Gains 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Looking ahead, immediate resistance is near the $1,900 zone, with the next major resistance near the $1,920 level. This level has been tested multiple times in the past, making it a multi-touch zone. If Ethereum makes a proper move above the $1,900 and $1,920 resistance levels, it might experience an upward trend, possibly leading to a price of $1,950. The next resistance sits near $2,000, above which Ethereum could rise further to $2,040. If the price gains continue beyond the $2,040 resistance zone, it might reach the $2,120 resistance level.</p>



<p>Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,860 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major support is near the $1,840 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,777 swing low to the $1,898 high. If there is a break below the $1,840 support, the price could decline toward the $1,800 support. Any further losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,775 level or even $1,740 in the coming sessions.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>French luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton is taking the next step in the world of blockchain technology by debuting a limited series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), known as “Treasure Trunks,” that is set to unlock exclusive products and experiences for high-level customers. </strong></h5>

<p>The Treasure Trunks NFTs will be priced at about $41,712 (€39,000) each and will consist of only a few hundred. The collection is inspired by Louis Vuitton’s iconic luggage trunk and each NFT comes with a matching, made-to-order physical Louis Vuitton trunk that is sold for tens of thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>The NFTs will be &#8220;soulbound,&#8221; which means they cannot be traded or transferred between individuals. The original owner of a Louis Vuitton Treasure Trunk is the only one who will be able to use it to access exclusive customizable products, early releases of new products, and bespoke experiences.</p>



<p>Beginning June 8, potential holders who reside in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, and Australia can register on a waitlist. Only selected registrants will then be invited by LV the following week to purchase a Treasure Trunk with cryptocurrency or fiat on a dedicated site.</p>

<p>The Treasure Trunk collection is reportedly just the first project in an ongoing Louis Vuitton series called “Via,” which will focus on granting exclusive and rarified access to the Louis Vuitton brand to high-paying, select clientele.</p>



<p>Louis Vuitton is not the only luxury brand that has taken an interest in blockchain technology. Many luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, have previously experimented with NFT games and programs intended to reach wide audiences. However, in the last year, these brands have pivoted away from such plays and towards expensive, limited lines of NFTs that reward high-impact customers.</p>

<p>Balmain has been developing an exclusive NFT-backed club for top-tier customers since last summer. In April, Ralph Lauren began hosting exclusive events for Web3-initiated customers at a themed private waterfront estate in Miami. Louis Vuitton, therefore, is following in the footsteps of these brands by creating a series of NFTs that cater to a select few, turning blockchain technology into an ultra-elite membership club.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Both BTC and ETH experience V-shaped reversal leading to surge in options trading volume, which soared over 400%. </em></li>



<li><em>Notable trading of 290K ETH block calls accounting for 57% of total volume, worth $540M, suggests bearish view on market conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Market participants use options contracts to speculate on future price movements of BTC and ETH, as volatility and trading activities continue to shape market outlook.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experienced a significant V-shaped reversal in their price spikes today, leading to a surge in options trading volume.</strong></h5>

<p>Daily volume in the options market soared by over 400%, indicating increased market activity. Additionally, short-term implied volatility (IV) saw a slight rise.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zh" dir="ltr">【V型反转带动市场情绪回暖】<br>BTC和ETH今天价格暴涨出现V型反转，一扫昨天因为SEC起诉带来的负面影响。<br>V反行情带动期权交易量大幅增加，日成交量上升超400%，同时短期IV也受刺激出现小幅上涨。… <a href="https://t.co/axGBXcqhqD" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/axGBXcqhqD</a></p>&mdash; Adam@Greeks.live (@BTC__options) <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC__options/status/1666265219310686209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 7, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>One notable highlight was the trading of 290,000 ETH block calls yesterday, which accounted for 57% of the total volume for the day. These calls had a notional value of $540 million and predominantly consisted of nearly 100,000 sets of calendar spreads. It&#8217;s important to note that the strike price of this large bid from a significant market participant was lower compared to the previous month.</p>



<p>This trading activity suggests that the whale, or large market participant, who executed these transactions holds a bearish view on the current market conditions. They appear to believe that it will be challenging for the price to surpass the $2,000 mark, even with the recent V-shaped reversal.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC-And-ETH-1.webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1019" height="573" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC-And-ETH-1.webp" alt="BTC And ETH 1" class="wp-image-192878" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC-And-ETH-1.webp 1019w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC-And-ETH-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC-And-ETH-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTC-And-ETH-1-750x422.webp 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1019px) 100vw, 1019px" title="BTC And ETH Witness V-Shaped Reversal As Options Trading Volume Soars Over 400% 24"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The V-shaped reversal occurs when the price experiences a sharp decline followed by a swift recovery, forming a pattern that resembles the letter &#8220;V.&#8221; This pattern often indicates a quick change in market sentiment and can lead to increased volatility and trading opportunities.</p>



<p>The surge in options trading volume reflects the market participants&#8217; desire to hedge or speculate on the future price movements of BTC and ETH. Options contracts provide traders with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price within a specific timeframe.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and exhibit volatility, market participants closely monitor these price movements and trading activities to make informed decisions. The views expressed by the large whale trader, as mentioned in the tweet, contribute to the ongoing discussions and analysis surrounding the market outlook for BTC and ETH.</p>

<p>Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said in an interview:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“If it takes going to the Supreme Court, that’s what we’re prepared to do. I think that every court that looks at this issue is going to conclude the SEC has fundamentally gotten this wrong.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On a separate issue, the U.S. Court of Appeals filed an order giving the SEC seven days to submit a letter stating whether it rejected Coinbase’s application for crypto rulemaking and how much time the agency needed to decide.</p>



<p>According to the news yesterday, the SEC sued the exchange, accusing <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192834-binance-ceo-coinbase-ceo-lose-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> of failing to register with the agency as a broker, exchange, or clearing company. Its pledge plan also violated securities laws.</p>



<p>In its lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC identified SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO tokens as securities. The exchange responded that the solution is legislation, not litigation and that it will operate as usual.</p>

<p>According to The Block editor-in-chief Frank Chaparro, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal <a href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1666085597918945282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> to the SEC lawsuit, saying that in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry, the SEC relies on an enforcement-only approach, which harms U.S. economic competitiveness and the compliance commitments of companies like Coinbase. </p>



<p>The solution is legislation that allows fair road rules to be made transparently and applied equally, not lawsuits. In the meantime, Coinbase will continue to operate business as usual.</p>

<p>SlowMist has proposed the possibility of a 12-bit brute force collision attack, where an attacker pre-computes the hash values for all possible combinations of the seed and subsequently attempts to collide the hashes. The firm suggests that if an attacker manages to obtain a substantial number of hashed helper words, potentially in the millions, the likelihood of collisions increases due to the combination of speed and volume.</p>



<p>A collision occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash output, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the system. Although SHA256 collisions are extremely rare due to the algorithm&#8217;s strength, the concerns raised by SlowMist emphasize the importance of ensuring robust security practices.</p>

<p>Atomic Wallet, a popular cryptocurrency wallet, offers users a helper feature to aid in seed generation. While the intent behind the feature is to enhance user experience, any potential vulnerability in the hashing process could present a security risk.</p>



<p>It is crucial for the Atomic Wallet team to address these concerns promptly and conduct a thorough security review of their hashing methods. This would involve assessing the feasibility of a collision attack and implementing appropriate measures to mitigate the risk.</p>



<p>Users of Atomic Wallet are advised to exercise caution and consider implementing additional security measures, such as enabling multi-factor authentication and regularly updating their wallet software to benefit from any security patches or improvements.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, ensuring the security of user funds and personal information remains paramount. Development teams and service providers must remain vigilant in addressing potential vulnerabilities and staying ahead of emerging security threats to safeguard the trust and confidence of their user base.</p>

<p>Arthur Hayes, a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency industry, is renowned for his insights and predictions regarding Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements. His tweet reflects his belief that despite the current challenges faced by Bitcoin, there is still significant potential for the cryptocurrency to surge to new heights.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s largest and most well-known cryptocurrency, has experienced a roller-coaster ride in recent months. After reaching an all-time high of around $64,000 in April 2021, the digital asset faced a sharp decline, causing some investors to question its long-term viability.</p>

<p>However, Arthur Hayes&#8217; tweet suggests that he sees the current difficulties faced by Bitcoin as temporary and part of the overall journey to new highs. He encourages others to join him on this bullish ride, implying that he expects the price of Bitcoin to rise significantly in the near future.</p>



<p>Hayes&#8217; optimistic outlook is not unfounded. Bitcoin has a history of volatility, with periods of consolidation often followed by rapid price increases. The cryptocurrency has witnessed multiple bull markets in the past, leading to substantial gains for investors.</p>



<p>The tweet also reflects the overall sentiment of many Bitcoin enthusiasts who believe in the long-term potential of the digital currency. Despite short-term market fluctuations, they remain steadfast in their conviction that Bitcoin will continue to grow and achieve new milestones.</p>

<ul>

<p>The Bloomberg Billionaires Index showed that Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng’s net worth shrank by $1.4 billion to $26 billion in the past two days, while Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s net worth Assets shrank by $361 million to $2.2 billion.</p>



<p>This is after the US SEC sued two companies for violating securities rules, causing the stocks and tokens of several crypto-related companies to plummet.</p>

<p>The US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also accused Zhao and Binance of habitually breaking its standards three months ago.</p>



<p>As a result, Zhao and former Chief Supervisor Samuel Lim were charged with breaking eight basic elements of the US Commodities Exchange Act, including the need that safeguards be put in place to prevent and identify money laundering and financial activities. Terrorist support.</p>



<p>The SEC has also been looking into whether <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192365-binance-immediately-responds-to-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> improperly traded digital currency for months. The SEC may have jurisdiction over a virtual currency if investors purchase it to finance a corporation or project for profit.</p>



<p>The SEC said in a complaint filed on Monday that Binance CEO and the exchange deceived investors and authorities mismanaged consumer cash, and violated securities laws. Zhao, 46, co-founded the exchange in 2017 and helped it grow into a worldwide behemoth. His personal net worth increased as well, peaking at $96.9 billion in January 2022.</p>



<p>According to the filing, the corporation ran an exchange and marketed unregistered securities, skewed trading controls, and committed a variety of other offenses.</p>



<p>The SEC also filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192774-cftc-chair-advocates-sec-for-strong-measures-against-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> in federal court in New York on Tuesday morning, stating that the firm was functioning as an unregistered broker and exchange and requesting that the company be permanently stopped and enjoined from doing so in the future.</p>
