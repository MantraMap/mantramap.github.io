			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Stock trading app Robinhood reported that its crypto business brought in $38 million in Q1 for 2023, down 30% from $54 million in Q1 2022. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency and stock trading app Robinhood reported its first quarter revenue for 2023, revealing a 29.6% year-on-year decline for its cryptocurrency trading division. In its filing, the firm also reported an increase of 26% in assets under custody which now amounts to $78 billion. Around 15%, or $12 billion, of the assets under custody, are crypto assets on its trading platform &ndash; 40% less compared to Q1 2022.</p>
<p>Despite declining crypto trading revenue, the trading app&rsquo;s total revenue increased year-on-year, amounting to $441 million compared to Q1 2022&rsquo;s revenue of $229 million. Robinhood&rsquo;s total year-on-year trading revenue increased by 47.5%.</p>
<p>As a result of the US Federal Reserve&rsquo;s recent rate hikes, Robinhood earned handsomely from interest. Q1 revenue is up 16% from Q4 2022.</p>
<p>Although the firm&rsquo;s overall revenue increased, the app witnessed a decline in monthly active users. In Q1 2022, Robinhood had 15.9 million users, but this number decreased to 11.8 million.</p>
<p>Jason Warnick, Robinhood&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officer, commented on the firm&rsquo;s report saying:</p>

<p>The broader macro backdrop has been tougher on trading volumes and engagement with brokerages.</p>

<p>Vlad Tenev, Robinhood CEO, remained optimistic over the firm&rsquo;s report:</p>

<p>In the face of uncertainty in the&nbsp;banking sector, we&rsquo;re continuing to see strong net deposits and improving customer satisfaction.</p>

Robinhood Will Soon Launch 24-Hour Weekday Stock Trading
<p>Robinhood said it would soon allow users to engage in 24-hour trading of selected exchange-traded funds and popular stocks such as Tesla and Apple, Forbes reports. Robinhood will become the first US brokerage to offer 24-hour trading in individual stocks after it announced its plans on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tenev told The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that the 24-hour service would enable round-the-clock trading in 43 securities between 8 p.m. ET Sunday and 8 p.m. ET Friday, with plans to add more securities to this list.</p>
<p>The WSJ reports the service will be available in a limited capacity by next week, with all users having access by June.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If you're looking for a trading platform that offers more than just Bitcoin trading, then PrimeXBT crypto futures may be the answer. With a range of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets available for trading and features like copy trading and leveraged trading, it's worth considering if you're an experienced trader or a novice looking to learn more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this review, we&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of why exactly you and others should consider giving it a try.</p>
PrimeXBT review summary: Why PrimeXBT is worth a try
<p dir="ltr">PrimeXBT is a crypto trading platform that has been gaining popularity in recent years. One of the reasons why it's worth considering is its user-friendly platform, which makes trading easy for both novice and experienced traders. Additionally, PrimeXBT offers competitive trading fees, no minimum on deposits, and more, making it more cost-effective compared to other exchanges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another benefit is the range of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets available for trading, which include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Gold, Oil, and more. The platform also offers leveraged trading on all available assets, which allows traders to access more funds than they have available, increasing their potential profits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PrimeXBT has recently expanded its offerings by adding base industrial metals such as Nickel, Aluminum, Zinc, Lead, and Copper. Other recent platform upgrades include the addition of USD and EUR-based accounts, adding to the many cryptocurrency-based account options, which include BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and more.</p>
PrimeXBT futures review: Flexible trading options
<p dir="ltr">Crypto futures are financial contracts that enable traders to buy or sell a digital asset at a predetermined price on a future date. PrimeXBT offers an extensive range of crypto futures, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and over 30 top altcoins.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">PrimeXBT futures offers perpetual swaps, which allow traders to hold positions indefinitely without any expiry date. This feature enables traders to execute both long and short positions in the crypto market, making it possible to profit from upward and downward price movements.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Using leverage also amplifies the potential returns on investment, although it's essential to note that it can also increase the risk of loss. One unique feature of PrimeXBT crypto futures is the sliding leverage system. This allows traders to adjust their leverage depending on the market conditions and risk tolerance. Additionally, the platform offers a choice between cross or isolated margin, giving traders more control over their trades in general.</p>
Copy trading: Learning from experienced traders
<p dir="ltr">Covesting copy trading is one of the most exciting features of PrimeXBT. It is a peer-to-peer community where experienced traders can share their strategies and trades with others new to trading. This feature allows novice traders to follow successful traders and replicate their trades in real-time.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By following expert traders, novice traders can learn from their experience and earn profits simultaneously. This feature also benefits experienced traders as they can share their trading strategies and earn a commission from their followers. In addition, Covesting offers a ranking system where traders are ranked based on their trading performance, which helps traders find successful traders to follow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another benefit of Covesting copy trading is the ability to diversify a trader's portfolio. Following multiple successful traders can spread their risks and potentially earn more profits.&nbsp;</p>
Security and trust: PrimeXBT's top priority
<p dir="ltr">When it comes to trading platforms, security, and trust are paramount. PrimeXBT takes this seriously and has implemented various measures to ensure the safety of its users' funds and personal information. These include two-factor authentication, SSL encryption, and cold storage for user funds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PrimeXBT has received numerous awards and recognition for its platform and features. In 2020, it was awarded the Best Bitcoin Margin Trading Platform by ADVFN International Financial Awards and the Best Crypto Trading Platform by Forex Awards. These awards are a testament to PrimeXBT's commitment to providing excellent trading services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PrimeXBT is committed to providing top-notch customer service to its users. They have a 24/7 customer support team available to assist with any issues or questions. The support team can be reached via live chat or email, and response times are usually very quick. Additionally, PrimeXBT has a comprehensive FAQ section on its website that covers many commonly asked questions.&nbsp;</p>
Conclusion: Give PrimeXBT crypto futures a try
<p dir="ltr">In conclusion, PrimeXBT crypto futures is a platform worth considering if you're looking for a user-friendly and cost-effective trading platform with a range of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets available.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its unique features, like copy trading and the sliding leverage system for crypto futures, make it a compelling option for both novice and experienced traders. With security and trust as a top priority and industry recognition for excellence, PrimeXBT is a platform worth giving a try.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For those looking to start trading on PrimeXBT, the deposit bonus currently available is worth noting. With deposits of $500 or more, a $100 bonus can be claimed within 48 hours of registration and remains valid for two weeks. This is an excellent opportunity to explore the platform and its offerings without risking too much capital.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">With the current market sentiment around tokens like KuCoin and Chiliz, a new coin on the market, Yachtify, is enjoying a boom in investors. With its foundation on the Ethereum blockchain and unique trading model, Yachtify promises investors the first ever crypto-maritime investment project.</p>
<p class="s3">Yachtify (YCHT) Opening New Frontiers In The Crypto Market</p>
<p class="s3">Yachtify is an ongoing crypto project that promises to revolutionize the crypto market as we know it.</p>
<p class="s3">It is a first-of-its-kind crypto trading platform that utilizes the multi-billion dollar luxury boat industry. Investors can earn revenue on luxury vessels when they buy, sell, or rent vessels on the marketplace. This way, crypto enthusiasts can venture into the exclusive yacht market for as low as $100.</p>
<p class="s3">Yachtify employs a fractional ownership model where investors buy NFTs that represent a real-life, high-value yacht and earn income on the lease or sale of the yacht. The revenue reached is then distributed among stakeholders according to the value of their holdings. Current &nbsp;yachtowners can also earn revenue by listing at least 25% of the total worth of their vessel on the marketplace.</p>
<p class="s3">All investor assets are insured and safeguarded in maximum security ports across the world. The Yachtify marketplace also makes it easy for stakeholders to manage and grow their portfolios. Furthermore, the growth of the maritime industry following the COVID-19 pandemic further secures Yachtify&rsquo;s strategy. </p>
<p class="s3">The Yachtify token, $YCHT, is at the presale stage, so now is a great time to stockpile tokens. With just $0.10, investors can venture into a highly profitable industry and earn stable income. </p>
<p class="s3">Yachtify's high growth potential and scalability equip the project to compare to crypto warlords like Bitcoin (BTC)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Chiliz (CHZ): Experts Predict Major Downfall for Chiliz (CHZ)</p>
<p class="s3">It is not the best of times for Chiliz (CHZ) as it experiences continued dips. Trading at $0.1257, below its $0.130 resistance level, experts are not optimistic about a rise in the Chiliz (CHZ) price. Its Relative Strength Index of 14 indicates that further losses may be on the horizon for investors. </p>
<p class="s3">Daily charts show that further dips forced the support level to fall below $0.120 to $0.100 in April. As the RSI plummets, bearish influence may push Chiliz (CHZ) to the lower market boundary. When pitted against Bitcoin, one can notice a bullish trend; however, it is barely enough to save Chiliz (CHZ) from its current trajectory. </p>
<p class="s3">While investors hope for a dramatic upturn for Chiliz (CHZ), they have turned their sights to more promising new tokens such as Yachtify. </p>
<p class="s3">KuCoin (KCS): Security Breach Pulls Rug From Underneath KuCoin (KCS)</p>
<p class="s3">Things are not looking promising for KuCoin (KCS) as a 45-minute security breach on April 23rd, 2023, led to significant investor losses. The so-far unidentified hackers gained access to the KuCoin (KCS) platform and posted a fake event, leading to losses of 22,628 USD worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a result, the price of KCS has dropped from $9.05 to $7.61 as traders worry about their portfolios' safety. </p>
<p class="s3">KuCoin (KCS) is currently ranked 62nd on the Coinmarketcap and is trading at a loss of 0.60%, and experts believe this value will continue to drop. With KuCoin&rsquo;s (KCS) increasing safety concerns, more secure tokens like Yachtify are quickly gaining headway in the market. </p>
<p class="s3">We believe this is a unique opportunity for everyday crypto investors to tap into the recession-proof industry. Check Yachtify out below:</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Amidst the varying magnitude of price actions going on every minute in the crypto market, Sparklo has become a source of consistent hope that investors look to in making significant gains. </p>
<p class="s6">Meanwhile, tokens like Fantom (FTM) and Optimism (OP) leave investors second-guessing their next line of action as these coins fail to stabilize. However, volatility in the crypto market is what investors have come to expect in the crypto market. Issues lie in how they respond to price actions.</p>
<p class="s8">Fantom (FTM) Struggle Continues in the Crypto Market</p>
<p class="s6">The price of Fantom (FTM) failed to gain any price value as it lost -1.1% in the last 24 hours to stay at a current price of $0.411. The price decline of Fantom (FTM) went as far back as the last 14 days where statistics show a loss of -20.9% in the price value. Experts are suggesting that a bearish run of Fantom (FTM) may be coming to an end.</p>
<p class="s6">Fantom (FTM) has a circulating supply of 2.787B while the market cap stands at $1.146B. The trading volume of Fantom (FTM) in the last 24 hours is 103.486M. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Optimism (OP) Fails to Regain Lost Grounds with Yet Another Negative Price Action</p>
<p class="s6">The crypto market has witnessed yet another bad day for Optimism (OP) as the coin records a loss of -1.53% in the last 24 hours. While this may seem insignificant, going back to the last 7 days shows that Optimism (OP) has also lost -3.91%.</p>
<p class="s6">The last time Optimism (OP) saw a price rally was when some executives in the Optimism (OP) venture capital such as Andreessen Horowitz firm made a series of tweets in the middle of April which got the market talking and eventually raised the price value. However, the price of Optimism (OP) has maintained a downward trend since then. It is yet to be seen how far the bearish run of Optimism (OP) will go.</p>
<p class="s6">The trading volume of Optimism (OP) in the last 24 hours is $64.74M while the circulation supply is 314.84M. The market cap of Optimism (OP) is $660.79M.</p>
<p class="s8">More Investors Queue in on the Sparklo (SPRK) Project</p>
<p class="s6">It is not often that one sees investors and experts alike back a crypto project. However, that is the case with Sparklo as more investors and analysts foresee a very promising investment in the project.</p>
<p class="s6">While Sparklo is still in its presale phase, it is already tipped to end up becoming a blue-chip crypto with the massive potential for growth that the project shows.</p>
<p class="s6">Sparklo will be the first investment platform that will allow members the opportunity to invest in real-life assets like Silver Gold and Platinum. These assets will be backed by NFTs which will represent the luxury investments. </p>
<p class="s6">At the price of just $0.017, investors know how much of a bargain Sparklo is at the moment. That's not all, investors that purchase 1000 SPRK will get a 30% bonus. This means that investors will get 130000 SPRK for the price of 100000. The offer is valid until the 5th of May 2023. As most experienced investors already know, investing in projects early will result in significant gains.</p>
<p class="s6">Sparklo has been tipped by some experts to rise to up to 4,000% in the near future. We believe that the Sparklo project is a very promising investment opportunity which you should check out below:</p>

4. Access Protocol (ACS): Unlock the power of blockchain

<p class="s9">The Sandbox (SAND): Join The Blockchain Gaming Revolution</p>
<p class="s6">The Sandbox (SAND) is a cryptocurrency asset built exclusively for creatives and developers, providing them with autonomous ownership of their works. </p>
<p class="s6">The Sandbox (SAND)&rsquo;s market entrance generated a stir because of its unique concept of empowering users to take complete control and earn rewards through participation in the NFT sector. </p>
<p class="s6">As of now, The Sandbox (SAND) is trading at $0.505666, with a 24-hour trading volume of $74,665,346. According to market predictions, The Sandbox is expected to reach a minimum level of $1.16 by 2024 due to its continuous adoption.</p>
<p class="s6">Floki Inu (FLOKI): From A Tweet To A Thriving Crypto</p>
<p class="s6">Floki Inu (FLOKI) is a cryptocurrency that belongs to the group of tokens inspired by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Floki Inu (FLOKI) was created after a tweet by Elon Musk, in which he mentioned that he had a new pet dog called Floki, a Shiba Inu (SHIB) breed.</p>
<p class="s6">A team of developers seized this opportunity and turned it into a new crypto project, which attracted many investors.</p>
<p class="s6">Floki Inu (FLOKI) is currently trading at $0.00003584 and experts predict that the price of Floki Inu (FLOKI) will reach $0.00001287 by 2024 as more users are getting attracted to the project.</p>
<p class="s6">Access Protocol (ACS): Unlock the power of blockchain</p>
<p class="s6">Access Protocol (ACS) provides an innovative approach for digital media publishers and creators to earn money from their work.

Moreover, the news that UpBit, a cryptocurrency exchange, is now supporting Access Protocol (ACS) is excellent news for traders.</p>
<p class="s6">SingularityNET (AGIX): Invest in the power of decentralized AI</p>
<p class="s6">SingularityNET (AGIX) is a prominent decentralized initiative that seamlessly blends artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. It operates as a decentralized platform for AI algorithms where developers can create, distribute, and monetize AI services.</p>
<p class="s6">As of today, SingularityNET (AGIX) price stands at $0.244660. Experts predict that by 2024, SingularityNET (AGIX)'s minimum value will reach $0.73. Given the increasing demand for AI and blockchain, SingularityNET (AGIX)'s market share is expected to grow even further.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx (Werx): Empowering Freelancers To Reach New Heights</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx, the groundbreaking blockchain platform for freelancers, is taking the crypto space by storm. With a unique approach to freelance transactions, Uwerx will serve as a safe and secure intermediary between freelancers and clients, ensuring both parties are protected by its cutting-edge payment processing system.</p>
<p class="s6">But that's not all &ndash; Uwerx will change the game with its flat fee of just 1%, making it more affordable than traditional freelance marketplaces that charge exorbitant fees of up to 20%. And with InterFi Network and SolidProof approving audits of the project, users can be certain that their funds are in good hands.</p>
<p class="s6">What's truly remarkable about Uwerx is the team's commitment to investor protection. They will renounce contract ownership and implement a 25 years liquidity locking period post-presale, ensuring that investors' interests are protected and rug pulls are prevented.</p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx (WERX) Presale Keeps Exploding</p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx presale has been booming so far with the first and second stages finishing in 17 days and 8 days respectively. The third presale stage has begun, and on Saturday 29th April at 19:00 UTC, WERX has risen to $0.244 &nbsp;and the bonus on purchases will be decreasing to 20%.</p>
<p class="s6">Its also worth noting that Uwerx has been listed on Coinsnipper and has over 3,000 users so far. &nbsp;The Uwerx Vault has been unveiled on Friday 28th April, and users will can store their WERX tokens in the vault for various lengths of time to get rewards based on the platform&rsquo;s variables.</p>
<p class="s6">Analysts predict potential growth of up to $1.8 by Q3 2024 &ndash; a staggering 16,900% increase! Join the buzz and be a part of the future of freelancing with Uwerx.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Investors and traders who diversify their holdings consistently will typically pick up cryptocurrencies such as Quant (QNT) and Algorand (ALGO) with the goal of getting the most out of the blockchain space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through diversification, investors can get a lot more exposure in their portfolios to different projects and can support developers as well to disrupt a specific industry. As of recently, however, both of these cryptocurrencies have begun to decrease in value, and as such, investors have begun to turn to Tradecurve.io, a hybrid-exchange which is set to change the landscape of the financial markets and cryptocurrency exchanges as we know it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we will discuss each project to see what one we believe will perform best.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quant (QNT)</p>
<p>Quant (QNT) published an article where they went over how the Banking Giant Citi predicted $4 trillion to $5 trillion of tokenized digital securities and $1 trillion of distributed ledger technology would be in circulation, and half could be using third-party DLT-linked models.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Quant (QNT) CEO Gilbert Verdian will appear at the Financial Times Live's FTCrypto event with the Bank of England's Tom Mutton on May 9.</p>
<p>As a result, the overall community behind Quant (QNT) shared some level of excitement, but this did not lead to an increase in its value.</p>
<p>Specifically, as of April 27, 2023,&nbsp; Quant (QNT) traded at $110.93. Within the last 24 hours, Quant (QNT) saw a decrease in its value by 3.2%. In the last 30 days, Quant (QNT)'s overall decrease was at 6.7%. With all of this in mind, investors are worried about the future of Quant (QNT).</p>
<p>Algorand (ALGO)</p>
<p>The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at the Algorand (ALGO) Foundation, John Woods, went over how anyone can get POAPs at the Consensus 2023 event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the Algorand (ALGO) Developers page showcased AlgoKit, which enables users to set up their development environment within 10 minutes and deploy their first smart contract with ease.</p>
<p>When we go over the value of the Algorand (ALGO) cryptocurrency, as of April 27, 2023, Algorand (ALGO) traded at $0.182166.</p>
<p>Within the last 24 hours, Algorand (ALGO) decreased in value by 5.3%. In the last 30 days, Algorand (ALGO)&rsquo;s overall decrease has been at 9.4%. This has also left investors worried about the future of Algorand (ALGO).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) Presale continues Bullish Outlook</p>
<p>Tradecurve.io is being developed as a hybrid exchange that will bring together some of the best elements that investors and traders love in both Centralized and Decentralized exchanges. Tradecurve&rsquo;s platform allows users to create an account by simply registering their email address, users then connect their DeFi wallet, deposit funds and can instantly begin trading. All users have full control over their private keys and will not need to complete a KYC procedure.</p>
<p>The Tradecurve platform aims to raise $20 million in the presale and is looking towards onboarding 100,000 clients within the first three months of its launch. This makes it a major player in the Web3 space that is competing with the likes of Binance, Coinbase and Kraken.</p>
<p>Tradecurve native utility token TCRV is currently in presale trading at $0.01, analysts predict that TCRV will climb in value by 100x when it launches. Tradecurve&rsquo;s smart contract has been audited by CyberScope and an internal KYC was completed by AssureDeFi to provide full transparency to customers of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only 40% of the total TCRV supply will be available throughout the presale and with many experts tipping Tradecurve to become the next 100x token now is a great time to get involved.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investors and traders who diversify their holdings consistently will typically pick up cryptocurrencies such as Quant (QNT) and Algorand (ALGO) with the goal of getting the most out of the blockchain space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through diversification, investors can get a lot more exposure in their portfolios to different projects and can support developers as well to disrupt a specific industry. As of recently, however, both of these cryptocurrencies have begun to decrease in value, and as such, investors have begun to turn to Tradecurve.io, a hybrid-exchange which is set to change the landscape of the financial markets and cryptocurrency exchanges as we know it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we will discuss each project to see what one we believe will perform best.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quant (QNT)</p>
<p>Quant (QNT) published an article where they went over how the Banking Giant Citi predicted $4 trillion to $5 trillion of tokenized digital securities and $1 trillion of distributed ledger technology would be in circulation, and half could be using third-party DLT-linked models.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Quant (QNT) CEO Gilbert Verdian will appear at the Financial Times Live's FTCrypto event with the Bank of England's Tom Mutton on May 9.</p>
<p>As a result, the overall community behind Quant (QNT) shared some level of excitement, but this did not lead to an increase in its value.</p>
<p>Specifically, as of April 27, 2023,&nbsp; Quant (QNT) traded at $110.93. Within the last 24 hours, Quant (QNT) saw a decrease in its value by 3.2%. In the last 30 days, Quant (QNT)'s overall decrease was at 6.7%. With all of this in mind, investors are worried about the future of Quant (QNT).</p>
<p>Algorand (ALGO)</p>
<p>The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at the Algorand (ALGO) Foundation, John Woods, went over how anyone can get POAPs at the Consensus 2023 event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the Algorand (ALGO) Developers page showcased AlgoKit, which enables users to set up their development environment within 10 minutes and deploy their first smart contract with ease.</p>
<p>When we go over the value of the Algorand (ALGO) cryptocurrency, as of April 27, 2023, Algorand (ALGO) traded at $0.182166.</p>
<p>Within the last 24 hours, Algorand (ALGO) decreased in value by 5.3%. In the last 30 days, Algorand (ALGO)&rsquo;s overall decrease has been at 9.4%. This has also left investors worried about the future of Algorand (ALGO).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) Presale continues Bullish Outlook</p>
<p>Tradecurve.io is being developed as a hybrid exchange that will bring together some of the best elements that investors and traders love in both Centralized and Decentralized exchanges. Tradecurve&rsquo;s platform allows users to create an account by simply registering their email address, users then connect their DeFi wallet, deposit funds and can instantly begin trading. All users have full control over their private keys and will not need to complete a KYC procedure.</p>
<p>The Tradecurve platform aims to raise $20 million in the presale and is looking towards onboarding 100,000 clients within the first three months of its launch. This makes it a major player in the Web3 space that is competing with the likes of Binance, Coinbase and Kraken.</p>
<p>Tradecurve native utility token TCRV is currently in presale trading at $0.01, analysts predict that TCRV will climb in value by 100x when it launches. Tradecurve&rsquo;s smart contract has been audited by CyberScope and an internal KYC was completed by AssureDeFi to provide full transparency to customers of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only 40% of the total TCRV supply will be available throughout the presale and with many experts tipping Tradecurve to become the next 100x token now is a great time to get involved.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US Chamber of Commerce has criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its "haphazard" approach to regulating the cryptocurrency industry.&nbsp;</p>
SEC Has Muddied The Waters: USCC
<p>The United States Chamber of Commerce (USCC), representing over three million businesses across the United States, released a statement on Wednesday accusing the SEC of creating confusion and uncertainty in the industry.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the SEC's lack of clear guidelines and inconsistent enforcement actions have hindered innovation and investment in the cryptocurrency space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excerpts from the statement read,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it stands today, nobody knows for certain which digital assets, if any, are 'securities' under federal law&hellip;The SEC has deliberately muddied the waters by claiming sweeping authority over digital assets while deploying a haphazard, enforcement-based approach. This regulatory chaos is by design, not happenstance.&rdquo;</p>

USCC Stands With Coinbase
<p>The Chamber of Commerce urged the SEC to provide clear and consistent regulatory guidance to help businesses navigate the complex and rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>The statement is part of an amicus brief in the Coinbase vs. SEC legal battle, where the Chamber of Commerce has extended its support to the crypto exchange. The term "amicus brief" is of Latin origin and means "friend of the court," referring to guidance or knowledge shared by external parties who are not directly involved in a particular court case.</p>
USCC Calls Out &ldquo;Unlawful&rdquo; SEC Actions
<p>Metaverse attorney James Murphy, who is active on Twitter as MetaLawMan, has pointed out the significance of the Chamber of Commerce standing up for crypto and against the regulatory body, going as far as calling its actions unlawful. Since this organization is much more influential than the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Murphy believes its arguments will have more weight in the court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Murphy writes,</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chamber makes 3 arguments - (1) Regulatory uncertainty is killing innovation in the U.S. (2) The SEC is destabilizing the digital assets regulatory environment. (3) The SEC is violating Constitutional Due Process and Fair Notice rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

SEC&rsquo;s Anti-Crypto Crackdown
<p>The SEC has been grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies for years. While some lawmakers and regulators have called for stricter industry oversight, others have argued that heavy-handed regulation could stifle innovation and hinder the sector's growth.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce's statement comes amid a flurry of regulatory activity in the cryptocurrency space. Back in 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, alleging that the company had conducted an unregistered securities offering. Ripple has denied the allegations and vowed to fight the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More recently, the regulatory body has targeted the Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital over allegations of securities law violation.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Things could go from bad to worse for BlockFi users after a judge ruled against a petition to recover $300 million in Bitcoin and turn it over to users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BlockFi had filed for bankruptcy in 2022 following turmoil in the crypto space that saw the collapse of several crypto lenders.&nbsp;</p>
Major Setback For Some BlockFi Users
<p>According to a report, some BlockFi users have suffered a major setback after a judge denied them the possibility of recovering their funds. According to the report, the users in question unintentionally forfeited their right to the crypto assets held on the bankrupt lending platform. US Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan announced the decision. During proceedings, the judge dismissed the argument the platform&rsquo;s customers put forward, stating that, in this case, the users in question forfeited the right to their assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While controversial, the decision is considered standard in other similar cases. BlockFi was one of the companies severely impacted by the 2022 crypto winter, which saw major crypto lenders collapse, putting the price of almost all major cryptocurrencies on a downward spiral. The situation in the crypto space worsened thanks to the collapse of FTX. FTX was the parent entity of several lenders, including BlockFi. In this context, judges have sided with the crypto companies when determining whether users that held interest-bearing accounts could retain ownership of their coins.&nbsp;</p>
The Question Of Customer Funds&nbsp;
<p>Several questions about the ownership of customer funds were also raised during the bankruptcy proceedings of other lenders, such as Voyager Digital and Celsius Network. In those cases, judges ruled that funds that were held in interest-bearing accounts were the property of the bankrupt company and would be pooled with other assets and used to repay creditors of the company in question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it came to BlockFi and its users, the circumstances were harsher compared to others, given the company had to go through a series of potential acquisitions. However, after none went through, it was forced to declare bankruptcy. Judge Kaplan cited a critical lack of communication between BlockFi and its users as the basis of the decision. BlockFi&rsquo;s case was especially complicated as the division between account types on the platform became confusing following the freezing of accounts by the company on the 10th of November, shortly before filing for bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, BlockFi did not fully disable client-facing functions on its app, creating a situation that Judge Kaplan called &ldquo;confusing, misleading, and frustrating.&rdquo; Some BlockFi users had attempted to transfer around $375 million from their interest-bearing accounts into their wallets following BlockFi&rsquo;s shutdown. While they received a confirmation that the transfers in question were completed, the information given to them was incorrect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lawyers representing this group of customers argued that BlockFi should honor the transfers and return the funds to the affected customers. However, Judge Kaplan ruled that BlockFi&rsquo;s terms of service allowed the company to block transfer requests as part of its shutdown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite simply, a customer&rsquo;s withdrawal or transfer request on the user interface did not and does not automatically transfer digital assets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael Slade, the attorney for BlockFi, had argued in an earlier hearing that allowing the customers to transfer $375 million would significantly impact the recovery process for Wallet customers. He stated that it could also possibly prevent the company from returning customer funds due to the difficulty involved in sorting out how to pay additional wallet claims from a fixed asset pool.&nbsp;</p>
Not All Doom And Gloom&nbsp;
<p>However, there was good news for some customers as the bankrupt crypto lender received court permission to return around $297 million to customers with non-interest-bearing accounts. Bankruptcy judge Michael Kaplan ruled that customers were the owners of their deposits in BlockFi&rsquo;s wallet program. The wallet program did not pay out interest to customers and kept these funds separate from the company&rsquo;s other funds.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>This article will offer insights into the latest and most relevant updates in the crypto world, focusing on Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s (BIG) launch date, a bull market for Fantom (FTM), and the recent struggle of Uniswap (UNI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into how these tokens are performing and their potential for future growth!</p>
<p>BIG&rsquo;s Launch Date!</p>
<p>After months of suspense, the launch date of Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has finally been&nbsp; announced. The token&rsquo;s immensely popular presale will come to an end on June 3rd, and the official launch will take place less than two weeks later, on June 15th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin has raised over $35 million in investments, making it the largest presale token of 2023! Furthermore, the token is well-known for its exceptional offers and bonus deals. If you are among the many investors and meme coin fans that want to collect BIG tokens while they are still cheap, make sure to use the code END300 to receive an extra 300% discount on your purchase!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fantom Enables Token Trading Via Twitter!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fantom (FTM) was initially created as a smart contract platform, making it a viable alternative to Ethereum. The primary objective behind its design was to address the shortcomings of prior blockchains in areas such as scalability, security, and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its launch, the platform has been particularly successful in solving issues related to transaction speed, having achieved a reduction of less than two seconds!</p>
<p>Recently, FTM has experienced a significant surge in value. This is thanks to a new feature that enables users to send FTM and other tokens within the Fantom ecosystem via Twitter. This works by connecting users' Twitter accounts to their messenger which can transfer tokens to specific identities. Since a significant number of crypto communities connect on Twitter, FTM has made the perfect choice to incorporate this platform, which is why their recent rally may be just the beginning!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Uniswap Declines by 40%!</p>
<p>Uniswap (UNI) was founded in 2018 by a man named Hayden Adams, who aimed to offer the market a more efficient platform for cryptocurrency trading. To his success, UNI has become one of the most popular siteswaps on the crypto market today!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, UNI has seen a significant price drop in the last few months and its year-on-year performance has fallen by almost 40%! The price reports display a steady resistance at $5.60 and support at $5. Upon entering 2023, the crypto&rsquo;s recovery has been notably sluggish. Despite reaching an all-time trading volume of $1.5 trillion, Uniswap has faced challenges in maintaining its bullish momentum.</p>
<p>The crypto world is always evolving. BIG has had a hugely successful presale and will officially launch soon, offering bonus deals for investors. FTM has surged in value due to its integration with Twitter, allowing for easier token trading. However, UNI has struggled with a significant price drop over the past few months, and its recovery has been slow despite reaching an all-time high in trading volume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how these tokens develop in the future, but for now, BIG and FTM appear to be offering potential for growth, while UNI faces challenges.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized application (dApp) provider and crypto wallet MetaMask has announced a partnership with payment service provider PayPal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership will allow MetaMask users in the United States to purchase ETH via PayPal and purchase, sell, and hold ETH directly in their wallets.&nbsp;</p>
Purchase ETH Through PayPal&nbsp;
<p>With the announcement, MetaMask claims to have become the first Web 3.0 wallet to offer ETH transaction options via PayPal. The collaboration allows MetaMask users based in the United States of America to use PayPal as their preferred payment method when purchasing ETH. The integration will also allow users to transfer ETH from PayPal to MetaMask. This is a significant boost when it comes to promoting the self-custody of crypto assets. In a press release, MetaMask stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;MetaMask is the first web3 wallet to enable users to buy ETH using PayPal, a leader in the digital payment space. In addition to purchasing ETH directly, the integration also supports the transfer of ETH from PayPal to MetaMask, aiding in more self-custody adoption.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to reports, PayPal partnered with MetaMask&rsquo;s parent company, ConsenSys, in December 2022. Back then, the parties announced that the partnership would help users to purchase cryptocurrencies and explore the larger Web 3.0 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Joining A Vast Ecosystem&nbsp;
<p>The partnership with MetaMask sees PayPal join a vast ecosystem of payment providers that have already integrated with MetaMask. These include giants such as MoonPay, Coinbase Pay, Transak, Wyre, Sardine, and a host of others. In a report filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), PayPal stated that it held around $943 million in crypto assets as of 31st March 2023. This represents a significant 56% jump from the previous quarter when it reported crypto assets worth $604 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The news of the MetaMask and PayPal integration comes just weeks after MetaMask announced the launch of a new feature that allowed users to purchase crypto directly from its Portfolio dApp using fiat currency. The new feature, called &ldquo;Buy Crypto,&rdquo; allows users to purchase a range of cryptocurrencies via a number of payment methods, such as credit and debit cards or bank transfers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service will cover over 189 countries and will support over 90 different cryptocurrencies spread over eight networks. These networks include the likes of Arbitrum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Ethereum, Fantom, Optimis, Celo, and Avalanche. &ldquo;Buy Crypto&rdquo; considers the user&rsquo;s location and local regulations before providing them with a customized quote.&nbsp;</p>
MetaMask&rsquo;s Push For New Partnerships&nbsp;
<p>MetaMask has been making a greater push for integrations and partnerships in an effort to expand its global reach and offer on-ramps for its growing customer base. Recently it sought to expand the direct access to cryptocurrencies in Nigeria through a partnership with MoonPay, a crypto fintech firm. The partnership allows MetaMask to allow users based in Nigeria to purchase cryptocurrencies instantly using bank transfers. Nigeria is one of the leading nations when it comes to crypto adoption, according to the 2022 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Stablecoin issuer Circle has reportedly adjusted its treasury reserves to mitigate the risk of US debt defaults.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Amid the ongoing banking crisis in the United States, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire stated on May 10 that the company has altered the mix of reserves backing its USD Coin (USDC) by transitioning to short-dated US Treasurys to sidestep potential involvement in a US debt default. Allaire explains that Circle no longer holds Treasuries with maturities beyond early June to minimize debt exposure.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We don't want to carry exposure through a potential breach of the ability of the U.S. government to pay its debts," the executive said.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Blackrock-managed Circle Reserve Fund reveals holdings maturing no later than May 31.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently indicated that the government would have to make "decisions" if Congress fails to raise the federal debt limit. The $24 trillion Treasury market and the global financial system could experience significant disruption if the country defaulted on its debts. Currently, US President Joe Biden and Republicans are in disagreement over raising the $31.4 trillion borrowing limit.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Tether, another stablecoin issuer, claims that most of its reserves are invested in Treasury bills with an average maturity of fewer than 90 days. According to a May 10 quarterly assurance report, the firm has been "working to take steps to reduce its reliance on pure bank deposits as a source of liquidity."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Over the past year, the USDC supply has been declining, dropping by 46% from its all-time high of $56 billion in June 2022. This has led to a decrease in its market share to 23%, with a circulation of $30 billion. In contrast, rival Tether's market dominance has increased to 62%, with a circulation of $82 billion USDT (USDT). Notably, Circle recently launched a cross-chain transfer protocol for $USDC via Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Circle's USDC stablecoin remains the second-largest stablecoin with a market cap of $30 billion. This year, Circle has faced turbulent times, with the USDC stablecoin losing its peg in March 2023, leading to significant withdrawals from the USD Coin and a market cap drop of over 25%.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">As part of the collaboration, World ID, a decentralized, privacy-first identity protocol, will be available on OP Mainnet, and the World App will migrate from Polygon to OP Mainnet.

<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Decentralized identity is central to the Optimism Collective's goal of building an economic engine that fuels positive-sum games. Bringing World ID to OP Mainnet lays the groundwork for scaling the future home of web3 identity and governance.

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin's alignment with the Optimism ecosystem dates back to December 2020, with work on Hubble, an optimistic rollup optimized for simple payments. World App beta launched using Hubble before moving to Polygon PoS due to user demand for features beyond Hubble&rsquo;s capabilities and the high costs associated with Optimism and Arbitrum at the time.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Collaboration between Worldcoin and Optimism has been ongoing for roughly a year, with joint contributions to EIP-4844, which aims to reduce Layer 2 fees by 10x. Coinbase has also contributed to EIP-4844, working towards Optimism's Superchain vision via its Layer 2 network dubbed Base. EIP-4844 is set to potentially help in accelerating adoption in the Optimism ecosystem and significantly boosting World App transactions across Ethereum Layer 2s with the wallet's migration to OP Mainnet.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance.US, the American subsidiary of the world's largest crypto exchange, is reportedly exploring ways to reduce the stake of its owner and founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Sources indicate that CZ has been trying to sell part of his stake since last summer, and recent regulatory scrutiny may be a driving force behind the decision.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Launched sometime 2019, Binance.US is a separate entity from the global exchange. However, given the recent legal issues involving Binance and CZ, executives are considering limiting the exchange's relationship with its founder to alleviate regulatory pressure. The US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has charged Zhao with willful evasion of federal law and ostensibly operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange. Reducing CZ's majority stake in Binance US may help the exchange secure necessary regulatory licenses for smooth operation in the US market.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Over the past year, Binance and CZ have faced increased scrutiny from US regulators. In response to the CFTC lawsuit, Binance has emphasized its commitment to regulatory compliance, implementing a "three lines of defense" approach to risk and compliance. As CZ remains the majority owner of Binance US, the management team is reportedly seeking ways to reduce his stake and influence over the company to mitigate potential regulatory obstacles.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, a recent report from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) reveals that the share of global crypto developers based in the United States declined by 26% between 2018 and 2022. The report cites lack of regulatory clarity as a possible reason for the decline, which may have hindered the growth of web3 in the US.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite this situation, a16z claims that it remains hopeful that the US may regain some of its lost ground, citing multiple bills tabled in Congress seeking regulatory clarity for crypto assets, as well as several impactful crypto cases that may soon be decided. These include the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement action on Ripple, the Treasury Department's Tornado Cash civil actions, and the bankruptcy proceedings of firms such as FTX, Voyager, and Celsius.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In recent months, the SEC has targeted American-based crypto exchanges, imposing regulations similar to those applied to banks and stock brokerages. This crackdown has prompted several major players, including Coinbase and Gemini, among others, to consider moving their operations offshore. Exchanges such as Kraken and Bittrex have already shuttered or reduced their services in the United States as the war on crypto continues.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ethereum's Beacon Chain recently experienced a temporary issue, halting transaction finalization for roughly 25 minutes. Although new blocks could be proposed, a still unknown problem prevented them from being finalized.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">A similar issue already occurred on the Goerli testnet version of Ethereum's "Shapella" upgrade earlier in March. The Shapella upgrade which was successfully executed on the mainnet on April 12. The Beacon Chain, launched in 2020, represents Ethereum's original proof-of-stake blockchain. In September 2022, Ethereum's pre-existing proof-of-work chain "merged" with the Beacon Chain, completing the network's transition to a faster and more eco-friendly proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Finality refers to the guarantee that cryptocurrency transactions cannot be altered, reversed, or canceled after completion, ensuring that the executed transactions on the blockchain will not be lost. Blockchain protocols typically display probabilistic transaction finality, with transactions becoming "more and more final" over time as more blocks are confirmed.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Developers are still investigating the cause of the disruption on Ethereum's Beacon Chain. During the incident, the network's latency affected its finality rate, and validators encountered issues as the number of attestations received for Ethereum epochs 200,552 to 200,554 saw a sharp decline. The problem was resolved within 30 minutes, with transaction finality being restored.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Following the 25-minute pause, Ethereum core developer and Prysmatic Labs co-founder Preston Van Loon announced that "finality has been restored."</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Finality has been restored. We do not know the root cause yet, but something happened to cause several client implementations to work really hard to keep up with the chain.</p>
&mdash; prestonvanloon.eth (@preston_vanloon) May 11, 2023

<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Data from blockchain analytics provider Beaconcha.in shows that Ethereum epochs 200,552 to 200,554 experienced a sudden decline in the number of attestations. Notably, Prysm was previously a supermajority client for Ethereum.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The issue's cause remains unknown, but Ethereum developers are investigating the occurrence to prevent future occurrences. Ethereum Beacon Chain consultant Superphiz highlighted the importance of "client diversity" in mitigating the impact of such issues, emphasizing that a more secure and robust network for validators could be achieved with no client having more than 33% control.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Decentralization on all levels limits the impact of these events, regardless of what caused this we must continue hardening every vector," superphiz.eth shared.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s4">Since the unprecedented rise of Bitcoin and accompanying cryptocurrencies, we've witnessed the rise of various trends, meme coins of the most renowned. Ideally, meme coins are depicted by animated or comical memes with support from millions of enthusiasts globally. While hundreds of meme coins exist, approximately 340, per CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin Pepe is the latest coin in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Bitcoin Pepe is an internet meme featuring Pepe the Frog, an internet character surrounded by or holding Bitcoin or other crypto-related symbols. Over the years, this popular meme character has become a sign of support for Bitcoin and altcoins. And a verbal commitment to keep holding cryptocurrencies as part of a long-term investment strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s9">Pepe the Frog and Bitcoin&mdash;the Connection&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Created by cartoonist Matt Furi, Pepe was part of Matt&rsquo;s 2015 Boy&rsquo;s Club comic. The meme&rsquo;s popularity grew exponentially, especially on MySpace, 4Chan, and Gala Online. Now, while Pepe has existed since way before Bitcoin&rsquo;s revolutionary launch in 2009, the connection could be traced back to the origin of &ldquo;HODL,&rdquo; the popular crypto term for holding cryptocurrencies as long-term investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">A misspelling of the word &ldquo;hold&rdquo; on a Bitcoin forum created the term &ldquo;HODL&rdquo; and has become an integral part of Pepe and Bitcoin&rsquo;s existence. Pepe became a constant feature of most Bitcoin-themed memes and has become what we know it to be today&mdash;an unwritten representation of support for holding Bitcoin and altcoins. Pepe and Bitcoin&rsquo;s connection has led to a notable overlap as these separate yet intertwined cultures share similar values and beliefs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Like Bitcoin, Pepe has been caught up in controversies and hate, especially by the far-right corner. However, Pepe&rsquo;s connection to Bitcoin remains devoid of political sentiment and merely focuses on an irreverent view of traditional finance. Additionally, it highlights the influence of internet culture and emerging technologies. As well as how both can revamp, on a grander scale, cultural discourse.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">The commingling of Pepe the Frog and Bitcoin led to the creation and subsequent launch of Bitcoin Pepe&mdash;a revolutionary meme coin built on the premise of holding cryptocurrencies to earn multiple rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s9">The $BTCPEP Token&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Bitcoin Pepe allows its token&mdash;$BTCPEP&mdash;and NFT holders to earn BTC. Community members are rewarded in the form of BTC for holding on to $BTCPEP. It doesn't end there; Bitcoin Pepe also introduces upgradeable NFTs featuring Pepe the Frog in different positions, holding the Bitcoin logo.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Bitcoin Pepe has a total supply of 222 billion $BTCPEP tokens. And according to the team, 60% of that was sent to a liquidity pool, locked and burnt. 10% will be paid for centralized exchange listings, bridges, and LPs. The remainder 30%, on the other hand, is locked separately and linearly vested over 12 months and will serve staking and rewarding purposes for its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s9">The Project Roadmap&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">The Bitcoin Pepe team has released an ambitious yet realistic roadmap, split into four phases. Centralized exchange listing, token airdrop, collaborations, partnerships, and the highly anticipated BitcoinPepe NFT drop are part of the second phase of the roadmap.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">The launch of the dynamic Bitcoin Pepe ecosystem, staking and earning of $BTCPEP, NFT staking, Bitcoin Pepe merchandise, tools, and additional exchange listings are also a part of the third and final phase of the project roadmap. Through a series of marketing campaigns, the team hopes to reach and exceed 50,000 $BTCPEP holders at the end of the fourth and final phase of the project plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s4">Like Bitcoin, Pepe has been caught up in controversies and hate, especially by the far-right corner. However, Pepe&rsquo;s connection to Bitcoin remains devoid of political sentiment and merely focuses on an irreverent view of traditional finance. Additionally, it highlights the influence of internet culture and emerging technologies. As well as how both can revamp, on a grander scale, cultural discourse.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">The commingling of Pepe the Frog and Bitcoin led to the creation and subsequent launch of Bitcoin Pepe&mdash;a revolutionary meme coin built on the premise of holding cryptocurrencies to earn multiple rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s9">The $BTCPEP Token&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Bitcoin Pepe allows its token&mdash;$BTCPEP&mdash;and NFT holders to earn BTC. Community members are rewarded in the form of BTC for holding on to $BTCPEP. It doesn't end there; Bitcoin Pepe also introduces upgradeable NFTs featuring Pepe the Frog in different positions, holding the Bitcoin logo.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Bitcoin Pepe has a total supply of 222 billion $BTCPEP tokens. And according to the team, 60% of that was sent to a liquidity pool, locked and burnt. 10% will be paid for centralized exchange listings, bridges, and LPs. The remainder 30%, on the other hand, is locked separately and linearly vested over 12 months and will serve staking and rewarding purposes for its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s9">The Project Roadmap&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">The Bitcoin Pepe team has released an ambitious yet realistic roadmap, split into four phases. Centralized exchange listing, token airdrop, collaborations, partnerships, and the highly anticipated BitcoinPepe NFT drop are part of the second phase of the roadmap.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">The launch of the dynamic Bitcoin Pepe ecosystem, staking and earning of $BTCPEP, NFT staking, Bitcoin Pepe merchandise, tools, and additional exchange listings are also a part of the third and final phase of the project roadmap. Through a series of marketing campaigns, the team hopes to reach and exceed 50,000 $BTCPEP holders at the end of the fourth and final phase of the project plan.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>PacWest Bancorp price is on the receiving end of a 24% loss today. Bitcoin is down 2%. Which of these is most likely to make a comeback?</p>
PacWest - dead man walking
<p>For PacWest Bancorp the writing is very much already inscribed on the wall. Down 83% since the end of February this year, we are just awaiting the last rites and for the fat lady to sing.</p>
<p>Deposits declined nearly 10% over the previous week, and the bleeding can only continue for so long before the shrivelled corpse of PacWest becomes the next casualty for the banks.</p>
<p>If the bank were to come back like Lazarus from the dead, the question would have to be asked &ldquo;who would think to put their cash into this bank&rdquo;? Of course, the answer would be &ldquo;nobody&rdquo;.</p>
What stops this banking crisis?
<p>Money markets return a better percentage than banks, and in this current environment they are certainly a lot safer. The banking crisis that is taking place now is going to be one that will be infernally difficult for central banks to put the lid back on.</p>
<p>When confidence goes in a bank it is only a matter of time. Back in the day, the banking system cracks could have been papered over. Yes, the odd bank might have failed but there were plenty of others, and the debt wasn&rsquo;t so ridiculously large.</p>
<p>However, the Global Financial Crisis of 2007/8 took the system to the limit, and the Federal Reserve had to pour currency back into the banks, and only just managed to stave off a potential globally systemic meltdown.</p>
<p>This time, the debt is exponentially worse and there are literally thousands of banks sitting on assets that are worth less than their liabilities.</p>
<p>Five banks are already gone. Credit Suisse was sold to UBS but had it not been, it could only have lasted a few more days before crashing into the dust, and sparking off a contagion which would likely have brought the whole industry down.</p>
Bitcoin stricken but otherwise healthy
<p>Amid this banking carnage Bitcoin is having some issues of its own. It really looks like it is going to head back down to the $25,000 support level at least.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be that as it may, this is likely a blip in Bitcoin&rsquo;s incredible trajectory. Going back to the $25k or $20k supports is a healthy correction before Bitcoin starts its latest bull run in earnest.</p>
<p>For such a scarce asset, which is outside of a crumbling financial system, the price is likely to head skywards. What will happen to the rest of the crypto ecosystem is a moot point. But for the average investor, Bitcoin at least is a flight to safety from what could be the most devastating financial crash in history.</p>
<p>It remains for the Federal Reserve, and the world&rsquo;s other premier central banks to do what they can to lift the traditional financial system out of a mire that is of their own making.</p>
