In comparison to the figures observed in previous months, the recent 247,016 burned XRP represents a significant increase. This development has prompted crypto enthusiasts to question the potential for further growth and whether it could drive XRP&#8217;s value to unprecedented heights. The increased burn rate and the subsequent reduction in XRP&#8217;s supply have sparked a wave of excitement among investors. It suggests the possibility of a bullish trend, with the burn rate potentially rising even further as trillions of dollars flow into the crypto market. XRP price trending above $0.47 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com Senior Ripple Engineer Shares Insight A deeper dive into the factors driving the heightened burn rate reveals valuable insights as a Software engineer at Ripple, Neil Hartner, shed light on the situation, attributing the surge to the deletion of XRPL accounts as a deleted account equals two XRP burned. Hartner specifically highlighted Poloniex, a leading crypto exchange, which recently deleted a staggering 85,566 outdated XRPL accounts. This action alone contributed to the burning of 171,132 XRP. As the burn rate accelerates and the supply of XRP dwindles, the prospect of XRP reaching $100 per token gains traction.  While some skeptics may question the validity of such a bold claim, the consistent upward trend in the burn rate provides a compelling argument if it continues at such a scale.  Related Reading: Zilliqa (ZIL) Notches 10% In Anticipation Of Network Upgrade The continuous rise in the burn rate and the deletion of XRPL accounts by prominent exchanges reflect the evolving landscape of the crypto market.
