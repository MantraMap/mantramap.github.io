His statement of support comes as the BRICS bloc is gaining global influence, with 19 countries seeking to join the group.</strong></p>
<h2>Brazilian President Lula Supports BRICS Currency Creation</h2>
<p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-brazil-lula/brazils-lula-supports-trading-currency-for-brics-countries-idUSL1N36T0YG">reiterated</a> Wednesday that he supported creating a currency for trading between BRICS countries, Reuters reported. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. In a speech during a trip to Spain, he said without providing further details:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am in favor of creating, within the BRICS, a trading currency between our countries, just like the Europeans created the euro.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lula&#8217;s support for the creation of a BRICS currency followed his statement urging developing countries to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-urges-developing-countries-to-abandon-dollar-as-global-reserve-currency/">stop using</a> the U.S. dollar and adopt local currencies instead. The Brazilian president said on April 13 during his visit to the New Development Bank in Shanghai, which was established by BRICS countries: &#8220;Why can’t an institution like the BRICS bank have a currency to finance trade relations between Brazil and China, between Brazil and all the other BRICS countries? Who decided that the dollar was the (trade) currency after the end of gold parity?&#8221;</p>

<p>The BRICS nations have been pushing to gain <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-push-to-expand-global-influence-to-counter-the-wests-destructive-actions/">global influence</a> to counter Western countries&#8217; &#8220;destructive actions&#8221; as they ramp up their de-dollarization efforts. Anil Sooklal, South Africa’s ambassador to the group, said this week that 13 countries have formally <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">asked to join</a> the BRIC bloc and six have informally asked, emphasizing: &#8220;We are getting applications to join every day.”</p>
<p>Other countries, such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesia-is-following-brics-de-dollarization-lead-says-central-bank-governor/">Indonesia</a>, have followed the BRICS&#8217; lead to shift away from using the U.S. dollar in trade settlements in favor of local currencies. Lula’s chief adviser on foreign policy, Celso Amorim, recently said China and Brazil could play <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/de-dollarization-china-brazil-can-be-instrumental-in-building-less-centralized-world-with-no-hegemony-says-lulas-adviser/">important roles</a> in building a less centralized world with no hegemony.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier that the issue of creating a common BRICS currency is expected to be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">discussed</a> at the leaders’ summit set for the end of August.</p>

<h2>Russian Official: Full-Scale World War III Should Not Materialize</h2>
<p>The deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, urged all countries to make efforts to avoid the outbreak of a new, full-scale global conflict Tuesday while addressing participants in the Znanie (Knowledge) educational marathon.</p>
<p>“I cannot say what the last straw, what the trigger may be. But it may happen at some point,” he was quoted by Russian news outlet Tass as saying. The official emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>We all need to work to ensure that this threat of global confrontation, of a hot, full-scale World War III should not materialize.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on the current conflict between Russia and Western countries, he stressed that Russia has no desire to see a war break out.</p>
<p>However, he said: “But world tensions are white-hot indeed.”</p>

<p>Noting that he and his friends &#8220;used to talk about confrontation with the United States, about confrontation between the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Alliance,” the Russian official stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back then it seemed like some kind of hypothetical, far-fetched and impossible scenario. But I can&#8217;t say that now, however sad this may sound.</p></blockquote>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said this week that anti-Russia sanctions will have a detrimental impact on the global economy, with the potential to spark a global <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/anti-russia-sanctions-will-trigger-global-economic-crisis-russian-official-warns/">economic crisis</a>. To reduce its dependence on the USD after the U.S. seized about $300 billion of its foreign reserves, Russia is pushing for the BRICS to gain <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-push-to-expand-global-influence-to-counter-the-wests-destructive-actions/">global influence</a>. The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are also working on creating a currency.</p>

If member nations use only a common BRICS currency for international trade, &#8220;they would remove an impediment that now thwarts their efforts to escape dollar hegemony,” he described.</strong></p>
<h2>Former White House Economic Advisor on BRICS Currency and U.S. Dollar&#8217;s Reserve Currency Status</h2>
<p>A former White House economic advisor, Joseph Sullivan, discussed de-dollarization and the potential impacts of a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">BRICS currency</a> on the USD in an opinion piece published by Foreign Policy Monday. The BRICS nations are Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Sullivan was a special advisor and staff economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Trump administration. He is currently a senior advisor at the Lindsey Group, an economic advisory firm. Referring to the hypothetical BRICS currency as &#8220;the bric,&#8221; he warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the BRICS used only the bric for international trade, they would remove an impediment that now thwarts their efforts to escape dollar hegemony.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Those efforts now often take the form of bilateral agreements to denominate trade in non-dollar currencies, like the yuan, now the main currency of trade between China and Russia,” he continued.</p>
<p>The former White House economic advisor believes that it is “realistic to imagine the BRICS using only the bric for trade.”</p>
<p>He added that with the creation of a BRICS currency:</p>
<blockquote><p>The BRICS would also be poised to achieve a level of self-sufficiency in international trade that has eluded the world’s other currency unions.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Because a BRICS currency union — unlike any before it — would not be among countries united by shared territorial borders, its members would likely be able to produce a wider range of goods than any existing monetary union,” he explained.</p>

<p>However, Sullivan expects the BRICS currency to “raise a litany of thorny practical concerns.”</p>
<p>He detailed: “Used primarily for international trade rather than domestic circulation within any one country, the bric would complicate the job of national central bankers in BRICS countries. Creating a supranational central bank like the European Central Bank to manage the bric would also take work. These are challenges—but not necessarily insurmountable ones.”</p>
<p>The economist proceeded to discuss the BRICS currency displacing the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency among member countries. He noted: “The dollar’s global role has always been a double-edged sword for the United States. Though it does allow Washington to add sanctions to its foreign-policy toolkit, by raising the price of the U.S. dollar, it raises the cost of American goods and services to the rest of the world, decreasing exports and costing the United States jobs.”</p>
<p>In conclusion, while clarifying that he believes “the dollar’s reign isn’t likely to end overnight,” the former White House advisor cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>A bric would begin the slow erosion of its dominance.</p></blockquote>
<p>A growing number of people have warned that the creation of a BRICS currency would <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-de-dollarization-push-china-and-crypto-threaten-us-dollars-dominance-analyst/">threaten</a> the USD&#8217;s dominance. White House economist Jared Bernstein said during a hearing on his nomination to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers that China wants to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-economist-warns-china-wants-to-weaken-us-dollars-reserve-currency-status-senator-says-biggest-threat-comes-from-within/">weaken</a> the U.S. dollar&#8217;s reserve currency status.</p>

As of writing, 134,986 unconfirmed transactions await confirmation, and block times are lingering above the usual ten-minute mark.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Transactions Backlogged as Mempool Reaches Higher Levels</h2>
<p>On the morning of Wednesday, Bitcoin.com News brought to light the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-difficulty-estimated-to-drop-after-5-back-to-back-increases/">decrease</a> in Bitcoin&#x2019;s global hashrate over the past 24 hours, currently hovering just above the 300 exahash per second (EH/s) range. Meanwhile, block intervals have <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">slowed down</a> and surpassed the average ten-minute mark, with the most recent block taking a total of ten minutes and 50 seconds to be validated.</p>
<p>Even though bitcoin&#x2019;s price initially soared past the $30K mark earlier today, by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on April 26, 2023, the value had regressed back to a low of $27,242. Since then, the price managed to jump back above the <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">$28K zone</a>. At present, the <a href="https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,24h,weight">mempool</a> remains packed with transactions, awaiting their turn to be confirmed.</p>

<p>In essence, the Bitcoin network&#x2019;s mempool acts as a repository of unconfirmed transactions that must be incorporated in the next block of the blockchain. Every transaction in the mempool comes with its own unique transaction ID, fee, and other pertinent information. Since miners prioritize transactions that offer higher fees, users tend to compete by offering increased fees to expedite the confirmation of their transactions.</p>

<p>At 4:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday, <a href="https://mempool.space/">data</a> obtained from the web portal mempool.space reports 134,986 unconfirmed transactions. Meanwhile, transaction fees vary, with a no-priority transaction costing a 2 sat/vB or $0.08 per transaction, a low-priority transaction setting users back 29 sat/vB or $1.15 per transfer, and a high-priority transaction currently priced at 35 sat/vB or $1.38 per transfer.</p>

<p>Bitinfocharts.com supplies additional <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3y">data</a> indicating that the average fee for transactions today is 0.000072 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $1.99 per transaction. The same website also reveals a <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html">median-sized fee</a> of 0.000035 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $0.97 per transaction.</p>

Similarly, the search term &#x201C;how to buy bitcoin&#x201D; reached the same score two weeks earlier, on March 20, 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>90-Day Stats From Google Trends Highlight Interest in How to Buy Gold and Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Over the past six months, the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/">value of gold</a> has soared by an impressive 20%, with a single troy ounce of .999 fine gold currently changing hands for $1,998 per unit. As for <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, it is presently trading at just under $30K per unit, having risen by 8.9% in the last 24 hours as of April 26, 2023. Both gold and bitcoin have experienced an upsurge in value following the banking crisis of mid-March, which witnessed the collapse of three major U.S. banks. Market observers are now <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/first-republic-rescue-pitch-help-now-or-pay-more-later-when-it-fails.html">keeping a close watch</a> on the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/first-republic-banks-shares-downgraded-to-junk-status-by-s-stock-slides-25-lower/">First Republic Bank</a> fiasco, as it lost over 50% of its value during Tuesday&#x2019;s trading sessions.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=how%20to%20buy%20gold&hl=en">Google Trends data</a>, the search query &#x201C;how to buy gold&#x201D; has been trending worldwide in the last 90 days. On March 20, 2023, the search term reached a score of 90 out of 100, followed by a peak score of 100 on April 6. As of now, the score for &#x201C;how to buy gold&#x201D; is hovering at 62, according to Google Trends data. The search term has generated significant interest in regions such as Singapore, Australia, St. Helena, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Canada.</p>

<p>Worldwide data from <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=how%20to%20buy%20gold&hl=en">2004 to the present day</a> indicates that the &#x201C;how to buy gold&#x201D; search term has an 85 out of 100 score, with its last peak score of 100 recorded in August 2011. In addition to gold, Google Trends data shows that interest in the search term &#x201C;how to buy bitcoin&#x201D; has also risen, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=how%20to%20buy%20bitcoin&hl=en">reaching a high score of 100</a> on March 20, 2023, based on 90-day statistics. Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/google-trends-data-shows-bitcoin-search-interest-surged-this-week-amid-10-month-price-high/">reported</a> last week that in mid-March and into April, the search query &#x201C;bitcoin&#x201D; was also on the rise.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the failure of three major U.S. banks, namely Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank, in mid-March triggered a spike in searches for terms such as &#x201C;banking crisis&#x201D; and &#x201C;bank runs,&#x201D; as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/google-trends-data-reveals-searches-for-banking-crisis-bank-runs-skyrocket/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News on March 19, 2023. The very next day, &#x201C;how to buy bitcoin&#x201D; achieved a score of 100, having come close on February 5, 2023, when it reached a score of 96 out of 100. Current interest in the term &#x201C;how to buy bitcoin,&#x201D; according to 90-day Google Trends statistics, stems from regions like Nigeria, Guam, Cameroon, St. Helena, and Mauritius.</p>

<h2>Shares From America&#8217;s 14th Largest Bank Decimated Over the Last Two Days</h2>
<p>The situation only <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/first-republic-bank-stock-price-today/">worsened</a> as pre-market trading began, and by 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday, First Republic Bank&#8217;s shares had fallen <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-FRC/">by over 30%</a>. The decline in market capitalization has been a major concern for investors, who are increasingly worried about the bank&#8217;s stability and future prospects.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Sources close to the matter have indicated that the banks which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-bank-outflows-and-concerns-mount-11-banks-bail-out-first-republic-bank-from-collapse/">injected $30 billion</a> into First Republic Bank may need to step in and provide additional assistance. Advisors to the banks have stated that failure to do so would result in a greater cost down the line. It is expected that the advisors to First Republic Bank will make a plea to the larger U.S. banks to provide further support.</p>
<p>The troubled bank has already taken significant steps to address its financial challenges, including the sale of assets and a significant reduction in its workforce, with 7,200 employees being laid off. However, it remains to be seen if these measures will be sufficient to restore investor confidence and ensure the bank&#8217;s long-term viability.</p>

<p>The banks’ advisors reportedly disclosed that if they are not helped, the system will “pay more later when it fails,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/first-republic-rescue-pitch-help-now-or-pay-more-later-when-it-fails.html">according</a> to CNBC. “Advisors to First Republic will attempt to cajole the big U.S. banks who’ve already propped it up into doing one more favor,” CNBC’s Hugh Son reported. Others have blamed a specific demographic of First Republic Bank&#8217;s customers for its downfall.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>&#8220;Wealthy clientele such as the affluent individuals that banked at [First Republic] have no loyalty to any particular financial adviser,&#8221; Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, stated in a note <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/first-republic-bank-stock-down/">received</a> by CBS News. &#8220;First Republic was one of many advisers and service providers to their wealthy customers, people who find products like interest-only mortgages attractive,” Whalen added.</p>
<p>After dropping more than 30% on Wednesday, First Republic Bank&#8217;s shares managed to rise and currently, the stock is down between <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-FRC/">21% to 26%</a> after the rebound. Still, there&#8217;s another half day of Wall Street trading and First Republic Bank stock will be watched closely. Reports further <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgura/status/1651232866708213765?s=20">detail</a> that the bank&#8217;s stocks were <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/world/first-republic-bank-shares-halted-for-trading-11682521269662.html">halted</a> due to volatility this afternoon.</p>

In the same day, a separate law, the Transfer of Funds regulation, was passed, requiring crypto operators to confirm the identity of their customers in order to halt money laundering transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the crypto regulation worldwide is becoming increasingly strict, Alchemy Pay is rapidly growing and rising in the cryptocurrency payment field as a payment solution provider bridging global fiat and cryptocurrencies for users in 173 countries. All these achievements started from a forward-looking insight about the revolutionary potential of crypto – the team believe that by creating a seamless gateway between traditional finance and crypto assets, they can make the emerging technology more widely available and provide easier access to financial services for businesses and individuals in different countries and regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, it has established solid partnerships with international payment channels such as Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Diners Clubs, Google Pay, Apple Pay and hundreds of local payment channels, and is gradually expanding a larger network of partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Shawn Shi, the founder of Alchemy Pay, was selected as one of the “2022 Forbes China Web 3.0 Innovation Pioneers”. At the same time, Alchemy Pay has established a brand benchmark for its professionalism, trustworthiness and accessibility as a professional and serious payment solution provider that is bridging the gap between fiat and cryptocurrencies in the global economies.</span></p>
<p><b>Dedicated for Five Years to Provide Mainstream Friendly Crypto Payment Solution </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alchemy Pay project was built and launched by a team of payments experts who had come from years of experience in Singapore, America, Europe with the likes of HSBC, Mastercard, Paypal, and Visa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year later, the Alchemy Pay team followed up with Crypto Payment, the world&#8217;s first hybrid payment merchant acceptance system that allows merchants to accept payments in both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies from their customers. “This is the equivalent of a &#8216;hands off&#8217; system.” Robert McCracken, the head of the Alchemy Pay ecosystem explained, “We accept cryptocurrency payments on behalf of merchants and convert them to fiat currency for settlement in the merchant&#8217;s local fiat currency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, the services offered by Alchemy Pay have gradually expanded in four main directions, including on-ramp, off-ramp, NFT checkout and cryptocurrency payment acceptance systems, bringing forward a diverse range of solutions, while maintaining some convergence and crossover between the four segments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On &amp; Off-ramp is our payment solution.” Robert explained in the interview, “On-ramp is deployed as a plugin that the Web3 platform can host on their website so that users can use legal payment methods such as Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, Google Pay, local bank transfers and commonly used local digital wallets to securely purchase cryptocurrencies. Off-ramp is also a feature of the plugin that operates in a reverse manner, allowing users to sell their cryptocurrency into fiat currency and send the funds directly to their personal bank account, which makes it very easy, straightforward, secure and compliant for users to buy and sell cryptocurrency. NFT checkout is a relatively new solution, with the ability to easily purchase NFT using fiat currency payment methods. This is an easier and more straightforward way for both crypto native and users unfamiliar with Web3.”</span></p>

<p>After more than five years of development, Alchemy Pay has gained more experience than any other project in the cryptocurrency payments industry – it pinpoints the needs of cryptocurrency-native users, constantly updates and iterates the service, and comes up with solutions with mainstream-friendly usability. Alchemy Pay is available almost anywhere in the world for people of all technical backgrounds, which has built the platform&#8217;s barriers within the crypto payments field.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its first years of development, Alchemy Pay focused on the Asian market, and gradually expanded to Europe and the Americas. By 2021, Alchemy Pay has established payment touchpoints with over 2 million merchants in 70+ countries worldwide. In the last year, Alchemy Pay has focused its business on expanding its global network of payment and remittance partners, partnering with more exchanges and mainstream blockchain networks, and moving towards providing direct-to-customer (D2C) payment solutions.</span></p>
<p><b>Put Vision Into Global, Root in the Local</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the business continues to expand, Alchemy Pay has developed into a truly worldwide organization. At the same time, the team found that constructing a strict hierarchical structure may stifle creativity and productivity and limit the organization&#8217;s growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, at the end of 2022, Alchemy Pay implemented an “Advisory Board Management System”, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inviting global experts to take charge of different departments such as compliance, product, security, etc., </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">where they can participate in decision-making, provide more professional advice and focus their talents on areas where they can achieve their true potential. “Because one person can&#8217;t be proficient in everything, we have implemented a committee based advisory and management system.” When asked about the original reason for the system, Robert explained, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We thought a decentralized structure would allow our team to thrive and grow healthily.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This setup has been very successful in allowing a real sense of team collaboration to occur.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Plouffe, the former </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House Senior Advisor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">legendary campaign manager,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also recently chosen to join Alchemy Pay and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">served as a committee member of Alchemy Pay’s management and advisory board, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is responsible for strategy, compliance, and government relations as a global strategic advisor. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plouffe is credited with the strategy and grass-roots public engagement savvy that won Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign. After his work for Obama, Plouffe became the Senior Vice President of Policy and Strategy for Uber, and in 2022 Plouffe joined the Binance Global Advisory Board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Alchemy Pay has core talents and expert leaders in all departments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethan Wang has been a driving force for the tech team, he is the tech lead in Google Cloud Web3 team and one of the founding team members. He also formerly worked for Facebook Libra as a tech lead and founding team member; Andy Ng has over 20 years of experience deep-diving in product; Jonas Cernius head up the compliance team from Europe, for he has over 10 years of combined experience in civil service and finance compliance and has extensive experience in legal operations. Robert said, &#8220;We welcome talented people from around the world to join us and build Alchemy Pay with us!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By building a group of talents with its roots in the local market, Alchemy Pay is putting more emphasis on local payments, making it easier and faster for local users to use the payment services it offers. Alchemy Pay has a significant advantage in the industry in terms of local payments, for it currently supports 300+ local payment channels such as OVO and DANA in Indonesia, GCash in the Philippines and many more. At the same time, this team model has allowed Alchemy Pay to gain an advantage in global policy and compliance, &#8220;Any changes in the global regional regulatory environment are important to us and can lead to changes and trends in the payments space, so we will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">keep a watchful eye to catch the latest trends and changes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Robert said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, Alchemy Pay has seen the potential for demand for cryptocurrencies in South East Asia and Latin America, tailoring its payment solutions and focusing its marketing efforts on these regions, developing operational strategies to promote its products in line with local market conditions. Alchemy Pay has also built a strong reputation and competitiveness for its products by partnering with celebrities and notable organizations to promote its payment products and expand brand local presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission is to bridge the fiat and crypto global economies.&#8221; Talking about Alchemy Pay&#8217;s long-term vision, Robert expressed the team’s desire to create a sustainable and evolutionary project that solves the problems of connecting the world of traditional finance to the world of cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He concluded Alchemy Pay’s mission and vision:“Our ultimate goal is to make it easy for people worldwide to use and access a more decentralized, open, and fair form of finance. We want Alchemy Pay to represent a crypto payment solution that stands the test of time and values users’ feedback. To achieve this, we will focus on refining and improving our product while adopting a long-termist mentality to meet the long term needs of our users.”</span></p>

Spurred by an apparent collapse of First Republic Bank, the global crypto market cap moved 7% higher, as of writing. Solana was also in the green, rising by nearly 9%.</strong></p>
<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) rose by as much as 9% on Wednesday, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.38 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $0.4166 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s surge in price saw cardano climb to its highest point in six days, since when the token was trading above a ceiling at $0.4200.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, Wednesday&#x2019;s move came as the relative strength index (RSI) broke free of a resistance level at 53.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 55.12, with an upcoming ceiling of 58.00 a potential target for bulls.</p>
<p>Should this point be hit, there is a strong possibility that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> will move back above its aforementioned point of resistance.</p>

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Additionally solana (SOL) was another notable mover on Wednesday, as the token was also nearly 9% higher.</p>
<p>SOL/USD rose to a peak of $22.92 earlier in the day, after almost breaking out of a floor at $20.00 the day prior.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s gains, solana is now on the cusp of colliding with its long-term ceiling at $23.00.</p>

<p>Although the RSI has risen above a ceiling at 50.00 in today&#x2019;s session, it will need to move beyond the 55.00 mark in order to reach the above target.</p>
<p>As of writing, price strength is tracking at 52.97, with solana now trading at the $22.71 mark.</p>

The network has witnessed a notable difficulty upswing of approximately 22.62% since block height 778,176. Consequently, with the current block times in place, the mining participants of the network may finally see a drop.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Difficulty Expected to Drop 1-4% Lower; <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Price Spikes 6% Higher</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Present data suggests that the decline in Bitcoin&#x2019;s difficulty level could potentially take place around May 4, 2023. The hashrate of the network currently stands at 332 exahash per second (EH/s) after experiencing a dip to </span><a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart"><span style="font-weight: 400;">290 EH/s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday. According to statistics obtained from three data points (</span><a href="https://www.bitcoinsensus.com/bitcoin-halving-countdown/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), the block intervals, i.e., the time between each block discovered, indicate that blocks are being found over the ten-minute average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, the estimations for the next difficulty drop hover around -1% to -4%. However, with over a week, or more than a thousand blocks, yet to go before the next difficulty adjustment, the exact figures remain uncertain. Nonetheless, a reduction after the five consecutive increases and the 22%+ surge in difficulty in the last two months will undoubtedly give miners a much-needed respite. Moreover, the price of bitcoin has also been on an upward trajectory, providing miners with a higher daily revenue until the next retarget.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 26, Bitcoin&#x2019;s value spiked 6% higher, surging above the $29K range. This notable increase has come as a breath of fresh air for the miners who had been bracing themselves through five back-to-back difficulty increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past three days, Foundry USA has contributed a substantial hashpower of 110.30 EH/s, which accounts for 32.68% of the total hashrate. Following behind, Antpool has produced 79.62 EH/s or 23.59% of the total hashrate, securing its position as the second-largest mining pool. Foundry and Antpool&#x2019;s hashrates are followed by F2pool, Viabtc, and Binance Pool, respectively. </span></p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rebounded strongly on Wednesday, as markets reacted to the news that deposits in First Republic Bank fell by $100 billion last month.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD surged to a peak of $29,121.97 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, following a low of $27,217.17 the day before.</p>
<p>This move has pushed bitcoin to its highest point in the last seven-days, when it was trading above $30,000.</p>

<p>Overall, the surge in price comes as bulls rejected a breakout below a long-term support point at $27,000 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The relative strength index (RSI) also bounced from a floor of its own at the 44.00 mark, and is now tracking at 54.09.</p>
<p>A ceiling of 55.00 will likely act as a checkpoint for bulls, and should they move beyond this, there is a strong possibility that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> climbs to $30,000.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also in the green, as prices snapped a three-day losing streak.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,805.32 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD jumped to a peak at $1,919.72 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of this move, ethereum has hit a five-day high, with price now hovering around a resistance point at $1,915.</p>

<p>The last time <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> bulls broke this ceiling was on April 13, and on the occasion the price went on to reach an 11-month high above $2,100.</p>
<p>In order for something similar to happen this go round, the RSI would need to overcome a hurdle at the 53.00 level.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 51.64.</p>
