<p>BTC/USD Softer After 16988 Print:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 6 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) softened below the 17000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair encountered selling pressure after peaking around the 16988 area, its strongest print since 20 December.&nbsp; The move higher also represents further gains above the 16880.44 level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the broad depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders recently drove BTC/USD as low as the 16326.16 area after Stops were elected below the 16375.18 area, a downside retracement level related to selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels.&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, and it was off more than 3% in December.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16721.41 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16786.71.</p>
