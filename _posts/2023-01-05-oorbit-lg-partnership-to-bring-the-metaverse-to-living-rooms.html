<p>South Korean tech giant LG Electronics has announced a partnership with the cloud-based technology platform Oorbit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership will aim to bring the metaverse directly into the living room of TV viewers.&nbsp;</p>
An Easy Way To Interact With The Metaverse
<p>LG Electronics has announced that it has teamed up with the cloud-based technology platform Oorbit to bring the metaverse experience directly to living rooms. The collaboration will allow users to seamlessly view interconnected virtual worlds, concerts, and artificial intelligence (AI) multiplayer games directly through their LG TVs, making it easy for users to access and interact in the metaverse. According to a press release, users will be able to access super high-fidelity interconnected virtual worlds and experiences such as virtual concerts and AI-generative multiplayer games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LG&rsquo;s endorsement of the metaverse comes at a time when there are a growing number of critics of the technology. However, the metaverse is getting a significant boost at CES 23, which is where LG made the announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief technology officer of Oorbit, Pooya Koosha, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working on the hardware, networking, and software layers to create the metaverse for almost a decade &ndash; it just wasn&rsquo;t called the metaverse back then. Our proprietary technology is the connective tissue that links virtual worlds together and makes it easy for developers and brands to bring their experiences into the metaverse. Scaling our technology for millions of LG TV customers is the next step in making the metaverse accessible for all.&rdquo;</p>

LG Actively Exploring Blockchain-Based Software&nbsp;
<p>LG has been actively exploring cryptocurrency and blockchain-based software and updated its business development goals to reflect the same. According to a South Korean news source, the company added two crypto-specific objectives during its annual general meeting. These were the &ldquo;development and selling of blockchain-based software&rdquo; and &ldquo;the sale and brokerage of cryptocurrency.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking about the partnership with Oorbit, and its vision, the head of content service division at LG Electronics Home Entertainment Company, Jung Sung-Hyun, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At LG, we take pride in driving innovation and bringing new, personalized experiences to consumers, allowing them to easily interact. And we are pleased we can achieve that now once again thanks to Oorbit&rsquo;s vision to give open access to metaverse experiences in one place on our TVs.&rdquo;</p>

Portable Achievements And Purposes&nbsp;
<p>Additionally, users will also be able to retain a persistent digital identity, making purchases and achievements portable between worlds. Oorbit CEO Ash Koosha stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;LG has the vision and reach to help Oorbit make the metaverse more accessible to more people through their Smart TVs. Imagine playing with a map you bought for one game and taking that same item into a concert, where it becomes your backstage pass. Translatable digital ownership is possible with virtual worlds that are connected through Oorbit. Our goal is for users to have access to boundless streams of entertaining content through the devices they already own. Our partnership with LG will dramatically speed our journey toward that goal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oorbit is building the world&rsquo;s premiere technology platform, allowing users to access multiple metaverse worlds and experiences from one place. Users can use one identity to travel between interoperable virtual worlds and discover games, creative spaces, entertainment, and more.&nbsp;</p>
