			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD 29477 Increasingly at Risk:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 24 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to lack conviction early in the Asian session as the pair remained below the 30000 figure and orbited the 29922.87 area, a downside price objective associated with recent selling pressure around the 30421 and 30281 levels.&nbsp; The 29477.92 area remains highly at risk of being absorbed by selling pressure as BTC/USD has twice tested this previous upside price objective after trading as high as the 31862.21 level.&nbsp; Related previous price objectives that are technically significant include the 28937, 28845, 28213, 28137, 27430, 27338, 27312, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives include the 29403, 29089, 28775, 28386, and 27757 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following recent upside activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 28306, 27466, 26428, and 26272 levels.&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30011.17 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29884.81.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After securing a partial win in its case involving the SEC, Ripple&rsquo;s Managing Director for the UK and Europe revealed the firm recently applied for registration in the UK and Ireland. </p>
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s recent landmark victory in its case involving the SEC has spurred a renewed interest in the firm and its native token XRP. The firm is riding the wave of its current popularity and is setting its sights on expanding to the UK and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
Ripple Looks to Expand Operations to UK and Ireland
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s European Managing Director, Sendi Young, told DL News in an interview the firm is in the process of obtaining approval in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>While the company still sees the US as its global hub, Sendi said, &ldquo;We are going to continue growing exponentially&rdquo; in the UK and Europe. To that end, Young said Ripple &ldquo;very recently&rdquo; applied for crypto asset firm registration with the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and a payment institution license in the Republic of Ireland. &nbsp;</p>
<p>During the interview, Ms Young stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are in the process of applying for our crypto asset registration in the UK and our payments licence in Ireland. These are all massive investments with a view that we are going to continue growing exponentially in this region.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She, however, declined to provide a numerical target for the company&rsquo;s UK and European growth plans but confirmed the company is increasing hiring in the region.</p>
Court Ruling is a &ldquo;Huge Win&rdquo; for Ripple
<p>Ripple secured a partial win against the SEC when Judge Analise Torres ruled Ripple&rsquo;s XRP token is &ldquo;not necessarily a security on its face.&rdquo; Ripple has been engaged in a three-year battle with the SEC after the agency alleged the firm breached US securities laws.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">XRP is not a security.This victory for @Ripple is a win for the entire industry and a step toward regulatory clarity in the U.S.A huge thank you to @bgarlinghouse, @chrislarsensf, and @s_alderoty for their leadership and the #XRPCommunity for their continued support.</p>
&mdash; Ripple (@Ripple) July 13, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Based on the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuit, crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken were forced to delist XRP offerings but have since indicated they would relist the token.</p>
<p>Young commented on Judge Torres&rsquo; decision and said it is a &ldquo;huge win&rdquo; and &ldquo;positive for [the company&rsquo;s] growth in the US.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She added the company&rsquo;s position on the US as its global hub &ldquo;has not changed&rdquo; but noted since the lawsuit, the majority of Ripple&rsquo;s expansion &ldquo;has happened outside the US. I would only expect that the US will pick up and grow a lot more now.</p>
<p>Having said that, we are global, we have over 15 offices around the world.&rdquo;</p>

Ripple Secures an In-Principle MPI License in Singapore
<p>CNCB reported weeks before Judge Torres&rsquo; decision the firm received in-principle approval of a Major Payment Institution (MPI) License from the country&rsquo;s central bank &ndash; the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
<p>In a press release announcing MAS approval, Ripple said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ripple, the leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, today announced that its Singapore subsidiary Ripple Markets APAC Pte Ltd, has obtained In-Principle Approval of the Major Payments Institution License application from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
<p>This license will allow Ripple to offer regulated digital payment token products and services in the city-state, and further scale its customers&rsquo; use of its crypto-enabled&nbsp;On-Demand Liquidity&nbsp;(ODL) service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ripple has long held a strong presence in Singapore since opening its Asia Pacific headquarters in 2017.</p>
<p>Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, said in a statement released soon after announcing the company&rsquo;s MPI approval:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Singapore is a leading global financial center, and a prominent gateway to business in Asia Pacific. We&rsquo;re incredibly proud to receive an in-principle license from the MAS, reaffirming our commitment to the region and ongoing proactive engagement with regulators globally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stu Alderoty, Ripple&rsquo;s Chief Legal Officer, also commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As more countries develop regulatory frameworks for crypto, many are looking to Singapore&rsquo;s early leadership in developing a clear taxonomy and licensing framework. This in-principle regulatory approval from the MAS will enable us to better support our forward-looking customers looking to hone in on blockchain and crypto technologies to build a more inclusive and borderless financial system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ripple reportedly doubled its headcount in Singapore over the past year and continues to seize every advantage the city holds for it.</p>

To that end, Young said Ripple &ldquo;very recently&rdquo; applied for crypto asset firm registration with the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and a payment institution license in the Republic of Ireland. &nbsp;</p>
<p>During the interview, Ms Young stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are in the process of applying for our crypto asset registration in the UK and our payments licence in Ireland. These are all massive investments with a view that we are going to continue growing exponentially in this region.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She, however, declined to provide a numerical target for the company&rsquo;s UK and European growth plans but confirmed the company is increasing hiring in the region.</p>
Court Ruling is a &ldquo;Huge Win&rdquo; for Ripple
<p>Ripple secured a partial win against the SEC when Judge Analise Torres ruled Ripple&rsquo;s XRP token is &ldquo;not necessarily a security on its face.&rdquo; Ripple has been engaged in a three-year battle with the SEC after the agency alleged the firm breached US securities laws.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">XRP is not a security.This victory for @Ripple is a win for the entire industry and a step toward regulatory clarity in the U.S.A huge thank you to @bgarlinghouse, @chrislarsensf, and @s_alderoty for their leadership and the #XRPCommunity for their continued support.</p>
&mdash; Ripple (@Ripple) July 13, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Based on the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuit, crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken were forced to delist XRP offerings but have since indicated they would relist the token.</p>
<p>Young commented on Judge Torres&rsquo; decision and said it is a &ldquo;huge win&rdquo; and &ldquo;positive for [the company&rsquo;s] growth in the US.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She added the company&rsquo;s position on the US as its global hub &ldquo;has not changed&rdquo; but noted since the lawsuit, the majority of Ripple&rsquo;s expansion &ldquo;has happened outside the US. I would only expect that the US will pick up and grow a lot more now.</p>
<p>Having said that, we are global, we have over 15 offices around the world.&rdquo;</p>

Ripple Secures an In-Principle MPI License in Singapore
<p>CNCB reported weeks before Judge Torres&rsquo; decision the firm received in-principle approval of a Major Payment Institution (MPI) License from the country&rsquo;s central bank &ndash; the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
<p>In a press release announcing MAS approval, Ripple said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ripple, the leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, today announced that its Singapore subsidiary Ripple Markets APAC Pte Ltd, has obtained In-Principle Approval of the Major Payments Institution License application from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
<p>This license will allow Ripple to offer regulated digital payment token products and services in the city-state, and further scale its customers&rsquo; use of its crypto-enabled&nbsp;On-Demand Liquidity&nbsp;(ODL) service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ripple has long held a strong presence in Singapore since opening its Asia Pacific headquarters in 2017.</p>
<p>Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, said in a statement released soon after announcing the company&rsquo;s MPI approval:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Singapore is a leading global financial center, and a prominent gateway to business in Asia Pacific. We&rsquo;re incredibly proud to receive an in-principle license from the MAS, reaffirming our commitment to the region and ongoing proactive engagement with regulators globally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stu Alderoty, Ripple&rsquo;s Chief Legal Officer, also commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As more countries develop regulatory frameworks for crypto, many are looking to Singapore&rsquo;s early leadership in developing a clear taxonomy and licensing framework. This in-principle regulatory approval from the MAS will enable us to better support our forward-looking customers looking to hone in on blockchain and crypto technologies to build a more inclusive and borderless financial system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ripple reportedly doubled its headcount in Singapore over the past year and continues to seize every advantage the city holds for it.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and Tradecurve (TCRV) are cryptocurrencies offering exciting opportunities for potential profits. These coins represent promising projects in their respective niches, offering unique features and growth potential. Join us as we examine why these coins could be an excellent candidate for potential investment.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Summary
<ul>
<li>Polygon (MATIC) proposes a token switch&nbsp;</li>
<li>A New York prosecutor charges a Solana (SOL) hacker</li>
<li>Tradecurve (TCRV) expected to surge by 40% next week&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
What Is a Polygon (MATIC)?&nbsp;
<p>Polygon has emerged as a leading scaling solution for Ethereum, offering enhanced scalability and interoperability. The project aims to address the limitations of Ethereum's network, enabling faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p>With its growing ecosystem of dApps and protocols, Polygon has gained traction among developers and users alike. As the demand for scalable blockchain solutions continues, investing in the Polygon crypto may offer significant profit potential. Recently, Polygon proposed a token switch from MATIC to POL which will serve as a multipurpose token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following this announcement, the Polygon price soared. The token trades hands at $0.7675 with a market cap of $7.1B, up 3.69% overnight. Because of this, experts forecast that Polygon could rise to $0.96 by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
How High Can Solana (SOL) Go?&nbsp;
<p>Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform focusing on scalability and fast transaction speeds. Solana can handle thousands of TPS through its Proof of History, making it an attractive choice for dApps.As the Solana platform expands its reach, the Solana crypto could also experience a rise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A New York prosecutor recently charged a hacker with stealing $9M from a Solana-based exchange. This news sparked a rally for the Solana coin, as it is the first-ever criminal case that encompasses a DEX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solana trades hands at $22.34, a rise of 0.02% in the last 24 hours. Experts are bullish about its future, with its moving averages and technical indicators in the green. They forecast that Solana could reach $29.11 by December 2023.&nbsp;</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV): A Future Game-Changer&nbsp;
<p>While Polygon and Solana are soaring, one project currently in its presale has also gained worldwide attention. Tradecurve is a trading platform that could dominate the market as it incorporates the best features of CEX and DEX. Tradecurve users will be privy to fast order execution, deep liquidity, and anonymity through DeFi capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A significant difference that separates Tradecurve is that traders can trade all derivatives on one account. Users can create this account using an email only, as no sign-up KYC checks are required. Tradecurve provides a fully anonymous trading environment where users divulge no personal information.</p>
<p>Its decentralized nature will lower trading fees as all third-party mediators are gone. Tradecurve has also placed a particular focus on transparency by announcing the implementation of its Proof of Reserves. Over 15,000 registered users have welcomed this development.</p>
<p>The presale is currently in Stage 4, with its native token, TCRV, worth $0.018. This is an 80% surge from its starting price, meaning those who bought it early are now reaping the benefits. However, Stage 5 will begin sometime next week - causing a 40% price surge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, Tradecurve has a connection to the forex market. This market has seen a turnover of $7.5T in April 2022, meaning its growth potential is immense. With this in mind, experts forecast a 100x rise when TCRV gets listed on a Tier-1 CEX.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has been battling to push above the $31,000 level after recently crossing this threshold, prompted by a favorable ruling in the Ripple v. SEC case. This significant development sparked optimism among investors, leading to an upward swing in Bitcoin's price. However, despite the initial surge, Bitcoin continues to face resistance in its price movements as market dynamics fluctuate and investor sentiment remains cautious.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency's journey to establish a stable foothold above $31,000 has been met with constant fluctuations and varying selling pressure. Still, certain factors indicate bullish sentiment that could see BTC skyrocket in the coming months. Although Bitcoin is considerably down from its record high of approximately $69,000, which it achieved in 2021, on-chain data reveals that the flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading around the $30,000 level on significant exchanges, with a target of reaching $35,000. Its market cap is nearing an impressive $590 billion, accompanied by a robust trading volume about to surpass $7.6 billion.</p>
<p>The recent Bitcoin rally has sparked speculation among experts, suggesting that the price could rise further with the introduction of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The arrival of ETFs, particularly those pushed by top-ranking companies like BlackRock, can boost Investors' confidence and trigger a surge in the price of Bitcoin. Industry analysts are closely monitoring potential bullish catalysts that could significantly impact the price of BTC.</p>
<p>Their analysis highlights the Federal Reserve's pause on rate hikes, the outcome of Ripple's lawsuit against the SEC, the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF, and Binance's settlement with the Feds as crucial factors. These developments have caught the attention of famous investment analyst Callie Cox, who believes that the successful navigation of regulatory scrutiny by various cryptocurrency platforms indicates that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF is only a matter of time. Cox further emphasizes that this development could open the floodgates for a more comprehensive fleet of institutional investors, potentially skyrocketing BTC to new highs.</p>
<p>Adding to the bullish sentiment, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a widely-used technical analysis tool, indicates potential growth in the Bitcoin market. Financial analysts have recently observed an upside MACD cross on the BTC chart, suggesting the presence of bullish momentum. All the metrics mentioned above and the data point towards Bitcoin experiencing a significant bull run led by institutional investors.</p>
DigiToads (TOADS) Presale Milestone Highlights Growing Dominance Among Meme Coins
<p>The crypto markets have once again entered a phase of meme coin demand, and the recent success of DigiToads' (TOADS) presale is the best ICO that perfectly captures this trend. DigiToads has experienced a rapid 370% pump to $0.047 in the presale alone as meme coin investors relentlessly search for the best crypto investment. DigiToads dominates a market saturated with utility-lacking meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) amid this frenzy.</p>
<p>The rapid adoption of DigiToads' presale indicates that many investors believe TOADS could be the next cryptocurrency to explode, outperforming leading crypto giants. DigiToads has witnessed overwhelming demand, rapidly selling TOADS, and achieving a fundraising milestone of over $6.2 million. It's no surprise that analysts predict that after TOADS lists on exchanges, early investors could be sitting on colossal profits. Such potential for exponential growth suggests that DigiToads is the best DeFi crypto that could deliver 100x returns in the coming months.</p>
<p>DigiToads is the best DeFi crypto platform, offering a highly anticipated play-to-earn (P2E) game and a valuable NFT collection. This strategic move, coupled with the ongoing success of the presale, positions TOADS for even more adoption, fueled by the growing interest in projects that leverage DeFi technologies. In the current market, meme coins with innovative features are rare, making DigiToads' presale the best ICO to participate in for long-term profits.</p>
<p></p>
Conclusion
<p>Although Bitcoin's struggle to break through the $31,000 level reflects caution, there are reasons to remain optimistic, such as the potential introduction of spot ETFs that suggest a likely bull run for Bitcoin. Simultaneously, the meme coin frenzy has taken the crypto market by storm, with DigiToads' presale as a prime example. With its exponential growth and overwhelming demand, DigiToads has dominated the crypto market as the best crypto investment for investors seeking constant returns.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) has been unable to sustain upward traction early in the Asian session as the pair remains pressured below the 30000 figure after recently topping out around the 30060.28 level, right around an upside price objective associated with recent buying pressure around the 29525 and 30059.95 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Following the print around 30060, downside price pressures reversed at the 29768.19 area, right around a downside price objective associated with recent selling pressure around the 30421 and 30281 levels.&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives include the 29403, 29089, 28775, 28386, and 27757 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>DeFi protocol Conic Finance revealed that it had suffered an exploit, with the attacker draining over 1700 ETH worth $3.6 million from one of its Omnipools.</p>
<p>Conic Finance is a liquidity pool balancing platform for the decentralized finance protocol Curve.</p>
Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>According to security firm BlockSec, the attack&rsquo;s root cause was price manipulation caused by &ldquo;read-only reentrancy.&rdquo; Reentrancy is a common bug that allows attackers to exploit smart contracts by tricking them into making repeated calls to the targeted protocol and stealing its assets. A call is an authorization for a smart contract to interact with a user&rsquo;s wallet address. Web3 risk-alert source Beosin stated that a single transaction sent nearly the stolen amount to a new Ethereum address. Conic Finance reached out to users, tweeting they were investigating the exploit and would share updates soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are currently investigating an exploit involving the ETH Omnipool and will share updates as soon as they are available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Security firm PeckShield also analyzed the attack, revealing the root cause to be originating from the protocol&rsquo;s new CurveLPOracleV2 contract. The firm tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, @ConicFinance. Based on the initial analysis from the malicious tx, our initial analysis shows the root cause comes from the new CurveLPOracleV2 contract. FWIW, our audit identifies a similar read-only reentrancy issue. However, the same issue is introduced in the newly introduced CurveLPOracleV2 contract, which was not part of the audit scope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curve has also been following up with Conic Finance, stating that the primary issue had been identified and only the ETH Omnipool was impacted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have funds on @ConicFinance please remove! There seem to be an attack, which though doesn't drain all in one go&rdquo;</p>

<p>Conic later tweeted a detailed version of events, stating that they were alerted of an exploit impacting the $crvUSD Omnipool, adding they had taken all possible safety measures to limit the attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roughly four hours ago, we were alerted of an exploit affecting the $crvUSD Omnipool. In response to this and given today&rsquo;s ETH exploit, we immediately enforced maximum safety measures and temporarily shut down all Omnipools.&rdquo;</p>
DeFi Hacks A Major Problem&nbsp;
<p>The decentralized finance ecosystem has been plagued by a series of high-profile hacks impacting several major projects. A report by Web3 portfolio application De.Fi highlighted the scale of the problem. The reports stated that DeFi hacks and scams resulted in attackers stealing over $200 million in the second quarter of 2023 alone. However, losses to DeFi hacks were smaller in Q2 when compared to Q1 of 2023, with CertiK reporting that protocols lost over $320 million between January and March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conic Finance had only recently gone live, allowing users to deposit tokens into their Omnipools. Omnipools allowed users to diversify their exposure across the Curve ecosystem and also increased rewards. After going live, Conic Finance was able to attract millions of dollars in capital, highlighting the huge demand for such a product. Conic&rsquo;s Omnipools work by allocating the liquidity of a single asset across multiple Curve pools. Curve liquidity provider (LP) tokens are staked on Convex, boosting CRV rewards.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Following Ripple&rsquo;s victory against SEC, XRP&rsquo;s price skyrocketed on the same day but hasn&rsquo;t seen much more growth over the past week.</p>
XRP Price Boom after Ripple&rsquo;s Partial Win Against SEC
<p>Last week, XRP experienced an incredible price surge, growing by over 100% in value in just one day. The rise was a direct consequence of Ripple's partial win in a long battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC).</p>
<p>SEC first sued Ripple for its supposed breach of the U.S. Securities laws back in 2020 which started the 3-year-long crusade. Finally, on July 13, 2023, judge Analisa Torres of District Court of the Southern District of New York pronounced in her ruling that XRP does not qualify as a security, at least regarding programmatic sales and &ldquo;other distributions&rdquo; (it is considered a security in regard to institutional sales).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The remarkable Ripple victory sent a bullish wave not only to XRP but to the whole crypto market. Besides, the XRP token was relisted on many big exchanges such as Coinbase and Gemini after the announcement of the court ruling.&nbsp;</p>
XRP Network Usage Data Indicates a Short Pullback
<p>Traders have clearly shown much interest in XRP over the past week, with the coin&rsquo;s spot trading volumes even exceeding that of Bitcoin and Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, according to the recent data, the network&rsquo;s activity hasn&rsquo;t seen much increase. Ripple&rsquo;s blockchain-based distributed ledger technology XRP Ledger has maintained about the same number of transactions for over a year. This means that there&rsquo;s still a lack of new entities entering the network.</p>
New Bullish Trend for XRP
<p>Following the court&rsquo;s ruling in favor of Ripple on July 13, the price of XRP has been consistently growing during the whole week, hitting a mark of $0.84 on July 19. The growth could mark an end to the bearish trend that the token has been witnessing since its 2018 peak.</p>
<p>Despite the huge surge in value XRP saw last week, it still hasn&rsquo;t managed to reach the price of $1 and pulled back a little bit in the last couple of days. At the time of writing the token&rsquo;s value is $0.7831.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Amid a rebounding In the midst of a rebounding crypto market, Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has hinted at a forthcoming upgrade to the Ethereum network, which could potentially reduce costs by a factor of 100.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">During his presentation at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris, Buterin unveiled plans for introducing account abstraction to Ethereum. He described the proposed upgrade as "super elegant" due to its implementation not necessitating modifications to Ethereum's underlying protocol, unlike prior upgrades.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Smart Contracts, Smarter Protocols</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Account abstraction envisages transitioning externally owned wallets to smart contract-based wallets, enhancing users' control over their private key seed phrase, akin to resetting an email password. This could also translate into lower transaction fees through "signless transactions."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Buterin elaborated on the potential benefits:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"The idea here is if there are these techniques that allow you to take mold many signatures from any transactions, combine them into one object which is much smaller and which can be much more quickly verified than verifying all of the account abstraction transactions individually and by doing so you can save data [and] computation becomes 100 times cheaper."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The smart contract wallet upgrade would further enable Ethereum users to receive various cryptocurrencies and pay network fees without conversion to Ethereum.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, the announcement comes with an acknowledgment of the challenges that lie ahead. Account abstraction, expected to attract a billion users to Ethereum, is not without its hurdles.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In his discussion, Buterin acknowledged that upgrading existing Ethereum externally-owned accounts into smart contracts and ensuring the protocol works similarly in layer-2 solutions would be significant challenges. Additional difficulties include integrating with existing technologies such as biometrics and wallets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite these hurdles, Buterin expressed enthusiasm for the project's progress. The introduction of account abstraction could revolutionize the Ethereum experience, allowing users and decentralized applications (DApps) to sponsor transactions more efficiently. It could also enable more economical data use and faster verification times.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The news comes at a time when the crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ripple's XRP, is experiencing a resurgence, highlighting the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of this space.</p>
Account Abstraction And The Future of Ethereum
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While the implementation of account abstraction is heralded as a technical breakthrough, the intricate process of this upgrade warrants careful exploration. On a practical level, account abstraction means the transformation of externally owned wallets to those driven by smart contracts. This transition could simplify the recovery of private key seed phrases, lower transaction fees, and even enable Ethereum users to accept multiple types of cryptocurrencies without the necessity for conversions. This means that it could become 100 times cheaper in terms of data savings and computational costs.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p"> &ldquo;This is actually especially a big deal on rollups because in a rollup a big or on because a big part of the size of a transaction is the signature on a rollup," Buterin said.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite this, however, as Buterin notes quite sharply, navigating this transition won't go forth without its requisite challenges. Key upgrades to the Ethereum ecosystem, such as transitioning existing externally-owned accounts into smart contracts, and ensuring the protocol's compatibility with layer-2 solutions are hurdles that must be surmounted. The integration of this new system with existing technoliogies, like biometrics and present-day wallets, presents further complexities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Yet, the air of optimism surrounding account abstraction is tangible. Buterin's enthusiasm signals that despite the challenges, the potential rewards could be transformative, propelling Ethereum to new heights of user accessibility and network efficiency. As Ethereum prepares for this innovative leap, the industry watches in anticipation, ready for the potential advent of an even more dynamic era in the Ethereum saga.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After months of anticipation, the Indonesian government has finally launched its crypto bourse and clearing house in an effort to regulate digital assets in the country.</p>
<p>In its official statement from Thursday, the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (also known as Bappebti) reported that its new national crypto exchange has been operational since July 17. Along with the bourse, Indonesia has also established a futures clearing house to ensure secure transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state-backed crypto market has been in development since December 2021 and was initially planned to be released by December 2022. However, Bappebti had delayed the launch of the exchange several times until finally announcing it was ready to go live earlier this month.</p>
The Only Space to Legally Exchange Crypto in Indonesia
<p>Indonesia has previously banned the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment but has allowed investment in digital assets. Following the investment boom during the pandemic, the recent data shows that over 17 million citizens of Indonesia had invested in crypto.</p>
<p>The opening of the national crypto exchange comes as an effort to strengthen crypto regulation in the country. Bappebti has made it clear that the newly established platform will be the only space in the country where the legal exchange of cryptocurrencies is allowed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The establishment of exchanges, clearing houses and managers of crypto asset storage is proof that the government is present in an effort to create a fair and fair crypto asset trading ecosystem to guarantee legal certainty and prioritize protection for the public as customers," head of Bappebti Didid Noordiatmoko said in the statement of July 20.</p>

What Will Be Featured on the Indonesian Exchange?
<p>The national crypto bourse is expected to list licensed crypto companies, such as Binance's Tokocrypto and Indodax, and others as traders. At least five hundred digital assets have already been approved to be traded on the exchange.</p>
<p>Earlier reports stated that Bappebti intended to limit cryptocurrency sales to local transactions while aligning them with global market trends. Licensed traders will be granted a one-month window to join the new exchange.</p>
<p>According to the statement by Didid Noordiantmoko, PT Bursa Komoditi Nusantara will oversee the crypto bourse, while PT Kliring Berjangka Indonesia will handle transaction clearing. Additionally, PT Tennet Depository Indonesia has been designated as the manager responsible for crypto asset storage.</p>

<p>According to the statement by Didid Noordiantmoko, PT Bursa Komoditi Nusantara will oversee the crypto bourse, while PT Kliring Berjangka Indonesia will handle transaction clearing. Additionally, PT Tennet Depository Indonesia has been designated as the manager responsible for crypto asset storage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">The cryptocurrency market is in a state of constant evolution, with shifting dynamics and emerging trends. One such trend is the declining exchange volumes of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency. While this may raise concerns for some investors, it also presents an opportunity for emerging tokens like Borroe Finance to capture attention and gain traction. As the market diversifies and investors seek the best crypto to invest in now, alternative tokens have the potential to shine and offer lucrative investment prospects.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Bitcoin's Declining Exchange Volumes
<p class="s5">Bitcoin has long been the dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, serving as the benchmark for other digital assets. However, recent months have seen a decline in Bitcoin's exchange volumes. This trend is driven by various factors, including market cycles, regulatory uncertainties, and increasing competition from alternative cryptocurrencies. While some may interpret this decline as a sign of Bitcoin's waning influence, it also opens up space for emerging tokens to step into the spotlight.</p>
Opportunity for Emerging Tokens
<p class="s5">As Bitcoin's exchange volumes decline, emerging tokens have the opportunity to showcase their potential and attract investors. One such token making waves is Borroe Finance. BorroeFinance is an AI-powered funding marketplace that leverages Web3 principles to offer innovative solutions for content creators and businesses. This emerging token presents a compelling investment opportunity, especially in the context of Bitcoin's shifting landscape.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Why Borroe Finance Stands Out:
<p class="s5">1. Innovative Approach: Borroe Finance disrupts traditional financing systems by providing a platform where content creators and Web3 participants can generate instant cash flow. By selling future earnings through discounted NFTs, Borroe Finance aligns with the principles of Web3, emphasizing equitable value sharing among creators and users.</p>
<p class="s5">2. AI Risk Assessment and Blockchain Technology: Borroe Finance incorporates AI risk assessment and blockchain technology, ensuring a secure and efficient fundraising process. This integration enhances transparency, mitigates risks, and fosters trust among users.</p>
<p class="s5">3. Streamlined Funding Process: Borroe offers a streamlined funding process, allowing businesses to raise capital by minting NFTs representing future or outstanding invoices. The platform's user-friendly interface and efficient payment solutions make it an attractive choice for content creators and businesses seeking immediate funding.</p>
<p class="s5">4. Deflationary Token Model: Borroe Finance implements a deflationary token model, creating a potential for long-term value appreciation. The scarcity of tokens and the growing demand for the platform's services contribute to the token's value preservation and growth potential.</p>
<p class="s5">5. Market Potential: As the crypto market diversifies and investors seek opportunities beyond Bitcoin, tokens like Borroe Finance gain visibility. The platform's unique value proposition and alignment with Web3 principles position it as a strong contender for investors looking for promising alternative tokens.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Don&rsquo;t Miss Out On Borroe Finance 
<p class="s5">Borroe Finance has launched its presale which allows anyone to purchase $ROE tokens at the cheapest available price. The presale is a great opportunity to invest into this emerging ecosystem and the entire process is designed to give investors the best experience. There are multiple payment methods available including BTC,ETH,BNB,USDT and traditional fiat credit card payments.</p>
Final Thoughts
<p class="s5">Bitcoin's declining exchange volumes open up opportunities for emerging tokens like Borroeto capture attention and gain traction in the cryptocurrency market. As investors diversify their portfolios and seek alternative investment options, tokens with innovative features, such as Borroe's AI-powered funding marketplace, become increasingly appealing.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>An expert on crypto has recently postulated that criminals are leaving Bitcoin in order to use stablecoins, which are considered to be an easier go-to for illegal financial activities.</p>
From Bitcoin to Stablecoins
<p>It has often been suggested, especially in the mainstream media, that&nbsp; Bitcoin was one of the main currencies in which to transact illicit activities. However, recent insights suggest a shift in this trend. Originally reported by CoinTelegraph, Tara Annison, the former head of technical crypto advisory at Elliptic, stated that the criminal underbelly of the crypto world is now leaning more towards stablecoins, particularly USD Coin (USDC), over Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Annison, during her presentation at EthCC in Paris, delved into the changing dynamics of crypto-related crimes. She pointed out that Bitcoin's decreasing popularity among criminals can be attributed to the rise of decentralised finance protocols, mixing services, and most notably, stablecoins. These digital assets, especially those pegged to the dollar, offer new, more discreet avenues for illicit transactions.</p>
Why the shift to stablecoins?
<p>Annison explains that assets like USDC offer easy access and can be effortlessly laundered through decentralised exchanges (DEXs). She remarked that in her view the deep liquidity and substantial volume on these platforms make them ideal for such activities.</p>
<p>However, it's not all gloomy. Annison highlighted a potential advantage for law enforcement agencies. Centralised issuers, such as Circle, have the capability to freeze specific USDC tokens. This means that before these criminals can convert their assets into fiat currencies through DEXs or centralised platforms, their funds can be halted. Annison commented that in her opinion we are witnessing a rise in blacklisted USDC and USDT accounts, effectively freezing assets that criminals can't access.</p>
$7.8 billion in scams
<p>Annison went on to say that stablecoins aren't the only concern. Ponzi and pyramid schemes continue to plague the crypto sector. A staggering $7.8 billion has been syphoned off from unsuspecting victims through these scams. Moreover, criminals are constantly innovating, employing techniques like chain swapping and asset swapping to obscure their tracks, using a myriad of tools, from DEXs to mixers, in order to muddy the trail for blockchain analytics firms.</p>
<p>In the light of crypto scams decreasing by 46% compared to previous years, Annison believes the current bear market in crypto is a significant factor, suggesting that with reduced hype and lower prices, the sector becomes less lucrative for criminals.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) encountered elevated downside risks early in the Asian session as the pair has been increasingly unable to sustain recent gains above the 30000 figure.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bears absorbed the 30183.73 level during the ongoing pullback, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 24750 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 30172, 30095, 30018, 29922, and 29768 areas during the depreciation, downside price objectives associated with selling pressure around the 30421.29 and 30281.68 areas.&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives include the 29403, 29089, 28775, 28386, and 27757 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following recent upside activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 28306, 27466, 26428, and 26272 levels.&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives related to this level include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Seoul, South Korea, July 21st, 2023, Chainwire</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Superblock, a contributor to Over Protocol, has raised $8 million from prominent companies and VCs in South Korea across two funding rounds. Investors included SK, Netmarble, DSC, E&amp;Investment, Schmidt, SpringCamp, and NaverZ.</p>
Ben (Jae-Yun) Kim, the founder of Superblock, said: "We are deeply diving into the South Korea market with the best local partners and looking to meet global partners accelerating us all over the world."
<p>As layer 1 blockchains have become faster and more established over time, the costs of bootstrapping and maintaining nodes have become increasingly expensive. As a consequence, blockchain applications have become challenging to operate without the use of costly equipment.</p>
<p>Over Protocol is a new layer 1 blockchain based on a protocol named "Ethanos" that only considers active accounts valid, enabling full nodes to discard obsolete data and operate with less storage, thus allowing for reduced storage requirements. With Over, anyone will be able to run a node and become a validator on their PCs at home. Ethanos has been published at EuroSys&rsquo;21.</p>
"With the ability for anyone to run a validator, individuals can earn potentially passive income through a process called home staking, enabling them to embrace a new lifestyle with new payment options, enhanced credit, and innovative finance opportunities," Ben added.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Proof Collective is trying to rekindle interest in its Moonbirds NFTs with a brand new 20,000-piece Mythics collection, released almost a year after its initial mention in August 2022.</p>
Proof Collective Drops New Collection
<p>Moonbirds, the once-celebrated NFT brand, is making a comeback with the launch of its 20,000-piece collection, Mythics, which is also the latest Ethereum profile picture (PFP) collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proof Collective, the company behind Moonbirds, aims to rekindle interest among NFT collectors after facing a significant decline in sales since its first release in April 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mythics collection is the result of nearly a year of development and will be introduced gradually. Proof revealed that it will unveil 100 new NFTs today, followed by an additional 100 NFTs daily for the next 200 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Half of the 100 new NFTs revealed daily would be randomly selected claimed eggs, while the other half would be 50 Oddities chosen to be burned. The slow rollout is a strategic move to enrich the underlying intellectual property and keep the community engaged.</p>
More About The Mythics Collection
<p>The upcoming Mythics collection is considered a more genuine follow-up to Moonbirds than its predecessor, Oddities. The team at Proof Collective delved deep into the lore of the Moonbirds world to ensure that the new collection offers an engaging and entertaining experience for collectors.</p>
<p>The new collection has been classified into three categories, depending on their functionality and power - the stone eggs, legendary eggs, and runic eggs. The first two types are rarer as they consist of only 20% of the collection each. All these eggs can spawn a specific number of Mythic forms; for legendary eggs, it is three; for runic eggs, it is two; and a stone egg can only spawn one. The person who is minting the NFT gets to choose which form of Mythic to spawn from each type of egg.</p>
Change In Licensing Model&nbsp;
<p>Once minted and in possession of a Mythic NFT, the holder will have complete commercial rights over the artwork and even be able to use the characters&rsquo; IP. This is a major change from the two earlier Moonbirds collections, which followed a Creative Commons CC0 licensing model. As a result, anyone could commercially reproduce and use the NFT artworks from those collections, even without owning the NFT.&nbsp;</p>
Will Moonbirds Regain Their Popularity?&nbsp;
<p>The cooling interest in the NFT market has impacted Moonbird sales, with average sale prices plummeting almost tenfold from their initial high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Led by co-founder and CEO Kevin Rose and supported by top crypto venture capitalist a16z, the Proof is expanding the Moonbirds brand lore to rekindle interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rose said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With Mythics, we&rsquo;re really trying to give our community a new experience that links together the Proof ecosystem and expands the storytelling that started with Moonbirds. I&rsquo;m so proud of how hard our teams have been working on this launch, with the goal of expanding Moonbirds' storytelling both through art and technology.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>The UK government rejected lawmakers&rsquo; proposal to treat crypto trading and related investment assets as it does gambling instruments.</p>
<p>The House of Commons Treasury Committee argued that unbacked, mainstream crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) should be held to the same standards as gambling. In its report, the Committee said:</p>

<p>With no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such.</p>

<p>Andrew Griffith, the UK Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said it &ldquo;firmly disagrees&rdquo; with the &ldquo;Committee&rsquo;s recommendation to regulate retail trading and investment activity in unbacked cryptoassets as gambling rather than as a financial service.&rdquo;</p>
Regulating Crypto as Gambling Would Drive Crypto Offshore
<p>In its response to the Committee&rsquo;s concerns, Griffith stated that such an approach to regulation would defy the globally agreed-upon standards and potentially drive crypto activity offshore.</p>
<p>The government also opined that such a law would fail to address certain risks associated with crypto trading, such as market manipulation.</p>
Regulating Crypto in the UK
<p>The government further stated it is already working on crypto asset regulation, and proposed rules were put before parliament and debated last month. In its response, the government said:</p>

<p>HM Treasury and the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] will work with the industry to ensure crypto firms are made fully aware of the standards required for approval at the FSMA gateway.</p>
<p>Further communications will be provided in due course to ensure standards for approval are clearly available to crypto firms operating in the UK.</p>

<p>Regulators in the UK have made strides in crypto regulation to address global concerns over the industry&rsquo;s risks.</p>
<p>The House of Lords recently passed the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which aims to regulate Bitcoin and crypto in the country.</p>
<p>Deemed a &ldquo;Rocket Boost for the UK economy,&rdquo; the bill seeks to make a &ldquo;technologically advanced financial services sector&rdquo; that is &ldquo;open&rdquo; and will &ldquo;grow the economy.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The recently uncovered personal diaries of Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison could be used as key evidence in the upcoming trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>
Ellison&rsquo;s Diaries Could Be Used In Court
<p>The diaries, both handwritten and private Google documents, contain the rantings and ramblings of the 27-year-old CEO and will provide an insight into the events leading up to the FTX calamity. Bankman-Fried is facing charges of misusing billions of dollars from customer accounts, with eight counts of fraud and election law violations against him.</p>
<p>As the CEO of FTX's sister concern Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison was a significant member of the SBF business empire. The New York Times has recently uncovered and reviewed her private Google docs, which have shed light on her mental state during the final months at FTX. The documents, previously unreported, reveal that she was going through a breakup with Sam Bankman-Fried and was plagued with self-doubt about her ability to lead Alameda Research effectively.</p>
A Star Witness Against SBF
<p>After the collapse of the FTX exchange, Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with authorities in building a case against Bankman-Fried. She is being considered a &ldquo;star witness&rdquo; primarily because of her close insight into the FTX ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal experts believe that Ellison's testimony could be the ace up the prosecution's sleeve in Bankman-Fried's trial. The power differential between Ellison and Bankman-Fried makes her a compelling voice, and her candid admissions could hold significant weight in the case against him.</p>
<p>Other FTX executives, like Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, have also pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate.</p>
Doubting Her Abilities As CEO
<p>The entries in Ellison's diaries revolve around her turbulent relationship with Bankman-Fried, the stress, anxiety, and how it affected her perception of Alameda and its work. She expressed feeling hurt and rejected during their toxic breakups, leading to a decreased excitement about Alameda, as it felt closely associated with him in a painful way. Moreover, she confessed to doubting her own abilities to justify her position at the company, feeling disadvantaged and unsure of her suitability for the role.</p>
SBF Lost Confidence In Alameda
<p>In April 2022, she wrote that a previous breakup with Bankman-Fried had significantly diminished her enthusiasm about Alameda. Court records show that during this time, Bankman-Fried invested over $400 million in Modulo Capital, a trading company led by someone he had previously dated, indicating his waning faith in Alameda Research. Ellison's writings revealed jealousy and resentment toward Modulo, as she felt sidelined.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried's trial is scheduled to begin in October in Manhattan. As the proceedings approach, all eyes are on Caroline Ellison and the potential impact of her testimony in bringing the accused founder to justice.</p>
