From yield farming to avoiding the hassle of manual transactions or checking the best pools and farms based on the market, the Liquidus app helps users from all categories to master their needs.</p>

<p>Moreover, Liquidus offers access to all farming options on different networks for example BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum, Cronos, or Polygon.</p>



<p>The pooled funds get used by traders from decentralized exchanges, to carry out smart contracts. Liquidity pool providers benefit from receiving parts of the trading fees.

<p>·&nbsp; LIQ-Single Token with APY 18.28% (can&#8217;t withdraw for 1 month after deposit)</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>SBF tweeted approval for a social media post suggesting restarting FTX and issuing new FTT tokens to users.</li><li>Bankman-Fried hailed the proposal as a &#8220;productive path for parties to explore&#8221;.</li><li>The suggestion was tweeted by Ran Neuner, a crypto influencer and coin Shiller who goes by CryptomanRan.</li></ul>

<p>Indeed, SBF agreed with a post from Ran Neuner who tweeted an FTX “recovery proposal. CryptomanRan, as Neuner is known on Crypto Twitter, also proposed distributing the new FTT tokens to FTX clients. “Accrue 100% of profits to token holders” Neuner added.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>CT Backlash</h2>



<p>Crypto Twitter was awash with skepticism and critique for the <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1601129063221202945?s=20&amp;t=1yN6YZmGMw65-Amh5ITPcQ" rel="nofollow noopener">suggestion</a>. Ripple CTO David Schwartz pressed about funding, also noting that profits were “already allocated”. Benjamin Cowen rebutted the idea as an attempt to fix a sh*tcoin with a sh*tcoin.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried To Testify In Washington&nbsp;</h2>



<p>On Friday, SBF also tweeted to confirm an appearance before lawmakers in Washington DC. Bankman-Fried will <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-testify-senate/">testify</a> before the House Committee on Financial Services on December 13, 2022. The FTX founder previously refused the request, claiming incomplete insight into how the crypto exchange crashed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried traded jabs with other crypto CeFi execs from rival companies and bankrupt entities alike. SBF and Binance Changpeng Zhao engaged in heated replies after CZ called out Kevin O’Leary for accepting $15 million to promote FTX.</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried squared up with Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, the founders of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, over allegations that FTX manipulated the price of TerraUSD (UST) and contributed to Luna’s crash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, U.S. prosecutors were investigating FTX and SBF in connection to Luna and 3AC’s collapse when this report was written.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted that he will appear before the House Committee on Financial Services.</li><li>SBF&#8217;s tweets on Friday were a sharp turnaround from his earlier refusal to testify in Washington DC.</li><li>The affirmation to attend Tuesday&#8217;s hearing came amid a Twitter spat with 3AC bosses Su Zhu and Kyle Davies.</li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted that he will be in Washington DC on December 13, 2022 to testify before the House Committee on Financial Services. Bankman-Fried claimed that his knowledge of the FTX crash was limited and he expects to be of little use to the committee, per his Friday Twitter post. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Chairwoman Maxine Waters invited SBF to testify regarding FTX before the committee. Bankman-Fried drew heavy backlash from the public after turning down the request.</p>



<p>The crypto exchange founder was supposedly “reviewing what happened” and said his knowledge of the matter was insufficient, a claim refuted by Rep. Waters who reminded SBF of his comments in the media after FTX <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-letter-ftx-employees/">collapse</a>. Waters also pointed out that SBF had enough insight, seeing as he was at the helm of affairs from the firm’s inception to its bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, Bankman-Fried’s media tour following FTX’s collapse has both infuriated begrudged users and left questions unanswered. At press time, the former tech tycoon admitted to loose financial control at the crypto exchange during an interview with The Block. SBF did not however clarify whether or not customer funds were used to backstop Alameda Research.</p>



<h2>3AC’s Su Zhu And Kyle Davies Blame FTX For Luna Crash</h2>



<p>SBF was embroiled in Twitter spat with Three Arrows Capital’s co-founder over accusations that FTX crashed LUNA in May. “you also have to be afraid of highly conflicted industry players working to destroy your assets” 3AC’s Su Zhu tweeted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhu also suggested that 3AC trading positions were “hunted” by SBF through his crypto exchange and his trading giant. Bankman-Fried refuted the allegations, claiming that it never happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors launched investigations into whether SBF was guilty of crashing Luna through market manipulation, per a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/07/business/ftx-sbf-crypto-market-investigation.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times </a>piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>CZ&#8217;s company hired Mazars to audit its Bitcoin reserves after FTX&#8217;s crash shook faith in crypto exchanges.</li><li>Mazars reported that Binance&#8217;s BTC reserves were fully collateralized at a 101% ratio.</li><li>The global auditor verified both proof-of-reserves and proof-of-liabilities following a snapshot taken on November 22. </li></ul>



<p>An audit on Binance’s Bitcoin (BTC) reserves confirmed that the crypto exchange held fully collateralized assets. Mazars, a global financial advisory firm, conducted the audit after taking a snapshot of the exchange’s BTC holdings on November 22. The snapshot covered Binance’s Bitcoin holdings across several blockchain networks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Mazars, the platform’s BTC reserves were overcollateralized at a 101% ratio. The auditor reported full collaboration after verifying the company’s proof-of-reserves and proof-of-liabilities.&nbsp; Mazars audit also included customer assets, per details from the <a href="https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>At the time of assessment, Mazars observed Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total platform liabilities,&#8221; said Mazars in an announcement. The exact percentage was 101%.</p></blockquote>



<p>As of November 3, 2022, on-chain data showed that the leading crypto exchange boasted the single largest BTC wallet with around 252,597 Bitcoin. The wallet held an estimated $5 billion in crypto, around 1.3% of BTC’s circulating supply.</p>

<h2>Binance and Kucoin Tap Same Auditor</h2>



<p>Notably, Kucoin also hired Mazars to verify its reserves in line with the trend among crypto exchanges. Mazars’ audit on Kucoin was not published at press time. Sam Bankman-Fried invested in Kucoin via FTX. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As the People&#39;s Exchange, we place the safety and security of users&#39; funds as our top priority.<br><br>And so, we are proud to announce that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KuCoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">#KuCoin</a> has partnered with Mazars, a leading international audit, tax and advisory firm to increase transparency!</p>&mdash; KUCOIN (@kucoincom) <a href="https://twitter.com/kucoincom/status/1599730151733874688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">December 5, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Third-party audits like these have become almost mandatory for crypto exchanges in particular following the FTX debacle. Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchange and his trading outfit Alameda allegedly defrauded users of their assets and filed for bankruptcy after incriminating evidence was leaked to the public. </p>



<p>The resulting fallout <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-vitalik-buterin-proof-of-reserve/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-vitalik-buterin-proof-of-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivized</a> other centralized trading platforms like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cz-binance-issues-another-warning-directed-at-exchanges-crypto-com-and-gate-io/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cz-binance-issues-another-warning-directed-at-exchanges-crypto-com-and-gate-io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/changpeng-zhao-takes-a-dig-kraken-kucoin/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/changpeng-zhao-takes-a-dig-kraken-kucoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kucoin</a>, and Kraken to publish proof of their reserves, showing customer assets as well as liabilities. On-chain data aggregators like CoinMarketCap and Nansen also launched dashboards where users can view exchange reserves for themselves.</p>



<p>Not every crypto exchange had published proof-of-reserves, proof-of-liabilities, and third-party audits. However, Binance and Kraken were quick to act in the wake of FTX&#8217;s crash. Users also pointed out that reserve audits and reports should be published regularly by exchanges and companies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The custodian will hold customers&#8217; assets and mirror user deposits on crypto exchanges.</li><li>Zodia dubbed the new service &#8220;Interchange&#8221;, per reports on Wednesday.</li><li>The crypto custodial company announced the offering at a time when crypto custody concerns remained a trending topic following FTX&#8217;s crash. </li></ul>



<p>Zodia, a crypto company that offers digital asset custody services, announced a service touted as a solution to cryptocurrency exchange insolvency. The new service dubbed “Interchange” will mirror client deposits on crypto trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that the crypto custodian will allow users to deposit their tokens with the platform. <a href="https://www.zodia.io/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.zodia.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zodia</a> will then mirror client assets 1:1 on their preferred crypto exchanges. In theory, Zodia said Interchange will allow crypto participants to avoid investment losses and maintain access to their crypto even if centralized exchanges like FTX collapse. </p>



<h2>FTX Collapse Incentvizes Rethink On Crypto Custody From Zodia And Others</h2>



<p>Indeed, the crypto storage company unveiled the service in the wake of FTX’s collapse. Sam Bankman-Fried froze users from withdrawing their funds after Alameda’s balance sheet was leaked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leak revealed that the two entities led by SBF were comingled, confirming fears harbored by FTX users and crypto participants alike. FTX eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. Bankman-Fried also stepped down as CEO but has supposedly remained in the Bahamas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF, once a cryptocurrency tycoon, was the subject of probes, questions, and a congressional inquiry at press time. Congressperson Maxine Waters invited SBF to appear before a Financial services Senate committee and testify to events surrounding FTX&#8217;s collapse, although Bankman-Fried turned down the request to the chagrin on the crypto community.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rep. Waters, and the House Committee on Financial Services:<br><br>Once I have finished learning and reviewing what happened, I would feel like it was my duty to appear before the committee and explain.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure that will happen by the 13th.  But when it does, I will testify. <a href="https://t.co/c0P8yKlyQt" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/c0P8yKlyQt</a></p>&mdash; SBF (@SBF_FTX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1599511560384225281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Crypto custody resurfaced as a major topic of discourse within the crypto community, as signaled by tweets from prominent crypto proponents like Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, Kraken founder Jesse Powell, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies also responded to crypto user needs in the wake of FTX’s failure. Ledger, a crypto wallet maker backed by FTX and SBF, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ledger-hardware-wallet-amid-ftx-debacle/">unveiled</a> their latest hardware wallet on Tuesday. Hardware wallets provide users with a self-custody option for their crypto, allowing customers to manage their tokens themselves and control their own private keys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hardware wallet proponents rallied around a popular cry after FTX locked users out of their assets &#8211; “Not your keys, not your coins”. </p>

<ul><li>The funds in SushiSwap’s treasury can only sustain it for another 1.5 years.</li><li>The decentralized exchange is currently burning through $5 million a year.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Jared Grey has proposed to divert all fees to the exchange’s treasury for one year.</li><li>A new tokenomics proposal is in the pipeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Decentralized exchange (DEX) SushiSwap has seen an alarming depletion in its treasury. Mounting expenditures paired with uncertainty in the crypto market pose a threat to the decentralized exchange’s operation. Jared Grey, the CEO or “Head Chef” of SushiSwap has spent the past two months analyzing the exchange’s finances. The&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sushiswap-approves-restructuring-proposal/" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEX</a>&nbsp;used to operate with an annual runway of $9 million. That figure has been brought down to $5 million, but that still translates to a runway of just 1.5 years. Grey has come out with a controversial remedy for this situation.</p>



<h2><strong>Proposal to divert all of SushiSwap’s fees to the treasury</strong></h2>



<p>The Head Chef has&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.sushi.com/t/reinstated-increase-kanpai-treasury-allocation-to-100/11475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposed</a>&nbsp;that the Kanpai i.e. the portion of the fees that are sent to the exchange’s treasury, be increased to 100%. This would effectively divert all fees from the exchange to the treasury at the expense of Sushi stakers. This diversion of funds would last for a year or until the DEX implements new tokenomics. The SushiSwap chief has indicated that new tokenomics are currently in the works and may come into effect between Q2 and Q3 of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>An additional benefit of Kanpai’s solution to the Treasury is the diversification of assets, which limits the need for market selling Sushi, which is a net positive for all stakeholders.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Speaking on the native token SUSHI, Grey revealed that it is currently near full distribution of its supply, ruling out the possibility to use it to fund SushiSwap’s expenses. According to data from&nbsp;<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>, the token is currently trading at $1.25. The price has taken a significant hit of 9.5% since the CEO’s proposal came out. Head Chef Jared Grey had posted the same&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.sushi.com/t/withdrawn-kanpai-treasury-increase-to-100-for-1-year/11267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposal</a>&nbsp;back in October, but it was withdrawn shortly after. It was reinstated following a thorough analysis of the DEX’s finances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Apple iPod creator Tony Fadell worked on the design for Ledger&#8217;s new hardware wallet.</li><li>The so-called Ledger Stax wallet will feature an e-ink display for users to view NFTs and crypto transactions directly on the device.</li><li>Stax&#8217;s release was announced amid increased interest in self-custody solutions following FTX&#8217;s crash.</li></ul>



<p>Ledger, a popular crypto hardware wallet company, teamed up with Tony Fadell for its Stax self-custody solution expected in Q1 2023. Fadell is credited for designing Apple’s iPod device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wallet maker’s CEO and chairman Pascal Gauthier expanded on the approach taken by the company for its Stax hardware wallet. CTO Charles Guillemet affirmed that the aim was to achieve mass adoption with a device that features accessibility and self-custody security for crypto users. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When we designed Ledger Stax, our biggest requirement from a security standpoint was to fulfill those 3 security properties while improving user experience. What we did was reuse our Ledger Nano security architecture, then we improved the trusted display property.</p><cite>&#8211; Charles Guillemet, CTO.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fadell designed the Stax hardware wallet with an e-ink display wrapped around the body of the device. Sources said users will be able to view their NFTs and transaction history from the interactive display.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the inside, there are built-in magnets to allow users to hold multiple devices securely together. Stax’s size is roughly the same as a regular credit card and features a USB-type C port. Ledger will offer its Stax wallet for $279 come 2023.</p>

<h2>Ledger’s Key Timing</h2>



<p>The company designs hardware wallets &#8211; crypto wallet solutions that allow users to directly manage their digital tokens and private keys. Following FTX’s crash in November, advocacy for self-custody among crypto participants and proponents alike increased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, FTX was an investor in the hardware wallet maker before the centralized crypto exchange went belly up. Ledger was however not exposed to the bankrupt platform and was not <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankrupt-sam-bankman-fried-resigns/">included</a> in the Chapter 11 filing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ian Rogers, chief experience officer at the wallet maker, told CoinDesk that sales increased as the FTX spiraled down. “We were ready,” Roger said, disclosing that the company set a new record for product sales on November 14, three days after FTX filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on November 11. </p>

<h2>Celsius Filed For Bankruptcy</h2>



<p>The once-premium crypto lender <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-network-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/">filed</a> for bankruptcy after Terra imploded and shaved off over $40 billion from the markets. In the following weeks and months, so-called centralized entities like Celsius, BlockFi, Three Arrows Capital, and Voyager Digital all fell into ruin. </p>



<p>Following the chapter 11 filing, CEO Alex Mashinsky resigned in September amid rumors of malpractice at the company. An early October court filing revealed 14,000 pages of Celsius user transaction history, including Mashinsky’s trades as well as other top-ranking executives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The filing showed that Mashinsky, CTO Nuke Goldstein, and former CSO Daniel Leon all <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-users-doxxed-bankruptcy-filing/">withdrew </a>millions from the company’s custody accounts sometime between May and June 2022, around the time of Terra’s failure. </p>

<p>London-based crypto lender Nexo has announced that it will begin shutting down its operations in the United States. The lender will phase out its products and services from the country over the next few months.</p>



<h2><strong>Nexo is leaving due to a lack of regulatory clarity</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://nexo.io/blog/nexo-announces-gradual-departure-from-the-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> put out by the lender, the lack of regulatory clarity is one of the core reasons that prompted this drastic move. The inconsistent approach from state and federal regulators has only made things worse. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our decision comes after more than 18 months of good-faith dialogue with US state and federal regulators which has come to a dead end.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The press release further revealed that in an attempt to please the regulators, Nexo had off-boarded clients from the states of New York and Vermont between 2021 and 2022. Additionally, the crypto lender suspended new registrations for all US clients for our Earn Interest Product. From 6 December onwards, the Earn Interest Product ban will be extended to 8 additional states, namely Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Wisconsin, California, and Washington.</p>



<p>Other efforts to get on the good side of U.S. regulators include registering token sales with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), delisting XRP following the SEC’s&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ive-always-felt-good-about-our-legal-arguments-and-i-even-feel-better-now-stuart-alderoty-on-securing-hinman-docs-in-ripple-vs-sec-case/" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit</a>&nbsp;against Ripple Labs, and exiting the New York and Vermont crypto market at the request of officials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the above-mentioned efforts undertaken by Nexo, negotiations with U.S. regulators have fallen apart. The lender has indicated that there is a power struggle among regulatory agencies at the state and federal levels which has led to inconsistent decisions. The lack of clarity has also led to legal trouble for the firm as it faces enforcement actions by State regulators from <a href="https://dfpi.ca.gov/2022/09/26/dfpi-joins-other-state-securities-regulators-to-bring-actions-against-another-crypto-interest-account-provider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">California</a>, Kentucky, New York, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, <a href="https://dfi.wa.gov/sites/default/files/securities/enforcement-actions/S-21-3225-22-SOC01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Washington</a>, and <a href="https://dfr.vermont.gov/sites/finreg/files/regbul/dfr-order-22-022-s-nexo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vermont</a>. These include cease and desist orders as well as a statement of charges. </p>



<p>Nexo has clarified that arrangements have been made with the company’s payment specialists so that all withdrawals can be processed in real-time.&nbsp;</p>
