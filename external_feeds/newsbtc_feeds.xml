					<description><![CDATA[Renowned analyst Josh Olszewicz has shared some compelling insights on Ethereum&#8217;s price trajectory. Drawing parallels from historical patterns, Olszewicz&#8217;s analysis suggests that Ethereum might be gearing up for a significant rally in the coming months. Historical Pattern: Ethereum Forms Ascending Triangle Olszewicz starts by highlighting Ethereum&#8217;s current price pattern, jokingly stating, &#8220;Ethereum: ascending triangle 450 million years in the making w/fib extensions to $3k.&#8221; This ascending triangle, characterized by a flat top and rising bottom, has been forming since May 2022, and if history is any guide, it could be a bullish sign for Ethereum. Descending volume, another feature of this pattern, further strengthens the bullish bias. However, Olszewicz cautions that the &#8220;bias remains bullish until price breaks below diagonal support.&#8221; He also points out the psychological resistance at $2,000, noting it as an &#8220;extremely obvious signal that it&#8217;s go time, which should help the breakout.&#8221; Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF To bolster his analysis, Olszewicz draws parallels from Bitcoin&#8217;s past. He recalls, &#8220;take BTC in 2015/2016 [the price formed an ascending triangle for 210 days with descending volume] and BTC in 2018/2019 [ascending triangle for 130 days with descending volume] as examples.&#8221; In both instances, Bitcoin surged towards the Fibonacci extension levels post the breakout. Ethereum itself isn&#8217;t a stranger to such patterns. Olszewicz cites, &#8220;ETH has also had previous examples in 2017 (bullish continuation) and 2019 (bullish reversal).” Each ascending triangle pattern lasted 180 days. Both times ETH surged towards the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level. Drawing from these historical patterns, Olszewicz suggests that Ethereum is currently holding the potential to overshoot the 1.618 Fibonacci level and possibly reach the 2.618 level, which translates to a price of $3,800. However, he wisely advises, &#8220;but don&#8217;t get out the imaginary profit calculator just yet, let&#8217;s break $2k first.&#8221; ETH vs. BTC: Which One Is The Better Trade? While Ethereum&#8217;s potential rally is intriguing, Olszewicz also delves into its performance relative to Bitcoin. He observes that Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin year-to-date, attributing this to the ETF narrative and Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance as hard money. He speculates, &#8220;the better trade may continue to be BTC/USD, especially with initial spot ETF inflows favoring BTC.&#8221; Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Surging Today? However, if the ETH/BTC pair can break and sustain new highs, it might hint at a runaway trade for Ethereum. But Olszewicz remains skeptical, stating it&#8217;s &#8220;unlikely based on ETF flows.&#8221; Olszewicz also doesn&#8217;t shy away from discussing potential bearish scenarios. He&#8217;s closely watching certain bearish ETH/BTC levels, including the current local low at 0.050 and the previous inverse head and shoulders neckline at 0.039. For Bitcoin, he suggests a potential move to $42,000, provided it maintains certain bullish conditions. He notes, &#8220;as long as we can maintain prices above the midline of the PF &#38; stay in the cloud, we have a decent shot at reaching $42k before halving.&#8221; Wrapping up his analysis, Olszewicz envisions a dream trade where Bitcoin breaks bullish first, possibly due to technicals or a spot ETF approval. In this scenario, Ethereum breaks $2,000 but lags behind Bitcoin, leading to ETH/BTC getting “crushed, allowing for an eventual profit taking rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum”. However, he concludes with a word of caution: &#8220;without inflows, we ain&#8217;t movin.&#8221; At press time, ETH traded at $1,860.

					<description><![CDATA[In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a 2% surge, pulling the broader crypto market along with it into a bullish trajectory. Leading the charge among altcoins are PEPE with an 8% gain, followed closely by SHIB and HBAR both at 6.3%, TON at 5.6%, SNX at 5.4%, and SOL at 5.3%. The overall crypto market capitalization has swelled to $1.18 trillion(+1.63%), while Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance in the market has edged up to 50.63%. Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? The market&#8217;s euphoria was initially triggered by a news piece which was shared by Bloomberg&#8217;s Eric Balchunas. He conveyed that insider sources from BlackRock and Invesco suggest that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF is more a question of &#8216;when&#8217; rather than &#8216;if&#8217;, likely materializing within the next four to six months. The source for this information was Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz who made these revelations during a recent earnings call. This news, hinting at the imminent approval of a Bitcoin ETF, sent ripples across the Bitcoin and crypto community, igniting optimism and speculation. Following the news, whale activity has also been a notable driver behind the surge. Related Reading: Record-Breaking $10 Billion Open Interest Fuels Bullish Speculation For Bitcoin Reversal Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, tweeted: &#8220;Bitcoin whales opened giga long positions at $29k.&#8221; He also shared screenshots of the taker buy sell ratio on BitMEX, ByBit, Deribit and Huobi Global. Each chart shows an extremely high and sudden jump in buying volume, presumably from whales, as Ju said. Ali Martinez, a renowned analyst, chimed in on the significance of open interest. He pointed out that the Open Interest, which represents the total number of open long and short positions across all crypto derivative exchanges, has reached a remarkable year-to-date peak of $10.086 billion. This metric is particularly noteworthy given its historically strong correlation with Bitcoin&#8217;s price. The recent dip in Bitcoin to $28,700 seems to have presented an opportune moment for traders to adopt a bullish stance, suggesting that Bitcoin&#8217;s price might be poised for an upward trajectory Related Reading: ARK Invest’s CEO Says SEC Could Approve Multiple Spot Bitcoin ETFs Simultaneously Julio Moreno, from CryptoQuant, noted a sharp rise in Coinbase&#8217;s premium, indicating strengthening Bitcoin demand in the US. This observation aligns with the narrowing discount of GBTC, which many see as a proxy of Grayscale&#8217;s potential success against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its lawsuit for a spot ETF, but also as an indicator of the likelihood of a Bitcoin Spot ETF being approved. The GBTC discount fell to -27% yesterday. From a technical market perspective, the euphoria in the market has led to a short squeeze. A total of $37.19 million was liquidated in BTC shorts yesterday, $65.46 million in the overall crypto market. The short liquidations for Bitcoin were the highest since July 13 when the price rose to its yearly high at $31,820. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that while short-sellers were gradually liquidated while there was a premium on spot markets and funding rates on futures markets were falling. This means that the rise move was primarily driven via the spot markets rather than over-leveraged long positions. Remarkably, whales played a key role. At press time, the Bitcoin price faced critical resistance between $29,900 and $30,000. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradigView.com]]></description>

<p>Ali Martinez, a renowned analyst, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/record-breaking-10-billion-open-interest-fuels-bullish-speculation-for-bitcoin-reversal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">chimed</a> in on the significance of open interest. He pointed out that the Open Interest, which represents the total number of open long and short positions across all crypto derivative exchanges, has reached a remarkable year-to-date peak of $10.086 billion.</p>
<p>This metric is particularly noteworthy given its historically strong correlation with Bitcoin&#8217;s price. The recent dip in Bitcoin to $28,700 seems to have presented an opportune moment for traders to adopt a bullish stance, suggesting that Bitcoin&#8217;s price might be poised for an upward trajectory</p>

<p>Julio Moreno, from CryptoQuant, <a href="https://twitter.com/jjcmoreno/status/1688987622259978241" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">noted</a> a sharp rise in Coinbase&#8217;s premium, indicating strengthening Bitcoin demand in the US. This observation aligns with the narrowing discount of GBTC, which many see as a proxy of Grayscale&#8217;s potential success against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its lawsuit for a spot ETF, but also as an indicator of the likelihood of a Bitcoin Spot ETF being approved. The GBTC discount fell to -27% yesterday.</p>

<p>From a technical market perspective, the euphoria in the market has led to a short squeeze. A total of $37.19 million was liquidated in BTC shorts yesterday, $65.46 million in the overall crypto market. The short liquidations for Bitcoin were the highest since July 13 when the price rose to its yearly high at $31,820.</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-546342 size-full" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitcoin-liquidations.png?resize=3442%2C980" alt="Bitcoin liquidations" width="3442" height="980" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitcoin-liquidations.png?resize=3442%2C980?w=3442 3442w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitcoin-liquidations.png?resize=3442%2C980?w=460 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitcoin-liquidations.png?resize=3442%2C980?w=768 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitcoin-liquidations.png?resize=3442%2C980?w=860 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitcoin-liquidations.png?resize=3442%2C980?w=1536 1536w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitcoin-liquidations.png?resize=3442%2C980?w=2048 2048w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitcoin-liquidations.png?resize=3442%2C980?w=750 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitcoin-liquidations.png?resize=3442%2C980?w=1140 1140w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitcoin-liquidations.png?resize=3442%2C980?w=3000 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"/>
<p>Nevertheless, it is worth noting that while short-sellers were gradually liquidated while there was a premium on spot markets and funding rates on futures markets were falling. This means that the rise move was primarily driven via the spot markets rather than over-leveraged long positions. Remarkably, whales played a key role.</p>
<p>At press time, the Bitcoin price faced critical resistance between $29,900 and $30,000.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a new development, a trader who placed a substantial $10 million bet against LUNA in May 2022 before the then native currency and UST—the algorithmic stablecoin, collapsed is now setting his sight on Reddit Moons. Going by the moniker &#8220;GCR,&#8221; on-chain data on August 8 showed the trader moved 450,000 MOON from MEXC Exchange to Kraken. Moons Rallying Moons, the ERC-20 token associated with the r/CryptoCurrency forum on Reddit, is firm and on an uptrend, looking at current price action. At spot rates, the token is up 400% from late July and changing hands at $0.47, hovering near 2023 highs.  Related Reading: HBAR Token Scores Impressive Gains As Major Cryptos Nosedive Based on price action from MEXC trade data, the immediate resistance level is at $0.65, which was printed in late July 2023. However, with the revival currently visible across the crypto market, prices will likely continue increasing. To illustrate, Moons is already up 90% in August alone, rebounding from $0.25 and surging to spot rates.  Several factors are believed to be fanning demand. One of these is the influence of traders like GCR, who are acquiring Moons and potentially improving sentiment on altcoins considering the recent lower lows recorded in the better part of July. However, looking at how MOON prices reacted after Kraken&#8217;s listing on August 7, the community appears more buoyant and confident of improving liquidity.  Kraken Listing As trackers reveal, before the Kraken listing, most Moons trading activity was concentrated on MEXC Exchange. On August 7, Kraken announced its listing of Moons alongside Bricks (BRICK). Alongside the announcement, Kraken said users could deposit MOON and BRICK from the Arbitrum Nova network. Moons and Bricks are also available for trading on Kraken and Kraken Pro accounts. From Kraken Pro, clients can trade MOON and BRICK perpetual derivatives. MOON has been described as a &#8220;community-driven&#8221; token since its launch in May 2020. Within the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit, it serves multiple functions, including rewarding users who contribute positively. Reddit said Moons&#8217; holders can access premium features, including badges and custom emojis, and tip fellow community members. Moreover, holding Moons grants voting power in subreddit polls, affording holders a say in shaping the subreddit&#8217;s future.  Related Reading: Litecoin Long-Term Holders Smartly Exited Before Halving, Data Shows Arbitrum data on August 8 shows over 121 million Moons in circulation.

					<description><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market has experienced a period of stagnation, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading within a narrow range for the past week.  However, according to market analyst Ali Martinez, there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon as Open Interest, a key indicator of market sentiment, has skyrocketed to a year-to-date high. Correlation Between Open Interest And Bitcoin Notably, the correlation between Open Interest and Bitcoin’s price has historically been significant, suggesting that this surge may herald a potential reversal in the leading cryptocurrency&#8217;s fortunes.  Martinez believes the recent dip to $28,700 prompted crypto traders to take long positions, fueling optimism for a Bitcoin resurgence. Over the past week, the overall crypto market has experienced a period of stagnation, with Bitcoin trading within a tight range of $28,900 to $29,200.  This consolidation follows a continuous decline from its yearly high of $31,800, which has also set the tone for other major cryptocurrencies. The lack of significant price movement has left investors and traders eager for a catalyst that could propel the market forward. Related Reading: Is Curve DAO (CRV) Price On Track To Reach Or Exceed $1 This Month? Nevertheless, the number of open long and short positions on crypto derivative exchanges has surged to a remarkable year-to-date high of $10.086 billion. This surge in Open Interest is significant, indicating heightened market activity and trader engagement. One crucial aspect to consider is the historical correlation between Open Interest and the price of Bitcoin. This relationship has often been strong, with Open Interest as a leading indicator for potential price movements. As Open Interest reaches new highs, it suggests that market participants are actively taking positions in anticipation of a significant market shift. While the crypto market has been characterized by stagnation and decline in recent times, the surge in Open Interest to a yearly high provides hope for a bullish reversal.  Bearish Divergence Signals Potential Pullback For BTC Bitcoin has recently exhibited some intriguing patterns that warrant attention from both technical analysis and on-chain analysis perspectives.  According to Baro Virtual, CryptoQuant author and analyst, a bearish divergence on the BTC Average Return Index suggests a possible pullback to $26,000.  Simultaneously, on-chain analysis indicates a weakening return index performance alongside a rising Bitcoin price, potentially signaling a phase of re-accumulation that may benefit investors seeking lower prices.  The transition of the return index into the negative zone suggests a shift in market sentiment towards re-accumulation.  Related Reading: Terra Luna Token Burn Proposal Greenlit – Could $1 Be Hittable? Re-accumulation typically occurs when long-term investors or institutions acquire Bitcoin at lower prices, anticipating future price appreciation. This behavior can be seen as a positive sign for the market&#8217;s long-term health, reflecting increased interest from strategic investors. As of the current update, BTC has broken out of its range which has persisted since the beginning of August. It is trading at $29,600, reflecting a 2.5% increase over the past 24 hours. However, the upward price movement of BTC in the short term may not be sustained unless accompanied by substantial trading volume. Several significant resistance levels lie ahead, posing challenges for BTC&#8217;s attempt to reclaim the $30,000 milestone. To begin with, the $29,700 zone presents a formidable barrier, followed by subsequent resistance walls at $30,000, $30,700, $31,200, and $31,500. In the short and mid-term, BTC, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, will need a compelling catalyst to push beyond these levels. Without such, a retracement is possible in the coming weeks.  Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>Simultaneously, on-chain analysis indicates a weakening return index performance alongside a rising Bitcoin price, potentially signaling a phase of re-accumulation that may benefit investors seeking lower prices. </p>
<p>The transition of the return index into the negative zone suggests a shift in market sentiment towards re-accumulation. </p>

<p>Re-accumulation typically occurs when long-term investors or institutions acquire Bitcoin at lower prices, anticipating future price appreciation. This behavior can be seen as a positive sign for the market&#8217;s long-term health, reflecting increased interest from strategic investors.</p>

<p>As of the current update, BTC has broken out of its range which has persisted since the beginning of August. It is trading at $29,600, reflecting a 2.5% increase over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>However, the upward price movement of BTC in the short term may not be sustained unless accompanied by substantial trading volume. Several significant resistance levels lie ahead, posing challenges for BTC&#8217;s attempt to reclaim the $30,000 milestone.</p>
<p>To begin with, the $29,700 zone presents a formidable barrier, followed by subsequent resistance walls at $30,000, $30,700, $31,200, and $31,500. In the short and mid-term, BTC, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, will need a compelling catalyst to push beyond these levels. Without such, a retracement is possible in the coming weeks. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[In recent weeks, Ethereum has demonstrated a downtrend in shorter timeframes, where the bulls struggled to maintain the critical $1900 support zone. This allowed the bears to gain dominance. However, there appears to be a change in price sentiment during recent trading sessions. Related Reading: Terra Luna Token Burn Proposal Greenlit – Could $1 Be Hittable? On the daily chart, ETH experienced a 2% climb. A positive movement is observable on the weekly chart, although it remains relatively modest. Despite the upward movement, there is a potential risk of waning bullish momentum if Ethereum fails to sustain its price above the immediate trading zone. From a technical standpoint, the altcoin is leaning toward bullishness, with increased buying strength apparent in recent trading sessions. Both accumulation and demand have played a role in this positive shift. Furthermore, Ethereum&#8217;s market capitalization has grown, indicating heightened demand during the past trading sessions. At the time of writing, ETH was priced at $1,840. It is currently nearing its immediate resistance level of $1,850, which has previously functioned as a liquidity pocket. Approaching this level might trigger a price decrease. However, if the altcoin successfully surpasses $1,850 and establishes a trading position above the subsequent resistance at $1,870, it could signal a more prolonged period of bullish activity. On the flip side, the support level is $1,780, followed by another at $1,760. Falling within this range might lead to further downward movement in the price. The trading volume of ETH in the previous session was lower. However, the fact that it was in the green indicates that buyers were gradually entering the market. Technical Analysis Regarding buyer activity, there has been increased demand for the altcoin following a notable dip within the past 48 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) climbed above the 60 mark, suggesting a revival for the altcoin and signaling buyer engagement surpassed seller activity. Furthermore, the price remained above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that buyers were the driving force behind the market&#8217;s price momentum. Another observation is that ETH remained above the 200-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line (green). This suggests a substantial price surge could be anticipated before the bullish momentum wanes. Correlating with the increase in demand, ETH exhibited buy signals on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which signifies price momentum and potential shifts, showed green histograms aligned with buy signals. These buy signals also suggest a potential upward movement in the price over the subsequent immediate trading sessions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Accumulation Again, Bullish Sign? Additionally, the Bollinger Bands appeared wide from each other, indicating the likelihood of price volatility, although not overly significant as the bands mainly remained parallel. These parallel bands coincide with the immediate resistance level. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from TradingView.com]]></description>

The number one cryptocurrency by market cap might try another run north of critical resistance, but recent data points towards further sideways price action. Related Reading: Terra Luna Token Burn Proposal Greenlit – Could $1 Be Hittable? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $29,400 with a 2% profit in the past day.

Over the past two years, the Bitcoin price has been moving in tandem with macroeconomic forces. In particular, BTC reacts to the tension from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) and its interest rates hike program. The financial institution is entering a quiet period due to summer vacations. As a result, according to crypto analysis firm Blofin, Bitcoin and the crypto market will likely stay within their current range until September. Over this period, price movements and volatility spikes will continue to decline as the low liquidity environment impacts price action, and institutions hedging their positions impact volatility, Blofin stated. Furthermore, the report claims that potential interest rate hikes are “somewhat priced in” and could be inefficient in propelling BTC above $30,000. The current macroeconomic landscape could persist until May 2023 as inflation, the key reason behind the interest rates hike, becomes sticky. The above could translate into sideways price action until that period or until the U.S. Fed decides to cut interest rates paving the way for more risk appetite across the sector.

					<description><![CDATA[In recent developments, Hong Kong regulators have issued cautionary warnings to crypto investors, asking them to be careful of potential investment risks. According to the city’s chief regulatory agency, some cryptocurrency trading platforms have been making erroneous claims about meeting the regulatory requirements for digital assets.  Investors Beware Of False Claims From Crypto Firms The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the chief regulatory body of Hong Kong, released the alert on August 7.

					<description><![CDATA[ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has sparked speculation with her recent prediction that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may potentially grant approval for multiple Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) simultaneously. Deviation From The Norm For Spot Bitcoin ETFs In a recent interview with Bloomberg on August 7, Cathie Wood shared her insight that the SEC might opt for a groundbreaking strategy by approving more than one Bitcoin ETF at the same time. Related Reading: PayPal’s PYUSD Launch Triggers Calls For Stablecoin Bill Wood&#8217;s assertion, &#8220;I think the SEC, if it’s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once,&#8221; has captured attention, especially given her prior assurance that her firm would lead in securing approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Wood&#8217;s projection deviates from the conventional practice of sequential ETF approvals. By envisioning a simultaneous approval scenario, she introduces a novel approach that could streamline the regulatory process. This potential shift aims to foster a balanced and inclusive investment landscape, catering to an expected demand of over $50 billion. Implications For The Cryptocurrency Industry Historically, the SEC has not granted approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, while permitting the listing of ETFs tied to crypto futures. Wood&#8217;s forward-looking statement emerges amidst a surge in applications from major players like BlackRock Inc, Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco, all vying for the approval of similar crypto ETFs as ARK.  Wood&#8217;s forecast also emphasizes the significance of strategic marketing. Given the anticipated resemblance among various funds, Wood suggests that issuers&#8217; marketing prowess will be crucial in setting them apart as a race for dominance is expected. This insight underscores the competitive edge sought by applicants in a rapidly evolving sector. BTC price recovers as positive sentiment grows &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com As Cathie Wood&#8217;s prediction reverberates through the financial realm, industry observers await  SEC&#8217;s response. With a significant deadline for ARK&#8217;s application looming on August 13, amidst speculation of potential delays, Wood suggested that the deadline might pass and be extended but then the date will be eagerly waited on.  Although Ark Invest filed for its spot Bitcoin ETFs application on May 15, earlier than others like BlackRock who filed its application on June  15, this was thought to be a race for winners or losers according to Cathie&#8217;s &#8220;first in line&#8221; phrase to favor Ark Invest. However, her revised view makes the race for Spot Bitcoin ETFs and SEC ruling more interesting. This innovative forecast accentuates the intersection of forward-thinking and regulatory dynamics, highlighting an era where digital assets are increasingly integrated within traditional financial frameworks, especially the recent push for ETFs. Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF Wood is known for her unwavering conviction in disruptive innovations and the companies behind them with her investment management firm ARK Invest boasting numerous high-value stocks like CoinBase Global (COIN), Tesla(TSL), and Block (SQ), among others.  Wood also reportedly bought $100,000 worth of Bitcoin years ago when it was sold for $250 apiece and the CEO revealed that she has never sold a single BTC.

					<description><![CDATA[Since the Bitcoin bull market began, one discussion that has never left the crypto community is when the next bull rally will commence and if it would follow the previously established trend around the halving events. To this end, a crypto analyst, Lark Davis, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to share his forecast around the next bull market. What Could Happen If History Repeats Itself All of the previous Bitcoin bull markets have always begun after the BTC halving event which cuts block rewards in half. However, this time around, there have been dissenting views regarding the digital asset’s tendency to follow this established trend once more due to deviations in various Bitcoin metrics. But Davis has shared a possible scenario for BTC if the bull market begins after the rally once more. Related Reading: Litecoin Hashrate Taps New All-Time High, Will LTC Price Follow Suit? In the chart shared by the analyst on X, he points out a long period of accumulation. This is when investors fill up their bags with BTC as it is possibly the lowest that the price of the digital asset would get during the bear market. BTC could reach $180,000 if the bull market follows halving cycle &#124; Source: Lark Davis on X Next comes the Bitcoin halving event, at which time, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market start to pick up steam. This is when the bull market starts to take shape, leading to the next part of the trend which is when prices explode. In Davis’ post, he shows that the price of the digital asset could rise as high as $180,000 during this time. If the cryptocurrency does touch this price mark, it would mean that the price of BTC would almost triple from its current all-time high of $69,000. How This Can Happen For Bitcoin As clarified by the analyst in his X post, for any of this to happen, it would mean that BTC would have to completely follow the trends of the previous bull cycles. This would mean the bottom could likely be reached in early 2024, but it would also be the same year for the start of the bull run. Even if Bitcoin does follow this trend though, it would not always be ‘up-only’ for the market. It would mean that the bull market would top out sometime in 2025 and then there would likely be a market crash that sends BTC spiraling in the following year. As Davis points out, the digital asset could tumble 70% to reach $50,000 again. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Break Above $2,000 If This Happens However, even with the obvious bear market that would follow this trend, it is still an incredibly bullish scenario for Bitcoin and the crypto market at large. The bull market would last around one year, following historical data, providing ample opportunity for investors to make the most of the market. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024, and if history is anything to go by, this is around when the bull market should be expected to start back up.

It would mean that the bull market would top out sometime in 2025 and then there would likely be a market crash that sends BTC spiraling in the following year. As Davis points out, the digital asset could tumble 70% to reach $50,000 again.</p>

<p class="p2">However, even with the obvious bear market that would follow this trend, it is still an incredibly bullish scenario for Bitcoin and the crypto market at large. The bull market would last around one year, following historical data, providing ample opportunity for investors to make the most of the market.</p>
<p class="p2">The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024, and if history is anything to go by, this is around when the bull market should be expected to start back up.</p>
