The filing reaffirms the institution&#8217;s jurisdiction on securities laws, explaining that Coinbase misinterprets the Howey test and criticizing the &#8220;major questions doctrine&#8221; usage in the case.</strong></p>
<h2>SEC Rails Against Coinbase, Reaffirms Jurisdiction on Securities</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) answered the latest filing of Coinbase regarding the exchange&#8217;s criticism of the regulator&#8217;s actions in the crypto environment. The filing, introduced on July 7 before judge Katherine Polk Failla, tries to bring down each statement presented by Coinbase to disesteem the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a> the agency is taking against the exchange for unregistered brokerage and securities violations.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.26.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">response</a>, the SEC reaffirms its jurisdiction over securities cases, stating that this legal action against Coinbase is part of the &#8220;exercise of its longstanding authority to enforce statutory requirements&#8221; after having been authorized by Congress in 1934 to exert these through civil law enforcement actions. This interpretation contradicts Coinbase&#8217;s views, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-alleges-sec-lacks-any-powers-to-regulate-digital-asset-exchanges-in-recent-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declare</a> the SEC lacks &#8220;any powers to regulate digital asset exchanges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the institution explains that Coinbase now criticizes the validity of the Howey test after it used its criteria to make listing decisions before it became a public company.</p>

<h2>Howey Deconstructed and Major Questions Doctrine</h2>
<p>The SEC declares that Coinbase &#8220;attempts to construct its own test for what constitutes an investment contract&#8221; by making incorrect assumptions on what the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howey test</a>, a set of considerations that help to classify if transactions are investment contracts subject to securities laws, explains.</p>
<p>For the SEC, the two requirements Coinbase considers for assets to qualify as securities – that it must include a formal common law contract and that even if this contract exists, it does not apply to sales on secondary markets – are wrong.</p>
<p>The agency criticized the usage of the major questions doctrine, a principle that puts Congress regulatory action over administrative agencies, explaining that &#8220;since its inception, the SEC has exercised that authority to pursue violations of the securities laws—and it exercises the same statutory enforcement authority here.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the SEC failed to address the change of heart its chair Gary Gensler experienced since he acknowledged the agency &#8220;lacked statutory authority to regulate businesses like Coinbase&#8221; in a May 2021 congressional hearing until when he commented that he believed they had &#8220;enough authority&#8221; in 2022.</p>
<p>Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal, who had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-clo-paul-grewal-secs-interpretation-of-investment-contract-violates-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> the SEC&#8217;s interpretation of what constitutes an investment contract violated the law, <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1677426018028511232?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> this filing was &#8220;sadly &#8230; more of the same.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Scammer Poses as Polk County Deputy, Defrauds Iowa Resident of $6,600 in Bitcoin ATM Scheme</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The Clive Police Department has notified the public that an individual was defrauded of $6,600 after being persuaded to deposit the funds into a bitcoin ATM. The account was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ClivePoliceDepartment/posts/pfbid0egFuCCpw1AKXzrd8Y4Cb4wTMenCWRN1ACV1qj18v3QzzMaHcFBdJFiFCVbytjJGgl">shared </a>on Facebook, and the police stated that the person affected would not be identified for &#x201C;security reasons.&#x201D; As per the statement, the victim received a call from an individual who falsely identified themselves as a Polk County Sheriff&#x2019;s Deputy.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-596936 size-full" title="Iowa Resident Scammed of $6,600 in Bitcoin ATM Scheme, Police Launch Investigation" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/batm.jpg" alt="Iowa Resident Scammed of $6,600 in Bitcoin ATM Scheme, Police Launch Investigation" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/batm-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/batm-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/batm-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/batm-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/batm-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/batm-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/batm.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The impersonator informed the woman about an arrest warrant and persuaded her to &#x201C;send $6,600 through a Bitcoin ATM to resolve the matter.&#x201D; Following this portion of the story, the police did not provide any information regarding how the imposter acquired the funds from the machine. The presence of the imitator alongside the victim would likely be necessary to successfully execute such a theft using a cryptocurrency ATM; however, these types of specifics were omitted from the narrative.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
If the imposter was physically present to acquire the cryptocurrency assets, as that would be the sole feasible method to obtain them unless she transferred the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to the impersonator subsequent to utilizing the bitcoin ATM, then opting for cash would have provided a significantly higher level of anonymity compared to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The account is excessively ambiguous and replete with uncertainties, yet local media organizations from Iowa <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2023/07/08/clive-resident-loses-thousands-in-bitcoin-atm-scam-police-say/70394470007/">disseminated the story</a> subsequent to the police&#x2019;s declaration of the theft.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The scam highlights the growing concern of scammers exploiting the anonymity and difficulty in tracking cryptocurrency transactions,&#x201D; the Clive police explain. &#x201C;According to recent reports, scammers are utilizing fear tactics and impersonating law enforcement officials to deceive unsuspecting individuals into transferring funds through bitcoin ATMs.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Clive police, in conjunction with the Polk County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, have launched an inquiry into the theft. &#x201C;Law enforcement agencies emphasize that they would never contact individuals to demand payment over the phone or through bitcoin ATMs,&#x201D; stated the police officials. In the press release shared on Facebook, a commenter expressed their opinion in the comments section, stating, &#x201C;Make bitcoin ATMs illegal.&#x201D;&#13;<br />

The official further asserted that such a BRICS currency would erode the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance and result in increased wealth for Iranians holding gold. “A tremendous change is taking place in the international economy,” the official stressed.</strong></p>
<h2>Iran Will Benefit From Gold-Backed BRICS Currency, Official Says</h2>
<p>Rasoul Mousavi, Assistant Foreign Minister and Director General of the South Asia Department of the Iran&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated Sunday that a common BRICS currency backed by gold will benefit Iran and weaken the U.S. dollar, Press TV reported. The BRICS comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>The Iranian official’s remarks followed a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">report</a> last week by Russian news outlet RT claiming that Russia has confirmed the creation of a gold-backed common currency within the BRICS framework. According to RT, this announcement is expected to be officially made during the upcoming leaders summit of the economic bloc scheduled for August.</p>
<p>“A tremendous change is taking place in the international economy,” Mousavi was quoted as saying. The official elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The BRICS’ introduction of a gold-backed currency, which is supported by 41 countries with large and influential economies, will weaken the dollar and the euro and will benefit countries such as Iran, while Iranians in possession of gold will experience a wealth increase.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Mousavi believes that a common BRICS currency backed by gold would benefit Iran and erode the dominance of the U.S. dollar, the economic bloc has not officially announced any plans to create such a currency.</p>
<p>Last week, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, stated that the creation of BRICS currency as an alternative to the U.S. dollar is a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">medium to long-term aspiration</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is a prevailing belief that the establishment of a successful BRICS currency will diminish the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The BRICS economic bloc is also expanding its influence and is considering adding more members.</p>

<h2>Janet Yellen on BRICS Currency, Challenges to US Dollar Dominance</h2>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen addressed concerns regarding the dominance of the U.S. dollar and the potential challenges by a proposed BRICS currency during a press conference at the U.S. embassy in Beijing on Sunday. The press conference took place at the conclusion of her four-day visit to China.</p>
<p>While there has been no official announcement by the BRICS, speculation about a new BRICS currency has been rife after Russian news outlet RT <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">reported</a> that Russia has confirmed that the BRICS bloc will launch a new currency backed by gold.</p>
<p>Yellen was asked to comment on the plan by the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to create a new currency that many say would erode the dominance of the U.S. dollar. &#8220;I just want to reiterate what I&#8217;ve said in the past, which is I think the United States can rest assured that the dollar is going to play the dominant role in facilitating international transactions and serving as a reserve currency in the years ahead,&#8221; the treasury secretary replied, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t see that role being threatened by any development including the one that you&#8217;ve mentioned [BRICS common currency].</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve said previously and would reiterate that because of the role of the dollar and its ability to enable us to implement sanctions, there certainly is motivation in countries around the world to find an alternative,&#8221; Yellen continued. However, the treasury secretary emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>All the data of which I&#8217;m aware shows that the dollar is overwhelmingly, close to 90%, used in international transactions, and I don&#8217;t think that there is an alternative that could possibly displace that for the foreseeable future.</p></blockquote>
<p>While RT reported that Russia has confirmed that the BRICS will launch a common currency backed by gold, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, stated last week that &#8220;The development of anything alternative [to the U.S. dollar] is indeed a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">medium to long-term ambition</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June, Yellen defended the U.S. dollar, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-defends-dollar-dominance-as-emerging-markets-push-to-de-dollarize/">stating</a>: &#8220;There is a very good reason why the dollar is used widely in trade and that’s because we have deep, liquid, open capital markets, rule of law and long and deep financial instruments.&#8221; However, she acknowledged in April that over time, the use of financial sanctions “could undermine the hegemony of the dollar.”</p>

Moreover, the total network hashrate achieved a 24-hour all-time high on July 8, reaching 538 exahash per second (EH/s) at block height 797,733.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Record-Breaking Bitcoin Difficulty Increase Imminent, Total Hashrate Taps a 24-Hour Record at 538 EH/s</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Statistics recorded on July 9, 2023, indicate that the next Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment is scheduled for July 12, 2023. In the previous difficulty change, Bitcoin&#x2019;s mining difficulty experienced a 3.26% reduction, lowering the total to 50.65 trillion. Estimates suggest that the difficulty is expected to increase by <a href="https://archive.ph/33iHt">4.74%</a> to <a href="https://archive.ph/XNkDj">7.7%</a> due to block intervals being consistently shorter than the ten-minute average.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, the average block time on July 9 ranges from 8 minutes and 2 seconds to 9 minutes and 18 seconds per block. Additionally, the total hashrate on Sunday maintains a steady level at <a href="https://archive.ph/86mud#selection-1555.14-1555.25">440.72 EH/s</a> after reaching a 24-hour record high the previous day. On July 8, at block height 797,733, records indicate that the hashrate peaked at 538.05 EH/s. The increase in hashrate has accelerated the speed of block intervals, resulting in a higher probability of mining 2,016 blocks faster than the typical two weeks.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
An increase ranging from 4.74% to 7.7% will eliminate the decline <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-difficulty-takes-a-dip-networks-first-downward-adjustment-in-56-days-signals-easier-mining-ahead/">recorded</a> on June 28 and push the overall network difficulty to another record-setting high. On the lower end of the range, a 4.74% increase would raise the difficulty from the current 50.65 trillion to 53.04 trillion. As a result, it will become the most challenging period in history for miners to uncover <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blocks. Despite the difficulty reaching historically high levels, several factors have contributed to the rise in hashrate.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One factor is that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-leaves-major-assets-in-the-dust-surges-80-in-the-first-half-of-2023-soars-to-12th-largest-global-asset/">increased by 80%</a> against the U.S. dollar during the first half of 2023, making it more lucrative to mine <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Additionally, manufacturers have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microbt-unveils-new-whatsminer-bitcoin-mining-rig-with-320-th-s-setting-new-standard-for-hashpower/">introduced</a> next-generation application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining rigs that offer significantly higher hashrate and improved efficiency. Lastly, mining operations that survived the &#x2018;Crypto Winter&#x2019; of 2022 have significantly expanded their activities by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mawson-infrastructure-group-deploys-2600-bitcoin-miners-at-newly-secured-pennsylvania-site/">acquiring</a> new facilities and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-purchases-45000-bitcoin-mining-devices-adding-6-3-eh-s-to-current-fleet/">deploying thousands</a> of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> miners.&#13;<br />

Notably, K33 provides a comprehensive snapshot of the crypto landscape, highlighting that these 10,000 firms possess a collective valuation of $180 billion.</strong></p>
<h2>K33 Research Unveils Crypto Employment Trends in July 2023 Snapshot</h2>
<p>K33 Research released a <a href="https://k33.com/research/articles/the-global-crypto-industry">report</a> this week providing a “high-level overview of the crypto Industry” as of July 2023. The study was authored by K33 executives Anders Helseth, Torbjørn Bull Jenssen, Bendik Norheim Schei, and Vetle Lunde. According to the report, approximately 190,000 individuals are currently employed in the crypto industry, working for 10,000 firms with an estimated value of $180 billion.</p>
<p>According to K33 researchers, the number of individuals employed in the crypto industry has decreased compared to 2021, when there were approximately 211,000 crypto employees. Presently, about 30% of all crypto workers are based in the United States, while the United Kingdom accounts for one-third of crypto employment in Europe. K33’s study says in North America, the United States and Canada are the dominant forces, whereas “crypto employment in South America correlates with economy size.”</p>
<p>K33 study indicates around 35% of the worldwide cryptocurrency workforce is concentrated in Asia and Australia. The report highlights that in terms of the African continent and its diverse nations, “Nigeria is the crypto powerhouse of Africa.” Approximately 4% of the global crypto workforce originates from Africa, with South Africa following Nigeria&#8217;s lead. Furthermore, the study reveals that India surpasses China in crypto employment. Still, China follows India in terms of the leading countries in Asia despite China’s crypto ban.</p>
<p>K33&#8217;s report shows approximately one-third of the current crypto workforce is employed by brokerage services or crypto exchanges. The study further reveals that the majority of crypto jobs are in investment and trading roles. Among the total, 48,500 positions are in financial services, while the non-fungible token (NFT) and blockchain gaming sector accounts for an estimated 12,000 jobs. Approximately 40,000 jobs are centered around mining and blockchain intelligence positions, and an additional 24,800 employees have undefined roles.</p>

The European Central Bank has to do more to bring it down, its governor commented on the backdrop of stable consumer expectations about rising prices during the said period.</strong></p>
<h2>Euro Area Inflation Projected to Stay Above Medium-Term Target, Christine Lagarde Says</h2>
<p>Eurozone inflation is decreasing, having dropped from double-digit numbers in the early fall of 2022 to 5.5% for the whole area of the single currency in June, President of the European Central Bank (<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ECB</a>) Christine Lagarde said in an interview published by the bank this week.</p>
<p>Speaking to the French daily La Provence, Lagarde explained that the trend is mainly due to the fall in commodity and energy prices while suggesting that the ECB’s monetary policy decisions had also had an impact on prices.</p>
<p>However, when asked by the newspaper if “inflation is under control at last,” she pointed out that it is “still higher than our medium-term target of 2% and according to our staff projections, is set to remain so in 2024 and 2025,” emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>We therefore still have work to do to bring it back down and reach our target.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lagarde’s statements coincided with the release of the ECB’s latest Consumer Expectations Survey results. According to the study, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/inflation-expectations-of-eurozone-consumers-increased-significantly-ecb-says/">inflation expectations</a> for the next 12 months have decreased, while those for inflation in the next three years have remained stable.</p>
<p>“The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months decreased to 8.0% in May 2023, from 8.9% in April. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months also decreased to 3.9%, from 4.1% in April, while those for inflation three years ahead remained unchanged at 2.5%,” the bank detailed in a report.</p>
<p>At the same time, consumer expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months increased slightly, while expectations for nominal spending growth continued to decline, the European Central Bank highlighted.</p>
<p>In her interview, Lagarde noted that profit margins have not decreased during the recent period of high inflation and have even increased in some cases. She left it to the firms to decide whether to meet their employees’ expectations and restore some of their purchasing power but warned that a simultaneous increase in both profits and wages would fuel inflation and stressed that the monetary authority “would not stand idly by in the face of such risks.”</p>

<h2>Gold Maintains Resiliency in H1</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
At press time, the price of an ounce of .999 fine gold hovers just above the $1,900 range, specifically at <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/">$1,924 per unit</a>. Over the past 30 days, this precious metal has maintained a relatively stable position, while the first half (H1) statistics indicate a 5.4% increase against the U.S. dollar. Over the past five years, gold is up 53% against the greenback.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The World Gold Council (WGC) emphasizes in its latest 2023 <a href="https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-mid-year-outlook-2023-between-soft-and-hard-place">Mid-year Outlook report</a> that it anticipates &#x201C;gold to remain supported on the back of rangebound bond yields and a weaker dollar.&#x201D; The report further highlights that if economic conditions worsen, gold will experience heightened demand. &#x201C;Conversely, a soft landing or much tighter monetary policy could result in disinvestment,&#x201D; the report explains.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
&#x201C;If the recession risk increases, gold investment could see greater upside,&#x201D; the WGC report details. &#x201C;An economic deterioration could be driven by a significant increase in defaults following tighter credit conditions or other unintended consequences of the high-rate environment. Historically, such periods have resulted in higher volatility, significant stock market pullbacks, and an overall appetite for high quality, liquid assets such as gold.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
While bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) is not mentioned among the competitive assets, the WGC mid-year report specifies that gold emerged as one of the top-performing assets in 2023 when compared to U.S. cash, U.S. bonds, and the MSCI EM Index. In contrast, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> proved to be the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-leaves-major-assets-in-the-dust-surges-80-in-the-first-half-of-2023-soars-to-12th-largest-global-asset/">strongest performer</a> in the first half (H1), experiencing a significant increase of over 80% during the initial six months of 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The World Gold Council&#x2019;s analysis shows gold has a tendency to surpass equities in performance when the manufacturing purchasing managers&#x2019; index (PMI) is below 50 and declining. Additionally, historical data indicates that if the PMI drops below 45, gold&#x2019;s outperformance could be even more significant.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
WGC researchers and market strategists further say gold tends to be more influenced by bond yields rather than actual policy rates. This is because bond yields encompass market expectations regarding future policy decisions and the probability of an ensuing economic downturn.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting the global macroeconomic outcome, we believe that gold&#x2019;s positive asymmetrical performance can be a valuable component to investors&#x2019; asset allocation toolkit,&#x201D; the 2023 Mid-year Outlook report concludes.&#13;<br />

While certain individuals attribute this economic turmoil to the actions of central banks, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, firmly asserts that it is the retailers who are guilty of overpricing goods and services, consequently causing distress among countless families in the United Kingdom.</strong></p>
<h2>Bank of England Boss Andrew Bailey Pulls out the ‘Greedflation’ Accusation From the Bureaucratic Tool Box</h2>
<p>Although central banks have often been accused of bearing the brunt of responsibility for the economy&#8217;s volatile boom and bust cycles, their leaders refuse to shoulder the blame alone. European Central Bank (ECB) president Christine Lagarde, for instance, attributes Europe&#8217;s relentless inflation to the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecb-president-christine-lagarde-blames-climate-change-for-europes-torrid-inflation/">impact of climate change</a>. Meanwhile, in an interview with the BBC, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, contends that it is the retailers who are placing an undue burden on U.K. citizens.</p>
<p>In his interview, Bailey strongly emphasized that the burden of &#8220;overcharging customers&#8221; falls squarely on the shoulders of retailers, ultimately contributing to the unwelcome surge in inflationary pressures. “If you look at petrol prices, some sellers of petrol have possibly been charging too much for it,” Bailey <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/06/bank-of-england-governor-andrew-bailey-uk-retailers-overcharging-petrol-goods-fuel-prices-inflation">insisted</a>. When questioned about the potential timeline for a reduction in the benchmark bank rate, the governor of the Bank of England found it challenging to provide a definitive answer. Bailey stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can’t give you a date as to when interest rates start to come down because that really depends upon what happens over the period of time ahead, but getting inflation down is the most important thing that we have to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite Bailey&#8217;s assertions, U.K. retailers are dismissive of the argument he presents, and Martin Scicluna, the chair of Sainsbury&#8217;s, the country&#8217;s second-largest grocery store, vehemently refuted the accusation, deeming it false. “To be very, very clear, we are not profiteering and we are not rip-off retailers,” Scicluna firmly stated.</p>
<p>This sentiment is shared by Alex Baldock, the CEO of Currys, an electrical retailer, who emphasized that the company has effectively managed to keep “a lid on price rises.” Moreover, the notion of &#8220;greedflation,&#8221; often propagated by bureaucrats and central bankers in an attempt to deflect blame from their own failed economic policies, garners limited support among people worldwide.</p>
<p>Within the United States, Democratic leaders are convinced that the surge in inflation can be attributed to nothing but unbridled corporate greed. Last year, Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, put forth the &#8220;<a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/LYN222521.pdf">Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2022</a>&#8221; in response to this concern. However, this argument has faced extensive criticism.</p>
<p>Blogger Matthew Yglesias <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/greedflation-is-fake">astutely pointed</a> out the fallacy of &#8220;greedflation&#8221; last year, meticulously highlighting the plethora of inconsistencies and logical gaps within this theory when compared to actual facts, data, and rational thinking. Yglesias aptly remarked, “At the end of the day, though, only a very stupid person would think companies suddenly became greedy in 2021 after years of being non-greedy.”</p>
