										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of investors that filed a class-action lawsuit against <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/coinbase-customers-block-attempts-move-133216210.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">popular digital currency exchange</a> Coinbase are now withholding their account information as a means of preventing their case from moving into arbitration territory. They want to see their situation escalate to the American court system and placed before a judge.</p>
<h2>Could Coinbase Find Itself in Court?</h2>
<p>The customers allege that the security measures initiated by Coinbase against hackers and cyberthieves were weak and resulted in the loss of funds. In addition, they say Coinbase has worked hard not to compensate those who have fallen victim to criminal activity.</p>
<p>One plaintiff mentioned in the lawsuit says that he had $6,000 in crypto funds illegally taken from his wallet and moved to an address that wasn’t his. He also alleges that Coinbase did nothing to prevent the hackers from accessing his banking data, and that they stole another $1,000 from his bank account.</p>
<p>After calling the institution and reversing the transaction, he was able to receive his funds back, though Coinbase locked his account and cited a negative balance in his wallet. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. It alleges that Coinbase does not use “standard practices” to keep its customers protected, nor does it reasonably allow customers access to their accounts on a permanent or at least extended basis.</p>
<p>Coinbase, like many digital currency enterprises, has had a very hard time as of late due to the ongoing bearish conditions of the crypto space. The exchange initially announced that 2022 was going to be a year of hiring new personnel and adding to its growing roster of staff members, though this plan <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-freezing-all-2022-hiring-plans/" data-wpel-link="internal">became frozen in place when</a> bitcoin started losing value very quickly last year.</p>
<p>Things then took a turn for the worse when <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-laying-off-several-employees/" data-wpel-link="internal">the exchange said</a> it would be laying off about 18 percent of its staff, claiming it could not keep up with the ongoing volatility and thus could not afford to pay all the required salaries giving how tied it was to BTC, which was falling faster than anyone could have predicted.</p>
<p>Still, however, the company has garnered a certain degree of support from crypto heads such as Cathie Wood of <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-122536067.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">Ark Invest fame</a>. Not long ago, Wood decided to double down on her ownership of Coinbase stock and purchased several more shares given that they had dipped dramatically from where they were when the company first <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-spikes-following-public-debut-of-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">went public on the</a> Nasdaq in April of 2021.</p>
<h2>Wood Still Predicts Big Things for the Firm</h2>
<p>Explaining her decision, Wood wrote in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>To the extent investors have reserves of cash to put to work, ARK believes that this time will be no different and that innovation strategies will be prime beneficiaries when equity markets recover.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investors in the Gemini exchange in New York are suing <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/winklevoss-twins-and-cryptocurrency-exchange-gemini-lawsuit-fraud-investors-2022-12" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">the company and its founders</a> – Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – for fraud.</p>
<h2>Gemini Is Being Sued</h2>
<p>It is alleged in a class-action lawsuit that the company is in violation of the Exchange Act. A complaint was filed against Gemini and its creators in the US Southern District of New York, and it centers around the firm’s Earn Program, which offers as much as 7.4 percent interest to traders who take part in it. The program halted all offerings in the month of December in 2022, meaning all investors that still had money within its confines suddenly couldn’t get ahold of their funds.</p>
<p>The Earn Program was allegedly shut down due to the company’s ties to the now fallen FTX exchange, which <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed bankruptcy</a> in late November following <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">complaints of a liquidity crunch</a> on social media. FTX is believed to have lent more than $10 billion in customer digital funds to Alameda Research, another company founded by FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>The fall of FTX led to negative effects for Genesis Global, an institutional crypto firm and partner of Gemini. Two of the plaintiffs listed in the court filing – Max. J. Hastings and Brendan Picha – allege that Gemini did not register assets in the Earn Program as securities as they were required to do in accordance with present monetary laws in the U.S.</p>
<p>The complaint reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Genesis encountered financial distress [due to] a series of collapses in the crypto market in 2022, including FTX Trading Ltd. (‘FTX’), Genesis was unable to return the crypto assets it borrowed from Gemini Earn investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>To say that Gemini has been having a rough time would be something of an understatement. Like many crypto companies, the enterprise has fallen victim to many of the bearish conditions that are now being witnessed daily within the borders of the digital currency space. So much so, that Gemini was forced to lay <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/gemini-exchange-says-major-layoffs-are-coming/" data-wpel-link="internal">off approximately ten percent</a> of its staff back in the summer of 2022.</p>
<p>The company took flak when it came to light that the firm was letting go of many of its employees via Zoom calls rather than delivering the news to them in person.</p>
<h2>A Lot of Money Is Owed to the Firm</h2>
<p>In addition, Gemini is also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/winklevoss-twins-run-crypto-exchange-owed-900-million-by-genesis-2022-12?inline-endstory-related-recommendations=" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">allegedly owed close</a> to $1 billion by Genesis. The latter firm had approximately $2.8 billion in assorted loans, one of which stems from Genesis, though the company put out a message on Twitter last November that due to the frozen market and trouble with FTX, all redemptions on loans were being paused as of November 16, 2022.</p>
<p>At press time, it’s unclear when or even <em>if</em> the enterprise plans to begin its loan payment processes again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solana – a crypto that’s otherwise known as SOL to its personal holders – continues to shed <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cryptocurrency/embattled-cryptocurrency-solana-continues-to-crash" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">value given it’s so tied</a> to the fallen crypto exchange FTX and its disgraced head executive Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<h2>Solana Isn&#8217;t Doing Too Well</h2>
<p>FTX is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">currently in the process</a> of filing bankruptcy. Sam Bankman-Fried is accused of lending out approximately $10 billion in user funds to his other company Alameda Research, which was supposed to be a separate and independent entity from FTX. By conjoining them through loan activity, he broke several agreement terms and is now awaiting trial for fraud and other charges.</p>
<p>He is in <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/23/sam-bankman-fried-arrives-at-parents-home/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">California at his parents&#8217; home</a>. The pair have signed a $250 million bond pledging their home and other personal assets as collateral should SBF choose to flee the country. Two other close friends have also pledged their assets to the bond requirement.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – which is presently engaged in a civil suit against SBF and FTX – has stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire.</p></blockquote>
<p>Solana has deep ties to the fallen exchange and has since crashed by more than 96 percent since reaching an all-time high during the month of November 2021. During that time, it was trading for just shy of $260 per unit. At the time of the FTX bankruptcy, the currency had fallen to less than ten dollars.</p>
<p>Solana’s ties to FTX are so deep that it’s often dubbed “Sam Coin” in <em>honor</em> of Sam Bankman-Fried (not such a big honor anymore). The asset has links to an on-chain crypto exchange known as Serum, which was also created by Bankman-Fried. Solana is issued by the Solana blockchain, which presently engages in decentralized finance (defi) protocols and offers monetary products such as loans and mortgages.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Solana was considered one of the most promising digital assets on the market, though things have certainly taken a nasty turn with the recent collapse of FTX. Still, there are some that claim it has a lot of potential, one of those being Vitalik Buterin. As the co-creator of Ethereum, Buterin recently stated on social media:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future. Hard for me to tell from [the] outside, but I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Could His Words Lend a Hand?</h2>
<p>It’s unclear if this will help boost the currency’s prospects with traders.</p>
<p>Given Buterin’s present standing in the industry, it’s likely to do something, though things remain bearish at press time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin had a rough 2022, but that hasn’t stopped <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/bitcoin-is-still-well-below-20-000-so-why-haven-t-kevin-o-leary-edward-snowden-and-other-celebrity-investors-given-up-on-it/ar-AA15LVeK" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">high-ranking celebrities</a> and investors from praising it. They feel that while bitcoin may have had a rough 12 months, things can always return to form, and they’re not turning their backs on the world’s number one digital currency by market cap yet.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is Still the Apple of Many Celebrities&#8217; Eyes</h2>
<p>Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit in November of 2021. Just a year later, the currency was trading in the high $16,000 range. That’s a valuation dip of more than 70 percent. It’s a sad and ugly sight to see, yet there are still so many individuals out there that have hope that the currency is not dead yet.</p>
<p>One of those people is NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who now calls Russia home after fleeing the U.S. In a conference last June, he explained to the viewers about BTC:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s like a forest fire. When the ground has been cleared, things will grow again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another person who’s refusing to give up on bitcoin is “Shark Tank” star <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/kevin-oleary/" data-wpel-link="internal">Kevin O’Leary</a>. Always a bitcoin bull, O’Leary explained in an interview last summer that bitcoin has “so much intellectual property” and that it’s a “genius idea.” He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you go to any graduating cohort, go engineering, a third of them would want to work in the chain. They don’t want to work in the 11 sectors of the economy. They want something new.</p></blockquote>
<p>Patrick Thompson – host of the blockchain and digital asset podcast “More Than Money” – says while many celebrities continue to support bitcoin, the asset has no doubt experienced heavy value loss over the past several months. There are many reasons for this in his mind, a big one being that there’s heavy talk of a recession.</p>
<p>With so much economic uncertainty in the air, it’s likely many people are getting rid of risky assets and trying to swoop up as much cash as possible. Thompson believes bitcoin was the asset that likely sparked the ongoing selloffs of many risky assets. Discussing crypto, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s an industry built on an extremely unstable foundation. Many of the biggest companies in the cryptocurrency space had extremely high-risk business models and were over-leveraged… Why would someone want to hold an asset that will most likely decrease in value in the short term? Sometimes, you need to cut off your finger to save your hand, to sell assets now so that your total losses aren’t as detrimental as they could possibly be.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Speculation Isn&#8217;t the Main Problem</h2>
<p>Merav Ozair – a blockchain expert at Rutgers Business School – says speculation isn’t entirely to blame for this crypto winter. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, the crypto market is very much correlated and in tune with everything that is happening in the economy and with other asset classes.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The top spy agency of South Korea stated its <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/south-korea-s-top-spy-agency-says-north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-12-billion-in-cryptocurrency-and-other-virtual-assets/ar-AA15CohS" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">neighbor North Korea has</a> stolen an estimated $1.5 trillion won worth of cryptocurrency funds over the past five years. This is equivalent to about $1.2 billion in USD. More than half of that money was stolen in the year 2022 alone.</p>
<h2>North Korea Is Still Stealing Crypto</h2>
<p>North Korea <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/north-korea/" data-wpel-link="internal">has long been in the</a> habit of stealing digital currency and engaging in crypto hacks and related activities to garner the funds it needs to continue building its nuclear arsenal. The country also experienced a weakening economy during the days of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coronavirus/" data-wpel-link="internal">the COVID pandemic</a> and has also suffered at the hands of the U.S., which has regularly imposed sanctions against the nation. Thus, the country has long been in desperate need of fast cash, and it’s often turned to crypto to make this happen.</p>
<p>But this crypto is usually stolen from other regions of the world including the United States, several parts of Europe, and of course, South Korea. The National Intelligence Service – the main spy agency of the latter region – has said that North Korea’s ability to steal digital currencies has grown exponentially over the years, and they predict the methods it uses are among the best in the world.</p>
<p>Sanctions against North Korea were toughened in the year 2017 by the United Nations given its ongoing nuclear missile tests and its regular focus on cybercrime. Exports from North Korea – such as coal, textiles, and seafood – have all been very limited over the past five or six years, causing the nation to pass several of its foreign workers onto other regions. Even further restrictions came about during the days of the pandemic, and by then, North Korea was allegedly suffering like it never had before.</p>
<p>South Korea is now saying that its neighbor to the north is not done stealing digital assets. In fact, it’s likely only getting started. South Korea fully expects its northern counterpart to conduct additional illegal cyber hacks in the year 2023, and that more crypto is likely to make its way into the hands of Kim Jong-un and his fellow regulators.</p>
<h2>Trying to Keep Itself Alive</h2>
<p>In addition, South Korea says that the northern region will also attempt to make off with specific technology information and confidential data regarding South Korean foreign policy and national security.</p>
<p>In December of last year, several representatives of nations like the U.S., South Korea, and Japan all unanimously agreed to increase their efforts to fight off or at least limit the illegal dealings of North Korea. Just last February, a panel of U.N. representatives claimed that the nation of North Korea was continuing to engage in cyberattacks on various crypto firms and exchanges, and that missile tests go on despite the nation’s ailing economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2022 was a bad year for crypto. Bitcoin and many leading forms of digital currency have crashed, but that doesn’t <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/topstories/alberta-cryptocurrency-companies-still-say-they-re-optimistic-despite-industry-struggles/ar-AA15MEY8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mean all the crypto companies</a> out there are turning their backs on their respective industries. Several companies in Calgary, Canada – like Bitvo Inc. – still believe crypto has a fighting chance, and they’re refusing to give up on this growing financial arena.</p>
<h2>Calgary Has Tried Hard to Incorporate Crypto</h2>
<p>Bitvo is a unique firm <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">in that FTX</a> – the now failed crypto exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried – was all set to acquire the Calgary-based trading platform in June. Given that FTX has completely crashed and burned, Bitvo has said the entire deal will not go through, now. It has also said it had no direct links to FTX, nor is it part of the company’s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>Pamela Draper – president and CEO of Bitvo – said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s no impact on Bitvo&#8217;s operations, or the security of our customers&#8217; funds, as a result of the FTX failure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Calgary – which is situated in Alberta, Canada – has long tried to position itself as an industry leader. This is ultimately why the government of the region was so willing to work with FTX at one point. Sam Bankman-Fried and many other employees and staff members of the fallen exchange spent time talking to the regulators of Calgary to see how they could build up the exchange’s presence in the area.</p>
<p>In an interview not too long ago, Bankman-Fried said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve had some fantastic conversations with the government of Alberta, which has been really constructive, and [we’re] trying to take the lead in Canada and around the world for crypto policy and frameworks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fall of FTX has certainly led to some ripple effects, and several companies in Canada have felt the heat. Hut 8 – one of the oldest and largest miners in the country – has been hit by the effects of FTX, though it doesn’t feel that the latest bear market is anything to greatly worry about.</p>
<p>Sue Ellis – head of investor relations at Hut 8 – mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is not our first bear market. In the last bull market of 2021, we were one of the only guys who were actually setting ourselves up and setting up our balance sheet so that we could weather any sort of storm.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Some Important Factors Are Being Ignored</h2>
<p>Koleya Karringten – executive director of the Canadian Blockchain Consortium – says that while much of the news surrounding crypto has been negative as of late, there are some hardcore developments that have happened that the media is choosing to ignore. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The industry is] developing technology that&#8217;s capable of being exported internationally and supporting everything from remittance payments to better transparency and a more secure supply chain for everything from pharmaceuticals to our energy industry to agriculture.</p></blockquote>

<li>Bitcoin cash started a decent increase above the $108 and $112 resistance levels against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above the $115 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $118 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair must clear $125 and $130 to continue higher in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is climbing above $115 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-rally-could-extend-above-22k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $130 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price formed a decent support base above the $110 level. BCH started a recovery wave and was able to clear the $112 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the $120 and $125 resistance levels. The pair is now trading above the $115 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-rally-could-extend-above-125/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. The recent surge was such that the price even traded above the $125 level. A high is formed near $132 before there was a minor decline.</p>
<p>There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $106 swing low to $132 high. It is now trading above the $115 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $125 level. The next major resistance is near the $132 level, above which the price may perhaps rise towards the $150 level. Any more gains above $150 could set the pace for a move towards the $165 level in the coming days.</p>
<p>An immediate support on the downside is near the $118 level. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $118 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair.</p>
<p>The first major support sits near the $115 level. It is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $106 swing low to $132 high. The next major support is near $105, below which the bears might aim $100. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $92 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kabosu – the cute little Shiba Inu dog that inspired the memes of such famous digital currencies as Dogecoin – has been <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/the-internet-famous-shiba-inu-who-inspired-doge-memes-and-a-joke-cryptocurrency-is-seriously-ill-with-cancer/ar-AA15JVI2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">diagnosed with liver disease</a> and leukemia according to her owner Atsuko Sato.</p>
<h2>Kabosu Is Very Ill</h2>
<p>The news is indeed sad for both animal lovers and crypto fans alike. Kabosu will likely never know how many people she has inspired with her cute little face, nor will she ever realize that her complexion and furry countenance arguably gave birth to one of the biggest bitcoin rivals to ever exist in Dogecoin.</p>
<p>Her owner made the following announcement on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now, the liver is very bad, and jaundice appears, but antibiotics will definitely improve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Originally a rescue pup, Kabosu voluntarily stopped eating and drinking on or around Christmas time in 2022. However, it has since been reported that she can drink water and that her appetite has come back somewhat, thus suggesting that while her condition is dangerous, hope is not completely lost yet.</p>
<p>Kabosu has already surpassed the life expectancy of her species given that she celebrated her 17th birthday in October of last year. Right now, Shiba Inu dogs are only expected to live between 12 and 15 years, so even if this is the end, one can attest to the fact that Kabosu is indeed a fighter and will go down in crypto history as a true pioneer and powerhouse of the space.</p>
<p>Her image has become synonymous with Dogecoin over the years, a currency that was initially created by computer genius Jackson Palmer. The currency was established as a way of making fun of the crypto space and its users. It was a meme coin, but it wound up becoming a major staple of the industry and has even garnered the attention of hardcore tech and crypto fans such as Elon Musk, who in all fairness, has often been kinder to Doge in the past than he has to bitcoin.</p>
<p>Musk has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-affirms-his-position-on-doge-its-the-peoples-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">referred to Dogecoin</a> as the “people’s crypto.” He has since allowed it to be used for merchandise purchases with many of his companies including <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-permits-tesla-customers-to-use-dogecoin-for-certain-merchandise/" data-wpel-link="internal">Tesla</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-permits-doge-payments-for-spacex-merchandise/" data-wpel-link="internal">SpaceX</a>.</p>
<p>Kabosu first became an <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/shiba-inu-behind-doge-meme-diagnosed-with-leukemia-and-liver-disease-owner-says/ar-AA15JmBp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">internet sensation in 2010</a>. Her owner Sato posted her photo online and she became a quick hit on Reddit, with one user posting the word “Doge” under her photo, thus birthing the Dogecoin name.</p>
<h2>Let Us All Hope for Her Safety and Potential Recovery</h2>
<p>Three years later, the currency would emerge with her image as its major logo. This startled Sato at first, and she stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I first found out about the Kabosu memes, I was very surprised. I was terrified at the thought that just one photo I had casually posted on my blog could spread all over the world to places I didn’t know.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let us all join in praying for Kabosu’s safety.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Argo Blockchain – one of the largest and most powerful digital currency mining enterprises in the world – has announced a new plan <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/bitcoin-miner-argo-to-avoid-bankruptcy-with-24100m-deal-from-galaxy-digital/ar-AA15Kx1P" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">that will allow it to avoid</a> bankruptcy and become another company that falls victim to the ongoing bear conditions of the crypto arena.</p>
<h2>Argo Blockchain Won&#8217;t Have to File Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Argo has agreed to sell its bitcoin mining facility (called Helios) for $65 million to Galaxy Digital, the hedge fund managed by Mike Novogratz, a billionaire investor and big-time fan of bitcoin and other forms of crypto. The wealth management firm will also provide Argo with a $35 million loan to help it restructure its operations. The loan was secured through a collateral package that came in the form of Argo mining equipment.</p>
<p>In a statement, Galaxy Digital explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>The transaction will accelerate the expansion of Galaxy’s bitcoin mining operations and services, provide access to tax-efficient mining infrastructure, and reduce reliance on third-party hosting providers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The crypto space has been extremely bearish over the past 12 months. So much so, that several digital currency companies and mining facilities have entered bankruptcy proceedings as they are unable to keep up with the rising energy prices of Joe Biden’s America. They also cannot contend with the ongoing price dips being experienced by bitcoin and other mainstream forms of digital currency.</p>
<p>Some of the big names that come to mind when discussing crypto bankruptcies include the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-network-is-next-crypto-company-to-file-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Celsius Network</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-lender-voyager-digital-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Voyager Digital</a>, and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-is-now-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">Three Arrows Capital</a>, the latter being a crypto hedge fund. However, it is Celsius that arguably got things going in this direction. It is also one of the largest crypto companies out there and likely received the most attention when it decided to enter court proceedings as a means of shielding itself from angry customers and lenders.</p>
<p>However, it can be argued that the bankruptcies of these companies are nothing compared with the one that is currently underway for FTX, one of the largest digital currency exchanges in the history of the space. FTX first came to fruition in 2019 and rose through the ranks very quickly. It became a top-five crypto exchange by 2021 and it seemed like everything was really going well for the company, though things came crashing down in November of 2022.</p>
<h2>FTX Is the Biggest Bankruptcy Story</h2>
<p>During that month, the company’s chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">announced FTX was enduring</a> a liquidity crunch and needed fast cash. Initially, it looked like the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">larger crypto firm Binance</a> was going to buy FTX out, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">though things didn’t quite</a> turn out that way, and it wasn’t long before FTX became <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">another bankrupt firm</a> and SBF was resigning from his post.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Argo has debts exceeding $41 million. Peter Wall – CEO of the firm – says he hopes this new deal will allow it to remain functional during the bear market.</p>
