					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu remains one of the most popular meme coins but the performance of the cryptocurrency in the last year has been discouraging for holders. Despite remaining the second-largest meme coin, it has continued to decline in price and this has caused the asset to fall below very crucial support. And now that SHIB is now sitting at the $0.000008 level, is it a good time to buy the meme coin? Shiba Inu Falls Below Critical Level For Shiba Inu, the $0.000009 price level has served as good support for it through the ups and downs of the crypto market over the last year. This made it the most important point for bears to beat if they were to take control of the digital asset. However, over the last week, SHIB has fallen below $0.000009 which could present a good buying opportunity for the digital asset. Related Reading: Decentraland (MANA) Leads Crypto Market Gains, Here’s Why One reason why buying SHIB could be a good play right now is that the developments by the team are yet to reflect in the performance of the coin. Also, with the launch of the four new hubs in Shib: The Metaverse coming soon, the meme coin could see renewed interest and this interest could lead to a price rally. SHIB price falls below $0.000009 support &#124; Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView.com The market has also been consolidating for a while with the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum trading sideways for the last week. Once this consolidation ends, the likelihood of these large assets rallying upward remains high. And as always, a rally in these top cryptocurrencies would pull the rest of the market up with it. If Bitcoin were to move above $30,000 again, SHIB could go as high as $0.00001 once more, which would mean a more than 10% gain for investors in the short run. Over the long term, the gains could be higher, assuming that the market has not completely exited its bull trend. SHIB Could Be A Breakout Star The Shiba Inu team continues to rapidly develop the ecosystem and the latest in its long line of products is its SHIB-themed cold wallets. These wallets have been in the works for a while and the official SHIB handle confirmed on Twitter that the wallets will be ready for preorder on May 29. The wallets are being developed in partnership with Swiss company Tangem to allow users to hold more than 6,000 coins. #SHIBARMY! @Tangem is about to unleash SHIB-themed cold wallets! 🎉 These card-shaped vaults are set to become your new best friend for safeguarding our ecosystem&#39;s tokens.

Additionally, SHIB’s price is sitting at almost 90% of its all-time high price, which, historically, has been a good level to purchase cryptocurrencies at. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims $27,000, Here Are The Factors Driving The Recovery Nevertheless, SHIB still leaves a lot to be desired since its volume has declined to $92 million, indicating a drop in activity in the meme coin.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum gas consumption landscape is transforming significantly as Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplaces no longer dominate the network&#8217;s gas usage. According to a report by Nansen, a crypto analytics platform, NFTs have fallen behind in doing the most in Ethereum gas fees.  Notably, while Ethereum&#8217;s transition to proof-of-stake, in an event known as &#8220;The Merge,&#8221; is anticipated to address high gas prices, investors are now exploring alternatives like Cardano, which boasts greater cost-efficiency following its recent Hydra upgrade. Ethereum&#8217;s Gas Consumption Shift According to data revealed by Nansen on Friday, there&#8217;s currently a noteworthy shift in Ethereum&#8217;s gas consumption patterns. NFT marketplaces, which once held the top spot, now account for a mere 3% of total gas usage. Related Reading: Crypto Assets Flow From Ethereum To BSC, Are Users Escaping High Gas Fees? Surprisingly, decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap has emerged as the primary gas consumer, representing 31.99% of gas consumption. This shift indicates a diversification in Ethereum&#8217;s transactional activity and a reduction in NFT-related gas usage. Nansen noted: Gone were the days of NFTs topping the Ethereum gas-consuming charts. This week, of the top 20 gas consumers, OpenSea and Blur accounted for less than 10% combined. And against all gas consumers, the NFT marketplaces were just over 3%. Uniswap in contrast was 10x more &#8211; 31.99%. This substantial decline in NFT-related gas consumption can be attributed to various factors, including the network&#8217;s congestion caused by an influx of meme coin trading, notably the recently hyped frog-themed meme coin PEPE. This surge in meme coin transactions resulted in heightened gas prices, prompting users to explore alternatives and alleviating the burden on NFT marketplaces. Navigating the Gas Crisis Ethereum&#8216;s gas crisis has persisted despite The Merge, which is said to enhance scalability and reduce gas fees by migrating the network to a proof-of-stake consensus model. In response, some investors have sought solace in blockchain platforms offering cost-efficient alternatives. With its recent Hydra upgrade, Cardano has gained attention for its ability to handle transactions more economically. The implementation of Hydra&#8217;s layer-2 scaling solution has positioned Cardano as a viable option for users seeking relief from Ethereum&#8217;s high gas prices. The recent decrease in NFT marketplaces&#8217; gas consumption marks a significant turning point in Ethereum&#8217;s gas crisis. As decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and other transaction-heavy platforms take the lead in gas consumption, the burden on NFT marketplaces has lessened. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Confluence Of Bearish Factors and At Risk of Another Decline However, the broader Ethereum community anticipates the implementation of updates on the mainnet to address the persistent gas issues and improve scalability on the network.  Meanwhile, Ethereum&#8217;s price has experienced an upward trend in the past week, up by 2.4%. ETH has surged from a low of $1,771 seen last Friday to trading as high as above $1,800 later this week.  Ethereum market capitalization has also recorded huge gains in the past 7 days. ETH&#8217;s market cap has surged over 2% from a cap low of $215 billion to a high of $218 billion on Friday. Meanwhile, ETH’s daily trading volume has plunged throughout the week from a high of $10 billion last Friday to $5.5 billion in the last 24 hours. Interestingly, the asset has picked up from where it left off, rallying 1.1% in the last 24 hours. ETH currently trades slightly above $1,800 with a price of $1,811 at the time of writing.

					<description><![CDATA[The Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) industry has been a hub of innovation and growth over the past year, but as it approaches the midway point of 2023, the market is showing signs of maturation and change. According to a recent report by DappRadar, NFT sales could fall below $1 billion for the first time this year. Related Reading: XRP Ledger On Fire: Daily Transactions Skyrocket 10.7% In Q1 2023 NFT Market Facing Headwinds According to the report, the NFT market shows signs of a potential shift in May 2023, with the trading volume reaching $333 million from $2.3 million in sales, a trend that may result in the first month of this year with a trading volume under $1 billion. Despite this decline in sales, the NFT industry is still showing strong activity and engagement, with daily unique active wallets (dUAW) linked to NFT activities reaching 173,000, marking a 27% increase from the previous month. However, the NFT market is facing significant challenges, with many traders selling their large NFT holdings at a loss to participate in the Memecoin frenzy, according to DappRadar. This has led to an uptick in on-chain activity, driving Ethereum’s gas fees above $100 and negatively impacting the volume of low-value NFT trades on the blockchain. Despite this, the NFT market is still experiencing significant developments and events. Elon Musk’s tweet on May 10, 2023, referencing the Milady Maker collection, fueled a trading volume spike, reaching $13.95 million and doubling the number of trades in the same week.  Additionally, the Pudgy Penguins project secured $9 million in seed funding, debuting the Pudgy Toys collection, which amassed a total trading volume of $7.89 million the following week. Furthermore, the top ten NFT sales reveal stalwarts like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks dominating the NFT landscape. However, a new entrant has emerged in the sixth position &#8211; an ADA handle, a personal crypto domain on the ADA blockchain, sold for $182,089, equivalent to 500,000 ADA.  Bitcoin Ordinals vs. NFTs Bitcoin Ordinals, a new form of digital asset, has become a hot topic in the decentralized app (dapp) community since its launch by software engineer Casey Rodarmor on January 21. This protocol has garnered a significant following, with over 7.4 million Ordinals minted at the time of writing. Ordinals differ from NFTs as they house all their data directly on-chain, earning the label “digital artifacts”. This feature makes Ordinals a potential technical upgrade to NFTs and a shift in Bitcoin&#8217;s cultural landscape. However, the rise of Ordinals and the BRC-20 token standard, which enables the deployment of meme coins on the Bitcoin blockchain, has provoked concern among Bitcoin maxis. These innovations have strained the Bitcoin network, leading to a backlog of unconfirmed transactions and increased fees. The spike in transaction demand caused fees to soar to $31 on May 8, 2023, according to DappRadar’s report.  Despite the challenges, the increased activity has boosted miner fees, enhancing the overall security of the Bitcoin blockchain. The surge in fees indicates a growing number of people using Bitcoin for non-financial purposes, such as creating and trading Ordinals and speculation on tokens. The Ordinals Protocol has given rise to intriguing collections and impressive sales, with Ordinal Punks and TwelveFold as notable examples. These collections have seen trading volumes, in the past 30 days, of 11.85 BTC and 14.9 BTC, respectively, indicating significant interest and engagement in the new digital asset.

However, it also highlights the need for continued innovation and upgrades to address the challenges posed by increased activity and demand on the Bitcoin network.  Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>Despite the challenges, the increased activity has boosted miner fees, enhancing the overall security of the Bitcoin blockchain. The surge in fees indicates a growing number of people using Bitcoin for non-financial purposes, such as creating and trading Ordinals and speculation on tokens.</p>
<p>The Ordinals Protocol has given rise to intriguing collections and impressive sales, with Ordinal Punks and TwelveFold as notable examples. These collections have seen trading volumes, in the past 30 days, of 11.85 BTC and 14.9 BTC, respectively, indicating significant interest and engagement in the new digital asset.</p>

<p>The introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals represents an exciting development in the NFT space, opening up new possibilities for digital asset creation and trading. However, it also highlights the need for continued innovation and upgrades to address the challenges posed by increased activity and demand on the Bitcoin network. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[According to the latest report by the research firm, Messari, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) saw a significant surge in activity during the first quarter of 2023. The daily active addresses and daily transactions increased by 13.9% and 10.7% QoQ, respectively. XRP&#8217;s price also showed an impressive increase of 56% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), from $0.35 to $0.54. This price increase outpaced the total crypto market cap in the same period, largely due to positive news regarding the ongoing case between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Juicy Capital Inflows – An Imminent Rebound in Sight?  XRP Ledger Network Activity Soars The XRP Ledger is a blockchain network operational for over a decade. It is known for its fast and energy-efficient cross-border payment capabilities, among other features. It offers a variety of native capabilities, including Issued Currencies, a decentralized exchange, escrow functionality, and token management. These features allow the XRPL to execute many of the same functions as other networks, even though it does not support smart contracts. The chart above shows that the XRPL has seen a significant increase in overall network activity metrics in Q1. Daily active addresses and transactions increased by 13.9% and 10.7%, respectively. The increase in total active addresses was largely due to receiving addresses growing by 17.1% from 47,000 to 55,000. However, sending addresses decreased by 7.2% QoQ, further separating the metric from receiving addresses. Despite 141,000 accounts being deleted in Q1, the total addresses increased. This is because, unlike many other blockchain networks, the XRPL allows accounts to be deleted to reclaim the deposit of XRP escrowed during account creation. This escrow incentivizes to delete of accounts, and the total address metric has more significance. According to the report, the XRPL applies deflationary pressure to the total supply of 100 billion XRP through transaction fee burning. However, only around 10 million XRP have been burned since the XRPL&#8217;s inception. To counteract this burn rate, 1 billion XRP vests to Ripple per month. Any XRP not spent or distributed by Ripple in that month is returned to escrow. This system will continue until the remaining 48 billion XRP become liquid. Unlike many other cryptocurrency networks, the XRPL does not distribute rewards or transaction fees to validators. Instead, validators are incentivized by supporting the decentralization of the network. This is similar to a full node for Ethereum/Bitcoin rather than a validator/miner.  NFT Market Adapts To XLS-20 Standard The XRPL standardized NFTs on its network with the XLS-20 standard, enabled in October 2022. Five new transaction types were created to track all NFT activity on the network accurately. However, NFT mints declined 40.4% QoQ, from 732,000 in Q4 to 436,000 in Q1, while NFT offers accepted declined 25.1% QoQ, from 370,000 in Q4 to 277,000 in Q1. Furthermore, in NFT sales volume, XPUNKS remained the all-time leader with 15.7 million XRP ($8.5 million as of Q1). However, Core Apes Club and RipplePunks rivaled XPUNKS in sales volume in Q1, with each collection doing 400,000-500,000 XRP in quarterly volume. RipplePunks averaged 141,000 XRP ($76,000) in monthly sales volume and 960 monthly sales in Q1. Related Reading: Lido’s ETH Deposits Reach Record High Amid Stagnant stETH Withdrawals Overall, the XRPL&#8217;s deflationary mechanism of burned transaction fees and focus on decentralization and trust between nodes through unique node lists are key factors in its success.

					<description><![CDATA[Lido (LDO), the leading liquid staking derivatives (LSD) protocol, recently made waves in the crypto community by enabling staked ETH (stETH) withdrawals. Expectations were high as many anticipated a surge in stakers unstaking their ETH. However, contrary to these predictions, Lido has witnessed a remarkable increase in ETH deposits, reaching a record-breaking level. This surge has also been reflected in the protocol&#8217;s native token which has recorded a rally of more than 20% in the past week. Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Surges 16% In Single Day, Maintains Dominance In Liquid Staking Market ETH Deposits Soar to New All-Time High Despite the introduction of stETH withdrawals, Lido experienced a surge in ETH deposits, defying expectations of widespread unstaking. On Friday, the platform witnessed a significant milestone as the total number of ETH deposited hit an all-time high. According to data provided by Lido, an astounding 6,373,289 ETH is currently staked with Lido, equivalent to more than $11.5 billion. Interestingly, while ETH deposits on Lido continue to soar, stETH withdrawals have remained stagnant around the 450,000 ETH mark, as reported by data from Nansen. It is worth noting that these withdrawal requests have yet to be processed, contributing to the overall stability of stETH withdrawals. This trend raises questions about the anticipated unstaking frenzy, prompting a closer examination of the factors influencing stakers&#8217; decisions. As the most significant liquid staking derivatives protocol, Lido holds an impressive 75% market share, surpassing its competitors in the Liquid staking (LSD) space. Notably, according to data from Nansen, Coinbase and Rocket Pool trail behind, occupying the second and third positions. Furthermore, while it may sound like positive news that ETH deposit is surging while withdrawal flattens, it is worth noting there are several reasons behind this so as not to get carried away. On the one side, the stabilized withdrawal can be attributed to the pending processing of withdrawal requests. On the other side, it can be attributed to stakers&#8217; long-term commitment to the protocol and the attractiveness of Lido&#8217;s offerings amidst the volatile crypto landscape. Lido Surges 20% In The Past Week Along with its surge in market share, Lido native token LDO&#8217;s price has experienced an upward trend in the past week up by more than 20%. Lido has surged from a low of $1.81 seen last Friday to trading as high as $2.48 on Wednesday. Related Reading: Lido DAO (LDO) Surges Nearly 20% In The Past 7 Days, Here’s Why LDO market capitalization has also recorded huge gains in the past 7 days. LDO&#8217;s market cap has surged 20.7% from a cap low of $1.5 billion to a high of over $2 billion on Wednesday. Meanwhile, LDO&#8217;s daily trading volume has only continued to range between $60 million and $100 million throughout the week. Interestingly, the asset has plunged over the past 24 hours down by 4.4%. LDO currently trades slightly above $2 with a price of $2.18 at the time of writing with a 24-hour trading volume of $62.1 million.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin has now dipped below the $27,000 level as on-chain data shows the miners have possibly been selling the asset recently. Bitcoin Miner Reserve Has Taken A Sharp Plummet Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, miners have taken out about 1,750 BTC from their wallets during the past day. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;miner outflow,&#8221; which measures the total amount of Bitcoin that miners are transferring out of their wallets currently. The counterpart metric of the outflow is called the &#8220;inflow,&#8221; and it naturally tracks the total number of coins going into the addresses of these blockchain validators. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner outflow, as well as the inflow, over the last few weeks: Looks like the value of the outflow has been pretty high in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant Whenever the miner inflow has a high value, it means that this cohort is depositing a large amount of Bitcoin into their wallets. Such a trend, when prolonged, can be a sign that the miners are accumulating right now. Naturally, this can have bullish implications for the price. When the outflow is high, on the other hand, it suggests that a large amount of the asset is exiting from the supply of the miners. Generally, the main reason why these holders transfer their coins out of their wallets is for selling-related purposes, so this kind of trend can be bearish for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value. In the above graph, it&#8217;s visible that the miner inflow has been at relatively low values during the past day, implying that these investors aren&#8217;t depositing any significant amounts to their wallets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Stays Low, Here’s What This Means The miner outflow, however, has registered a pretty high spike in the same period. In total, around 1,750 BTC ($47 million) has exited the supply of the miners with this surge in the indicator. Since there haven&#8217;t been any inflows to counteract these outflows, a net amount of the asset has now left the miners&#8217; wallets. This would mean that if the outflows were made for selling purposes, a net bearish effect should appear on the price. An indicator that helps better identify whether these transfers were for selling or not is the &#8220;miner to exchange flow,&#8221; which tracks only the miner outflows heading towards centralized exchanges. Usually, this cohort uses the exchanges when they want to take part in distribution. As shown in the above chart, however, the metric has remained low recently, meaning that these outflows haven&#8217;t directly entered into the wallets of these platforms. Though, the quant has discovered that the destination wallet of the 1,750 miner outflow made another transfer, which was indeed towards an exchange. &#8220;There is a high probability that 1,750 BTC ultimately went to Binance,&#8221; explains the analyst. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Support Line Is Still Active, Bullish Signal? When these outflows took place yesterday, Bitcoin was above the $27,000 level. Following them, however, the asset has observed a plunge and is now below this mark, suggesting that this latest selling pressure from the miners may have been behind the decline. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,800, up 2% in the last week.

Generally, the main reason why these holders transfer their coins out of their wallets is for selling-related purposes, so this kind of trend can be bearish for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>In the above graph, it&#8217;s visible that the miner inflow has been at relatively low values during the past day, implying that these investors aren&#8217;t depositing any significant amounts to their wallets.</p>

<p>The miner outflow, however, has registered a pretty high spike in the same period. In total, around 1,750 BTC ($47 million) has exited the supply of the miners with this surge in the indicator.</p>
<p>Since there haven&#8217;t been any inflows to counteract these outflows, a net amount of the asset has now left the miners&#8217; wallets. This would mean that if the outflows were made for selling purposes, a net bearish effect should appear on the price.</p>
<p>An indicator that helps better identify whether these transfers were for selling or not is the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-miners-transfer-exchanges-sign-of-selling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">miner to exchange flow</a>,&#8221; which tracks only the miner outflows heading towards centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>Usually, this cohort uses the exchanges when they want to take part in distribution. As shown in the above chart, however, the metric has remained low recently, meaning that these outflows haven&#8217;t directly entered into the wallets of these platforms.</p>
<p>Though, the quant has discovered that the destination wallet of the 1,750 miner outflow made another transfer, which was indeed towards an exchange. &#8220;There is a high probability that 1,750 BTC ultimately went to Binance,&#8221; explains the analyst.</p>

<p>When these outflows took place yesterday, Bitcoin was above the $27,000 level. Following them, however, the asset has observed a plunge and is now below this mark, suggesting that this latest selling pressure from the miners may have been behind the decline.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,800, up 2% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently caught the attention of investors as its chart reflects a significant surge in capital inflows and buying pressure. These developments have left many speculators wondering if this positive momentum will be sufficient to initiate a much-anticipated price rebound.  With increased interest and activity surrounding Shiba Inu, all eyes are now focused on whether this surge in support will ultimately lead to a revitalization of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s fortunes. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Resurfaces After 2-Year Hiatus, Stakes $7.4 Million In ETH Shiba Inu Price Consolidation And Increased Capital Inflows Shiba Inu, over the past few days, has witnessed relatively low volatility on higher timeframe price charts. From May 8 onwards, its price has oscillated within a range of $0.00000832 and $0.00000914, indicating a period of consolidation. At the time of writing, CoinGecko reflects Shiba Inu&#8217;s price at a mere $0.00000871. In the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency experienced a slight slump of 1.4%. The meme coin was up a very modest 0.3% over the course of the last seven days. Source: Coingecko Despite the recent price consolidation, the daily chart&#8217;s CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) and RSI (Relative Strength Index) have shown notable upward movements in the past few days. The CMF suggests increased capital inflows, while the RSI indicates rising buying pressure. SHIB Potential Rally Based On Fib Retracement, Market Conditions To analyze the potential price movement of Shiba Inu, traders have utilized the Fibonacci retracement tool by placing it between the swing high of the first quarter (Q1) and the lows observed in December. This tool helps identify crucial levels based on the Fibonacci sequence. If the current trend in SHIB continues and the overall macro environment conditions continue to improve, there is a possibility of a rally. This rally could lead SHIB to reach the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which stands at approximately $0.00000967. Fibonacci retracement levels are commonly used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance levels based on the historical price movement. The 23.6% level often represents an initial area of interest where a significant rebound or reversal could occur. SHIB market cap nearly unchanged at $5.22 billion.

Positive developments and easing conditions could contribute to an upward movement in SHIB&#8217;s price. As traders and investors monitor these factors and the Fibonacci retracement levels, they will closely observe whether SHIB can indeed rally to the 23.6% Fib level, and if so, what implications it may have for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future trajectory. -Featured image from Nairametrics]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin (DOGE) has been embarking on a relentless quest for a price surge in recent weeks. As the market witnessed a flurry of activity, an unexpected twist unfolded when an anonymous whale made a significant decision—to sell a portion of their coveted meme coins.  In a move that raised eyebrows, one of these hefty Dogecoin holdings found its way to crypto exchange Binance, setting the stage for intrigue and speculation.  This interesting development came at a time when Dogecoin was fiercely determined to regain its footing and recoup some of the losses it had endured in recent weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Resurfaces After 2-Year Hiatus, Stakes $7.4 Million In ETH Dogecoin Whales Make Waves: Massive DOGE Transfers Raise Eyebrows In a series of transactions, the Dogecoin community has been abuzz with news of substantial transfers involving the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency. Crypto platform @DogeWhaleAlert, known for tracking large DOGE transfers on Twitter, has recently reported multiple colossal movements of DOGE across wallets, with a cumulative total exceeding 100 million DOGE. 🐕🪙🐋🚨 14,835,380 $DOGE ($1,103,737 USD) was transferred from multiple wallets to a #Binance wallet. Fee: 1.00 ($0.07 USD) Tx: https://t.co/4lBCExiwYT#DogecoinWhaleAlert #WhaleAlert #Dogecoin #CryptoNews — Ðogecoin Whale Alert (@DogeWhaleAlert) May 17, 2023 Among the notable transactions, one of the largest transfers involved a staggering 14,835,380 DOGE, making its way to Binance. On the other end of the spectrum, the smallest transaction consisted of a still impressive 10,000,000 DOGE. Over a span of 24 hours, a total of five major transfers of the meme coin DOGE took place, as substantial chunks of cryptocurrency ranging from 10 million to 30 million DOGE were swiftly shifted between wallets.  The flurry of activity has piqued the interest of the Dogecoin community and the wider crypto sphere, as they eagerly analyze the implications of these substantial movements. DOGE Whale Behavior Sends Ripples Through The Market: Impact On Price The recent surge of large-scale DOGE transfers by anonymous whales has not gone unnoticed, and their behavior has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency market. Unsurprisingly, the market has reacted to the recent whale transfers, resulting in notable price volatility for Dogecoin. The price of DOGE, as reported by CoinGecko, experienced a slight 0.7% slump in the past 24 hours. This downturn is likely attributed, at least in part, to the influx of substantial DOGE holdings hitting exchanges and potentially creating selling pressure. DOGE market cap currently at $10 billion.

This upward momentum, coupled with increased adoption and renewed interest in DOGE, may indicate that the impact of the whale transfers on the overall price has been mitigated by bullish market sentiment. Until then, observers will continue to dissect the actions of these anonymous whales, searching for insights and anticipating the next twist in the ever-evolving tale of Dogecoin. -Featured image from Cryptoglobe]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Web3 industry offers a diverse range of services, creating a dynamic landscape for individuals. A notable development in this space is the recent partnership announcement by Horizon, the creators of Sequence, aimed at redefining Web3 infrastructure. This collaboration has had a significant impact, particularly on Polygon&#8217;s governance token MATIC, which experienced a notable increase of nearly 3% within the past 24 hours. This bolstering of the infrastructure signifies a positive step forward for the Web3 ecosystem.

Once the final release of Supernets is launched, this partnership will surely affect the dominance of Polygon in the Web3 space.  Web3: Scalability, Seamlessness For Developers On Polygon The seamless integration of Sequence’s smart wallet and infrastructure stack on Polygon Supernets will pull business enterprises into the ecosystem. Polygon Supernets are custom-built blockchains for specific apps. The most important of these customizations is a custom blockspace, ensuring that the user experience isn’t affected by bumps in activity on-chain.  Sequence’s all-in-one development stack is the main attraction for both developers and investors. It is a complete package, covering tokens and NFTs to SDKs, the stack will fuel on-chain development as the release of Polygon Supernets nears.  To further push growth, both Polygon and Sequence will offer credits to incentivize developers to build on the platform. In doing so, the strategic alliance will have a strong effect on how quickly the Web3 infrastructure will improve.  .@AntimetalCloud launched its AI-powered cloud cost optimization platform, with an incredible $4.3M seed funding round led by @hiFramework☁️ 👉🏾We&#8217;re thrilled to have invested in Antimetal’s vision, driving innovation &#38; empowering the tech ecosystem More: https://t.co/beRTvlkVRE pic.twitter.com/TxJdJN76qv — Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) May 17, 2023 This isn’t the only move by Polygon to improve Web3 infrastructure. Recently, Polygon invested in Antimetal, a cloud-based platform, in a seed funding round led by Framework Ventures. With Polygon’s entry into the world of cloud infrastructure, we might see more developments in the space led by Polygon itself in the near future.  MATIC total market cap at $8.09 billion.

However, the current market structure is bearish, supporting the bears in the short to medium term. Thus, MATIC bulls should defend $0.8339 as much as possible.  With on and off-chain developments backing the token, MATIC might see a return to $1 in the coming days or weeks. Despite this, investors should be cautious in the short to medium term. Ethereum’s recent upward swing caused the altcoin market to follow as well.  If these price swings continue to move upward, MATIC’s rise to $1 is secured. With the market showing signs of strength, investors and traders should be able to enjoy gains in the long term.  -Featured image from DailyCoin]]></description>
