            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jo Johnson &#8211; the brother of the UK&#8217;s former PM, Boris Johnson &#8211; reportedly resigned from his advisory role in Bifinity (a payments technology company launched by Binance). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency platform has had several brushes with British regulators over the past few years. Despite the tension, the company aims to become a registered entity in the Kingdom sometime next year.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Johnson&#8217;s Departure</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to recent <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/12/19/boris-johnsons-brother-quits-adviser-binance-amid-crypto-meltdown/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">coverage</a> by The Telegraph, Boris Johnson&#8217;s younger brother &#8211; Jo Johnson &#8211; has quit the advisory board of Binance&#8217;s subsidiary.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He and Britain&#8217;s former Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries &#8211; Ed Vaizey (Lord Vaizey of Didcot), joined the company in September, highlighting Binance&#8217;s efforts to build trust between the crypto industry and the UK&#8217;s regulators and political elite. Lord Vaizey resigned from his post at Bifinity, too.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Binance spokesperson said Johnson left the firm to become an Executive Chairman of the digital education platform &#8211; FutureLearn.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;He will be focusing on his new role within the digital learning platform and is looking to scale back other activities,&#8221; he added.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The United Kingdom has not been the most-welcoming destination for Binance.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company hired more people and enacted mandatory know-your-customer (KYC) requirements to complete the watchdog&#8217;s guidelines.

To do so, it might establish a separate venture called Binance UK, similar to the existing one in the United States. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Politicians are returning tainted money donated to them by Sam Bankman-Fried prior to FTX’s collapse. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Negative press surrounding bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has inspired the Democratic Senate Majority PAC to return $3 million in political donations from the company’s executives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those donations include $2 million from FTX’s ex-head of engineering, Nishad Singh, and $1 million from disgraced former boss Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). </span></p>
<h2>Returning Tainted Money</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/ftx-democrats-senate-majority-pac-to-return-bankman-fried-donations.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by CNBC, a spokesperson for the PAC said the PAC decided to return the funds following “serious allegations against FTX.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before returning the money, the PAC is waiting on “proper direction from federal law enforcement officials based on their legal proceedings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wouldn’t be the first Democratic arm to take such action. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have also agreed to pay back their contributions from FTX. Daniel Wessel – spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee – </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-112ab1f32d23b1409fc53a5a73207f34" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the group will return $815,000 in donations from Bankman-Fried dating back to 2020, following proper legal guidance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">SBF is </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-says-sbf-donations-to-democrats-probably-over-1-billion/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">notorious</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for being the second-largest donor to the Democratic party during this year’s midterm election cycle. By his own account, he also made donations </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DezodR9hNI&amp;ab_channel=TiffanyFong" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">supporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Republican candidates in roughly equal measure – but kept these under the radar for fear of public backlash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of the former billionaire’s donations totaled nearly $40 million. Singh’s totaled $8 million – though the latter has not been charged with any crimes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, FTX’s sister trading desk Alameda Research donated $5 million to Future Forward USA – which spent millions on Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential bid. FTX’s bankruptcy lawyer </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-used-client-assets-for-margin-trading-at-alameda-confirms-bankruptcy-lawyer/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that FTX’s assets were comingled with Alameda’s for the purpose of margin trading, where tremendous money was lost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bankman-Fried has been arrested in the Bahamas, and is set to be extradited to the United States. He’s also been charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for defrauding investors, while still being investigated by both agencies for potential securities fraud. </span></p>
<h2>Potential Binance Clawbacks</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Politicians aren’t the only ones who may have to pay back their ill-gotten gains from FTX. Binance – which received $2 billion from the company when exiting its FTX equity position last year – may also face clawbacks during the bankruptcy process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When asked whether his company could handle such a clawback last week, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was reluctant to provide a clear answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll let the lawyers handle it. We are financially strong,” he </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cz-binance-on-audits-ftx-the-2-1-billion-sbf-buyout-in-2021-and-recent-withdrawal-spree/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The South Korean court has reportedly frozen 120 billion won (over $93 million) in assets belonging to executives of blockchain consultancy firm Kernel Labs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The entity is speculated to have had a hand in Terra&#8217;s collapse earlier this year while its CEO &#8211; Kim Hyun-Joong &#8211; served as Vice President of Engineering at Terraform Labs. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Latest Efforts</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a local </span><a href="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202212208809B" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the Korean Authorities froze around $93 million owned by bosses of Terraform Labs&#8217; affiliate company &#8211; Kernel Labs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some sources revealed that employees of the organization previously worked at the Terraform Labs Korea office, while CEO Kim Hyun-Joong was the Vice President of Engineering of the notorious crypto fintech firm. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest coverage disclosed that the nearly $100 million were frozen from seven people. The Seoul Southern District Court claimed that all those individuals have been involved in selling pre-issued Terra tokens to generate significant profits. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prosecutors </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://ilyo.co.kr/?ac=article_view&amp;entry_id=443108" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">determined</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that Hyun-Joong illegal gains amounted to over $61 million. They disclosed that he purchased a building in Seoul for around $27 million last November. He also bought an apartment in the capital for almost $8 million shortly after Terra&#8217;s catastrophe. For his part, Choi &#8211; Kernel Labs&#8217; former CEO &#8211; received around $32 million in illicit profits.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The South Korean authorities recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/south-korea-confiscates-over-100-million-from-terras-co-founder-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">confiscated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> more than $100 million worth of assets belonging to Shin Hyun-Seong (Daniel Shin). They claimed the Co-Founder of Terraform Labs violated domestic capital laws and was responsible for the price crash of the tokens.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors Office </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/korean-prosecutors-seek-an-arrest-warrant-for-terraforms-daniel-shin-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">issued</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> an arrest warrant against him several days later, while Shin maintained he had no relation to Terra&#8217;s fall as he cut ties with the project in 2020:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I left (Terraform Labs) two years before the collapse of Terra and Luna and have nothing to do with the collapse.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What About Do Kwon?</span></h2>

The relevant agencies previously seized $65 million in bitcoin, presumably belonging to him.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The demise of FTX has set back crypto by years and this disaster is likely to stir regulators into action.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, for one, believes that ideal crypto regulations should start with centralized actors since most of the damage to the consumers has been done by these entities.</p>
<p>In a recently <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/regulating-crypto-how-we-move-forward-as-an-industry-from-here?__cf_chl_f_tk=3IJazblXj4XHfNypOvRnwTnHSkJK.AmbJz7y7Tfj3l0-1671545172-0-gaNycGzNCz0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">released</a> &#8220;realistic blueprint,&#8221; Armstrong highlighted the need to pursue legislation early instead of waiting for something comprehensive and perfect. Regulations should initially focus on centralized actors in crypto, such as &#8211; stablecoin issuers, exchanges, and custodians, which have seen the most risk of consumer harm, he argued.</p>
<h2>All Eyes on Centralized Entities</h2>
<p>A good place to start will be stablecoin regulations, a sector that has already garnered much attention from DC. According to Armstrong, the stablecoin market in the United States can be regulated under standard financial services laws.</p>
<p>A sound stablecoin regulation would require issuers to register as a state trust or OCC national trust charter and undergo rigorous annual audits to provide the transparency that customer funds are held in appropriate reserve assets and separate from corporate cash. The issuers should also ensure reasonable controls and board governance, meet basic cybersecurity standards such as SOC compliance, and set up a blacklist capability to meet sanctions requirements.</p>
<p>Watchdogs should then target exchange and custodians to help prevent malicious activity while ensuring that they do not stifle innovation. Traditional financial services can serve as inspiration, according to the Coinbase chief, which could entail implementing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures, establishing a federal licensing and registration regime, etc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, commodities and securities are other areas that need urgent attention from regulatory agencies. As such, Armstrong believes the US Congress should require the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to classify each of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, declaring them as either securities or commodities.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The industry is primarily focused on trading crypto commodities today, but a robust market to register and issue crypto securities should also exist in the U.S., and could be a real improvement over how traditional securities are issued.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Decentralized Crypto</h2>
<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been the &#8220;trickiest&#8221; area to get right. Armstrong opined that the role of financial regulators should be limited to centralized actors in cryptocurrency while their decentralized counterparts should instead be allowed to innovate.</p>
<p>He explained that decentralized platforms do not have intermediaries and that the open-source code and smart contracts serve as &#8220;the ultimate form of disclosure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest draft comes exactly two months after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-shares-his-position-on-crypto-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">published</a> a set of standards for crypto regulation that was met with significant backlash.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price continues to consolidate in a tight range, as it failed to break a significant resistance level to the upside a few days ago. However, from a technical analysis standpoint, the time for a decisive breakout is near.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>On the daily chart, the price is still consolidating in a large falling wedge pattern. These are commonly known as potential bullish reversal patterns in a bear market, provided they get broken to the upside.</p>
<p>However, last week&#8217;s rejection from the $18K resistance level and the 50-day moving average has halted the rally toward the higher boundary of the pattern. As a result, it likely initiated a drop down to the $15K support level and the lower trendline of the wedge.</p>
<p>Considering today&#8217;s bullish daily candle, a retest of the 50-day moving average currently located around the  $17K mark seems likely. The short-term future of BTC&#8217;s price would be determined by the outcome of this attempt.</p>
<figure id="attachment_229571" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-229571" style="width: 1354px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-20-2022.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-229571 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-20-2022.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_201202" width="1354" height="775" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-20-2022.jpg 1354w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-20-2022-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-20-2022-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-20-2022-768x440.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-20-2022-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1354px) 100vw, 1354px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-229571" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Viewing the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price is recovering but is experiencing major issues returning above the $16,800 level following last week&#8217;s plunge.</p>
<p>In the event of a break above the $16,800 level, a retest of the broken bullish trendline would be expected. On the other hand, the price&#8217;s failure to break above $16,800 would likely initiate a bearish continuation toward the key $15K area.</p>
<p>A recent short-term bullish move was signaled by the RSI indicator, as a clear divergence was formed between the last two price lows.</p>
<p>However, the oscillator is currently showing values around 50%, hinting at a neutral state in momentum and offering little clue on the probable direction of the trend in the short term as the market continues to witness a fragile equilibrium between buyers and sellers.</p>

<h2>Onchain Analysis</h2>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan </a></p>
<p>The following chart includes the Long Term Holder SOPR(Block resolution) and Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>Long-Term Spent Output Profit Ratio is a ratio of spent outputs (more than 155 days) in profit at the time of the window. Values over &#8216;1&#8217; indicate more long-term investors are selling at a profit, while values below &#8216;1&#8217; mean more long-term investors are selling at a loss.</p>
<p>The metric spiked three times during the price recovery from $16K to roughly $18.4K. Also, it has printed a significant jump after Bitcoin surged and reached the crucial resistance level of $18K.</p>
<p>This proves that long-term holders consider each price surge an opportunity to offload their assets and realize profits.</p>
<p>This is typical behavior during the late bear market stages; however, the next bull run won&#8217;t be initiated unless this cohort stops distributing their assets and start accumulating BTC with higher rates.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[A U.S. congressman suspects that certain parties want to keep Sam Bankman-Fried from speaking to the public. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer doesn’t believe that the arrest of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) – which allowed him to miss a scheduled congressional hearing on December 13 – was purely due to good fortune. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, the politician suspects that the arrest was “purposeful,” due to Bankman-Fried’s various connections and information. </span></p>
<h2>Centralized Failure</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking with Nicholas Carter during the On the Brink podcast </span><a href="https://onthebrink-podcast.com/emmer-dec22/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on Tuesday, Emmer stressed that FTX’s failure was a failure of centralized finance, rather than decentralized tech. “The only difference between this and financial fraudsters from the beginning of time is we’ve now moved into digital assets,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The congressman shifted the blame toward the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a regulator responsible for providing safeguards in the Tradfi world. The agency, he argued, was “asleep at the wheel” with FTX, and possibly </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspired-with-sec-for-special-treatment-us-congressman/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">complicit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with the fraud. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Politicians and regulators were quick to act on FTX and Bankman-Fried only after the bankruptcy took place early last month. The SEC and Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) jointly </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-219" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">charged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Bankman-Fried with fraud in December, while the Senate held a hearing on the exchange’s collapse with FTX’s bankruptcy lawyer, </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-used-client-assets-for-margin-trading-at-alameda-confirms-bankruptcy-lawyer/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">John Ray</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, on December 13th. </span></p>
<h2>Conspiracy to Arrest SBF?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bankman-Fried was also supposed to attend the hearing, but was </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bahamian-authorities-arrest-sbf-at-the-request-of-us-government/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">jailed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Bohemian authorities at the Department of Justice’s request just one day ahead of time. He is still due to be </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/its-official-sbf-agrees-to-be-extradited-to-the-us/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">extradited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, Emmer found his arrest, and opportunity to avoid the hearing, a little too convenient. He believes a range of parties may have wanted to keep him from speaking before congress, including Bahamian regulators. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The speed with which this indictment apparently moved at… it’s an unusual speed that it moved at by any account,” said Emmer. “You talk to anyone in the prosecution business. They’ll tell you that this really went in a much faster fashion than most of these that they have ever seen out of the Southern District of New York.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Emmer was also suspicious of how residents in the Bahamas were prioritized when reimbursing customers, and how Bohemian regulators reportedly </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-bahamas-asked-sbf-to-mint-new-crypto-worth-hundreds-of-millions-us-lawyers-claim/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">asked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> SBF and FTX to mint $300 million in new crypto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The congressman was particularly hard on SEC chairman Gary Gensler, who spent months speaking with SBF prior to FTX’s collapse. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why wasn’t he doing his job? Why wasn’t the SEC doing the oversight? he asked. </span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[With 2022 coming to an end, here are six key considerations for Ethereum's price going into the new year.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Other than PayPal&#8217;s launch of the MetaMask integration, which is positive news for Ethereum, recent news about the world&#8217;s largest smart contract blockchain is mostly a yawn.</p>
<p>Compared to last year this time, ETH is trading at a 68% discount, highlighting the exacerbated bear market of late.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also worth outlining that it was the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s most boisterous bubble with its most catastrophic collapse, knocking out one crypto business and altcoin after another in the wake of its fall.</p>
<h2>What Will Happen With Ethereum (ETH) in 2023?</h2>
<p>Will Ethereum&#8211; and its peers, Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) &#8211; rally in 2023, remain in an extended bear market, or capitulate even further in Q1 or Q2 of next year?</p>
<p>As long as Bitcoin&#8217;s coattails are in the crypto exchange sector &#8211; and with the high liquidity among crypto trading pairs and consequent unprecedented velocity of money through crypto exchange infrastructures &#8211; major altcoins like Ethereum are likely to share the same fate as BTC.</p>
<p>Just what will that fate be is the question all participants in this market are anticipating the answer to as well as dreading should there be any more shocks to their system.</p>
<p>So what follows, for your consideration, dear reader, are three near-ish term bear cases for Ethereum and three bull cases for the cryptocurrency powering the world&#8217;s oldest and strongest smart contract blockchain.</p>
<h2>Four 2023 Bear Case For Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ethereum_bear_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229554" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ethereum_bear_cover.jpg" alt="ethereum_bear_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ethereum_bear_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ethereum_bear_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ethereum_bear_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ethereum_bear_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ethereum_bear_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h3>Hawkish Fed Policy</h3>
<p>The Federal Reserve recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fed-rate-hike-how-does-it-affect-you-5e404362fe2703b1a092190cb7b9e106" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">raised its</a> key rate &#8211; the federal funds rate &#8211; by 50 basis points, bringing it into the range of 4.25% to 4.5%.</p>
<p>The goal of this latest round of Fed rate hikes is to increase the cost of borrowing in the United States&#8217; international banking system by making technical adjustments to its purchasing activities in vast money markets with U.S. banks and lending institutions.</p>
<p>The result is a stronger dollar in the floating exchange rate against other currencies.</p>
<p>That goes for foreign central bank fiat currencies (traditional finance &#8211; or TradFi) as well as for major, liquid digital assets like Ethereum. So as a result, Ether which trades against USDs and USD-pegged stable coins will depreciate in some value against the dollar.</p>
<p>All other things remaining equal, this would be a reason to be bearish on the price of Ether over the next two quarters. We&#8217;ll see if the Fed&#8217;s hawkish stance is a new secular monetary regime, or if the world&#8217;s most powerful central bank will back off of hikes in the face of a recession or overly deflationary dollar.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Maximalism and POW</h3>
<p>Bitcoin maximalism and the fierce competition for capital between Ethereum and Bitcoin could cut BTC&#8217;s way against ETH depending on how things play out between the two.</p>
<p>The much-vaunted <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-the-merge-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-transition-to-ethereum-2-0/" data-wpel-link="internal">merge</a> to upgrade Ethereum&#8217;s entire MainNet from a blockchain that achieved network consensus via proof of work to one that uses proof of stake (POS) is not without controversy.</p>
<p>Bitcoin maximalists believe that proof of work on the BTC blockchain is a singularly important development in the global, network-connected economy.</p>
<p>This is not an uncommon view among crypto enthusiasts that Bitcoin eventually will win out over Ethereum and even central bank fiat currencies, stealing massive amounts of Ethereum&#8217;s market share along what they believe is a moonshot to become the entire world economy&#8217;s reserve currency for final settlement and cross-border trade.</p>
<p>They have specific criticisms of Ethereum&#8217;s network consensus model and believe it is vulnerable to reaction from centralized and federalized corporate players. For instance, many Ethereum stakers under the POS model <a href="https://hackernoon.com/ethereum-20-staking-on-aws-cloud-staking-matters" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">use Amazon Web Services cloud servers</a> to host their nodes.</p>
<h3>Extended Bitcoin Bear Market Could Drag Ether Down With It</h3>
<p>As go the fortunes of Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s king crypto with the largest crypto market share by far &#8211; so goes the rest of the exchange market for cryptos.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s future over the first half of 2023 is anybody&#8217;s guess, however, anyone waiting for the market bottom to be in for BTC should not hold their breath. Bitcoin keeps taking the hits as we round out the final quarter of 2022. The absolutely vicious crypto winter this year shows no clear signs of abating.</p>
<p>November&#8217;s break below the key psychological support level of $20K, where Bitcoin markets traded range-bound for since June, was the final nail in the coffin of any hope that it would be impossible for the Bitcoin price to sink any lower.</p>
<h2>Four 2023 Bull Cases for Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/etherem_bull_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229555" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/etherem_bull_cover.jpg" alt="etherem_bull_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/etherem_bull_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/etherem_bull_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/etherem_bull_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/etherem_bull_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/etherem_bull_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h3>The Ethereum Merge and A Fundamental Analysis of ETH</h3>
<p>Not only was the Ethereum merge the most impressive upgrade to a very sophisticated network distributed database in the history of the Internet, but it also went quite well without any significant hiccups up to date.</p>
<p>The sheer scale of investment by the programmable money&#8217;s stakeholders (80,000 depositors x 32ETH =~ $3 billion USD worth) is difficult to overlook in the long-term view of ETH as a digital asset worth investing in.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s worth buying at fever pitch bull market prices, but as far as prices have corrected from the last ATH, it looks cheap to me the longer it trades in</p>
<h3>Shanghai Upgrade and Institutional Investment / Corporate Inroads</h3>
<p>The Ethereum network has hardly been fully operational as a proof-of-stake network after the migration of Ethereum&#8217;s Mainnet to the POS Beacon Chain, yet a new one is underway.</p>
<p>The merge was accomplished via a two-step process called the Bellatrix and Paris upgrades. The next in line is the Shanghai upgrade.</p>
<p>It will come in March and will add some value to Ethereum by enabling users to withdraw staked ETH, but lookout &#8211; that could result in a lower trading value for the crypto as well.</p>
<h3>Gas Fees, Usage and Developer Statistics</h3>
<p>Before and after the Ethereum Merge earlier this year, crypto market watchers were debating whether or not it would lower gas fees on the network. While they&#8217;re not any lower than they were pre-merge, gas prices on Ethereum have not really gone up any higher than they&#8217;ve been since we were last in bubble territory.</p>
<p>Ethereum fees outside of bubbles have been remarkably stable over the years. The number of new projects and developments, meanwhile, continues to climb for the same fees. If we factor in the soaring rate of inflation for other commodities over the last macro market cycle, we could argue that Ethereum gas prices are cheaper now than before the pandemic and massive global expansion of fiat monetary bases.</p>
<p>The Ethereum Network continues to rank number one among blockchain-powered distributed computers in the number of new projects and development, in the number of new coins, tokens, and contracts minted, in all the fundamental measures of a blockchain ecosystem&#8217;s size, impact, relevance, and rate of healthy, useful growth.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[ From Mt. Gox to FTX, Vitalik Buterin believes that the "quality of villains" has gone downhill. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FTX&#8217;s collapse has shaken the crypto market to the very core. But this isn&#8217;t the first time the space has experienced significant turmoil related to the failure of an exchange. The fall of Mt. Gox, an exchange that oversaw 80% of all Bitcoin trades back in February 2014, did likewise. Its former chief executive officer &#8211; Mark Karpelès &#8211; was arrested in 2015 and was later acquitted on several charges four years later.</p>
<p>While admitting that Karpelès did a &#8220;bunch of horrible stuff,&#8221; the Ethereum co-founder, however, believes that the former chief of the now defunct Tokyo-based exchange has emerged as an honorable man.</p>
<h2>Who&#8217;s a Bigger Villain?</h2>
<p>For many, the FTX blow-up is a sad reminder of how Mt.Gox, the original Bitcoin exchange, fell to ruin more than eight years back. But the latest one feels a lot bigger because it not only dragged the space into a near-permanent bear market but also transformed Sam Bankman-Fried from a billionaire savant and industry savior to a corporate villain virtually overnight.</p>
<p>Despite being acquitted by the court in 2019, the verdict stated that Karpelès had inflicted &#8220;massive harm to the trust of his users&#8221; and added that he abused his status and authority to conduct clever criminal acts. Both Karpelès and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/its-official-sbf-agrees-to-be-extradited-to-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bankman-Fried</a> have similarities, but according to Buterin, the former has maintained himself better after the blow-up.</p>
<p>During a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=QXKqIIf6_AE&amp;ab_channel=BanklessShows" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">interview</a> with Bankless co-owner David Hoffman, the Ethereum frontman said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I actually feel like the way that he has handled himself post-blow-up, has actually been kind of honorable. He hasn&#8217;t tried to give himself a Su Zhu-style redemption arc. Went quiet for a while, and diligently worked on helping people get their money back. It&#8217;s like villains are getting lower quality now. Mark has improved in ways that I just, unfortunately, don&#8217;t expect people like Su and Kyle to improve even a decade from now. Very much hope I am wrong though.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Buterin asserted that the 2014 blow-up did feel like an existential crisis for the crypto market as well as a huge crash for Bitcoin. &#8220;It was an invitation for regulators to swarm around the space,&#8221; he added. But he also believes the 2022 collapse will be harder to recover from.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Adoption Curve</h2>
<p>Several projects have been the target of maximalist criticism calling them distractions and/or scams. The movement started by Bitcoin Maxis &#8211; has helped the premier crypto&#8217;s adoption to an extent. But the same strategy might not be helpful for further growth, according to Buterin, whose very own Ethereum has been the most consistent and high-profile target of this vocal group.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A community having a very high variance, high excitement, and high turn-off approach to existing is a very good strategy when you&#8217;re trying to increase adoption for 0.1% to 10%. But it&#8217;s a terrible strategy if you&#8217;re trying to increase adoption from 10% to 70%. crypto is no longer in the stage of getting from 0.1% to 10%. The space is at the level of trying to get 10% to 70% and that requires different strategies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin, which has been long heralded as a store of value, flopped during the test this year, but Buterin remains hopeful about the narrative. He also said crypto may meet a similar adoption fate to that of Linux in developed countries but added that the asset class may become &#8220;ubiquitous&#8221; in the developing world.</p>
