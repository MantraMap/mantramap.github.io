			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">As Borroe&rsquo;s stage 1 presale continues to skyrocket, depicting significant growth potential, Cardano and Chainlink are following suit based on high accumulation rates.</p>
<p class="s3">Through its governance token $ROE, Borroe intends to propel the Web3 wave so that content creators can be compensated accordingly because they are sometimes shortchanged.</p>
<p class="s3">Borroe is taking innovation in the Web3 space a notch higher by ensuring that creators can easily monetize their efforts through the sale of their future non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Looking to Borroe For Big Gains
<p class="s3">Investors are eyeing huge returns from the Borroe ecosystem based on its real-world utility of making the fundraising process smooth, given that this is a huge stumbling block in the Web3 sector.</p>
<p class="s3">By serving as the first-ever Web3 blockchain invoice discounting NFT marketplace globally, the stakes are high that Borroe will moon because of the solutions presented.</p>
<p class="s3">Furthermore, pundits speculate that Borroe will be a force to be reckoned with in the Web3 sector based on the deployment of cutting-edge technologies, such as automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology in the fundraising process.</p>
<p class="s3">$ROE tokens sold at stage 1 have surpassed the 37.5 million mark as more investors continue to jump on the Borroe bandwagon. $ROE is retailing at $0.0125 with the price hitting $0.015 at the next stage.</p>
LINK whales have been on a buying spree
<p class="s3">With hodling being a favored strategy in the crypto space, Chainlink whales have been on an accumulation mode.</p>
<p class="s3">Market analyst Ali Martinez disclosed that approximately 14 million LINK, worth more than $100M were bought in a span of one week.</p>
<p class="s3">&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s3">Source: Santiment</p>
<p class="s3">The analyst also stated that the accumulation trend had gained significant momentum in the Chainlink ecosystem, given that nearly 29,000 addresses had bought 295M LINK worth more than $2.2 billion.</p>

<p class="s3">He noted, &ldquo;Chainlink established strong support between $6.63 and $6.88. Nearly 29,000 addresses acquired 295 million LINK within this range. As long as LINK maintains above this level, there's strong bullish sentiment since on-chain data shows no major resistance barriers ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s3">Based on this analysis, LINK&rsquo;s bullish outlook still stands as it eyes a 100x growth potential because the coin was trading at $7.50 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko data.</p>
<p class="s3">This trend has been happening as development activity on the LINK network soars.</p>

<p class="s3">Leading market insight provider Santiment stated, &ldquo;Chainlink's Github development activity has been notably higher this summer, leading to the asset cracking the top 5 most frequently developed assets. Additionally, whales &amp; sharks with 100K-10M LINK now hold the most coins since December, 2022.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>
<p class="s3">Source: Santiment</p>
<p class="s3">Cardano&rsquo;s transaction volume balloons</p>
<p class="s3">The ADA network enjoyed significant growth in the second quarter of this year based on a Messari report.</p>
<p class="s3">The transaction volume or blockchain load on the Cardano blockchain saw a growth rate of nearly 50% between the end of April and August, illustrating heightened activity as more users onboard the ecosystem.</p>

<p class="s3">Messari noted, &ldquo;State of Cardano Q2 2023. With a dedicated community of users and developers, Cardano has demonstrated staying power. In Q2, average daily dapp transactions were up 49%, TVL up 10%, and 199% YTD.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s3">The accumulation trend has also engulfed the ADA network as whales and sharks continue to accumulate.</p>

<p class="s3">Santiment disclosed, &ldquo;As Cardano sits just above $0.29, whales and sharks holding between 100K-10M ADA have accumulated back to their highest level since September, 2022. Additionally, onchain transaction volume has been rising nearly every week for the past 6 months.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s3">&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<p class="s3">Therefore, Borroe, Chainlink, and Cardano are making a strong case for a 100x growth rate. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">The last few weeks have seen some exciting events. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pomerdoge have been in the lead. However, analysts prefer Pomerdoge over Shiba Inu (SHIB) for better gains. The former is a new project, and is still in its presale. But experts opine that it will grow at least 4,000% in 2023.</p>
Summary
● Shiba Inu (SHIB) has grown by more than 25% since July 1.
● Pomerdoge is likely to grow by 4,000% in the next four months.
<p class="s13">Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Gains Massively From Shibarium Mania
<p class="s7">Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been on the rise lately, despite the overall market conditions being bearish. Decoupling with larger market trends, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has witnessed a rise in its market value in recent times. The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has soared by more than 16% in the last seven days. On the 30-day chart, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is up by more than 36%. Consequently, the trading price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has increased to $0.000010.</p>
<p class="s7">The data from Kaiko shows that Shiba Inu (SHIB) had an explosion in developer activity, thereby supporting its price movement. The meme coin has grown by more than 25% since July 1. Notably, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has surpassed its arch-rival, Dogecoin, in network growth. The biggest reason behind this exponential growth of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is the upcoming Shibariummainnet launch. According to reports, Shiba Inu (SHIB) can launch the Shibarium mainnetbefore the end of August. Therefore, there is a strong mania around Shiba Inu (SHIB).</p>
<p class="s7">Another development that has helped Shiba Inu (SHIB) rise on the growth chart is the self-sovereign identity (SSI) protocol. Recently, Shiba Inu developers announced that they would tie digital identity verification, dubbed SSI, to all the development within the SHIB ecosystem. With this update, Shiba Inu (SHIB) aims to give users more control over their personal data. According to experts, this update can make Shiba Inu (SHIB) more attractive, as users are getting privacy-conscious.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Posts Ballistic Growth
<p class="s7">As per the latest market data, the global play-to-earn (P2E) NFT Games industry can rise at a CAGR of over 21% during the next five years. Pomerdoge has planned to launch a new P2E meme coin that will disrupt the blockchain gaming industry. The platform has attracted a large number of investors with its growth-oriented business roadmap.</p>
<p class="s7">It has brought a new P2E game, Pomergame. In this game, which has not been launched yet, players will get an opportunity to battle against each other, win rewards, and earn money. Players can also create and improve their characters with customized in-game items. If gamers get a gold status Pomer, they become eligible to sell or trade their in-game items with other members.</p>
<p class="s7">Pomerdoge has also planned to launch 7,777 non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, one must be a POMD token owner to get an opportunity to purchase these exclusive NFTs. POMD will be the native crypto of the platform, and has been built on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p class="s7">The project will have four stages of POMD&rsquo;s presale. At present, the platform&rsquo;s presale is in stage 1. The purchase price of a token has increased from $0.007 to $0.008. However, the token&rsquo;s market value can jump by 1,700% during the presale round, and 40x before the end of 2023. Additionally, Pomerdoge will give a $50,000 mega Pomer prize, and weekly giveawaysworth $100,000. Moreover, there is no buy or sell tax on POMD transactions, making it lucrative to savvy investors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>OpenSea is still the biggest NFT marketplace, but there are new players and competitors that offer things that Opensea doesn&rsquo;t. One example is an upcoming project called Everlodge, which allows people to buy NFTs that represent a share in luxury holiday projects. Here I&rsquo;ll explore both of them and the potential for the future.</p>
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
OpenSea is behind the times with Real World Assets NFTs
<p>Founded in 2017, OpenSea is a grandaddy of Web3 at this point, given the speed at which blockchain technology progresses. With over 40 million NFTs for sale its the best place to find everything and anything, but not necessarily to find something truly special.</p>
<p>Many customers are using Nifty or SuperRare to find truly special NFTs, and Blur, a newer market entrant. In May 2023, Blur emerged as the dominant NFT marketplace with an impressive 65% market share and $442 million in sales. They disrupted the market with their zero royalty fee platform and customer loyalty rewards. Meanwhile, OpenSea, once a heavyweight, struggled to keep up with Blur's disruptive approach. They eventually followed suit by offering zero royalty fees after experiencing traffic loss to Blur.</p>
<p>However even Blur&rsquo;s success versus Opensea may be more to do with the fact that Blur incentivised people to do wash trading in order to receive Blur tokens.</p>
<p>PFPs and in game NFTs have lost a lot of popularity and value this year, with industry experts turning towards tokenisation of financial products and also Real World Assets (RWA) such as property and art, and social projects. &nbsp;Since Opensea and Blur focuses mainly on the former types of NFTs, they arent keeping on trend with NFT options. Everlodge on the other hand, is part of a wider trend where NFTs have real use cases and tokenise RWA.</p>
What Everlodge has to offer over Opensea in terms of NFTs and value
<p>Everlodge provides the chance for people to make money in property, using NFTs. Luxury villas and holiday homes are fractionalised on the blockchain, with deeds in the metadata, and then sold in fractions to users.</p>
<p>As property tends to go up, there is a good chance that the NFTs rise in value, as the properties do. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s more ways to make money from Everlodge. &nbsp;One of the ways is to buy into their presale of their native token ELDG.</p>
<p>Holders will get staking benefits with an APR of 10%, discounts in the Everlodge NFT marketplace, and lower fees on property maintenance costs. &nbsp;Holders can also provide liquidity and receive an APY for that. Owning an NFT also brings advantages since you get a timeshare in one of these luxury places. &nbsp;But for those who want to skip that they can then rent out their timeshare for extra income.</p>
<p>Big players like Avalanche, Solana and Polygon are also just getting involved in the RWA tokenization space, showing how much room for growth there is in the industry. Boston Consulting Group predict that the space will be worth $16 trillion by 2030. Binacnce believe the figure is much higher due to the value of the total global asset market.</p>
<p>ELDG is currently on offer for $0.01 and 40 million will be available at that price. That&rsquo;s bullish considering that 480 million tokens will be offered in the presale. This means that now is a great chance to get in, before the price increases. &nbsp;The token will launch for $0.035, and is expected to do around a 3000% after it goes live on Uniswap and certain CEXes.</p>

<p>Everlodge provides the chance for people to make money in property, using NFTs. Luxury villas and holiday homes are fractionalised on the blockchain, with deeds in the metadata, and then sold in fractions to users.</p>
<p>As property tends to go up, there is a good chance that the NFTs rise in value, as the properties do. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s more ways to make money from Everlodge. &nbsp;One of the ways is to buy into their presale of their native token ELDG.</p>
<p>Holders will get staking benefits with an APR of 10%, discounts in the Everlodge NFT marketplace, and lower fees on property maintenance costs. &nbsp;Holders can also provide liquidity and receive an APY for that. Owning an NFT also brings advantages since you get a timeshare in one of these luxury places. &nbsp;But for those who want to skip that they can then rent out their timeshare for extra income.</p>
<p>Big players like Avalanche, Solana and Polygon are also just getting involved in the RWA tokenization space, showing how much room for growth there is in the industry. Boston Consulting Group predict that the space will be worth $16 trillion by 2030. Binacnce believe the figure is much higher due to the value of the total global asset market.</p>
<p>ELDG is currently on offer for $0.01 and 40 million will be available at that price. That&rsquo;s bullish considering that 480 million tokens will be offered in the presale. This means that now is a great chance to get in, before the price increases. &nbsp;The token will launch for $0.035, and is expected to do around a 3000% after it goes live on Uniswap and certain CEXes.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained on the defensive early in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 25912.09 area following widespread selling pressure, representing the 61.8% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 25234.76 to 27007.87.&nbsp; &nbsp;Upward activity emerged around the 25610 area after additional selling pressure, right around the 78.6% retracement of the appreciating range.&nbsp; BTC/USD recently came off to the 25234.76 area, its weakest print since mid-June.&nbsp; This fresh multi-month low represented a test of a major downside price objective around the 25128.94 area that is associated with selling pressure that increased around the 31862.21 and 30421.29 levels in July.&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Stops were elected below the 27620.46 area during the decline, another downside price objective linked to recent downward pressure around the 30222 and 29665.27 areas.&nbsp; Major Stops were also elected below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in appreciating ranges from the 15460 and 19568.52 levels include the 23661, 22793, and 21725 levels.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Chainlink (LINK), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Everlodge (ELDG) &ndash; three coins that could bring unique value to your investment portfolio. When it comes to building a portfolio, the key is diversity. Including a mix of established players and promising newcomers can help mitigate risks and maximize potential gains. Due to these reasons, let's explore all three of them in greater detail. </p>
Summary
- Chainlink integrates with Coinbase&rsquo;s Base 
- Shiba Inu one of the top weekly gainers 
- Everlodge expected to rally by 30x
<p>Join Everlodge Presale</p>
Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Solution
<p>Chainlink (LINK) has solidified its position as a cornerstone in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As a bridge between smart contracts and real-world data, Chainlink's decentralized oracle network ensures blockchain applications access to accurate information.</p>
<p>In recent Chainlink news, it announced that it merged with Coinbase's Base. As a result, the Chainlink crypto interest rose. In fact, its value jumped by 6.3% over the past month alone. </p>
<p>Currently, Chainlink is trading hands at $7.28 with a market cap of $3.9B. However, due to its technical indicators showing green, market analysts remain bullish about it. Therefore, they forecast a $9.12 price for Chainlink by the end of 2023. </p>
Shiba Inu (SHIB): Expected To Soar 
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the scene as a community-driven experiment inspired by the success of meme coins like Dogecoin. While often associated with its meme status, Shiba Inu aims to create a decentralized ecosystem that includes tokens like BONE. </p>
<p>The Shiba Inu price has increased 13.2% over the previous week, ranking among the top 20 altcoins by total market capitalization. Not only that, Shiba Inu is one of the best-performing currencies overall. The Shiba Inu crypto has a value of $0.00001036 with a market cap of $6.1B. </p>
<p>Most importantly, the Shiba Inu technical analysis shows bullish signs. To clarify, all its moving averages and technical indicators are showing strong buy signals. As a result, experts in the field predict Shiba Inu surging to $0.00001078 soon..</p>
Everlodge (ELDG): Brings Something Unique to the Real Estate Market
<p>Everlodge (ELDG) aims to democratize real estate investment by tokenizing properties and offering fractional ownership through blockchain technology. This approach allows investors to purchase fractions of high-value properties, such as luxury villas, vacation homes, and hotels, for $100. Therefore, Everlodge enables more individuals to participate in real estate investment.</p>
<p>One of the most innovative aspects of Everlodge is its integration of NFTs into the real estate market. Each property is minted as an NFT, representing ownership, and stored securely on the blockchain. This provides several benefits, including increased transparency, immutability of ownership records, and removing the need for intermediaries.</p>
<p>At the core of this platform lies the ELDG native token. ELDG holders are rewarded with discounts on property purchases, reduced trading fees, and even free nightly stays in the properties within the Everlodge ecosystem. This rewards program incentivizes participation and fosters a vibrant and engaged community of investors.</p>
<p>One ELDG token costs only $0.01. But keep in mind that it is in Stage 1 of its presale. In other words, it will rise as it advances. And with Stage 2 coming this month, a 20% surge will also occur. Everlodge stands out from Chainlink and Shiba Inu thanks to its low market cap, which means it will surge faster. Consequently, experts foresee a 30x growth for it on launch day. </p>

And with Stage 2 coming this month, a 20% surge will also occur. Everlodge stands out from Chainlink and Shiba Inu thanks to its low market cap, which means it will surge faster. Consequently, experts foresee a 30x growth for it on launch day. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>NFT marketplace OpenSea will be sunsetting its on-chain royalty enforcement tool, Operator Filter.&nbsp;</p>
Operator Filter Falls Short Of Expectations
<p>On Thursday, OpenSea announced on X (formerly Twitter) that it would be removing the Operator Filter tool from its platform. The tool was introduced on the platform back in November 2022 to allow creators to blacklist NFT marketplaces that didn't adhere to royalty enforcement standards. However, according to founder and CEO Devin Finzer, the tool's effectiveness fell short of expectations.</p>
<p>Starting August 31, the Operator Filter will cease to block any marketplaces. For existing collections on non-Ethereum blockchains and those currently using the tool, creator fees will remain enforced until February 29, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finzer clarified,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To be clear, creator fees aren&rsquo;t going away &mdash; simply the ineffective, unilateral enforcement of them."</p>

Operator Filter Rendered Useless
<p>The Operator Filter, touted as a "simple code snippet," aimed to limit NFT sales exclusively to marketplaces that upheld creator fees. Yet, its impact didn't align with the aspirations of its creators, as Finzer pointed out that the NFT ecosystem's support for the tool was insufficient.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain NFT marketplaces like Blur, Dew, and LooksRare managed to bypass the filter by integrating Seaport Protocol, which helped them circumvent OpenSea's blacklist and thus avoid creator fees.</p>
Creator Concerns and Redirecting Efforts
<p>Creators themselves expressed concerns about the Operator Filter infringing upon their control over where their collections were sold.</p>
<p>He said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have heard from some creators that the Operator Filter limits their sense of control over where their collections are sold, and at the same time may collide with a collector&rsquo;s expectation of full ownership&hellip;The Operator Filter&rsquo;s restrictions come at the expense of decentralized ownership.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finzer also emphasized that while creator fees play a role in specific business models, they constitute only one among many revenue streams available to creators. OpenSea is redirecting its efforts toward enabling new use cases, such as digital and physical redeemables, and promoting these use cases more effectively in primary and secondary experiences.</p>
Mixed Reactions from the NFT Community
<p>This decision from OpenSea holds implications for NFT artists seeking passive income. Some creators expressed disappointment, suggesting that collectors should support them on platforms that enforce royalties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a Reddit avatar artist posited that the move might have been prudent, as the existing business model appeared to profit excessively from hype trading.</p>
<p>OpenSea's cessation of the Operator Filter reflects a shift in approach to NFT market dynamics. While the decision might disappoint some in the NFT community, the move aims to strike a balance between creator autonomy and the evolving landscape of NFT technology applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Trading-focused blockchain Sei&rsquo;s latest SEI token launch did not go over as well as expected after being plagued with delays and problems with the token giveaway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
SEI Token Drama
<p>The newly launched Sei blockchain Sei generated quite a buzz in the crypto space as its SEI token hit the market with a resounding start, quickly amassing a market capitalization of over $400 million within the first day of trading. Despite the promising start, a wave of discontent emerged on social media platforms regarding the much-anticipated airdrop of SEI tokens to early users and community members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Airdrops have become a common tactic for attracting users and bootstrapping liquidity, but they often encounter operational and legal complications. The SEI airdrop was no exception, facing issues such as difficulties in claiming tokens and uncertainties surrounding eligibility criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sei Labs intended to incentivize users from established platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain to migrate by offering SEI tokens upon "bridging" assets.</p>
Airdrop Discontent
<p>Trading activity for SEI surged, with a staggering $1.6 billion in trading volume over the next 24 hours. Leading exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken all joined the fray, listing SEI in conjunction with the blockchain's debut.</p>
<p>The situation led to confusion and frustration, as the initial announcement about the airdrop's launch did not align with the actual claim process. Early SEI adopters experienced delays, with some users unable to claim the promised tokens at the network's launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company behind the blockchain, Sei Labs, attempted to clarify the situation through an X post, mentioning that "airdrop rewards will be claimable following an initial warmup period," yet failing to provide a specific timeline. Only after the airdrop claim process had already been criticized by some as a "fiasco" did the functionality eventually open to users, underscoring the complexities inherent in crypto airdrops.</p>
Airdrop Challenges
<p>Sei's mainnet launch coincided with the announcement of an airdrop of the SEI token. In response to airdrop-related concerns, a spokesperson from the Sei Foundation explained that the airdrop was never officially tied to the mainnet launch and would be executed according to the Foundation's timeline. Despite community frustration, the Foundation encouraged patience and emphasized the need for partners and validators to ensure a smooth experience for Sei's mainnet beta launch.</p>
Foundation's Response
<p>The Sei Foundation addressed issues with its official Discord server, limiting channels to combat spam and fraudulent links arising from the excitement around the mainnet beta launch. Sei Labs allocated 40% of the circulating SEI supply to its team and private investors, while 48% is designated for ecosystem reserves, including the airdrop and other incentives. The remainder of the supply is divided between the SEI Foundation (9%) and Binance launchpool incentives (3%).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After a heavy crash on Thursday bitcoin bulls are still struggling to stop the king of the cryptocurrencies from falling further. Is this it, or is there more to go?</p>
A precipitous drop
<p>A palpable nervousness had beset the crypto market over the previous week. All eyes were on bitcoin as it continued to traverse down in its bull flag. Given the pattern, many were expecting the apex crypto to finally break out to the upside and confirm the bull market.</p>
<p>However, bears had other ideas.</p>
<p>Things really started getting serious on Thursday evening as bitcoin suddenly painted an hourly red candle to the downside, of a whopping 9.6%.</p>
<p>This reached the $25,000 price level where bulls were waiting in numbers to buy the asset back up. A wick back to $26,250 resulted - all in the space of the same hourly candle.</p>
A healthy correction
<p>Around 12 hours later and bitcoin is moving sideways, with the market waiting for the next direction to become apparent. Bitcoin is currently at a reasonable area of support at $26,500, which is just above the 0.786 Fibonacci level. The next very strong support below is at $24,250.</p>
<p>The upwards trendline has been broken and so has the 200-day moving average, both incredibly important supports if bitcoin is to maintain its bull momentum. However, the weekly candle does not close for another couple of days or so, giving bulls a chance to at least potentially regain the 200-day MA at $27,250.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, it does look like bitcoin just came to the bottom of a range it entered back in March of this year, with the bottom of the range at $25,000 and the top at $31,000.</p>
<p>So far, this looks like a healthy correction, given the incredible thrust upwards since the beginning of this year. Even if bitcoin were to go lower, $25,000 is a huge platform to sustain the price.&nbsp;</p>
Bull market still intact
<p>Some investors may have been cursing their luck at missing the giant step up out of the bear market. This correction, or even if bitcoin were to go back down to $25,000, would be great areas to start building a position.</p>
<p>If investors are still nervous, they only need to look at the other available asset options, all of which are tied into the monetary system. Even gold and silver are manipulated by the paper futures market.</p>
<p>Bitcoin may have corrected, but there is certainly no reason for panic. Phase 1 of the bull market is still very much intact, and phase 2 can potentially begin next year when bitcoin gets above the $31,000 level.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States Securities Commission (SEC) is all set to greenlight the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ether (ETH) futures in a big win for the crypto space.</p>
<p>Nearly a dozen companies have expressed interest and filed applications with the SEC to launch ETFs.</p>
Big Win For Crypto
<p>According to sources familiar with the matter, the regulator will not block or oppose products. This comes as a major relief to companies who have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Bitwise, Roundhill, ProShares, and Volatility Shares. However, it is still unclear which funds would receive the nod from the SEC. Officials and sources close to the matter have stated that approvals could come as early as October, but the SEC has yet to comment on the matter. Ether (ETH) is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain and is the world&rsquo;s second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, second only to Bitcoin.</p>
The SEC&rsquo;s Changing Stance
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly blocked previous attempts at an ETF based directly on a cryptocurrency. However, in late 2021, the regulator began permitting trading in a fund that involved Bitcoin futures contracts trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Since then, speculation has been growing that the Securities and Exchange Commission would allow a product with Ether futures which would also be traded on the exchange.</p>
<p>However, despite the buzz and excitement, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dragged its feet when it comes to approvals for a product that involves derivatives in Ether. Data from CoinGecko shows that ETH commands a market value of just under $200 billion, second only to Bitcoin, which has a market value of nearly $700 billion.</p>
Hope For Bitcoin ETFs?
<p>However, the Securities and Exchange Commission is still pushing back against Bitcoin-based ETFs and is locked in a tense standoff with the crypto industry on the matter. Grayscale Investments has already challenged the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s rejection of its application to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. A panel of US federal appellate court judges will be deciding on the matter soon.</p>
<p>On its part, the Securities and Exchange Commission has argued that the crypto space is fraught with several hazards. The regulator has repeatedly expressed concerns about price manipulation and insufficient liquidity when it comes to crypto. The regulator has also flagged Bitcoin&rsquo;s volatility as a threat, especially to newer investors. However, several firms, including BlackRock, have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list ETFs based on Bitcoin. BlackRock&rsquo;s filing had a considerable impact on the market, pushing the price of Bitcoin above $31,000. However, since then, the price has hovered around the $29,000 mark.</p>
Valkyrie&rsquo;s ETF Filing
<p>Asset management firm Valkyrie has also submitted an application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for an Ethereum (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund. The application signals the asset manager&rsquo;s intention to move beyond just offering Bitcoin futures ETFs. Valkyrie had filed the application on the 16th of August. The application stated that the ETF would not directly invest in ETH, purchasing ETH futures contracts instead.</p>
<p>The application also outlines a specific limit on the ETF&rsquo;s investment in ETH futures contracts. As per the application, the investments are capped at 8000 contracts per month. This has been done to comply with position limits set by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. If the Securities and Exchange Commission approves the application, investors will be able to speculate on ETH&rsquo;s future price movements via the ETF. Valkyrie also plans to invest in cash, cash-like instruments, or high-quality securities. These include government-issued bonds, bills, notes, money market funds, and corporate debt securities.</p>
<p>Valkyrie is one of several asset managers looking for approval for an Ether futures ETF. Others include VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, ProShares, Volatility Shares, and Round Hill Capital.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX has reportedly reduced the value of its Bitcoin by a whopping $373 million and has potentially liquidated all of its holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Elon Musk-led technology firm had announced in 2021 that it held some Bitcoin. Accounting rules state that once written down, the value cannot be adjusted upwards.&nbsp;</p>
Uncertainty Around Bitcoin Holdings&nbsp;
<p>According to a report published on the 17th of August, the Wall Street Journal stated that SpaceX had recorded $373 million worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet in 2021 and 2022. It has now reportedly sold the cryptocurrency in question. However, it is still not clear if the company has sold its entire $373 million stash. The Wall Street Journal stated in its report,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SpaceX wrote down the value of bitcoin it owns by a total of $373 million last year and in 2021 and has sold the cryptocurrency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The outlet reportedly viewed financial documents related to the firm&rsquo;s finances, showing expenses of around $5.2 billion for 2022. The documents also showed expenses of around $5.2 billion towards acquiring property and equipment and towards research and developmental costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Big Four Accounting Firm Deloitte, Bitcoin is typically considered an &ldquo;indefinite-lived intangible asset.&rdquo; It further adds that companies should account for Bitcoin at cost and then make adjustments should the price of the asset experience a notable decrease. If the value of Bitcoin declines, companies must declare a write-down in its books, which is also referred to as impairment charges. However, the asset&rsquo;s value cannot be written up after recording a decrease. This applies to all subsequent Bitcoin price increases or rebounds.</p>
Tesla&rsquo;s Revision Of Bitcoin Holdings&nbsp;
<p>Elon Musk had publicly announced that SpaceX had acquired crypto, Bitcoin in particular, in 2021. This announcement came after a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Tesla, another of Musk&rsquo;s companies, was planning to purchase $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. The announcement by Tesla had played a crucial role in Bitcoin hitting a then-all-time high price of $43,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, according to the company&rsquo;s second-quarter earnings report for 2023, Tesla had sold all except for $184 million worth of its Bitcoin holdings. Tesla confirmed that it had liquidated over 30,000 BTC in the second quarter of 2022, netting around $936 million. This figure represented around 75% of Tesla&rsquo;s original $1.5 billion worth of BTC holdings. However, since then, Tesla has held on to its remaining Bitcoin reserves, with the company continuing to do so in the second quarter of 2023 as well. This means the company has not purchased or sold Bitcoin for the fourth consecutive quarter, with the value of its assets holding steady at $185 million.&nbsp;</p>
Musk and Crypto&nbsp;
<p>Elon Musk is one of the richest individuals in the world and has often commented on the crypto space and cryptocurrencies. Musk seems particularly fond of Dogecoin (DOGE) and had briefly changed Twitter&rsquo;s iconic blue bird logo to the Shiba Inu of Dogecoin. Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion, later rebranding the company to X, and has suggested that the platform could offer an entire financial world to users, including payment and banking services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Musk and his companies may hold a considerable amount of Bitcoin, he has often reaffirmed that his favorite crypto remains Dogecoin. Musk has not given any reason for his admiration for Dogecoin, simply stating that &ldquo;it has the best humor, and it has dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not advising anyone to buy crypto or bet the farm on Dogecoin or anything like that.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The National Agency for Prospective Projects in Uzbekistan has granted two banks in the country to issue crypto cards. </p>
<p>Two banks in the Central Asia nation of Uzbekistan have obtained permission from the National Agency for Prospective Projects (NAPP) to issue crypto cards.</p>
Private Banks to Issue Crypto Cards Powered by Mastercard
<p>The NAPP reported on August 14 that it granted approval to two private banks in Uzbekistan &ndash; Kapital Bank and Ravnaq Bank &ndash; to issue cryptocurrency cards and take part in the NAPP&rsquo;s digital sandbox of crypto regulation. The announcement reported Ravnaq Bank had just received approval, but Kapital had already received its approval in May.</p>
<p>The two private Uzbeki banks will issue UzNEX cards and will be supported by payment giants Mastercard. The UzNEX cards will integrate a bank account with access to a crypto exchange and automated exchange mechanism, Cointelegraph reports.</p>
<p>Kapital Bank and Ravnaq Bank are two of the three registered participants in the Uzbeki national sandbox, the NAPP reports. The third participant is &ldquo;UZINFOCOM,&rdquo; a &ldquo;single integrator for the creation and support of state information systems,&rdquo; which will implement &ldquo;NFT certificates based on distributed data registry technology (&ldquo;blockchain&rdquo;) for names in the &ldquo;.UZ&rdquo; domain zone.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The deadline for final customer rollouts of both institutions&rsquo; cards expires in December 2023.</p>
Uzbekistan Restricts Provision of Crypto Services to Licensed Firms
<p>The government of the Republic of Uzbekistan initially granted licenses to local crypto firms in November 2022, according to the NAPP. But from 2023, it has restricted crypto service provision to licensed crypto firms.</p>
<p>Before providing clarity regarding crypto service provision, the Uzbeki government restricted access to several international cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Huobi, and the now-collapsed FTX, after accusing them of conducting unlicensed activities.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan introduced its regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in early 2022 by presidential decree and launched the NAPP to oversee the industry.</p>
<p>The government of Uzbekistan started its crackdown on the crypto industry in October 2021 after it identified over half a dozen crypto exchanges operating illegally.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, Visa announced its trial of Ethereum (ETH) gas payments via cards, marking a significant milestone toward mainstream crypto adoption. Additionally, the popularity of projects like Pomerdoge (POMD) and its presale has further illustrated the appeal of innovative crypto projects. Today, we will take a closer look at both of these developments. </p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Price Rises After Visa Announcement 
<p>The global payment company Visa has been developing an experimental method that enables on-chain Ethereum (ETH) gas prices to be paid using credit cards. The fintech startup claims that the testing for this solution is now complete, allowing customers to use credit or debit cards to pay the gas cost with fiat on Ethereum directly. </p>
<p>The ease of use and convenience offered by this approach has the potential to make Ethereum transactions more accessible to a broader audience. As a result, the Ethereum price soared by 1.2% over the past seven days.</p>
<p>This bullish trend has continued as the Ethereum value now sits at $1,849.67 with a market cap of $222B, a rise of 0.18% overnight. Furthermore, the technical analysis of Ethereum paints a bullish picture. In other words, its moving averages and technical indicators show buy signals. Therefore, experts forecast a jump to $2,335.71 by December 2023.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD): Stellar Presale Performance
<p>While traditional financial players are making strides in crypto adoption with Ethereum, innovative blockchain projects are also making waves. Pomerdoge (POMD), an exciting play-to-earn gaming project, has captured mass appeal with its presale, providing early birds with a 14% ROI.</p>
Exploring The Pomerdoge (POMD) Success
<p>At the heart of Pomerdoge is the opportunity to build and nurture your Pomer character. As you progress through the game, your Pomer character evolves and grows to elite levels, reflecting your skill and dedication. To clarify, this unique feature adds an element of personalization and ownership that resonates with the core principles of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Pomerdoge 7,777 NFT collection is another rare and exciting component. Each NFT within this limited edition collection holds the promise of something extraordinary, but the full extent of its benefits remains tantalizingly undisclosed until closer to the launch. What we do know is that only POMD holders will gain access to it, and each NFT will be worth 0.2 ETH.</p>
The Allure of POMD Tokens
<p>POMD tokens fuel the play-to-earn mechanics, allowing players to engage with the game and reap the rewards. Currently, the POMD token is valued at just $0.008 as it is in Phase One of its presale. However, millions of tokens have been sold already, so demand is high. In fact, some experts even foresee a 20x surge for it before its presale concludes.</p>
<p>Considering its low market cap of $14M and ties to an online game industry with 3B players, Pomerdoge could see the same growth as Ethereum did. If you wish to purchase this token and participate in weekly giveaways totaling $150,000 - sign up below. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Pushing the possibility of artificial intelligence (AI), tools like Google Bard are now being used for market analysis and predictions. With very high accuracy, these tools are growing in relevancy. Today, Google Bard has stirred excitement in the crypto space, after bullish predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB), ApeCoin (APE), and Everlodge (ELDG).</p>
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Summary
● Shiba Inu is forming a golden cross and can rally by as much as 50%
● With an expansion of the APE ecosystem, the price of ApeCoin could rally to $2.5
● Experts predict up to 20x rally as Everlodge allows everyone to invest in real estate
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts a Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rally
<p class="s5">Over the last eight weeks, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been steadily increasing, finally reclaiming the $0.00001000 support last week. Google Bard has predicted that the rally for the Shiba Inu coin will continue, citing three major reasons.</p>
<p class="s5">The first reason according to Bard is the launch of Shibarium. The layer 2 network is set to launch this week and add more utility to Shiba Inu. Next, Google Bard highlights the increasing Shiba Inu burn. By reducing the number of SHIB, it predicts an increase in the Shiba Inu price.</p>
<p class="s5">Lastly, SHIB is approaching a golden cross after printing six consecutive weeks of bullish candles. If this holds up, Google Bard has predicted that the price of Shiba Inu could rally by 50% and trade as high as $0.00001510.</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts an ApeCoin (APE) Rally
<p class="s5">The AI chatbot has highlighted several reasons why the ApeCoin price could increase in the coming days. According to the AI chatbot, ApeCoin (APE) first is part of the biggest non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem, ensuring its success.</p>
<p class="s5">Also, the ecosystem is about to witness a significant expansion, which could also help the Apecoin value increase. Lastly, APE has been decoupling from the price of Bitcoin, which hints at a major price outbreak.</p>
<p class="s5">At the time of this writing, the price of Apecoin stands at $2.01. With the current projections, ApeCoin could reach highs of $2.5 by the end of August.</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts an Everlodge (ELDG) Rally
<p class="s5">Everlodge (ELDG) is another project that has attracted strong bullish predictions from Google Bard. The project is disrupting the timeshare sector by introducing a hybrid property co-ownership model, allowing millions of new investors to participate with as little as $100.</p>
<p class="s5">Google Bard is bullish about Everlodge as the project debuts as a one-of-a-kind initiative in the $280 trillion global real estate industry. Also, the project&rsquo;s partnerships with well-known hotel brands and luxury real estate developers would drive the price higher.</p>
<p class="s5">Lastly, Everlodge's growth will be ensured by the project's broad ecosystem and customer-friendly benefits. At the time of this writing, Everlodge is in its beta presale stage and sells for $0.01.</p>
<p class="s5">Based on Google Bard&rsquo;s predictions, investors can expect a 20x price surge for Everloge in 2023 as the token has been given a yearly high of $0.20 per token.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, three cryptocurrencies have been catching the eye of traders - Stellar (XLM), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Everlodge (ELDG). While the crypto market is a dynamic and ever-expanding landscape, these cryptocurrencies stand out with their unique features and potential for substantial growth. Let&rsquo;s examine these three projects further and find out what makes them so appealing. </p>
Summary
- Stellar partners up with Bitso, causing a price increase
- Dogecoin shows green monthly charts
- Everlodge to bring outstanding returns for early buyers
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Stellar (XLM): Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments
<p>Stellar (XLM) is hailed as one of the frontrunners in the blockchain industry when it comes to facilitating cross-border transactions. Designed to bridge traditional financial systems with decentralized networks, Stellar&rsquo;s mission is to make money more fluid and accessible globally. </p>
<p>Additionally, Stellar&rsquo;s partnerships with established financial institutions bolster its credibility.</p>
<p>Recently, Bitso announced its partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation. This partnership aims to improve communication between the world stage and the Latin American crypto ecosystem. As a result, interest in the Stellar crypto rose as its trading volume jumped by 3% overnight, reaching $75,597,416. </p>
<p>Currently, one Stellar token costs $0.1339. In the past week, it achieved a peak of $0.1450. But,the technical indicators for Stellar are all showing strong buy signals. Therefore, experts remain bullish about it. Consequently, they predict a jump to $0.17 for Stellar by December 2023. </p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): From Meme to Market Resilience
<p>The Dogecoin (DOGE) journey from being a playful meme to a resilient cryptocurrency is a testament to its enduring popularity. Despite its lighthearted origins, Dogecoin has carved out a significant place in the crypto market. Consequently, gaining attention from high-profile individuals and capturing the mainstream spotlight.</p>
<p>This attention was displayed on the Dogecoin price charts as well. Most notably, the Dogecoin value soared by 4% in the past month alone. Moreover, its trading volume surged by 11.11% overnight, jumping to $318,640,213. One Dogecoin costs $0.0737 with a market cap of $10.3B. </p>
<p>While its price may experience fluctuations, its strong community engagement and potential for broader adoption continue to make it an attractive choice for investors. Due to all these reasons, bullish experts predict Dogecoin skyrocketing to $0.098 by this year&rsquo;s end. </p>
Everlodge (ELDG): Transforming Real Estate Investment
<p>While Stellar and Dogecoin are tokens worth watching, one project may outshine them - Everlodge (ELDG). With a predicted 20% pump coming in August, this upcoming property marketplace is breaking new ground by merging real estate and blockchain technology through fractional ownership and NFTs.</p>
<p>This innovative approach allows investors to gain exposure to many real estate assets that were previously out of reach. In other words, you can become a fractional owner of a luxurious home on the blockchain for prices as low as $100. Everlodge accomplishes this by minting NFTs representing high-end villas, homes, and properties and then fractionalizing them. </p>
<p>Due to this investment method, Everlodge provides greater property ownership transparency, security, and immutability. Not only that, NFTs enable unique and customizable ownership experiences, as owners can trade their NFTs on Everlodge&rsquo;s secondary marketplace or any third-party ERC20-compatible marketplace.</p>
<p>Holding the ELDG native token is crucial to obtaining discounts on trading fees, free nightly stays in properties, or staking rewards. One token costs only $0.01 since it is in Stage 1 of its presale. What separates ELDG from Stellar and Dogecoin is its low market cap, which means it can surge much faster. Thus, analysts forecast a 280% rise before its presale ends.</p>

Not only that, NFTs enable unique and customizable ownership experiences, as owners can trade their NFTs on Everlodge&rsquo;s secondary marketplace or any third-party ERC20-compatible marketplace.</p>
<p>Holding the ELDG native token is crucial to obtaining discounts on trading fees, free nightly stays in properties, or staking rewards. One token costs only $0.01 since it is in Stage 1 of its presale. What separates ELDG from Stellar and Dogecoin is its low market cap, which means it can surge much faster. Thus, analysts forecast a 280% rise before its presale ends.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In this market analysis, we'll delve into the movements of three intriguing cryptocurrencies: XRP (XRP), Tron (TRX), and Pomerdoge (POMD). Market analysis is important since trends can shift daily in the cryptocurrency market. Thus, traders and enthusiasts alike must keep a keen eye on the performance of various tokens.</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
XRP (XRP): Navigating the Waves
<p>XRP (XRP) has been navigating waves in the market. Recent weeks have seen the XRP price experiencing turbulence, with a 10.8% decline over the past 14 days. </p>
<p>However, XRP has shown green charts again as it trades hands at $0.6306 with a market cap of $33.2B, up 0.70% overnight. This came as a result of the recent XRP listing on Gemini. </p>
<p>Despite this minuscule rise, the XRP coin trading volume has plummeted by 40.78% daily, sinking to $1,022,725,535. Moreover, its moving averages and technical indicators show strong sell signals. Therefore, many experts foresee a short-term price drop for XRP, prompting buyers to sidestep this token.</p>
Tron (TRX): Showing Increased Volatility
<p>Tron (TRX) has been facing challenges recently. In fact, over the past two weeks, the Tron price has dropped by 7.2%. Since it was rejected by the range high on July 22, the Tron coin value has been fluctuating between $0.070 and $0.088.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tron recently breached a short-term ascending support line, further indicating the possibility of a negative trend. Tron has a value of $0.07725 with a market cap of $6.9B, up 0.39% in the past day alone. </p>
<p>But, the trading volume of Tron has taken a 10.41% dip during that time, sinking to $154,358,626. Its technical indicators also paint a bearish outlook as they are all in the red. Thus, market analysts foresee a drop to its support level of $0.066 for Tron soon. </p>
Pomerdoge (POMD): Unleashing Gaming Potential
<p>Amid XRP's and Tron's ups and downs, a new player has emerged on the scene with an intriguing ecosystem - Pomerdoge (POMD). This cryptocurrency introduces a gaming-focused approach, aiming to connect players globally through a play-to-earn model. In fact, with over 3B individuals playing online games, Pomerdoge taps into a flourishing market.</p>
Closer Look at the Pomergame
<p>The main appeal for gamers will lie in the Pomergame - a unique P2E crypto game where users can earn rewards just by playing it. Not only that, the Pomerplace marketplace is another exciting component of Pomerdoge. This innovative platform is a bustling hub where players gather to engage in many activities.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Pomerplace is a marketplace that opens doors to a universe of possibilities. Here, you can buy, sell, and trade the valuable items you've skillfully collected throughout your Pomerdoge journey, adding a tangible dimension to your virtual conquests.</p>
What Makes the POMD Native Token So Alluring?
<p>Buyers are flooding the Pomerdoge presale looking to obtain the POMD native token for an affordable price. One POMD token is worth $0.008, and those who bought it early enjoy a 14% ROI. Also, experts have taken notice of POMD's $14M market cap. In other words, when compared to XRP and Tron, POMD will skyrocket much quicker.</p>
<p>Those who purchase it now will gain access to an exclusive 7,777 NFT collection created by Pomerdoge. Each NFT will cost 0.2 ETH and provide holders with unique perks. In addition, early birds will also participate in weekly giveaways totaling $150,000. Therefore, do not miss out on this potential blue-chip token projected to surge by 20x before its presale ends.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Polygon Labs has partnered with Korean telecommunications company SK Telecom to develop a complete Web3 ecosystem.</p>
Enhancing Web3 Ecosystem with Polygon Integration
<p>International software development company Polygon Labs has announced a strategic collaboration with Korean mobile giant SK Telecom (SKT) to develop a robust Web3 ecosystem. The agreement signing ceremony took place at SKT's headquarters in Seoul, with Oh Se-hyun, Vice President and Head of Web3 CO of SKT, and Polygon Labs' CEO Marc Boiron in attendance.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, SKT will integrate support for the Polygon blockchain into its NFT marketplace TopPort and upcoming Web3 wallet.&nbsp;</p>
Polygon&rsquo;s Web3 Advancement
<p>The partnership between Polygon Labs and SKT will enable users to avail of faster and more cost-efficient transactions while leveraging the security and decentralization of Ethereum.</p>
<p>Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron emphasized the significance of this collaboration, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Polygon Labs has been developing optimal blockchain technology for Web3 popularization, and we see this collaboration with SKT as an important step in providing Web3 experiences to more consumers."</p>

<p>The Polygon Labs team had previously revealed its plans to establish multiple layer-2 networks on the Polygon blockchain as an integral component of their Polygon 2.0 roadmap.&nbsp;</p>
TopPort and Web3 Wallet Integration
<p>SKT had launched its NFT marketplace, TopPort, in 2022. The new partnership will also come in handy for the marketplace, as it will expand its capabilities. Creators would be able to mint Polygon-based NFTs on TopPort, making it compatible and scalable with other NFT platforms on the Polygon ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SK Telecom is also scheduled to drop its Web3 wallet in the second half of 2023. The partnership with Polygon Labs will integrate the latter&rsquo;s excellent network support and NFT trading facilities into the wallet for a seamless adoption of Web3 technologies by SKT users.&nbsp;</p>
Fostering Web3 Startups and Ecosystem Growth
<p>The collaboration extends beyond technical integration. Both companies will work together to identify promising Web3 startups and provide incubation support. Polygon Labs plans to explore potential investments in Web3 startups recommended by SKT through its subsidiary, Polygon Ventures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the partnership aims to facilitate the entry of competitive Web3 startups into the global market and introduce leading decentralized apps (dApps) from around the world into the Korean market.</p>
<p>Oh Se-hyun, Vice President and Head of Web3 CO at SKT highlighted the potential of the collaboration, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"By combining our experience in blockchain services and Polygon Lab's blockchain infrastructure and ecosystem, we will be able to create valuable business opportunities and boost the Web3 ecosystem."</p>
