Bitcoin (BTC) may give more stacks to MicroStrategy soon; the token trades at $29,019.48
<p class="s7">Bitcoin (BTC) has one of the biggest user bases as it's the first crypto coin to exist. Many of the Bitcoin (BTC) buyers are well-known personalities. One of them is MicroStrategy. He is a top software developer. Recently, he started showing interest in staking Bitcoin (BTC) again.</p>
<p class="s7">He has been a consistent buyer of Bitcoin (BTC) stakes for the last few years. However, he is planning to sell his Bitcoin (BTC) stake to raise up to $750 million. Further, he intends to buy more tokens with the money.</p>
<p class="s7">This announcement surfaced in one of the SEC's filings. As per information, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a price increase after the news surfaced, crossing $29,000.</p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,019.48, a 0.57% drop in a day. Experts forecast the token price to reach $30,786 by August this year.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) has a new upgrade in its list as the token trades at $1,835.52
<p class="s7">The Ethereum (ETH) community seeks better security and scalability. Hence, the platform's new upgrade, Dencun, can be a boon for Ethereum (ETH) users. Dencun stands for Deneb and Cancun.</p>
<p class="s7">As per the details, Dencum will operate on Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL). However, Cancun will operate on Ethereum Execution Layer (EL). According to Ethereum (ETH) developers, Cancun includes 5 EIPs. These EIPs will lower the Ethereum (ETH) fee and boost data storage.</p>
<p class="s7">The Dencum will launch by the end of this year. Though the date isn't fixed for launch, researchers say October will be the best time.</p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) developers prefer a standard contract for the upgrade. Furthermore, they will also plan a deployment scheme. Community members are expecting a price rise for Ethereum (ETH) tokens.</p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Ethereum (ETH) token is trading at $1,835.52, a 0.42% rise in a day. Experts predict the ETH token to drop to $1,607 in upcoming months.</p>
