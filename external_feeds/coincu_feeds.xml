<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>North Korean hackers launder $35M stolen from Atomic Wallet through Russian crypto exchange Garantex and obfuscate the funds through Sinbad.io mixer; OFAC-sanctioned Garantex complicit in illicit transactions.</em></li>



<li><em>Blockchain security firm Elliptic collaborates with exchanges to freeze stolen crypto, but Lazarus Group still finds ways to trade assets for Bitcoin.</em></li>



<li><em>Analysis reveals Garantex transactions associated with illicit actors and darknet markets, while Blender.io (the former iteration of Sinbad.io) is sanctioned for supporting North Korea&#8217;s malicious cyber activities and money-laundering of stolen virtual currency.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>This is not the end of the story. In fact, Elliptic said that there had been a significant and successful cross-community effort between Elliptic and many exchange partners to freeze the stolen crypto. However, Lazarus has now found new ways to trade their assets for Bitcoin. This means that the funds are still at large and there is a risk of them being used for further illegal activities.</p>



<p>The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Garantex and the Russian Hydra dark web marketplace in April 2022. This was a significant move in the fight against money laundering and illegal cryptocurrency activities. Garantex was founded in late 2019 and originally registered in Estonia before moving the majority of its operations to Moscow, the Treasury Department noted at the time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After a significant and successful cross-community effort between <a href="https://twitter.com/elliptic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@elliptic</a>, many of our exchange partners and friends to freeze stolen <a href="https://twitter.com/AtomicWallet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@AtomicWallet</a> funds, Lazarus have now turned to OFAC-sanctioned Exchange, Garantex, to trade their assets for BTC&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/5Lk9DeGjr8" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/5Lk9DeGjr8</a></p>&mdash; Elliptic Investigations (@Elliptic_Inv) <a href="https://twitter.com/Elliptic_Inv/status/1668338875243085824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 12, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In addition, the Treasury Department reported that &#8220;analysis of known Garantex transactions shows that over $100 million in transactions are associated with illicit actors and darknet markets.&#8221; This highlights the extent of the problem and the need for more stringent measures.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">

<p>The Treasury Department also sanctioned <a href="http://blender.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blender.io</a> (the former iteration of <a href="http://sinbad.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinbad.io</a>) in May 2022, warning that the service was being used by North Korea to &#8220;support its malicious cyber activities and money-laundering of stolen virtual currency.&#8221; This further highlights the importance of cracking down on these services and those who use them.</p>



<p>On June 3, a number of Atomic Wallet user accounts were compromised, resulting in losses of up to $35 million in digital assets. Five days later, Atomic stated that it had engaged blockchain security and analyst company Chainalysis as the leading incident investigator. This is a positive step towards greater security and accountability in the crypto industry.</p>

<p>The notorious North Korean hacking collective has been linked to several major crypto exploits in the past year, including the Harmony Bridge hack and the Ronin Bridge hack. This shows the need for greater awareness and preparedness in the crypto community against these threats.</p>

To alternate statistics, the Fear-Greed Sentiment Index, which had 47 points on June 12, suggestive according to neutral, had 45 points on June 13, showing crypto market fear. The Fear &amp; Greed Index indicates that the market sentiment is closer to extreme fear as it approaches 0, and as it approaches 100, it means too greedy.</p>



<p>This is close to the 44 points stated when the SEC launched a series of cases against Binance and Coinbase on June 5 and 6.</p>

<p>The crypto market took notice. According to CoinMarketCap, four of the top ten most valued cryptocurrencies lost at least 20% of their value last week due to SEC cases.</p>



<p>The market&#8217;s worry was also reflected in the market price. According to the industry, the overall coin market capitalization dropped by $44.8 billion on June 10 alone. Among them, the market value of cryptocurrencies outside Bitcoin, such as Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL), declined by $35.3 billion, accounting for more than 80% of the entire market cap loss.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Korean digital asset management platform Haru Invest is suspected of shutting down its offices after suspending deposits and withdrawals.</em></li>



<li><em>According to information from the building staff, they have closed the office and left.</em></li>



<li><em>This morning, Haru announced that the platform is experiencing issues with its service partners and is under investigation. Looks like it was hacked</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a source from <a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=2959" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Asset</a>, the digital asset management platform Haru Invest Korea (referred to as Haru Invest) has officially closed its office after issuing a notice to suspend deposits and withdrawals.</strong></h5>

<p>On June 13, I visited the building where Haru Invest and its parent company Block Crafters moved in and inspected it. It appears they have closed the office and left. Block Crafters is located on the 17th floor of Daeryung Gangnam Tower in Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, and Haru Invest is on the 18th floor.</p>



<p>A cleaning worker in charge of the 17th and 18th floors said: &#8220;This morning, Block Crafters people returned the company keys and hurriedly left.&#8221;</p>



<p>This person also explained, &#8220;Until this morning, the company has not stopped working and is operating normally.&#8221;</p>



<p>Haru Invest has also deleted announcements and blogs such as Medium, LinkedIn, and Instagram, and the Twitter account has not been canceled. Additionally, Haru Invest co-founder and former CTO (jooddang.eth) tweeted that the closing of Haru Invest&#8217;s social media accounts may have been done in some internal situation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>It was recently shared that Haru is currently running a reset protocol and not rugpull. Their marketing team member was hacked, and Haru&#8217;s social media channels were down, but their Twitter is now back up.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Earlier today, the platform announced in an announcement that the platform is experiencing issues with its service partners. It is continuing to investigate the matter and look for contingency plans to remedy the situation. From 8:40 on June 13, all deposit and withdrawal requests will be paused until further notice to protect users&#8217; escrow assets.</p>

<p>The case is still evolving, and Haru Invest has yet to issue any statement regarding the hack.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>In response to the SEC complaint, Binance filed multiple motions in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC filed 13 accusations against Binance, Binance.US, and CZ last week, alleging he violated US securities laws.</em></li>



<li><em>According to Binance&#8217;s attorneys, the company has been in contact with the SEC since 2021.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Monday, <strong>Binance</strong> filed multiple papers in the US District Court for the District of Columbia in response to the action launched by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by volume.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The SEC said in the exchange&#8217;s complaint last week that the giant exchange Binance, its CEO Changpeng &#8216;CZ&#8217; Zhao, and Binance.US violated securities laws and enriched themselves by billions of dollars while putting investors&#8217; funds in danger. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194533-the-sec-receives-no-positive-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The SEC</a> further claims that Zhao and his company participated in a &#8220;web of deception&#8221; that included conflicts of interest, failure to disclose, and intentional evasion of the law.</p>



<p>Daniel W. Nelson, the legal representative of Binance, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.43.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> in a submission co-signed by various attorneys of the exchange:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The SEC’s request for a temporary restraining order should be denied for several reasons, but the most important is this: there is no risk to BAM’s customer assets. Indeed, there is no ‘emergency’ here at all, other than the one manufactured by the SEC for its own purposes, when the alleged securities law violations, according to the SEC, have been going on publicly and openly for years.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>BAM Trading Services is the company behind Binance.US. According to the SEC, it is mostly held by BAM Management US Holdings, which is majority controlled by CZ.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-940-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-940-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Responds Strongly To SEC Charges With Over 20 Motions" class="wp-image-194575" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-940-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-940-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-940-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-940-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-940-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-940-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-940.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Responds Strongly To SEC Charges With Over 20 Motions 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>Binance&#8217;s attorneys questioned the timing of the SEC&#8217;s accusations, which coincided with a lawsuit against Coinbase, the biggest cryptocurrency in the United States, in more than 20 motions and declarations filed with the court.</p>



<p>According to the company&#8217;s legal team, the SEC ignored a basic security concern: whether this conduct was lawfully allowed by the commission since Chairman <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194473-house-republicans-to-fire-sec-chair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Gensler </a>had personal meetings with Zhao and the exchange throughout the period in question.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s lawyers&#8217; state in the filings that the company has been in contact with the SEC since 2021. Even still, it wasn&#8217;t until February 2023 that they discovered they were probable targets of an inquiry into the Binance.US exchange.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>On June 5 and 6, the SEC launched substantial litigation against Binance, the world&#8217;s biggest digital currency exchange, and Coinbase, the largest US-based exchange. While Gary Gensler has not been hesitant to issue enforcement actions against crypto companies, particularly following the collapse of FTX, these suits represent a significant new step in the SEC&#8217;s battle against crypto as well as its continued abdication of regulatory responsibility over the crypto landscape.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As alleged, Zhao and Binance misled investors about their risk controls and corrupted trading volumes while actively concealing who was operating the platform, the manipulative trading of its affiliated market maker, and even where and with whom investor funds and crypto assets were custodied. They attempted to evade U.S. securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded behind the scenes so that they could keep high-value U.S. customers on their platforms. The public should beware of investing any of their hard-earned assets with or on these unlawful platforms,” Gensler said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler confirmed to institutional investors in 2018 that BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH are not securities.</em></li>



<li><em>The comments come at a time when the cryptocurrency is in the midst of a bull market and more than two years before Gensler was appointed SEC chair.</em></li>



<li><em>Cryptocurrency lawyers said that this statement by Gary Gensler was only at the time, so it did not affect the current legal actions of the SEC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Forbes, a new video shows <a href="https://news.coincu.com/193985-sec-satoshi-nakamoto-to-court-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Gensler</a>, Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), telling institutional investors in 2018 that BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH are not  securities and 75% of the overall crypto market at the time was outside that legal category.</strong></h5>

<p>The comments come at a time when the cryptocurrency is in the midst of a bull market and more than two years before Gensler was appointed SEC chair. The video, from a crypto-themed institutional investor event hosted by Bloomberg and Fidelity in 2018, shows Gensler expressing a view that seems to contradict his recent statements that he currently believes that Bitcoin All cryptocurrencies other than cryptocurrencies are securities.</p>



<p>The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment about any potential conflicts between Gensler&#8217;s 2018 comments and the agency&#8217;s current legal position.</p>



<p>Prior to that, other videos from Gensler&#8217;s time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) also appeared, showing him saying that Ethereum is not a security. The video is arguably more important as it shows the current SEC chairman providing guidance to hedge funds and other investors on the regulatory state of the crypto market.</p>



<p>The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on any potential conflicts between Gensler&#8217;s 2018 comments and the agency&#8217;s current legal position.</p>

<p>However, these comments may anger the crypto industry and many crypto owners, who argue that Gensler did not provide guidance on the legality of specific tokens before embarked on what many describe as a &#8220;strategy of law enforcement.&#8221;</p>



<p>This could be a sensitive time for the SEC chairman as he is under fire from crypto fans due to strong legal actions against the two largest service providers in the market. are Binance and Coinbase. In addition, a pair of Republicans in the House of Representatives presented legislation to<a href="https://news.coincu.com/194473-house-republicans-to-fire-sec-chair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> remove</a> the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Republicans object to Gensler’s &#8220;long series of abuses that have been permitted under the current SEC structure.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC has put forward a proposal to modify the definition of exchanges, which would encompass platforms trading in both crypto asset securities and certain DeFi platforms. </em></li>



<li><em>In April, the SEC declared its intention to reopen the exchange&#8217;s definition comment period, following its decision to broaden the scope to include crypto and DeFi.</em></li>



<li><em>The agency has not received any favorable comments during the comment period. </em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The SEC polled on an offer to make bigger the definition of an alternate to DeFi companies in April however has now no longer obtained a positive reaction. The remark duration will quit on June 13.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-1024x682.jpg" alt="The SEC Receives No Positive Reaction With New DeFi Proposal" class="wp-image-194561" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-750x500.jpg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/15806_sec_722547.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The SEC Receives No Positive Reaction With New DeFi Proposal 25"></a></figure></div>


<p>The SEC first proposed an accelerated definition of what qualifies as an alternate again in January 2022. It claimed at the time that this changed into decorating transparency and oversight over Alternative Trading Systems (ATS). The SEC described ATS as entities that exchange Treasuries and different authorities&#8217; securities below the regulatory umbrella.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The reopening release reiterated the applicability of existing rules to platforms that trade crypto asset securities, including so-called ‘DeFi’ systems, and provides supplemental information and economic analysis for systems that would be included in the new, proposed exchange definition,” the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-77" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> in a press launch.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The upshot of this technological reality is that holding DeFi protocols to the requirements of the regulatory regimes governing national securities exchanges and ATSs would result in their de facto expatriation from the United States. DeFi is rapidly gaining trading market share in crypto assets, especially after recent and high-profile fraud and compliance issues at leading centralized and intermediated non-U.S. crypto asset exchanges,” according to the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) <a href="https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_f997b07bbb6d43b8a3b6c0626f57cdf3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaction letter</a>.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="982" height="220" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935.png" alt="The SEC Receives No Positive Reaction With New DeFi Proposal" class="wp-image-194562" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935.png 982w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935-300x67.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935-768x172.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-935-750x168.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" title="The SEC Receives No Positive Reaction With New DeFi Proposal 26"></a></figure></div>


<p>DEF said that the SEC’s thought fails to perceive opportunity regulatory techniques and does now no longer provide a complete, cogent, or defensible qualitative or quantitative cost-advantage evaluation. The agency has now no longer accurately considered DeFi’s function within the broader crypto marketplace.</p>



<p>On behalf of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain, Tavonia Evans stated that not all decentralized exchanges (DEXs) involve the trading of cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. Some DEXs primarily focus on the trading of cryptocurrencies, which may include stablecoins. However, the proposed rule lacks clear guidelines on how it would apply to DEXs that do not facilitate crypto-to-fiat transactions. Therefore, she urged the SEC to provide explicit guidance on this issue to ensure that such DEXs can operate within the regulatory framework.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936.png" alt="image 936" class="wp-image-194563" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-936-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The SEC Receives No Positive Reaction With New DeFi Proposal 27"></a></figure></div>


<p>Paradigm also <a href="https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_f997b07bbb6d43b8a3b6c0626f57cdf3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized</a> the SEC&#8217;s proposal, arguing that the Commission would be presenting a &#8220;Hobson&#8217;s choice&#8221; similar to what it did with Coinbase if it proceeds to regulate DEXs. Additionally, Paradigm deemed the SEC&#8217;s approach to the proposal as &#8220;haphazard.&#8221;</p>



<p>The SEC representatives have contended that the suggested explanation would encompass multiple cryptocurrency enterprises.</p>



<p>SEC chair Gary Gensler stated that several digital currency trading platforms are already considered to be exchanges based on the current definition and must adhere to the regulations governing securities. It is essential that individuals investing in the digital currency market are afforded the same established protections offered by securities laws in other markets, according to him.</p>

<p>Polygon Labs has recently announced its vision to build the Value Layer of the internet through the proposed set of upgrades, Polygon 2.0. With the aim to democratize access to the global economy, Polygon 2.0 will enable decentralized finance, digital ownership, and new mechanisms for coordination. The upgrades are set to reimagine almost every aspect of Polygon, ranging from protocol architecture to tokenomics to governance.</p>

<p>The Polygon team plans to detail each component of Polygon 2.0 over the coming weeks through a series of informative blog posts, community meets, and AMAs with the founders and engineers. Polygon 2.0 will become the Value Layer of the internet, offering unlimited scalability and unified liquidity through ZK technology. The network will consist of ZK-powered L2 chains unified via a novel cross-chain coordination protocol, making the entire network feel like using a single chain. Furthermore, cross-chain interactions can happen safely and instantly without additional security or trust assumptions.</p>



<p>Polygon 2.0 aims to expand Ethereum to become what it was always intended to be, a Value Layer that looks and acts like the rest of the internet. This will be achieved by supporting a practically unlimited number of chains while maintaining unified liquidity. Individual blockchains are not infinitely scalable, and adding capacity by creating new chains fragments liquidity and reduces security and capital efficiency.</p>

<p>The team at Polygon Labs plans to delve into topics like the future of the Polygon PoS chain, the utility and evolution of the Polygon token, and the transition to greater community governance of the protocol and treasury over the coming weeks. This will provide the Polygon community with a clear roadmap for how Polygon will become the Value Layer of the internet.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Novatti Group Ltd has added XRP Ledger support for its Australian dollar-backed stablecoin AUDD.</em></li>



<li><em>The stablecoin is intended to be used in applications such as remittance, payment gateway, trading pair, and stablecoin-as-a-service.</em></li>



<li><em>Novatti has also recently taken part in a study effort aiming at investigating the applications and advantages of CBDC in Australia.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to an <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/the-next-evolution-in-global-payments-novatti-brings-stablecoins-to-the-australian-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, Novatti Group Ltd, an Australian payments fintech, has extended its Australian dollar-backed stablecoin AUDD to XRP Ledger.</strong></h5>

<p>The AUDD, which was originally published on the Stellar blockchain in November 2022, will be accessible for a direct 1:1 exchange of fiat Australian Dollars through the XRPL. Transactions on the XRPL are both quick (3-5 seconds per transaction) and cheap (fractions of a penny per transaction), making it perfect for the scalability of stablecoins and asset tokenization.</p>



<p>Users may now use AUDD to make payments and trade with other XRPL-based tokens as a result of the extension. Because of the AUDD&#8217;s capabilities on the XRPL, people all over the globe may use it to make payments and trade with other XRP-based tokens through the native decentralized exchange (DEX). According to the company, users will be able to access AUDD using any XRPL-enabled wallet.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Novatti is excited to continue the journey in bringing our stablecoin roadmap to life with the goal to provide faster, more secure payments with lower friction costs to consumers. By deploying AUDD on the XRP Ledger, we will be able to capture the growing demand for digital currencies and create new revenue streams for our business, while delivering on our promise to make our solution available to multiple networks,” Peter Cook, CEO of Novatti Group said in the statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Novatti is incorporating AUDD into its current payment suite. According to the company, the stablecoin is intended to fulfill use cases such as remittance, payment gateway, trading pair, and stablecoin-as-a-service.</p>



<p>This latest deployment cements Novatti&#8217;s success in employing the XRPL&#8217;s native digital currency, XRP, for cross-border transactions.</p>

<p>Novatti used Ripple&#8217;s payments solution, which uses XRP as a bridge currency between two fiat currencies, for cross-border remittances between Australia and the Philippines in April 2021.</p>



<p>Novatti&#8217;s involvement in the RBA and Digital Finance CRC&#8217;s CBDC project, which investigates the use cases for a central bank digital currency in Australia, has contributed to the rising momentum of stablecoin adoption.</p>

<p>Novatti has been able to extend its company into 58 countries and handle billions of dollars in yearly transaction value after using <a href="https://news.coincu.com/137073-ripple-gives-fund-to-support-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a>&#8216;s payments technology. AUDD is also being incorporated into Novatti&#8217;s current suite of payment products, where it will be used for remittance, payment gateway, trading pair, and Stablecoin-as-a-Service.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/etoro-ending-us-customers-access-to-four-cryptocurrencies/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cryptoslate.com/etoro-ending-us-customers-access-to-four-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoSlate</a>, stock, and crypto trading platform eToro revealed that it would restrict access to specific cryptocurrencies for users in the United States. Effective from 6:00 a.m. ET on July 12, 2023, users in the U.S. will no longer be able to open new positions in Algorand (ALGO), Decentraland (MANA), Dash (DASH), and Polygon (MATIC), according to a report by CryptoSlate.</p>



<p>eToro clarified that while U.S. customers would be prohibited from initiating new positions in these assets, they would still be allowed to hold and sell any existing positions. This change in policy is solely applicable to U.S. users, with non-U.S. customers remaining unaffected by the decision.</p>



<p>The trading platform attributed its action to evolving regulatory conditions, stating that it had taken this step due to &#8220;recent developments&#8221; in the regulatory landscape. Although the email did not explicitly specify the regulatory concerns, the four affected cryptocurrencies were named in lawsuits filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Coinbase and Binance, starting on June 5.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that eToro, primarily recognized as a trading platform, facilitates the closure of open cryptocurrency positions and allows users to withdraw their balances in either cash or cryptocurrency. This differs from most traditional cryptocurrency exchanges, which focus on direct trading of digital assets.</p>

<p>On June 9, Delaware Judge John Dorsey dismissed the Bahamas Joint Temporary Liquidation Organization (JPL) petition to lift the automatic freeze order. Judge Delaware added that his primary concern is maximizing the value of recovery for FTX&#8217;s creditors and customers worldwide. Bahamian liquidators have received 46 million claims alone, and having similar matters litigated before him and Sir Ian in the Bahamas would inevitably involve increased costs, &#8220;confusion&#8221; and delays with all costs ultimately paid by Cryptocurrency exchange customers crashed.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On Friday, June 9, the Court denied the Bahamian joint provisional liquidators’ (JPLs) motion to lift the automatic stay to raise certain contested issues before the Bahamian court.</p>&mdash; Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of FTX (@FTX_Committee) <a href="https://twitter.com/FTX_Committee/status/1668381133795467264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 12, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>For Bahamian liquidators concerned that freezing Chapter 11 would prevent them from performing their legal obligations before the Supreme Court. However, while the ruling appears to be a total loss for the Bahamian liquidation trio, Tribune Business understands they have been greatly encouraged and comforted by various aspects of Judge Dorsey&#8217;s ruling.</p>

<p>Judge Dorsey ruled that serious legal issues needed to be determined before the assets could be distributed and returned to FTX&#8217;s creditors. These include who are clients of FTX Trading and other entities controlled by Mr. Ray and who are clients of FTX Digital Markets in the Bahamas.</p>



<p>The Court also directs the parties to mediate on matters brought up by the joint liquidators. FTX Creditors Committee will participate in mediation and<a href="https://news.coincu.com/193586-ftx-protects-customer-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> protect </a>the interests of creditors and customers. The bankruptcy court also launched a joint motion by the debtor and creditor committee to seal customer data.</p>



<p>In the remaining bankruptcy cases, the names, email addresses, and physical addresses of the natural customers will be permanently deleted. This will protect customers from the risk of scams and other threats. Business customer names, email addresses, and addresses will be deleted within 90 days, possibly with extensions.</p>
