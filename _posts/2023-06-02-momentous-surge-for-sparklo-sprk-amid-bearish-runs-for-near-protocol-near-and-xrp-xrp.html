<p class="s7">Near Protocol (NEAR) sees a crab-like price movement</p>
<p>Near Protocol (NEAR) is a community-driven cloud computing protocol that operates on the layer 1 blockchain to enhance the overall activities on the blockchain. Within the last 24 hours, Near Protocol (NEAR) saw an insignificant -0.18% loss in price value. This development pegs the price of the Near Protocol (NEAR) token at $1.56 at the time of writing. The trading volume of Near Protocol (NEAR) went down by -20.31% and currently stands at $40,745,164.</p>
<p>In the last few days, the Near Protocol (NEAR) price has not seen any upward price movement. The Near Protocol (NEAR) price chart shows that the coin is struggling to overcome the bear market. Despite all these, crypto experts still think that the price of Near Protocol (NEAR) will surge in the coming days despite the current price trajectory and the stats suggesting the contrary. Near Protocol (NEAR) coin holders have already joined the ongoing Sparklo project, which has proven to be a more viable investment option.</p>
<p class="s7">XRP (XRP) declines in price value amid fresh token released from escrow</p>
<p>XRP (XRP) is a decentralized open-source ledger that executes transactions in the blockchain network at a low-cost price alongside speed and scalability. In a fresh development, XRP (XRP) now has an additional 1 billion tokens added to its circulating supply in another monthly token released by the network. This development was executed through the escrow system which has 55 billion XRP (XRP) tokens locked in from December 17, 2021. These tokens have since then been released at 1 billion per month. However, the escrow system has seen divided opinions among experts as to whether it affects the price of the XRP (XRP) token negatively.</p>
<p>XRP (XRP) in the last 24 hours lost &nbsp;1.08% in price value. As a result, the price of XRP (XRP) is $0.50 at present time. The coin has made significant progress in the last few days and has gained over 5%. However, with the last 24 hours' price of XRP (XRP) not showing signs of a rally, the XRP (XRP) investors have moved over to the trending Sparklo project, where significant gains will be made. The Sparklo project is already giving a bonus for token purchase, which makes it one of the best crypto projects for now. </p>
