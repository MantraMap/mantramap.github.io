tag: CryptoDaily
---

<p>According to blockchain researcher and journalist Colin Wu, Solana&rsquo;s RPC Endpoints and Mainnet explorer are offline due to a bug in its latest release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solana has urged users operating on the impacted nodes to change to version 1.13.&nbsp;</p>
Network Still Functioning&nbsp;
<p>Solana Foundation-run Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoints are currently offline due to a bug in its latest test release, 1.14. While Solana has urged those operating on the impact nodes to change over to 1.13, the Solana Network remains unaffected, with block production taking place normally. This is due to the fact that other private RPCs by firms, such as Alchemy, QuickNode, and Triton, are still available to use. RPC endpoints are nodes connecting decentralized applications and wallets to the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Journalist Colin Wu also updated Twitter followers, highlighting that the network was functioning normally despite the RPCs being offline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mainnet beta Explorer and Solana Foundation Public RPC endpoints are currently offline as RPC node software is upgraded, following a bug in test release 1.14. Block production has not been impacted, and the Solana network has not been impacted.&rdquo;</p>

Latest Upgrade To Blame&nbsp;
<p>Developers on Solana were able to pinpoint the latest test upgrade, version 1.14, as the primary cause of the failure. The upgrade was carried out by Solana Foundation node operators on their RPC endpoints and impacted the public RPC endpoints and the Mainnet beta explorer. The beta explorer is a tool that analyzes on-chain transactions and displays them to users in a simplified manner. Solana issued a statement on Twitter regarding the developments,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mainnet beta Explorer and Solana Foundation Public RPC endpoints are currently offline as RPC node software is upgraded, following a bug in test release 1.14. Block production has not been impacted, and the Solana network has not been impacted. This bug impacted other nodes which had adopted the test release. If you are operating a node on a test release, please change over to 1.13.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Solana has faced a slew of network outages, with its history fraught with downtimes. In 2022 alone, the Solana network suffered 14 outages, which lasted for a total of 4 days, 12 hours, and 21 minutes. The last major outage on the Solana network occurred in October 2022 due to issues related to a node. The frequency of these outages has raised considerable concern among protocol users.&nbsp;</p>
Solana On The Road To Recovery&nbsp;
<p>Solana had a year to forget in 2022 but has started the new year on a brighter note. According to a tweet by Solana co-founder Raj Gokal, data from Artemis has shown that the network&rsquo;s daily addresses are ahead of those of its nearest rivals, namely Ethereum and Polygon, as of January 5th, 2023. Furthermore, the platform&rsquo;s native SOL token has seen its value jump considerably during the past week, rising by 37%, and is currently trading at just over $16, according to CoinMarketCap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in price is a welcome development, considering SOL had dropped to $8 during the closing weeks of 2022. The token has also climbed up to being the 11th largest asset by market cap. Solana&rsquo;s community has also rallied around a new meme coin that is taking the network by storm. The new Bonk Inu token has surged over 1000% in the first week of the new year, attracting significant network activity.&nbsp;</p>
