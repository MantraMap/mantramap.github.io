<p>Digital asset manager Osprey Funds has laid off 15 employees and is currently operating with fewer than 10 employees, according to a source familiar with the matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The news comes as the cryptocurrency market continues to struggle, with digital asset prices plunging and leading to the collapse of some heavily-leveraged investors. Despite the layoffs, Osprey CEO Greg King maintains that the company &ldquo;remains strong&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Osprey's Bitcoin Trust (OBTC), which is available at major online brokers like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and TD Ameritrade, had approximately $46.9 million in assets under management as of January 6.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When including its trusts for BNB, Solana, Polkadot, and Algorand, the company has a total of $67.6 million in assets under management.</p>
<p>According to a report on Yahoo Finance, Osprey tried to launch a hedge fund back in August of 2022, but the attempt failed, and management informed its staff that the latest cuts were due to this failure.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency market continues to face challenges, with investor appetite for risky assets shrinking and leading to a downturn in the industry. This has resulted in bankruptcies and layoffs, as well as a general decline in digital asset prices. It remains to be seen how Osprey and other companies in the space will navigate these challenges going forward.</p>
