The rules of the 8th PrimeVote will stay the same&nbsp; with "rockets" as the favored voting tool.</p><p>Vote for projects with "Rockets" and win limited edition NFTs</p><p>The "Rocket Plan" is Huobi's newest endeavor aimed at enriching user engagement and experience. Rockets refer to the USDT equivalent of your average assets on Huobi over a 30-day period. 1 USDT equals to 1 Rocket. The Rocket value represents an integer without decimal places.</p><p>The number of "Rockets" a user holds is determined by the balance of their assets. With an increased possession of "Rockets," users can wield more influence in the PrimeVote event, major platform decisions, new token airdrops, and other scenarios where "Rockets" come into play. This grants them a stronger voice and a larger share of rewards. To increase their Rocket values, users can improve their asset balances by making deposits and purchasing quality assets like BTC, ETH, HT, etc. Moreover, using "Rockets" to vote will not cause users' asset balance to be locked.</p><p>"Rockets" are users' tickets to take part in the PrimeVote events and also give participants a chance to mint limited edition NFTs in Huobi's Mars Program that offers $6 million worth of space travel.</p><p>Based on Huobi's official announcement, a total of 12 projects were shortlisted in the 7th round of the PrimeVote event. As of August 9 202313:00 (UTC), EML and XDAO emerged as top performers in Group A while XFI and AD took the lead in Group B. These projects have advanced to the final voting stage. Following two rounds of preliminary and final voting, MinePlex (XFI) has stood out as the favored pick among the community by winning the championship of this event with a notable 208,172,999 "Rockets".
