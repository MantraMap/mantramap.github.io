Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride recently, with sudden price drops and spikes keeping investors on their toes. Last week, the cryptocurrency failed to break through its $27,500 resistance level and dropped to a low of $24,700.  However, Bitcoin has again shown signs of regaining its bullish momentum, with a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and trading at $26,400 at the time of writing. Many analysts have predicted a continuation of the uptrend in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, which has been ongoing since January 2023.

Therefore, building confidence among investors is crucial to sustaining Bitcoin&#8217;s upward trend. On a positive note, BlackRock&#8217;s recent application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its new exchange-traded fund (ETF) has given Bitcoin holders and bulls hope.  As reported by NewsBTC, the recent announcement of BlackRock&#8217;s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has the potential to impact BTC’s price significantly. If approved, this ETF would enable a wider range of investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which could drive up demand and ultimately increase its price. ETFs provide a convenient way for institutional investors to access Bitcoin, creating a new demand avenue for the cryptocurrency. This could increase buying pressure and a potential surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Potential BTC Reversal From Support Bitcoin has recently bounced from its bullish trend and the top of its range, indicating that it still has some work to do before establishing a sustainable upward trend.  According to market analyst Crypto Con, one of the most accurate indicators of Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish or bearish momentum is the 140-day moving average (MA), which shows that BTC’s price is below this crucial level. The 140DMA is a widely followed indicator in the cryptocurrency market, as it clearly signals whether Bitcoin is in a bullish or bearish phase.  When BTC’s price is above the 140DMA, it&#8217;s a bullish signal, indicating that the cryptocurrency will likely continue its upward trend. Conversely, when the price is below the 140DMA, it&#8217;s a bearish signal, suggesting that the cryptocurrency will likely experience a downward trend. Bitcoin&#8217;s price is below the 140DMA, indicating that it&#8217;s in a bearish phase. However, Crypto Con hopes the cryptocurrency will experience a huge reversal from this support level, leading to a bearish fakeout of the 140DMA. This strong bullish signal could indicate that Bitcoin is ready to continue its upward trend.

There is a growing belief that the largest cryptocurrency in the market is poised to reach new annual highs in 2023 and possibly even surpass its all-time high. However, for BTC to continue its upward trend, the cryptocurrency needs to maintain its current level of $26,000 throughout the weekend. A sustained price above this price mark could indicate that BTC is on track for a green week in the coming days. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com
