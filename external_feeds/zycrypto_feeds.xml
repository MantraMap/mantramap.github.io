<p>Pepe Coin is a meme coin based on the Pepe the Frog meme, with the latter gaining popularity on the internet in the mid-2010s. Pepe has been used as a meme in various contexts, often to convey humour or sarcasm. PEPE as a cryptocurrency entered the crypto market in April and has since made staggering gains, despite the creators stating that the value of PEPE is primarily based on speculation and hype rather than any intrinsic value or use case.</p>



<p>Memecoins are cryptocurrencies based on internet memes or pop culture references created for entertainment or as a joke. Some examples include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Baby Doge, and Floki Inu. While their prices fluctuate significantly, they are considered highly speculative and risky investments due to their lack of underlying value or use case. Pepe Coin is a newer meme coin gaining traction and may signal a shift away from dog-themed coins.</p>



<p>Pepe Coin was launched without the use of traditional methods such as an ICO, presale, or airdrop, relying solely on the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme to generate investor interest. Within days of its launch, its price increased by 2000%, propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of more than $396 million.</p>



<p>The number of wallets holding PEPE has increased from 7000 in mid-April to 79000 at the start of May. The coin has set itself the goal to surpass <a href="https://zycrypto.com/doge-army-anticipates-stellar-dogecoin-rally-to-the-moon-as-dogeday-approaches/">Dogecoin</a> and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-shibarium-renews-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib-shiba-inus-metaverse-sees-major-developments/">Shiba Inu</a>, according to its website. It can be traded on Uniswap, OKX, and Houbi, amongst others, a be listed on nd is on the verge of going live on major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken. Crypto Twitter is in full anticipation that it will soon be listed and that explosive growth will continue.</p>



<p>Last weekend, traders experienced significant slippage when trying to convert large amounts of PEPE into other currencies, like ETH, due to a lack of liquidity despite a recent rise in liquidity pool activity.</p>



<p>With a self-reported circulating supply of 420.69 trillion PEPE tokens compared to a circulating supply of 139.22 billion DOGE, it is difficult to see how many newcomers are needed to reach similar volumes, and it remains to be seen how many people will buy into the latest meme graze.</p>



<p>Additionally, it must be said that PEPE has no intrinsic value and does not appear to have plans to add any features. Pepe Coin&#8217;s future is uncertain, with some experts predicting it will remain significant, while others believe it will follow in the footsteps of other short-lived meme coins such as Grimacecoin and Pump Coin. Grimacecoin, for example, experienced a brief increase in value following a McDonald&#8217;s tweet, but its price eventually returned to its original level.</p>



<p>According to the developers&#8217; website, investors may want to consider the following because “$PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.”</p>



<p>Then again, internet memes, especially crypto meme coins, are notoriously difficult to predict, and PEPE sees itself as the king of memes.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has not moved much lately, and that is having a ripple effect on most cryptocurrencies apart from newly launched meme coins like PEPE.</p>



<p>This week, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization mainly traded sideways, creating a tight price squeeze heading into the weekend. On Friday, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-bullish-stance-on-bitcoin-stronger-than-ever-as-firm-post-q1-2023-profits/">Bitcoin</a> was trading at $29,000, up 0.33% in the past 24 hours and down roughly 1% in the past week.</p>



<p>According to onchain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin’s recent behaviour can be pointed to constant selling by short-term holders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-short-term-holders-offload-btc"><strong>Short-Term Holders Offload BTC</strong></h2>



<p>In its latest weekly on-chain newsletter, the firm noted that whereas the majority of supply remains held by longer-term, the weight of short-term investors is currently prevailing over the price action within the uptrend.</p>



<p><em>“Among both Long-Term and Short-Term&nbsp; Holder cohorts sending coins to exchanges, the dominance of the Short-Term Holders remains a consistent 90%-95% of total inflows,” </em>wrote Glassnode.<em> “Of note is the increase of profit taking by STHs in 2023, denoted by the deeper dark red zone, which accounts for 58% of exchange inflows at present.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="590" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7-1024x590.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80544" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7-1024x590.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7-300x173.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7-768x443.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7.png 1431w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As per the firm, since early Jan, there have been two waves of profit-taking by short-term holders, surpassing the total profit taken by long-term holders. <em>“Within the current market, the second wave of short-term holders profit realization aligns with the recent correction,”</em> it added.</p>



<p>The firm noted that as this cohort continues to sell its coins, the market will likely experience volatility, and Bitcoin could <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-at-29000-but-pundit-says-it-could-drop-lower-after-losing-one-crucial-level/">slide lower</a>.</p>



<p><em>“We observed that sell pressure by new investors was a key driving force that established resistance at $30k. Should this present correction resume, the cost basis of the young supply holders at $24.4k may well be a psychological level to monitor in the weeks ahead.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Large Whales Deviate To Buying</strong></h2>



<p>However, it is important to note that as small-term holders continue to take profit, large whales with over 10,000 BTC seem to be accumulating. On Friday, Glassnode tweeted that this group has shifted “from a distributive regime to one of aggressive coin absorption.”</p>



<p>“Checkmate”, the lead onchain analyst at the firm, later clarified the tweet, noting that this metric excludes exchanges. Instead, he noted it showed the behaviour of &#8216;ETF-style sinks though like MicroStrategy, large institutions, GBTC, and WBTC over the last 30 days. This implies that these institutions could have significantly prevented Bitcoin&#8217;s price from declining recently.</p>

<p>Cardano&#8217;s highly-anticipated Hydra upgrade has finally arrived, with the first Hydra Head now open on the Cardano mainnet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a Thursday announcement by Input Output Global (IOHK), the team behind Cardano, hydra head version 0.10.0, was released in late March on the mainnet, setting pace for other releases in its category aimed at boosting Cardano’s performance.</p>



<p>Hydra is a layer 2 scalability solution for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-transaction-volume-sees-huge-upsurge-amid-price-fluctuations-ada-network-in-bullish-outlook/">Cardano</a> that aims to increase transaction speed through low latency, high throughput, and minimized transaction cost. The Hydra family of protocols was designed to make Cardano more scalable and adaptable for various use cases that require fast and cheap transactions.</p>



<p><em>“Our goal is to make Cardano possible to grow and increase its adoption by making it more scalable. We do that by building several protocols to make these situations possible,” </em>Sebastian Nagel, lead software engineer of Hydra, noted.</p>



<p>Nagel further emphasized that the Hydra family of protocols is meant to help Cardano become more scalable and flexible in several use cases. Hydra Head protocol is the first of many building blocks on Hydra aimed at enabling applications to offload some transactions from the global Cardano network into more local contexts, where the transactions are only run by involved parties, increasing transaction speeds.</p>



<p>Nagel further clarified that Hydra is not a network upgrade, meaning no hard fork will be involved.</p>



<p>“<em>Hydra is not a network upgrade, so there is no hard fork. There’s nothing really the whole network is waiting on-it’s just flipping a switch, and everything is fast,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>However, Nagel emphasized that it is not yet a finished product, and there will be more releases to incorporate more use cases.</p>



<p><em>You now have this version 0.10.0 available. It’s not done yet, but it is a very good starting point. There will be more releases to incorporate more user needs. Our focus lately has been making it possible to run on the mainnet. Our next focus is really to bring in more use cases,” </em>he went on.</p>



<p>The release came days after Cardano developers&#8217; <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-poised-for-ultra-bullish-surge-following-latest-hydra-upgrade-development-milestone/">showcased</a> the progress of the Hydra Head running smoothly on the mainnet. That said, the release of version 0.10.0 is a significant milestone for the blockchain and its ecosystem. It represents a major step forward in developing Cardano&#8217;s scalability and ability to handle complex smart contracts. Furthermore, as the Hydra family of protocols expands, Cardano is well-positioned to take advantage of its scalable solutions and attract new users and projects to its network.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the news has strengthened ADA, trading at $0.38 at press time, up just over 2% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Stripe, a leading financial infrastructure platform for businesses, has announced the launch of its first fiat-to-crypto onramp product. </p>



<p>The onramp, initially available to US-based customers, is designed to make purchasing cryptocurrency for customers of Web3 companies easier. According to Stripe, the new product aims at helping businesses willing to provide crypto and blockchain-enabled services but typically encountered onboarding difficulties in the past.</p>



<p><em>“Companies interested in offering cryptocurrency- and blockchain-enabled experiences often face a cold start problem: Their customers don&#8217;t have the crypto in their wallets to carry out transactions. Stripe’s onramp allows customers to purchase crypto at the precise moment they need it. They could purchase Ethereum, for example, and immediately use it to buy an NFT</em>,” the firm noted in a Friday <a href="https://stripe.com/zh-cn-hk/newsroom/news/fiat-to-crypto-onramp">statement.</a></p>



<p>Meanwhile, following today’s announcement, Stripe now offers two implementation options for its onramp. The first one lets developers put a crypto purchasing widget on their website with only a few lines of code, while with the second one, businesses can direct their customers to the onramp on “crypto.link.com” without needing any code.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;With our onramp options, Web3 companies can now outsource a bunch of the very important but tricky pieces to Stripe—things like conversion and auth optimization, identity verification, fraud prevention, and so on,&#8221;</em> said Guillaume Poncin, head of engineering for crypto at Stripe. <em>&#8220;This allows companies to focus on what’s unique to their business and helps their customers start using Web3 services quickly and safely.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Notably, the Stripe-hosted onramp is built for many of the use cases developed by Web3 companies around the globe, including Brave, Safe, 1inch, and Lens Protocol.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to welcome Stripe into LensFrens to reduce payment friction and encourage content monetization,&#8221; </em>said Lens Founder Stani Kulechov. <em>&#8220;By adding this payment feature, users can easily collect their favourite content and back the creators they admire.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>As demand for crypto products skyrockets, Stripe has been positioning itself as a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/stripe-now-supports-cryptocurrencies-once-again-after-changing-its-mind-in-the-past-welcome-the-institutions/">key player</a> in the space, offering various solutions to help businesses easily accept and process cryptocurrency transactions. In the recent past, the Dublin-based firm has witnessed an uptick in crypto businesses utilizing its other products, including its global payout service using the USDC stablecoin.</p>



<p>That said, Friday’s announcement is a significant development that aims to address the adoption barrier faced by Web3 companies. By offering an easy and convenient way for US-based customers to purchase crypto, the US is likely to witness further crypto adoptions as products in the sector become more accessible to the general public.</p>

<p>As some countries like the United States continue to restrict innovative technologies like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, other Latin American countries, such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/el-salvador/">El Salvador</a>, are working to boost the growth of their tech industries.</p>



<p>On May 4th, Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador, announced the enactment of a law that eliminates taxes on innovative technologies, including software creation, coding, artificial intelligence, and other fields.</p>



<p>The law<a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1654121271548866560"> signed</a> by Bukele will exempt fiscal taxes on these technologies for at least 15 years. Additionally, it includes the elimination of capital gains tax, paid when obtaining profits from the sale of an asset.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’ve just signed into law, the INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURING INCENTIVES ACT, that eliminates all taxes (income, property, capital gains and import tariffs) on technology innovations, software and app programming, AI, computer and communications hardware manufacturing. <a href="https://t.co/rZtGzPgVzW">pic.twitter.com/rZtGzPgVzW</a></p>&mdash; Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1654121271548866560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>El Salvador wants to become a technological leader in Latin America</strong></h2>



<p>The bill was approved on April 19th by the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador with 69 votes in favor and none against during the 103rd plenary session of the legislative body.</p>



<p>Congresswoman Elisa Rosales stated during the plenary session that the new Legislative Assembly and the Executive Branch are working to position the country as a leader in Latin America on technological manufacturing.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;There are five incentives being granted for 15 years, and we are not establishing a minimum investment amount because we want to encourage all those StartUps. We have a different vision; we are positioning our country with a different face internationally,&#8221; </em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-el-salvador-bets-on-emerging-technologies-to-improve-its-economy"><strong>El Salvador bets on emerging technologies to improve its economy</strong></h2>



<p>Congressman Estuardo Rodríguez pointed out that the Law for the Promotion of Innovation and Technological Manufacturing will “contribute significantly to the country&#8217;s economic development,&#8221; creating more jobs for young people.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the new law will create opportunities for the development of artificial intelligence, a cutting-edge technology used daily by millions of users and companies to improve their efficiency and productivity.</p>



<p>Thanks to Nayib Bukele&#8217;s technological proposals, such as enacting the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-officially-becomes-legal-tender-in-el-salvador-country-secures-first-400-btc-purchase/">Bitcoin Law</a>, which establishes the use of Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador, the country has become one of the most attractive nations for cryptocurrency companies.</p>



<p>As recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitfinex-awarded-first-ever-digital-asset-service-provider-license-in-el-salvador/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, Bitfinex became the first cryptocurrency exchange to expand to El Salvador after acquiring a digital asset license allowing it to operate in a regulated manner in the country. Will other major exchanges follow?</p>

<p>U.S. regulators, not least of all the Securities and Exchange Commission, have taken an aggressive tack lately with the crypto industry. Amid the regulatory headwinds, Coinbase’s and Ripple’s top legal experts met to discuss pressing matters in the fast-growing crypto space.</p>



<p>The news of the meeting has prompted speculation about the U.S.’s largest and best-known exchange relisting Ripple’s cryptocurrency XRP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-and-coinbase-legal-officers-hang-out"><strong>Ripple And Coinbase Legal Officers Hang Out</strong></h2>



<p>The top lawyers from Ripple and Coinbase convened for a recent offsite meeting to discuss pressing concerns in the vibrant crypto landscape.</p>



<p>Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, took to Twitter earlier today to express his appreciation to Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty for being invited to the meeting and suggested more meetings in the future. Alderoty then tweeted his gratitude to Grewal for taking the time to connect with the Ripple legal team.</p>



<p>Details of the meeting were sparse, but both Ripple and Coinbase are currently at an impasse with the U.S. SEC. Ripple Labs was sued back in December 2020 for allegedly selling unregistered securities in the form of XRP.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Coinbase — which has become the second-largest crypto exchange, trailing only Binance — was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">slapped </a>with a Wells Notice by the SEC in March over potential violations of U.S. securities law. In a document last week, the San Francisco-headquartered platform pushed back against the SEC’s enforcement notice.</p>



<p>These two U.S.-based companies have often called for formal rulemaking within the crypto assets sector, which the watchdog agency has ignored and chosen regulation by enforcement instead. In recent months, the SEC has taken action against notable industry players, including digital asset exchanges Bittrex, Kraken, Gemini, crypto lender Genesis and individual actors such as Tron founder Justin Sun. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>But Will Coinbase Relist XRP?</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase has previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-coinbase-asks-court-for-permission-to-support-ripple/">requested </a>the court for permission to file a friend of the court (&#8220;amicus&#8221;) brief in Ripple’s case with the SEC, arguing that the lawsuit threatens the broader industry. Grewal has also, in recent weeks, hailed the legal defense mounted by Ripple. </p>



<p>Many XRP fans are once again suspecting that Coinbase could soon relist XRP on its platform following the offsite meeting, where the two chief legal officers are seen pictured in a close friendly pose.</p>



<p>Even if Grewal and Stuart’s body language indicates improving cordiality between Coinbase and Ripple, a relisting of XRP soon seems unlikely at this point. As <em>ZyCrypto </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-will-get-relisted-on-coinbase-immediately-after-ripples-victory-over-sec-exchanges-chief-legal-officer-hints/">reported</a>, Grewal pointed out in a recent interview with Tony Edward that a possible timeline for relisting depends on various factors.</p>



<p>At press time, XRP was changing hands at $$0.456461, a gain of 0.9% in the past day, according to CoinGecko.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tensor marketplace has taken a slight lead over rival Magic Eden in the past seven days after dominating 45% of Solana’s market share. </li>



<li>Mad Labs remains key in the recent surge of Tensor, with the marketplace offering rewards to top traders ahead of Magic Eden. </li>



<li>With a week ahead, commentators assess Tensor’s chances in the top spot with new updates coming on their rivals.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFT) remain in the driving seat of the Solana (SOL) as the network continues its development amid tight competition with other smart contract blockchains.</p>



<p>This week, a new king of Solana’s NFT was crowned, but how long can the reign last? According to data from Tiexo, Tensor has toppled Magic Eden as the marketplace with the most volume in the past seven days. Tensor now commands 45% of total Solana’s NFT volume, leaving Magic Eden with a  little under 44%.</p>



<p>The uptick in Tensor’s volume can be linked to the launch of Mad Labs, with both platforms offering rewards on it. From the stats, traders prefer bonuses offered by Tensor over Magic Eden after it started its reward program last month.</p>



<p>The NFT market witnessed a burst of energy after Mad Labs was introduced in April. Mad Labs is a Profile Picture Collection on Solana that has generated over $15 million in trading volumes since its launch, becoming the latest Solana buzz after the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-is-losing-its-touch-with-nfts-as-major-projects-announce-departure/">network</a> lost DeGods and yOOTs this year.</p>



<p>Armanti Ferranter, co-developer of Mad Labs, described the void and the importance of the project on Solana.</p>



<p>“<em>There was this void, where the heart and soul of the NFT space needed to kind of have a new heartbeat, basically,” </em>he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-little-drops-make-an-ocean">Little drops make an ocean</h2>



<p>Launched in 2022, Tensor has grown gradually in terms of trade volume and constantly dubs itself the home of “<em>pro traders.” </em>Loyalty rewards have been key to the rise of Blur as it moved past OpenSea in February on the Ethereum Network. Learning a couple of tricks from Blur, Tensor jumped in on Mad Labs with a special offer.</p>



<p>Tensor announced that it would divert all trading fees on Mad Labs NFTs for the first three months to purchase floor NFTs from the project, which will be given to top traders via raffle. So far, Tensor has spent $93,640, about 4,280 SOL, to purchase NFTs for top traders.</p>



<p>Tensor’s CTO, Richard Wu, hailed the project’s community-based approach targeted at Mad Labs.</p>



<p>“<em>If you show people that you&#8217;re truly about giving back to the community, and trying to make your product the best for Mad Lads or the next NFT project then people will come and trade on your platform, and people will align with a Tensor versus a Magic Eden,” </em>Wu said.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>MicroStrategy reported a Q1 2023 profit of $94 million attributed to a one-time income tax benefit.</li>



<li>The firm purchased 7,500 BTC in the first quarter bringing its total holdings to 140,000 BTC with no signs of slowing down.</li>



<li>The firm’s Bitcoin stash turned to profit after BTC made a 72% gain in the first quarter, wiping away 2022 losses.</li>
</ul>



<p>Michael Saylor says his Bitcoin (BTC) strategy has outperformed stocks, similar assets, and Bitcoin itself after positive showings this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-doubles-down-on-bitcoin-vows-to-keep-accumulating-btc-despite-market-volatility/">MicroStrategy</a> has posted its Q1 2023 report, which shows a profit of $94 million, marking the company’s first-ever quarterly profit in nearly three years. Profits recorded this quarter can be linked to a tax benefit of $453 million and an upward revenue stream of 2.2% from the last quarter ( $121 million).</p>



<p>The firm also announced a net income of $46.2 million, an increase of a loss of $130.8 million in Q1 2022. The company also paid a $161 million BTC-backed loan to Silvergate Bank with the former releasing its 34,619 BTC.</p>



<p>MicroStrategy’s CEO Phong Lee stated that the company’s BTC stance is “<em>stronger than ever”&nbsp; </em>as the year progresses.</p>



<p><em>“The conviction in our Bitcoin strategy remains strong as the digital asset environment continues to mature. We remained disciplined on cost while investing in growth and will continue to execute our dual strategy of growing our intelligence software business and acquiring Bitcoin for the future,” he added.</em></p>



<p>Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, praised the company’s BTC strategy as the backbone of its success in the first quarter. </p>



<p>“<em>So ultimately, it’s not easy what a better strategy might be. And so, we are strong proponents of the Bitcoin strategy. And as you see from this chart, prudently acquiring Bitcoin is a good way to outperform the market.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bullish-on-btc-despite-slight-losses">Bullish on BTC despite slight losses</h2>



<p>According to the firm’s filings at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company acquired 7,500 BTC in Q2 2023 with two huge purchases worth $179 million on March 23 and April 5. The firm&#8217;s BTC stash now stands at 140,000 with no signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>Purchased at an average of 29,803, the company’s BTC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-bitcoin-stash-now-in-the-green-as-crypto-assets-soar/">holdings</a> flipped green after BTC surged past the $30,000 mark in April. With the price of BTC below $29,000 at press time, MicroStrategy BTC holdings are at a loss of 5.8%.</p>



<p>Michael Saylor has maintained his bullish stance on BTC through the years and revealed that he had integrated Bitcoin Lightning into his email address while also developing a layer 2 lightning network for corporations. </p>

<ul>
<li>Pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton has dismissed the rumour as unlikely.</li>



<li>The price of the native token XRP is yet to respond to the speculations.</li>
</ul>



<p>A fresh rumour is circulating that Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are arranging an undisclosed meeting on May 8. The claim has caused speculation that the discussion could be about a settlement in the duo&#8217;s long-standing case.</p>



<p>A Twitter account dubbed Blockchain Daily posted about the rumour, citing unconfirmed sources. &#8220;Just in: reportedly Ripple and SEC to hold an undisclosed meeting on May 8th – unconfirmed source.&#8221;</p>



<p>XRP community attorney John Deaton quickly dismissed the rumour as unlikely, saying the commission had no reason to go for a settlement before the summary judgment was out. According to Deaton, such a step could only happen if the presiding judge rules in favour of Ripple.</p>



<p>‘‘This is not how a settlement happens. First, I believe the only time a settlement occurs, in this case, is after a ruling by Judge Torres. That happens if Ripple wins so Gensler can save face and get a political win via settlement. Sorry, it&#8217;s not going to happen,’’ he wrote.</p>



<p>Deaton also argued that due to market manipulation and insider trading regulations, the commission could not set a meeting, leak information about it, and influence the market. Instead, how it could happen, in his view, is that Ripple and the SEC could meet and enter into a settlement before presenting it to the presiding judge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lawsuit-plagued-with-decision-delays"><strong>Lawsuit plagued with decision delays</strong></h2>



<p>The rumours and speculations come when the crypto community is growing impatient <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">concerning the outcome</a> of the long-awaited Ripple and SEC case. Deaton had earlier speculated that considering the previous cases handled by Judge Torres, the Ripple community could welcome the summary judgment by last month.</p>



<p>A month ago, to bolster its fair notice defence against the regulator, Ripple <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-invokes-key-ruling-in-voyager-bankruptcy-case-to-strengthen-its-defense/">filed</a> a Letter of Supplemental Authority, referring to a case involving a takeover bid by Binance.US of Voyager Digital. In the case, the presiding Judge Michael Wiles, among other things, dismissed the commission’s claims that the Voyager token (VGX) amounted to an issue of securities.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the crypto community has seemingly taken the rumour with a pinch of salt per the current price of XRP, which changed hands at $0.46 at press time, a difference of +0.91% in the past day.</p>

<p>Solana, one of the largest “Ethereum Killers”, has surpassed the latter to become the network with the most transactions.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Nansen shared a <a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1653581937620164609">tweet</a> comparing April&#8217;s most active on-chain addresses. According to the firm, Solana came in second after BNB Chain, becoming the network with the most active address by chain at 5.1 million in April.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80473" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-300x169.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-768x432.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>And despite that figure dropping by around 12% from March, the cryptocurrency network still managed to outdo Ethereum, which had 4.9 million active addresses in April.</p>



<p>Solana also surpassed Ethereum by non-vote transactions last month. Non-vote transactions are transactions that do not involve any voting or decision-making by token holders. They typically involve the transfer of cryptocurrency between wallets or accounts and are the most common type of transaction on most blockchain networks due to their simplicity. According to Nansen data, as of April 30, Solana’s total non-vote transactions stood at 24.3 million compared to Ethereum’s 974,972.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="705" height="663" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80474" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-5.png 705w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-5-300x282.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></figure>



<p>Solana’s attractive growth can be attributed to various factors, including a surge in developers and users due to its attractive transaction speeds and costs. Apart from announcing various developments that go into improving the network, including a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sol-jumps-over-8-as-solana-makes-groundbreaking-entry-into-ai-with-chatgpt-plugin/">Chat GPT plugin</a> and a web3 phone, Solana’s ballooning transactions have also been propelled by NFTs.</p>



<p>Recently, Mad Lads, a new project launched on Solana, became the most traded collection generating $17 million compared with $11 million for Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club collection during the last week of April. This is despite the Solana facing a major setback following the exit of y00ts and DeGods,&nbsp;two of its most popular collections, earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched roughly a month ago, Mad Lads is a unique type of NFT that falls in a category called xNFTs. Ideally, xNFTs combine the features of traditional NFTs and executable code, meaning users can use them to conduct other activities such as gaming and chatting.</p>



<p>That said, Solana&#8217;s native token SOL has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-predicts-why-solana-could-bounce-back-even-better/">also performed well</a>, soaring by over 116% since January 1. This is compared to Bitcoin, up 70%, and Ether, up just over 50% year-to-date.</p>



<p>At press time, SOL was trading at $21.47, down 3.36% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. On the other hand, Ether rose by 1.66% in the same period and was exchanging hands at $1,851.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cardano’s transaction volume surges to new highs not recorded in past months as the wider market also witnesses improved activity.&nbsp;</li>



<li>ADA’s price plunged further after losing its stance going below the $0.4 mark in May, trading at $0.38.</li>



<li>The future of Cardano’s development looks strong as the network rolls our new upgrades in preparation for the much anticipated Voltaire era.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-whales-are-taking-no-days-off-as-ada-transactions-hit-rooftop/">Cardano</a> (ADA) has been debated within crypto circles due to its huge developments lined up this year, coupled with a huge leap in price. </p>



<p>Transaction volumes on Cardano have been up this week together with the total number of active wallets on its network. According to a recent report by Input Output Global, the organization responsible for the network’s growth, Cardano processed 65.4 million transactions in the past seven days.</p>



<p>The network has also recorded a massive inflow of new wallets bringing the total number of wallets to over 4 million as of March 2023. The volatility of ADA this past month has been a significant concern for pundits despite the latest wins in transaction volume.</p>



<p>The current trend can be linked to reports of increased <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-primed-for-massive-boom-as-ada-whales-network-activity-heats-up/">whale activity</a> on the network. The accumulation of coins in whale addresses points to a growth in the confidence of bigger players, which often ignites bull runs.</p>



<p>Cardano’s futures market is also showing bullish signs as increased transactions are recorded on the network. According to a chart from IntoTheBlock, transaction volume fell below 10B ADA in January before growing above 20B ADA.</p>



<p>ADA currently exchanges hands at $0.38 and has surged by a staggering 58% this year, with bulls expecting more gains to clear huge losses in the bear market. Although the year has been good, ADA is still 49% down from May 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-community-can-feel-voltaire">The community can feel Voltaire</h2>



<p>Voltaire, described as the last phase of Cardano’s evolution, primarily aims to create a completely decentralized decision-making platform. Among the developments to flag off Voltaire is the Conway Ledger and CIP-1694.</p>



<p>CIP-1694 improved the governance of the network, making it more decentralized with any user having powers to submit governance actions which will go through three groups: The Constitutional Committee, Delegation of Representatives, and Stake Pool Operators.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Ledger Team has added new technologies, including Plutus v3, in addition to the Haskell Code and API receiving new updates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Balaji Srinivasan has settled a high-stakes BTC bet he made in March by donating $1.5 million to charity and similar projects.&nbsp;</li>



<li>He bet on what he termed a buzz of “<em>hyperbitcoinization” </em>sweeping the financial markets in the United States.</li>



<li>With the safe haven narratives springing up once more, Srinivasan landed blows on fiat as they “<em>head towards hyperinflation.”&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Balaji Srinivasan took his Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasm to the next level by making a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/black-swan-author-nassim-taleb-weighs-in-on-balajis-1-million-bitcoin-price-prediction/">controversial bet</a> on the future price of Bitcoin in March. </p>



<p>On May 2, Srinivasan, an investor and former CTO of Coinbase announced that he has settled the bet he entered into by mutual agreement. He will now donate $1.5 million and states that it was done to prove a point because of the bad shape of the economy.</p>



<p>In March, Srinivasan coined the term “<em>hyperbitcoinization” </em>to describe the potential mass adoption that will flock to web3 due to a rapid change in global finance. The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-coinbase-cto-makes-massive-bet-that-bitcoin-will-rampage-past-1-million-within-90-days/">bet was made</a> with Twitter web3 pundit James Medlock with the terms that should BTC fail to hit $1 million within 90 days, Srinivasan would pay $1 million in USD Circle.</p>



<p>From the mutual agreement, Srinivasan would donate $500,000 to Give Directly, $500,000 to Medlock, and another $500,000 to BTC core developers. Settling the bet ahead of time he <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1653449321185169409?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">stressed</a> that he did so for the public good while criticizing public finance experts for not being reliable anymore.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“So, I settled the bet ahead of time and donated even more than I had committed. I spent my own money to send a provably costly signal that there’s something wrong with the economy and that it&#8217;s not going to be a ‘soft landing’ like Powell [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell] promises but something much worse,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hyperinflation-claims-could-drive-btc-adoption">Hyperinflation claims could drive BTC adoption</h2>



<p>Pundits have tipped Bitcoin as a store of value to counter fiat inflation when things get bad. Srinivasan is among those commentators and has stressed that the American economy will hit hyperinflation, making Bitcoin a safe haven.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-maximalist-matthew-kratter-asserts-1-million-value-for-btc-counters-balajis-forecast/">He estimates</a> a potential BTC market cap of $19.3 trillion after the period of hyperbitcoinization. Bitcoin currently has a market cap of $548 billion and exchanges for $28,325, which means, according to his projection, BTC will skyrocket by 3,369% to hit $1 million per coin. </p>

<p>While many have called this a long shot, in 2013, BTC was valued at $122, meaning the market leader surged over 23,000% in the last decade.</p>

<p>Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has vowed to continue purchasing Bitcoin, despite cryptocurrency prices fluctuating wildly of late.</p>



<p>This assertion was made by Phong Le, Chief Executive Officer of MicroStrategy, while announcing the firm’s Q1 financial results Monday. </p>



<p><em>&#8220;As you all know, our strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin, and we plan to continue to accumulate Bitcoin over time using our excess cash and with the net proceeds of capital markets transactions,&#8221;</em> said Le during the earnings call noting that Microstrategy&#8217;s core business is not impacted by near-term Bitcoin price fluctuations.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We remain committed to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy with a high degree of conviction,&#8221;</em> he added.</p>



<p>MicroStrategy has had a long-term focus and a risk-managed approach for its Bitcoin strategy. Since 2020 the firm has continued to purchase Bitcoin, with the most recent foray being for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-spends-29-million-buying-more-bitcoin-as-btc-eyes-30000/">1045 Bitcoins</a> earlier last month. Microstrategy currently holds 140,000 Bitcoins with an aggregate cost of $4.2 billion or an average of approximately $29,800 per Bitcoin. This makes MicroStrategy the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Le also reassured investors of the firm’s financial health, noting that it had repaid its $205 million Bitcoin-backed loan from Silvergate last year at a 22% discount. In March, MicroStrategy disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it used part of the proceeds from a $339.4 million public sale of its shares to pay back the loan.</p>



<p>According to Le, following the repayment, MicroStrategy recovered 34,619 Bitcoins that were serving as collateral for the loan, which is now unencumbered. As of March 31, 2023, only 11% of MicroStrategy&#8217;s total Bitcoin holdings were pledged as collateral for debt.</p>



<p>MicroStrategy&#8217;s decision to invest heavily in Bitcoin has been controversial, with some investors expressing concerns about the cryptocurrency&#8217;s volatility. However, Michael Saylor, now the company’s Executive Chairman, has remained bullish on Bitcoin, saying it&#8217;s “100% better than gold”. He has also argued that Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty.</p>



<p>That said, despite MicroStrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin stash remaining in the red for roughly a year, its bold investment has recently paid off handsomely, with the holdings <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-bitcoin-stash-now-in-the-green-as-crypto-assets-soar/">increasing in value</a> as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price surged in recent months. According to ‘Saylor Tracker’ a service that tracks MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases, the firm’s Bitcoin stash value is currently at a loss of $203 million. That said, it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin prices can rise for those holdings to turn green or if the cryptocurrency will continue plunging.</p>



<p>At press time, BTC was trading at $28,762, up 2.08% in the past seven days, as per CoinMarketCap data. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded mostly flatly Tuesday, gaining only 0.53% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>As the crypto world eagerly awaits District Judge Analisa Torres&#8217;s ruling in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">landmark case</a> between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, pro-XRP attorney John E. Deaton is hinting that the San Francisco-based enterprise blockchain company could agree to new settlement terms. Deaton, however, emphasized that this will depend on the ruling in the lawsuit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expert-s-opinion-regarding-a-likely-ripple-sec-settlement"><strong>Expert’s Opinion Regarding A Likely Ripple-SEC Settlement</strong></h2>



<p>John Deaton has taken to Twitter to highlight various scenarios that could influence Ripple’s decision on whether or not to settle.</p>



<p>Deaton’s comments come amid chatter among the community of a secret meeting between Ripple and the SEC. In his opinion, the terms of a potential settlement would depend on the specifics of the outcome of the ongoing litigation.</p>



<p>One important consideration would be whether leading U.S.-based digital assets exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken would immediately restart XRP trading on their platforms or wait for a possible appeal by the SEC. Coinbase delisted XRP in January 2021, immediately after the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">launched </a>its lawsuit against Ripple. Despite vocal appeals by the XRPArmy, Coinbase has remained unmoved.</p>



<p>Another key consideration would be whether major Ripple partner, Bank of America, would feel comfortable about the court verdict or wait to see if Judge Torres gets overturned in the event the SEC appeals her decision.</p>



<p>Deaton notes that the SEC could possibly file a notice of appeal and later withdraw it, leaving room for more negotiations.</p>



<p>The XRP amicus curiae also pinpointed a theoretical scenario in which the U.S. securities regulator told Ripple it would issue a public statement that all future sales of XRP don’t constitute securities and not appeal Judge Torres’ ruling if the payments firm agrees to pay $50 million. Deaton says, in this case, Ripple boss Bradley Garlinghouse would swiftly sign off on the settlement as this would provide the certainty the company has long clamoured for and return liquidity to the U.S. market.</p>



<p>Still, if Judge Torres rules that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-q1-2023-xrp-markets-report-shows-xrps-super-bullish-trajectory-despite-sec-lawsuit/">Ripple</a> did not violate federal securities laws and subsequently revives liquidity to U.S. markets without causing businesses to worry about being in the SEC’s crosshairs if they utilize the XRP cryptocurrency, then Ripple will ultimately decide to refrain from a settlement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After two gruelling years in the Southern District of New York, a ruling in the XRP lawsuit could further define what crypto assets are considered securities in the United States.</p>
