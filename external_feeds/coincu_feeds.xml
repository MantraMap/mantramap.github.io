<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OKX becomes the official sleeve partner for Manchester City&#8217;s men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s teams.</em></li>



<li><em>This marks their third sponsorship deal with the club in a little over a year.</em></li>



<li><em>Partnership highlights Web3 integration in sports with innovative initiatives and player murals.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>OKX <a href="https://www.mancity.com/news/club/okx-to-sponsor-manchester-city-shirt-sleeve-202324-63823725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> during an exclusive panel discussion at the Etihad Stadium that it had become Manchester City&#8217;s official sleeve partner for both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s major teams in a new multi-year relationship.</strong></h5>

<p>OKX, the premier Web3 technology company, and Manchester City Club today named OKX as the club&#8217;s official sleeve partner in a new multi-year relationship.</p>



<p>OKX and Manchester City have signed their third sponsorship agreement in little over a year. OKX became the club&#8217;s official cryptocurrency partner in March 2022, and months later, it added sponsorship of Manchester City&#8217;s training clothes. Man City has accomplished a &#8220;treble&#8221; by winning all three of its major competitions: the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the UEFA Champions League.</p>

<p>City Football Group Chief Executive Officer Ferran Soriano and OKX Global Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique were present for an exclusive unveiling at the Etihad Stadium. The sleeve was revealed as part of the event in a &#8216;virtual reveal&#8217; with a movie involving player avatars. Gael Clichy, a Manchester City great, was also there for a media Q&amp;A. In the statement, Soriano stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We are very proud to have OKX represented on the sleeve of the Manchester City shirt. We have already seen great web3 experiences designed by OKX for Manchester City’s global fan base and there will be many more to come.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>City Football Group (CFG) is a British conglomerate that owns Manchester City as well as other soccer clubs such as New York City FC and Melbourne City FC. Newton Investment and Development LLC, an Abu Dhabi-based firm completely controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, owns the majority of CFG.</p>



<p>Haider Rafique added:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The journey with the Man City team has been incredible. Manchester City was our first official global brand partnership and in just a year and a half we have come a long way. We always intended to integrate with the sport and help the Club lead on leaning into Web3. Fast forward fifteen months, we now have a metaverse, an NFT initiative and a number of other new projects that we are excited about.</p>

<p>OKX also became a presenting partner for City&#8217;s 2022 trophy tour as part of last year&#8217;s agreement. OKX commissioned street artist Akse P19 and Global Street Art Agency to paint murals in Manchester portraying Manchester City players Erling Haaland, Jack Grealish, Joao Cancelo, and John Stones.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC finds recent applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs insufficient due to clarity and thoroughness.</em></li>



<li><em>Asset managers, including Fidelity and Ark Investment, are modifying their applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs.</em></li>



<li><em>Approval of a Bitcoin ETF could revolutionize the industry by increasing accessibility and transforming the cryptocurrency market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to persons familiar with the subject, the Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that a recent wave of applications submitted by asset managers to create spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) is insufficient, <em>WSJ</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-says-spot-bitcoin-etf-filings-are-inadequate-390336e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-1024x683.png" alt="BREAKING: SEC Says Bitcoin ETF Filings Are Inadequate, Market Panic" class="wp-image-199280" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2310.png 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BREAKING: SEC Says Bitcoin ETF Filings Are Inadequate, Market Panic 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to the persons, the agency notified exchanges Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets, which submitted the applications on behalf of asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, that the files weren&#8217;t sufficiently clear and thorough.</p>



<p>Following in BlackRock&#8217;s footsteps were a slew of conventional and crypto asset managers. In recent days, Fidelity Investments, Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Investment Management, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise Asset Management, and Valkyrie have all revived or modified their applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<p>Since 2017, the SEC has frequently rejected such funds on the grounds that they are prone to fraud and market manipulation. At least a half-dozen ETFs that hold Bitcoin futures are already available.</p>



<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) trading volume increased as a result of the current interest from mainstream players in Bitcoin ETFs. Nonetheless, analysts believe that the SEC in the United States may be obliged to accept the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF proposal soon.</p>



<p>Since Grayscale filed an appeal against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s decision to deny its application in June 2022, the two sides have exchanged legal files in addition to oral evidence heard by three U.S. federal appellate court judges on March 7.</p>

<p>Prices for Bitcoin and other crypto-related equities have risen since <a href="https://coincu.com/195477-blackrock-to-expand-more-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a> submitted paperwork with the SEC for an ETF that contains genuine Bitcoin in mid-June. The cryptocurrency has risen by approximately 20%, surpassing $30,000 for the first time since April. At the same time period, shares of Coinbase Global, which is listed as the custodian for the BlackRock fund&#8217;s assets, have risen by more than 30%.</p>



<p>Several industry observers believed that BlackRock&#8217;s submission would allay the SEC&#8217;s worries by committing to share &#8220;monitoring&#8221; of a spot Bitcoin trading platform with Nasdaq, which would list the ETF.</p>



<p>An ETF that reflects the real price of Bitcoin would be a game changer for the industry since it would allow more people to invest in the cryptocurrency. It would enable investors to purchase and sell Bitcoin via a brokerage account in the same way that they do stocks.</p>



<p>The day after the news, Bitcoin and the entire crypto market had a massive crash that erased today&#8217;s bull efforts.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that Pham Minh Chinh, Vietnam&#8217;s prime minister, has already highlighted the necessity for the government to properly explore cryptocurrency legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum (ETH) has shown stability compared to Bitcoin and modest gains compared to some altcoins during a recent downward correction.</em></li>



<li><em>The price of Ethereum has recently increased by over 8%, with positive investor sentiment.</em></li>



<li><em>Breaking through resistance at $1,925 could lead to further rises toward $2,040 and potentially surpass the $2,125 barrier.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum (ETH) is showing similar stability to Bitcoin. Contrary to the recent gallop of some altcoins, ETH remains one of the large-cap coins with modest gains.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-1024x683.png" alt="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target?" class="wp-image-199242" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2301.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target? 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>Ethereum price started a downward correction below $1,885 following a spike to $1,900 today. <a href="/t/eth/">ETH</a> previously spiked below $1,820 on June 15, but the drop has been limited, unlike Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Besides, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shows that <a href="https://coincu.com/t/eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ETH</a> is lagging behind other tokens is not an issue.</p>



<p>A user inquired about Buterin&#8217;s thoughts on the US Governmental approach to cryptocurrency in light of recent enforcements. The Ethereum creator expressed regret that significant projects like as Solana are being targeted in this manner. He said that these blockchains do not deserve this treatment.</p>



<p>He said that if Ethereum wins and all other blockchains are booted off crypto exchanges, it would not be an honorable way to win. But, he claims that this isn&#8217;t even a long-term win.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="959" height="640" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302.png" alt="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target?" class="wp-image-199247" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302.png 959w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302-768x513.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2302-750x501.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" title="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target? 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>The price of Ethereum has increased as purchasing power has accumulated near support levels, signaling a positive mindset and increased investor interest. Ethereum&#8217;s price has surged by more than 8% in the previous 24 hours. With its present momentum and the broader rising trend in the crypto market, Ethereum might reclaim the $2,000 level if Bitcoin&#8217;s price continues to rise into the $35,000 region.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="623" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-1024x623.png" alt="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target?" class="wp-image-199236" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-1024x623.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-300x182.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-768x467.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-1536x934.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-2048x1246.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-750x456.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2297-1140x693.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ethereum Stable At $1,820, What About $2,000 Target? 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>Through the price chart above, to hit $2,000, ETH needs to break through its nearest resistance level at $1,925. In the near term, the $1,820 price zone is unlikely to come back, as if the price hits this level again, it would mean that recent gains have been erased. Closing above $1,925 might spark a new rise. The next level of resistance is at $2,000, over which the price might increase to $2,040. Any more advances might push Ether beyond the $2,125 barrier level.</p>



<p>The fact that the current price is at the Fib 50% level is also a condition for ETH to slow down the uptrend, if there is a breakout, it is likely that the price will break above the Fib 61.8% level corresponding to $1,950.</p>

<p>Other improvements include extended testing coverage for third-party EVM contracts and full backward compatibility with all Scilla contracts currently in the Scilla 0.13.3 release. This reinforces Zilliqa&#8217;s commitment to security and robust functionality.</p>



<p>Additionally, the upgrade includes various bug fixes, improved server-side resiliency and overall network performance improvements, the introduction of enhanced search and tracking capabilities for developers, and support for Extended development platform support.</p>



<p>The Zilliqa team will provide quick updates on the completion of the upgrade and appreciate the understanding and patience of all network participants during this period.</p>



<p>Zilliqa (ZIL) is one of the cryptocurrencies designed to solve the scalability and transaction processing problems plaguing the Ethereum network. However, the recent Ethereum consolidation and stiff competition in the Layer 2 scaling space with newer protocols offering higher throughput have declined Zilliqa (ZIL) usage.</p>



<p>However, the positive news about improvements from the main network update motivates the ZIL price to increase sharply by nearly 9% in the past 24 hours. Currently, ZIL is trading at $0.212.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>South Korea passes first independent cryptocurrency bill to strengthen investor protection.</em></li>



<li><em>19 cryptocurrency-related bills integrated, imposing penalties for violations, insurance, and reserves required.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>South Korea passed the first independent cryptocurrency bill to strengthen investor protection, integrating 19 cryptocurrency-related bills, including imposing penalties for violations such as the use of non-public information, market manipulation, and unfair trading practices, Insurance, reserves, and necessary record keeping are required. </strong></h5>

<p>South Korea&#8217;s parliament recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-30/south-korea-passes-inaugural-standalone-crypto-bill-after-spate-of-scandals" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-30/south-korea-passes-inaugural-standalone-crypto-bill-after-spate-of-scandals" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed</a> the Virtual Asset User Protection legislation to boost investor protection and regulate crypto. This legislation includes penalties for violations such as the use of non-public information, market manipulation, and unfair trading practices. The Financial Services Commission will oversee crypto operators and asset custodians, and the Bank of Korea will have the power to investigate these platforms. The act requires insurance coverage, reserve funds, and necessary record-keeping. The rules cover assets such as Bitcoin, while existing capital-markets law applies to tokens deemed securities.</p>



<p>The legislation comes just over a year after the implosion of tokens created by South Korean crypto entrepreneur Do Kwon exacerbated a $2 trillion crypto-market rout. Kwon was recently sentenced to four months in jail in Montenegro for trying to travel with a forged passport. He is wanted by South Korea and the US after the 2022 collapse of his TerraUSD and Luna coins wiped out at least $40 billion.</p>



<p>Investors were recently reminded of the risks in the digital-asset sector when two crypto lenders with links to South Korea halted withdrawals in quick succession in June. In March, a high-profile Seoul murder case linked to crypto investment losses stoked calls for politicians to accelerate new rules.</p>



<p>The Korea Blockchain Enterprise Promotion Association in Seoul welcomes the authorities&#8217; attempt to build order, but they argue that the law remains stuck in the perspective of traditional finance in terms of regulating crypto, which may suppress the industry rather than promote it.</p>



<p>Jurisdictions around the world are stepping up efforts to regulate digital assets. Places like Hong Kong and Dubai are seeking to attract crypto investment, while the European Union recently passed its landmark Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) regulation. US agencies have implemented a crackdown after a string of blowups, including the FTX exchange&#8217;s bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The Korean Financial Services Commission&#8217;s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) seized Delio&#8217;s virtual asset operating and financial data today and is conducting an on-site examination.</p>



<p>Delio is also being investigated by South Korean authorities, according to reports. Prior to June 25, it was reported that South Korean authorities had barred top officials from leaving the country from B&amp;S Holdings, Delio, and Haru Invest. </p>



<p>The company&#8217;s creditors previously filed to the Seoul Bankruptcy Court through the LKB &amp; Partners law firm for the company&#8217;s bankruptcy reorganization process (the original court took over proceedings), and the law firm is presently bringing a class action lawsuit against Haru Invest and Delio.</p>

<p>Delio announced the suspension of withdrawals on June 14 due to Haru Invest, and South Korean authorities have barred top company officials from leaving the country. It said on June 26 that it would begin cryptocurrency deposit and withdrawal services on June 28 for the following coins: Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Tezos (XTZ), Polkadot (DOT), Kusama (KSM), Near (NEAR).</p>



<p>The company gave a bogus explanation on the day of the suspension of daily deposit and withdrawal, claiming, &#8220;It has nothing to do with Haru,&#8221; but the firm confessed the following day that he deposited virtual assets on the same day.</p>

<p>Yet, since Haru is not registered with the government as a VASP, it is not subject to FIU control; nonetheless, its management, like Delio, was sued by the prosecution.</p>

<p>Venom Network is a layer 0 blockchain developed by the Venom Foundation and is also the first network supervised under the authority of ADGM &#8211; Abu Dhabi Global Market International Financial Center.</p>



<p>According to the Venom Foundation, their mission is to promote the widespread adoption of blockchain technology. They provide innovative technologies and frameworks that comply with the law and create a secure environment for a wide range of users, from retail customers to institutions and sovereign states.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Unique asynchronous architecture</h2>



<p>Venom Network is a unique blockchain with asynchronous architecture. The network&#8217;s unparalleled innovation ensures endless scalability, low costs, and fast transactions. All those advantages are mainly due to its robust system design.</p>



<p>Asynchronous blockchain technology deviates from the order of transactions, which is why Venom Network promotes high scalability. Real-time processing and the large volume of transactions. Venom Network has very little difficulty achieving these specifications. When the network encounters too many trades, validators split into pools to process concurrent transactions, known as &#8220;split events.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="805" height="242" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290.png" alt="Venom Network Review: Increase Scalability With Asynchronous Architecture" class="wp-image-199211" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290.png 805w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290-300x90.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290-768x231.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2290-750x225.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" title="Venom Network Review: Increase Scalability With Asynchronous Architecture 22"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Structure of Venom Network</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A heterogeneous multi-blockchain platform with dynamic sharding that is one of a kind and consists of a main chain, a work chain, and a shard chain, all of which work together as part of a powerful blockchain technology Venom Network&#8217;s power.</p>



<p>The three layers support parallel transaction processing, so Venom Network can process between 100,000 and 1 million transactions per second (TPS).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Main chain</strong></h3>



<p>As a layer 0 blockchain, it ensures that all necessary information is present to reach a consensus among validators. Therefore, you must consider this as a coordinator with significant responsibility for the workflow and the fragment chain. Information such as network configuration, implementation and scope of validators, and election rounds are all stored on the main chain. This is where the shard configuration begins and where you will find the latest block hash of the shard chain, where you will find the origin of our blockchain.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Workchains</strong></h3>



<p>Workchains are layer 1 blockchains hanging below the main chain. Each workchain features state transitions, cryptographic primitives, transaction or block structures, and native crypto while enjoying the security of the main chain. Rigorous security by consensus and central chain validator provides an opportunity for heterogeneous Venom Blockchain. Workchains can take on different roles and operate independently of each other. Venom has up to 2³² workstreams to support the Foundation&#8217;s grand ambitions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shardchains</strong></h3>



<p>Each Shardchain has the same DNA as the work chain. However, the liability is much more limited as it belongs to only a small group of accounts. Each chain has its own memory space, consisting of a set of smart contracts stored on the blockchain. Shardchain is limited to the transactions of these contracts only. With 2⁶⁰ shardchains per workchain, a huge amount of capacity can be accessed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>General advantages of asynchronous blockchain:</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Scalability</strong>: One of the critical benefits of asynchronous blockchain technology is its scalability under high transaction volumes. This is done through dynamic sharding, which allows a blockchain to process transactions in parallel and significantly increases its overall throughput.</li>



<li><strong>Faster Transaction Processing</strong>: Asynchronous blockchain technology allows transactions to be processed independently of each other instead of in a sequential order. This means that transactions can be processed significantly faster, making it suitable for applications that require real-time processing.</li>



<li><strong>Lower costs</strong>: Asynchronous blockchain technology allows a blockchain to process transactions in parallel instead of sequentially. This means less processing power is needed to process a certain number of transactions, which can lead to lower costs for businesses and organizations. Users do not need to pay extra gas fees for transactions in front of the pool, as is done in outdated queuing methods like BTC and ETH.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dynamic sharding</strong></h3>



<p>The feature used by Everscale, Ethereum 2.0. Dynamic sharding enables increased transaction processing capacity and network capacity. In addition, Venom Network allows to adjustment the number of shards based on network needs to ensure the platform can handle large transaction volumes without compromising security or decentralization.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Threaded Virtual Machine (TVM)</strong></h3>



<p>TVM helps to increase processing speed and improve network performance compared to traditional virtual machines. In addition, the TVM used on the Venom Blockchain is similar to the EVM on Ethereum, playing an essential role in the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications on the blockchain.</p>



<p>However, the disadvantage of TVM is that it is challenging for developers because most developers will be more used to EVM than TVM. Therefore, to overcome this weakness, Venom Blockchain only allows the integration of EVM and other virtual machines in shardchains &#8211; an area with lower security than Basechain and Masterchain.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Threaded Solidity (T-Sol)</strong></h3>



<p>T-Sol is a new programming language exclusively for Venom Network. Therefore, T-Sol still needs to be more widely used and supported by the community than the Solidity language. This can be difficult for developers when they want to use T-Sol to build on Venom. However, given the size of Venom, many people are expected to support and use T-Sol in the future.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venom Wallet</strong></h3>



<p>It is a non-custodial crypto wallet for storing digital assets derived from the Venom blockchain, such as VENOM tokens, NFTs, and other custom tokens. Other functions include sending and receiving tokens, accessing Web3 marketplaces, swapping between multiple tokens, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venom Bridge</strong></h3>



<p>A bridge is a dApp that facilitates the exchange of digital tokens from one blockchain to another. The Venom Bridge supports such swaps between the Venom, Fantom (FTM), BNB Chain (BSC), and Ethereum networks</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venom pool</strong></h3>



<p>Validators who wish to verify transactions on Venom will use the Pool feature to stake their VENOM tokens, redeem rewards, and engage in other governance activities. This feature is currently in testnet mode</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Web3World</strong></h3>



<p>A Venom blockchain-based decentralized exchange (DEX) relies on an automated market maker (AMM) model to generate liquidity. It offers the widest range of swap pairs with high liquidity as deep as possible. Similarly, as of publication, this DEX is yet to launch officially.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venom scanner</strong></h3>



<p>As the name suggests, a scanner is a discovery service that allows users to track transactions, fee trends, and other critical network-related metrics;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oasis Gallery</strong></h3>



<p>This is the first NFT marketplace on Venom Network to support a non-fungible token created natively on Venom. Users can browse, buy, sell, and trade these digital assets here as it launches.</p>



<p>These are official apps created and maintained by Venom Foundation only. Communities can also create and launch custom apps cost-effectively, meaning that with increased adoption, the number of dApps on Venom will surely grow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Venom Network Tokenomics</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>VENOM token</strong></h3>



<p>The Venom blockchain features a native platform cryptocurrency known as the VENOM token, which is a transfer of value within the Venom Network.</p>



<p>The VENOM token is currently inflated, with an initial market supply of 7.2 billion tokens. The document shows that the Foundation plans to change its supply metrics and transition to a deflationary model once several key metrics are achieved, including adoption, volume, and utility.</p>



<p>VENOM serves four main purposes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Payment of transaction fees;</li>



<li>Governance through PoS consensus mechanism;</li>



<li>Incentivize validators to participate in the transaction verification process to receive rewards;</li>



<li>Increase network security by attracting enough validators.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WVENOM token</strong></h4>



<p>VENOM is the native token of the Venom blockchain, and WVENOM is a TIP-3 standard token implemented in smart contract code. DeFi protocols only support TIP-3 for ease of deployment and general compatibility, in this respect, the Venom network follows standard practice in most blockchains.</p>



<p>WVENOM is a swappable TIP-3 token issued 1-1 with the VENOM token. You always have the option of converting your WVENOM back to VENOM.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Gas and fees</h2>



<p>A specific amount of Venom tokens must be attached when sending a message to the network. This is used to compensate validators for their work, cover the costs of storing the message on the network, and return any remaining balance as change.</p>



<p>There are several important characteristics of commissions:</p>



<ul>
<li>The cost per unit of gas on the network is fixed and is outlined in the global configuration, which can only be modified by the consensus of validators.</li>



<li>The network also charges a commission for data storage for the entire duration of their existence in the network.</li>



<li>The commission is always paid from the contract balance, as external messages cannot be value-bearing messages.</li>



<li>The user decides how many VENOM to attach as payment fees from their contract account for the call. The attached value is the upper limit for the cost of executing the call chain. Typically, the DApp automatically suggests a recommended value for the user.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each phase is associated with its own type of fee. Inbound external message fee: the only fee that is not related to the transaction execution phases described. It is charged when a transaction is initiated by an external message as a fee for sending the message (forward message fee).</p>



<p>Fees in the context of execution phases:</p>



<ul>
<li>Storage: related to the namesake fee (Storage fee) and charged for storing the contract and associated data.</li>



<li>Credit: the only phase that does not involve charging any fee.</li>



<li>Compute: charges a fee (Gas fee) for calculations performed in the called account (contract).</li>



<li>Action: each outgoing message from the contract, both external and internal, must be paid a fee (Action fee) as a fee for sending the message.</li>



<li>Bounce: in case of an error, an exception will be created, and an internal outgoing message will be taken, for which a fee will be charged as a fee for sending the message.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>With a rapidly changing technology like blockchain, there is a need for a protocol that is more future-proof than first and second-generation networks. Venom Network is heralding an innovative idea of having multiple layers supporting more than one type of blockchain.</p>



<p>With fast confirmation speeds, low transaction fees, regulatory compliance, and highly secure credentials, Venom is poised to be a remarkable smart contract and Web3 blockchain that competes directly with industry leaders current industry leader.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The tokens scheduled for burning are TRXOLD, PAX, DAI, USDP, PAXG (on the Binance Smart Chain), PAXG (on the Binance Chain), BUSD, and USDC. These tokens represent a range of digital assets that have been pegged to their corresponding fiat currencies or assets, providing users with liquidity and stability.</p>



<p>By burning these idle tokens, BNB aims to enhance the efficiency of its token ecosystem. The act of token burning involves permanently removing a certain quantity of tokens from circulation, thereby reducing the total supply. This reduction in supply often contributes to price stability and can generate positive effects on market dynamics.</p>



<p>However, the token burning process initiated by BNB is distinct from the traditional concept of token burning, as it is tied to the release of collateral on their native networks. This approach allows BNB to maintain a balanced utilization of resources while ensuring the liquidity and availability of the underlying assets.</p>

<p>Binance&#8217;s decision to burn these specific Binance-pegged tokens underscores the exchange&#8217;s commitment to actively manage its token ecosystem and optimize the allocation of resources. By releasing the equivalent amount of collateral tied to these tokens, BNB aims to enhance liquidity and support the broader crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>As token burning has become a widely adopted practice among various blockchain projects and exchanges, market participants will closely observe the potential impact of this move on the supply dynamics of the burned tokens. Additionally, stakeholders will monitor how the release of collateral contributes to the overall stability and liquidity of the respective native networks.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s proactive approach in managing its token ecosystem reflects the company&#8217;s ongoing efforts to adapt and optimize its operations. By strategically burning idle tokens and releasing collateral, Binance aims to strengthen its position as a leading cryptocurrency exchange while promoting a healthy and efficient crypto market ecosystem.</p>
