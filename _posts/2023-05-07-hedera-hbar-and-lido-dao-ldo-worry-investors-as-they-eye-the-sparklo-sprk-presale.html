<p class="s5">The blockchain space is home to some of the most notable projects. From Hedera (HBAR) and Lido DAO (LDO), investors have historically begun to diversify their holdings with the goal of getting the most out of the space in regard to returns. </p>
<p class="s5">However, with their recent bearish performance, investors have begun turning to presale-stage projects, out of which Sparklo has gained a lot of attention. Today, we will go over why this is the case and will analyze each one of these cryptocurrencies individually.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Sparklo (SPRK) Gains a Lot of Attention from Investors</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo will be an investment platform that specializes in providing each user an opportunity to get into the luxury investment space, with an opportunity to diversify their portfolio with silver, gold, and platinum.</p>
<p class="s5">Every time someone makes an investment on top of the platform, a non-fungible token (NFT) gets minted and then diversifies.</p>
<p class="s5">Then, each investor will have the opportunity to either buy an entire NFT or buy a fraction of it. If they buy the entire NFT, they can then get it delivered to them at a location of their choosing.</p>
<p class="s5">Moreover, the project has been audited by the InterFi Network, and its liquidity will get locked for 100 years. As for the value of the SPRK token, at its presale, it trades at a value of just $0.017. Analysts predict a 4,000% increase in value within the next few months, providing early investors with a solid opportunity.</p>
<p class="s9">Hedera (HBAR) Worries Investors with a 17.6% Decrease</p>
<p class="s5">Hedera (HBAR) &nbsp;made huge waves on Twitter after they announced that the total transactions on top of the network reached 8 billion. In the last 15 days alone, Hedera (HBAR) reached one billion transactions, leading to a high level of momentum for the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s5">Despite this massive milestone, the value of the Hedera (HBAR) cryptocurrency has been in decline.</p>
<p class="s5">As of April 2, 2023, Hedera (HBAR) traded at $0.058200. In the last 30 days, Hedera (HBAR) decreased in value by 17.6%, and in the last 24 hours, its overall decrease was at 4.8%.</p>
<p class="s9">Lido DAO (LDO) Sees Massive 18.3% Dip</p>
<p class="s5">Lido DAO (LDO) made an announcement surrounding their most recent Node Operator Community Call, where they went over the slashing incident update, the V2 testnet status and updates, and updates on the Lido DTV testnet.</p>
<p class="s5">Moreover, on April 28, Lido DAO (LDO) announced that the V2 release was approaching and that the bounty for the not yet deployed code for Lido V2 has been raised to $1m per critical finding.</p>
<p class="s5">As for its value, the Lido DAO (LDO) cryptocurrency traded at $1.96 as of May 2, 2023.</p>
