<h2>US House Committee Advances 4 Crypto Bills</h2>
<p>The U.S. House Financial Services Committee passed four digital asset bills last week. Following the passing of the bills, Kristin Smith, CEO of Blockchain Association, tweeted Friday: &#8220;This is a result of a coordinated effort to educate + support crypto’s Congressional champions.&#8221; The executive continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>This week was a milestone for the American crypto industry, and for the promise of real progress on the path toward a workable regulatory framework in the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>The four bills are the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, and the Keep Your Coins Act.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmakers-advance-fit-for-the-21st-century-act-to-establish-crypto-framework/">FIT for the 21st Century Act</a> establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for the issuance and trading of digital assets at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act &#8220;provides that blockchain developers and providers of blockchain services that do not take control of consumer funds are not deemed financial institutions or money service businesses under the law,&#8221; the committee detailed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-house-financial-services-committee-passes-stablecoin-legislation-after-a-few-fireworks/">Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act</a> recognizes several regulatory paths for approving and regulating stablecoin issuers. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-house-committee-passes-keep-your-coins-act-to-protect-right-to-self-custody-crypto/">Keep Your Coins Act</a> protects the self-custody of crypto.</p>

<p>“These votes are a big deal for crypto in the U.S.,&#8221; Smith opined. &#8220;While there’s more work to do, and the FIT 21 Act is not yet perfect, we’re excited by the progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting that “Congress is asserting its authority to design a regulatory framework, rather than allowing overzealous federal agencies to fill the gap with enforcement actions,&#8221; the executive emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s the first time crypto regulatory bills have been voted out of committee, on their way to a full House vote.</p></blockquote>

<h2>RFK Jr. and Ron Paul on Free Market</h2>
<p>Former U.S. Representative Ron Paul has expressed his agreement with U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.), who recently said that America does not have a free market. Kennedy is a son of former U.S. Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Paul, an American author, physician, and retired politician, served as a U.S. representative and made three attempts to become the president of the United States. In 2015, he founded the Ron Paul Liberty Report, a platform dedicated to offering insightful opinions and analysis on contemporary issues affecting our lives and finances.</p>
<p>Paul tweeted Saturday: “RFK Jr. recently pointed out that America doesn’t have a free market, but rather a crony corporatist system. He’s right!”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-600439 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ron-pauls-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="915" height="573" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ron-pauls-tweet-300x188.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ron-pauls-tweet-768x481.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ron-pauls-tweet.jpg 915w" sizes="(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px" /></p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet, Paul wrote: “The problem in America is not our ability to voluntarily transact with one another. The problem is the persistent removal of that ability; a removal conducted by the bond between politicians and crony corporations. So called ‘public/private partnerships’ are the problem.” In the Ron Paul Liberty Report episode aired on Friday, the former congressman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crfNDC9Icu8">explained</a> why he believes RFK Jr. “is right.”</p>

<p>On July 26, RFK Jr. said during an <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1684052425056079876">interview</a> with Fox News: “We have a system of cushy socialism for the super-rich, and this brutal, savage, merciless capitalism for the poor. And it&#8217;s all designed to strip-mine the middle class of this country of all their equity, all of their assets, and move it to the upper echelons.” The presidential candidate tweeted following the interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don’t have free market capitalism in this country. What we have is socialism for the super-rich and brutal capitalism for the poor.</p></blockquote>

He stressed: &#8220;It will break down in the regional banks, which support 60% of the economy &#8230; We’ve started to see the cracks.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Kevin O&#8217;Leary Foresees More Bank Failures</h2>
<p>Shark Tank star Kevin O&#8217;Leary, chairman of O&#8217;Shares Investments and O&#8217;Leary Ventures, has predicted that more banks in the U.S. will fail as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates.</p>
<p>Sharing his prediction in an interview with CNBC on Thursday after the Fed announced its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-federal-funds-rate-by-25bps-amidst-moderate-economic-growth/">latest interest rate hike</a>, O&#8217;Leary stressed: “You keep squeezing the toothpaste tube, you keep rolling it up, you keep raising rates, and you know things are going to break, you just don’t know when and where.” Mr. Wonderful opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am just predicting — and I am very cautious on this — it will break down in the regional banks, which supports 60% of the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Shark Tank star cautioned that the rapid rise in the cost of capital is “killing” regional banks “on their real estate loans.”</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that prevailing economic conditions suggest that monetary policy will likely need to be restrictive for longer. “I would say that what our eyes are telling us is that policy has not been restrictive enough for long enough to have its full desired effects,” the Fed chair said. “We intend to keep policy restrictive until we’re confident inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2% target, and we’re prepared to further tighten if that’s appropriate.”</p>

<p>O’Leary shared: “I am telling investors that I work with and I advise &#8230; let’s wait 90 days to see what happens in the small banking arena in the United States.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wonderful further predicted that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates beyond its current projections. “Terminal rate, where the Fed stops, could be 6.25, could be 6.50 … So you’ve really got to think about this if you think about the long term and the short-term effect,” he warned, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve started to see the cracks, the Titanic has not sunk.</p></blockquote>
<p>A number of banks in the U.S. have failed this year. Last week, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-us-bank-collapses-heartland-tri-state-bank-closed-by-regulator/">Heartland Tri-State Bank</a> collapsed. On March 10, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/first-citizens-bank-acquires-silicon-valley-bank-costing-fdic-deposit-insurance-fund-an-estimated-20b/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Silicon Valley Bank</a> was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. On March 12, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/signature-bank-closure-has-nothing-to-do-with-crypto-says-regulator/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Signature Bank</a> was closed by the New York State Department of Financial Services. On May 1, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/" target="_self" rel="noopener">First Republic Bank</a> was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Moreover, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/silvergate-bank-announces-voluntary-liquidation-as-crypto-industry-woes-persist/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Silvergate Bank</a> announced voluntary liquidation.</p>
<p>Several individuals have predicted a surge in regional bank failures due to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s ongoing interest rate hikes. Back in April, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, warned that regional banks are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-regional-banks-are-being-wiped-out-calls-fed-criminal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being wiped out</a> because of Fed policies. Economist Peter Schiff echoed these concerns earlier this month, stating that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-all-banks-will-fail-people-will-suffer-massive-losses-as-banking-crisis-unfolds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all banks will fail</a> and people will suffer massive losses as the banking crisis unfolds.</p>

The study, titled &#8220;The Economic Potential of Generative AI&#8221; and published June 14, 2023, analyzes the impact AI tools like Chatgpt could have across sectors.</strong></p>
<h2>McKinsey &amp; Company Study: &#8216;Generative AI Is Poised to Unleash the Next Wave of Productivity&#8217;</h2>
<p>The consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company estimates generative AI could add $2.6 to $4.4 trillion in global value per year by enhancing productivity across 63 different use cases. This would increase AI&#8217;s overall contribution to the economy 15-40% above previous projections that did not account for advances like natural language processing. The study emphasizes that industries ranging from banking to pharmaceuticals are poised to reap the most rewards in terms of revenue share.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#/">report</a> cautions that realizing the full potential requires adapting business practices and reskilling workforces for new roles. Although, McKinsey &amp; Company says rapid adoption could boost annual global productivity growth up to 0.6 percentage points through 2040. Researchers say it underscores the importance of understanding where generative AI can create the most value as companies race to implement applications.</p>

<p>However, the report’s authors insist excitement over expanding capabilities needs tempering to address risks around misinformation, security, and job losses in automated work. Supporting transitions to new types of work will be pivotal to ensuring economic gains don&#8217;t accrue disproportionately. On the other hand, McKinsey &amp; Company researchers say if AI is thoughtfully implemented, the scale of opportunity makes generative AI&#8217;s emergence a watershed for global growth.</p>
<h2>Goldman Sachs Research Study Concurs, &#8216;Generative AI Could Raise Global GDP by 7%&#8217;</h2>
<p>McKinsey &amp; Company is not the only organization that sees economic growth in generative AI. Goldman Sachs Research also suggests that breakthroughs in generative AI have the potential to bring about sweeping changes to the global economy, driving a 7% (or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP. The investment bank said on April 5, 2023, that advances in AI tools using natural language processing could also lift worldwide productivity by 1.5 percentage points through 2033.</p>
<p>“Despite significant uncertainty around the potential for generative AI, its ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects,” wrote Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani in their April 5 <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html">report</a> titled &#8220;Generative AI could raise global GDP by 7%.&#8221;</p>

<p>The economists estimate this new wave of AI systems may also have a major impact on employment, with shifts in workflows potentially exposing the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs to automation. Analyzing databases detailing the task content of over 900 occupations, Goldman estimates roughly two-thirds of U.S. jobs are exposed to some degree of automation by AI. The bank says up to half the workload in exposed occupations could be replaced, but not all automated work will lead to layoffs.</p>
<p>While McKinsey &amp; Company and Goldman Sachs are optimistic about AI, the year before, many financial institutions were excited about the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-reportedly-axing-metaverse-division-amidst-company-restructuring/">metaverse hype</a>, which did not pan out well the following year.</p>

She anticipates further upheaval within the banking industry. The strategist articulated her belief that we have not yet witnessed the &#8220;full damage&#8221; wrought by the rate increases and their subsequent impact on the U.S. economy.</strong></p>
<h2>QI Research&#8217;s CEO Analyzes the Fed&#8217;s 22-Year Interest Rate Peak</h2>
<p>This year marked a tumultuous period in the U.S. banking industry, with three of the largest bank failures in American history occurring in just a few short weeks. Then, last Friday, the Kansas banking regulator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-us-bank-collapses-heartland-tri-state-bank-closed-by-regulator/">took action by shuttering</a> Heartland Tri-State Bank. Much like the three aforementioned banks, this financial institution was placed into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).</p>
<p>On July 27, 2023, Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist at QI Research, made an appearance in a <a href="https://youtu.be/kqBxSh6Jdxg">video interview</a> with Kitco News&#8217; lead anchor and editor-in-chief, Michelle Makori, sharing insights about the predicted turbulence ahead. In the conversation, DiMartino Booth shed light on the recent <a href="https://therealdeal.com/la/2023/07/27/jpmorgan-chase-to-buy-1-8b-in-mortgages-from-banc-of-california/">&#8216;forced&#8217; merger</a> between Pacwest and Banc of California, attributing the fallout to “Federal Reserve policy.”</p>

<p>She informed Makori, “After First Republic, the assumption in the investing community was that Pacwest would be the next bank to go. So what we&#8217;re seeing is something that is slow-moving in nature, but if you&#8217;re having forced marriages, and JPMorgan announcing that it&#8217;s going to be buying $2 billion of mortgages from this brokered deal, we&#8217;re clearly still in a situation with tightening lending standards.”</p>
<p>DiMartino Booth explained that a “slow-rolling recession” is encroaching, and she argues that the reverberations of the Fed&#8217;s elevated rates will wreak further turmoil in the economy. Other financial experts and analysts share her sentiments, including gold enthusiast and economist <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-advises-get-out-of-the-dollar-says-the-usd-is-being-destroyed/">Peter Schiff</a>, as well as Rich Dad Poor Dad author <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosakis-warnings-giant-crash-incoming-end-of-us-dollar-approaching/">Robert Kiyosaki</a>.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/which-banks-are-in-danger-of-failing/#:~:text=Recently%2C%20a%20report%20posted%20on,high%20proportion%20of%20uninsured%20deposits.">research paper</a> unveiled on the Social Science Research Network, it was revealed that 186 U.S. banks are teetering on the edge of failure, imperiled by a considerable volume of uninsured deposits and the Fed&#8217;s towering interest rates. “I don&#8217;t think that we have seen the full brunt, the full outcome, the full damage that rate hikes past are going to take on the economy,” DiMartino Booth conveyed to the show host.</p>
<p>The chief strategist at QI Research added:</p>
<blockquote><p>The New York Federal Reserve put out a survey just a few days ago that indicated that lenders that extend credit for mortgages and auto loans and credit cards, that they foresee going out into the future, the highest rejection rates for U.S. households in the history of them doing business.</p></blockquote>
<p>DiMartino Booth went on to express her anticipation that American banks are poised to reel from the collapse of commercial real estate. At present, the QI CEO discerns a great deal of &#8220;pretending&#8221; transpiring within the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/charlie-munger-raises-concerns-over-troubled-commercial-property-loans-at-us-banks/">commercial real estate industry</a>. Demonstrating her faith in precious metals, the strategist holds a bullish stance on gold, while maintaining no exposure to U.S. stocks. Furthermore, she noted that her current allocation in gold surpasses what she would typically assign to the asset.</p>

Starting from July 29, the average onchain fees have fallen below the $1 threshold for each transaction, and as of July 31, 2023, the average fee stands at 0.000026 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $0.778 per transfer.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin&#x2019;s Reduced Onchain Fees and Falling Unconfirmed Transactions Mark the Start of the Week</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On Monday, July 31, 2023, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m">figures</a> from bitinfocharts.com reveal that the average onchain fee on the Bitcoin blockchain has tumbled below $1 for each transaction. As it stands, the average fee on Monday measures at 0.000026 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $0.778 per transaction, and the <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html#3m">median-sized fee</a> is 0.0000085 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $0.251 per transfer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Back on July 27, the average onchain fee stood at $1.482, and from that point, it has declined 47.5%, while median-sized transfer fees on the Bitcoin blockchain have decreased by 57.88% since that day.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-600455 size-full" title="Bitcoin Onchain Fees Dive Below $1, Pending Transactions Drop, and Miners Experience Difficulty Reduction" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/avfg.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Onchain Fees Dive Below $1, Pending Transactions Drop, and Miners Experience Difficulty Reduction" width="1280" height="350" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/avfg-300x82.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/avfg-1024x280.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/avfg-768x210.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/avfg.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://archive.ph/Z7Nig#selection-2425.1-2425.8">Data captured</a> on Monday reveals that the number of unconfirmed transactions has fallen beneath the 300K threshold, with precisely 291,721 pending transactions as of 8:08 a.m. Eastern Time on July 31. In addition, metrics from mempool.space indicate a decline in fees to $0.33 per transaction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To clear the entire backlog of 291,721 pending transfers, equivalent to 185 megabytes (MB), around 100 blocks must be mined. The average block time has hovered close to or even under the ten-minute average, standing at 8 minutes per block.</p>

<p>Miners have recently witnessed a <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">2.94% reduction</a> in difficulty, simplifying the process of uncovering <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blocks compared to the time before block height 800,352. As of Monday, <a href="https://archive.ph/BiEAY#selection-323.2-323.8">current statistics</a> demonstrate that the hashrate is smoothly cruising at 425.65 exahash per second (EH/s).</p>
<p>Leading the pack in mining pools today is Foundry USA, commanding a robust 111.18 EH/s, closely trailed by the second-largest pool in terms of hashrate, Antpool, with 88.42 EH/s. Throughout this week, approximately <a href="https://miningpoolstats.stream/bitcoin">44 mining pools</a> are contributing their SHA256 hashrate to the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

Swisstronik Testnet 1.0 is now available, offering dApp developers powerful encryption and enterprise-grade transaction security through Intel SGX technology. Simultaneously, Swisstronik&#x2019;s first Bug Bounty is launching, with rewards reaching up to $31,000 per bug found.</p>
<p><b>Why join Swisstronik&#x2019;s Bug Bounty?</b></p>
<p>With 750+ applications already received for early access to Swisstronik&#x2019;s Testnet 1.0, it seems clear that this is a great opportunity any Web3 developer should explore. But earning rewards of up to $31,000 per reported bug (paid mostly in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) is not the only reason to join.</p>
<p>By supporting Swisstronik, developers also help the crypto community stay true to the decentralization spirit while adapting to the new crypto regulations that transform the industry as we speak. They can contribute to a more balanced Web3 where KYC and other user verifications don&#x2019;t lead to personal data losses or dependence on centralized parties; where dApps can truly be integrated into the real world by using Swisstronik as a compliant bridge. And since this is their first Testnet ever, chances are even newbies could find some bugs.</p>
<p>After the Bug Bounty 1.0 closes on September 15, 2023, developers can expect the second Testnet and Bug Bounty to go live in the autumn with an even higher reward pool. Later, a Grant program for developers will also be launched to encourage app development within the Swisstronik ecosystem.</p>
<p><b>What will Testnet 1.0 achieve?</b></p>
<p>This release establishes the groundwork for creating compliant yet private decentralized applications (dApps) that are also Ethereum-friendly and provide developers with ease of access. Testnet 1.0 focuses on the core blockchain, without the Decentralized Identities block, but with the first of two planned data security levels.</p>
<p>The adoption of Intel SGX technology is central to Testnet 1.0, ensuring top-tier encryption and security within the Swisstronik ecosystem. All interactions with nodes, including transactions and queries, are kept secure through encryption, safeguarding data integrity and privacy throughout the network. By leveraging Intel SGX enclaves, transaction details remain protected even from the nodes, significantly enhancing the privacy and security of the Swisstronik blockchain. This feature is extremely important, especially when dealing with sensitive user information like KYC data which has often been the subject of many digital exploits in the past.</p>
<p>Moreover, Swisstronik focuses on interoperability from day one. Its Testnet 1.0 supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for seamless transitioning of Ethereum-based applications and smart contracts to the Swisstronik ecosystem. As the platform evolves, it aims to also integrate with the Cosmos network using the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, ensuring a more scalable and interconnected decentralized experience. This strategic integration opens up new horizons for blockchain innovation, promising technical possibilities and seamless cross-chain interactions.<br>
<b>Understanding Swisstronik</b></p>
<p>Swisstronik is the first blockchain platform that enables anyone to create compliant yet private dApps with no legal knowledge and minimum coding required. This is made possible by a previously unseen combination of two functionalities.</p>
<p>The first one is Swisstronik&#x2019;s Web3 Compliance Suite: the first of its kind. Swisstronik Compliance Suite is a self-regulating network that brings together international regulators, KYC issuers, and other legal service providers, similar to a DAO. They collaborate to adapt the Swisstronik system to local regulations in real time and consult the builders on internal compliance issues. As a result, Swisstronik-built apps are inherently compliant, even as regulations change.</p>
<p>Secondly, thanks to zk-SNARKs and Intel SGX, KYC, AML, and other user verifications can be performed on the Swisstronik blockchain in a private and secure manner.</p>
<p>As a result, by launching on Swisstronik or integrating one of its utilities in their apps on other chains, Web3 companies can become KYC, AML, and DPR compliant at a low cost. Finally, users can be confident that their data will remain private and secure even during identity verification.</p>

<h2>SEC Lawsuit Accuses Richard Heart of Running Unregistered Securities Offerings</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/LXgg43D/hex-complaint-pdf">SEC complaint</a> alleges that beginning in December 2019, Heart offered and sold Hex tokens and promised investors incentives and bonuses while marketing Hex as a high-yield blockchain certificate of deposit. Between December 2019 and November 2020, Heart accepted more than $678 million worth of ether from investors in exchange for Hex tokens, the complaint states. The SEC lawsuit states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Through their actions, defendants Heart and Pulsechain violated, and unless enjoined will continue to violate, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the complaint alleges that between July 2021 and April 2022, Heart conducted unregistered offerings of investments called Pulsechain and Pulsex, allegedly urging investors to deposit crypto assets into public wallet addresses in exchange for tokens that would be delivered in the future. SEC highlights that more than $354 million was invested in Pulsechain and more than $676 million in Pulsex in this fashion, according to the complaint.</p>

<p>The SEC states that the offerings from Hex, Pulsechain, and Pulsex were securities offerings that were not properly registered. Furthermore, the complaint alleges that Heart and Pulsechain defrauded investors by misappropriating at least $12.1 million to pay for Heart&#8217;s personal luxury purchases including a 555-carat diamond, luxury watches, and cars rather than for developing the Pulsechain network as promised. The SEC is seeking to bring this case to trial.</p>

This comes despite the global cryptocurrency market cap mostly consolidating in today&#x2019;s session. Bitcoin cash was another notable exception, as the price rose by over 4%.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) was close to a two-month high on Monday, as momentum in the meme coin remained bullish.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.000008171 on Sunday, SHIB/USD jumped to an intraday high of $0.000008688 earlier today.</p>
<p>This has pushed SHIB close to its highest point since May 29, when price peaked at $0.000008888.</p>

<p>Monday&#x2019;s move came as the relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a recent support point at the 60.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 64.41, with the next visible point of resistance at 68.00.</p>
<p>Should it reach this point, SHIB will likely hit a ceiling of $0.00000885.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>)</h2>
<p>Another notable gainer on Monday was bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>), which rose by as much as 4% to start the week.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>/USD peaked at $258.30 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, following on from Sunday&#x2019;s low at $243.34.</p>
<p>The move saw the cryptocurrency continue to trade near yesterday&#x2019;s two-week high at the $266.29 point.</p>

<p>Earlier gains have since slipped however, as price strength collided with a resistance level at 56.00.</p>
<p>Currently the RSI is at a reading of 53.23, and appears to be heading for a floor around the 50.00 zone.</p>
<p>A destination of $240.00 may be the target for bears should this decline continue.</p>
