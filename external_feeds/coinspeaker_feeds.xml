<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-spot-trading-tradingview/">Binance Integrates Its Spot Trading Platform with TradingView</a></p>
<p>The Binance Spot market trading platform has been <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/binance-integrates-with-tradingview-to-enhance-trading-capabilities-301828343.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">integrated</a> with TradingView, a leading charting platform that offers traders a greater insight into the markets. The news broke via a press release seen on Thursday, May 18.</p>
<h2>Providing Greater Insight into the Market via Tools and Data</h2>
<p>With the integration, users of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> will have access to a wide range of tools featured on TradingView, enabling them to approach their trades with greater insight into the market and deploy a wider range of strategies in their trades. They’ll also be able to access TradingView tools via the Binance interface without a secondary log-in.</p>
<p>Binance had earlier integrated its derivatives offering with the charting platform, and the latest initiative is a reflection of an ongoing effort to give users of the platform more analytical trading tools, a press release from the company said.</p>
<h2>Conferring Legitimacy on Tokens among Traditional Investors</h2>
<p>The latest integration will give more exposure to Binance’s high liquidity products to existing TradingView users, who mostly invest in traditional financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. The press release said that the TradingView integration will attract traditional investors who rely on technical tools provided by TradingView to access opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>It added that the availability of advanced charting tools will further confer legitimacy on digital asset tokens as investable instruments, despite the traditional skepticism of conservative investors.</p>
<h2>Creating Exposure to Traditional Investors</h2>
<p>Catherine Chen, who heads Binance’s VIP and Institutional divisions, said that the availability of level 1 and level 2 market data and advanced charting in Tradingview will act as a boost that will help in driving development in the growing cryptocurrency market. She added that these tools will engender the confidence of mainstream investors in the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Chen said that institutional investors that have shown interest in cryptocurrency investment have made demands for these data and analytical tools and that with the integration with TradingView, this class of investors will be able to navigate the market with a higher sense of confidence and assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users now have the convenience of a single sign-on to utilize TradingView&#8217;s interface to trade directly on Binance, the largest and most liquid digital asset exchange,&#8221; Chen said.</p>
<h2>Binance Futures Already Supports TradingView</h2>
<p>Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges and has listed more than 350 tokens. There are currently 1400 pairs available for trading on its spot market listing and 260 pairs available on its futures trading platform. The exchange boasts high liquidity, depth, and low fees.</p>
<p>Last December, Binance announced the integration of its Binance Futures with Tradingview. It gave users of its futures platform access to technical analysis tools. The latest spot market integration is a result of the success of the futures platform integration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-cbdc-central-banks/">Ripple Labs Debuts CBDC Platform for Central Banks</a></p>
<p>Popular blockchain payments firm <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple Labs Inc</a> is set to launch its own Central Bank Digital Currency <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(CBDC)</a> platform, which will allow central banks, governments, and financial institutions to issue digital currencies.</p>
<p>The news comes shortly after Ripple and the Central Bank of Montenegro <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/montenegro-ripple-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> to collaborate on the development of a pilot project for a national digital currency.</p>
<p>This platform&#8217;s goal is to equip Central Banks with the technology and infrastructure required to issue and operate their own CBDCs. Through Ripple’s CBDC platform, government agencies will be permitted to manage and customize the entire CBDC lifecycle including minting, distribution, redemption, and token burning.</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform will enable financial institutions to administer and engage in CBDC-related inter-institutional settlement and distribution functions. This could involve facilitating the secure and efficient transfer of CBDCs between financial institutions, enabling interoperability and settlement finality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Central banks can issue both wholesale and retail CBDCs, which can also be used to conduct offline transactions. This would enable users to perform transactions with their CBDCs even if they did not have an active internet connection.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that the specific features and capabilities of CBDCs, including offline transaction support, would be determined by each central bank&#8217;s design choices and requirements.</p>
<p>Ripple said it would demonstrate use cases for the platform as part of the e-HKD pilot, a program of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the de facto Central bank. Additionally, it is also <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/press-release/2023/20230518e4a1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with Taiwan&#8217;s Fubon Bank</a> to tokenize real estate assets and develop stock trading products as part of the e-HKD trial.</p>
<h2>CBDC Platform Enhanced by Ripple’s Private Ledger</h2>
<p>Notably, the CBDC platform is an improved version of Ripple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-cbdcs-private-ledger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private ledger</a>, launched in 2021 to issue CBDCs. It is built on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripples-xrp-8-price-pump-court-twist/">XRP</a> Ledger but on a new private ledger.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ripple has been leveraging the XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain protocol, in its existing technology solutions. The firm has utilized the XRP Ledger for various applications, including facilitating fast and efficient transaction settlement.</p>
<p>The CBDC Private Ledger would leverage Ripple&#8217;s existing blockchain technology, specifically the XRP Ledger, to enable Central banks to create and distribute their digital currencies securely and efficiently. The goal is to deliver a holistic solution that meets the unique needs of Central banks, such as scalability, security, and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>The CBDC Private Ledger, according to Ripple, will handle tens of thousands of transactions per second. This compares to the previous hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. By collaborating with central banks to develop CBDCs, Ripple aimed to support the modernization of the global financial system and promote the adoption of digital currencies.</p>
<p>In a bid to advance its business reach, Ripple has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-acquires-metaco-250m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid</a> $250 million to Switzerland-based firm, Metaco in order to expand its remittance network into institutional Bitcoin custody.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bt-shares-cut-up-55k-jobs-2030/">BT Shares Drop 8% after BT Group Announced Move to Cut Up to 55K Jobs by 2030</a></p>
<p>Shares of BT Group PLC (LSE: BT.A) dropped as much as 8 percent on Thursday to trade around £136.85. The sudden drop in the £14.91 billion valued British multinational telecommunications holding company was attributed to the announcement that between 40,000 to 55,000 of its workforce will be reduced by 2030. According to the company, the workforce reduction is set to begin in five years, which will represent between 31-42 percent of its total staff members. Notably, the company intends to cut down both third-party workers and its direct employees.</p>
<p>The company intends to digitize most of its services, which in return will help cut down huge operating costs. As the largest provider of fixed-line, broadband, and mobile services in the United Kingdom, BT Group will significantly streamline its services through the automation of some redundant tasks. Moreover, the information technology sector has significantly been automated throughout the world with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>“By continuing to build and connect like fury, digitize the way we work, and simplify our structure, by the end of the 2020s BT Group will rely on a much smaller workforce and a significantly reduced cost base. New BT Group will be a leaner business with a brighter future,” BT Chief Executive Philip Jansen <a href="https://newsroom.bt.com/results-for-the-full-year-to-31-march-2023/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>.</p>
<h2>BT Group Market Outlook</h2>
<p>The announcement came as the company highlighted its financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year that ended on March 31. According to the announcement, the company grew both its pro forma revenue and its EBITDA for the first time in six years. Moreover, the company focused on delivering a quality 5G network across several markets in the past few years.</p>
<p>According to the financial earnings results, BT Group has a total of 8.6 million 5G connections, whereby 62 percent materialized last year. Nevertheless, the company noted that its revenue for the full year came in at £20.7 billion, down 1 percent. As a result, the company reported profit before tax of about £1.7 billion, down about 12 percent from the prior year. BT Group attributed the decline in profit for the financial year that ended March 31 to increased depreciation from network build.</p>
<p>Notably, the company reported a net debt of about £18.9 billion, up approximately £850 million primarily due to pension scheme contributions of £1 billion. Nonetheless, 19 analysts surveyed by MarketWatch gave BT shares an average of Over despite issuing disappointing guidance for the financial year 2024.</p>

<p>Walmart “leveraged expenses and expanded operating margin” in Q1 2023 and now expects a 3.5% increase in consolidated net sales for the year. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/walmart-q1-2023-results/">Walmart Q1 2023 Results Sees Retail Giant Beat Expectations on Earnings &#038; Revenue despite Prudent Consumer Spending</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/walmart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart Inc</a> (NYSE: WMT) has raised its 2023 full-year guidance following its stellar <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/media-library/document/q1-fy24-earnings-release/_proxyDocument?id=00000188-2c80-dc3a-af89-bfecf9740000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Q1 earnings report.</a> On Thursday, the multinational retail corporation reported better-than-expected revenue, which was boosted by grocery and online businesses.</p>
<p>For the first quarter of the year, Walmart posted revenue of $152.30 billion compared to the $148.76 billion analysts expected. In addition, the Arkansas-based retail giant reported earnings per share of $1.47 adjusted versus $1.32 expected.</p>
<p>Walmart’s Q1 2023 sales grew 8%, with its substantial grocery business counterbalancing underwhelming clothing and electronic sales. Groceries amounted to approximately 60% of annual US sales, with revenue and operating income growing 7.6% and 17.3%, respectively.</p>
<p>The company’s stock rose in premarket trading amid increased guidance to reflect the positive earnings.</p>
<p>Walmart expects a 3.5% increase in consolidated net sales for the financial year. In addition, the retail corporation expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of between $6.10 and $6.20, which analysts also anticipate.</p>
<h2>Walmart CEO Expresses Contentment with Q1 2023</h2>
<p>Walmart President and Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon spoke about the company’s latest outing in glowing terms, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We had a strong quarter. Comp sales were strong globally, with eCommerce up 26%. We leveraged expenses, expanded operating margin, and grew profit ahead of sales. And a big thank you to our associates, who continue to step up and deliver for customers and members whenever and however they want to be served.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey drew attention to sustained consumer spending despite more prudent spending habits. According to Rainey, consumers bought smaller pack sizes and spent less on discretionary items while banking on promotions for pricier item purchases. However, despite these strains, consumer spending resilience remained unaffected. In a media session with CNBC, Rainey said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think [the reason for the resilient consumer spending habits] is probably because balance sheets are much stronger than they were pre-pandemic, even at this point.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Popular American retail chains, such as <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/home-depot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a> (NYSE: HD) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/target/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target </a>(NYSE: TGT), previously reported more prudent consumer spending habits.</p>
<p>Walmart shares closed Wednesday at $149.53, with a market value of $403.33 billion.</p>
<h2>Q4 2022</h2>
<p>Walmart’s <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/262069030/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/Earnings-Release-(FY23-Q4)-(final).pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">2022 fourth-quarter results</a>, released in February, also reflected <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/walmart-revenue-holiday-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substantial revenue</a> for the retail giant amid the holiday period. For Q4 2022, the largest retail chain in the US reported revenue of $164.0 billion, with international net sales coming in at $27.6 billion. However, at the time, Walmart said $900 million from currency valuation negatively impacted its international net sales figures.</p>
<p>The retail company maximized consumer spending at the height of inflation by positioning itself as a choice option for cheap deals.</p>
<p>Mcmillon described Walmart’s Q4 2022 results as a great way to finish the year 2022. At the time, the CEO said Q4 built on the momentum gained in the preceding quarter and put Walmart in a prime position for 2023.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/goldman-sachs-ai-tech-sp-500/">Goldman Sachs Expects AI Tech to Boost S&#038;P 500 Profits by 30% Over Next Decade</a></p>
<p>Although the onslaught of artificial intelligence (AI) is creating a major disruption in the market date, banking giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldman Sachs</a> is bullish about the tech and expects it to boost the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-sp-500-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> profits over the next decade.</p>
<p>The emergence of ChatGPT from OpenAI and several AI platforms subsequently, has created a significant storm in the tech space. While on the one hand, AT raises concerns over job losses, it also brings excitement on the other hand.</p>
<p>Particularly, the investor community is brewing with optimism as it expects AI to drive profit growth at a time of rising borrowing costs and supply chain problems. Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, May 18, Goldman’s senior strategist Ben Snider <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/18/goldman-sachs-ai-driven-gains-could-lead-to-30percent-sp-500-profit-spike.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Over the next 10 years, AI could increase productivity by 1.5% per year. And that could increase S&amp;P500 profits by 30% or more over the next decade. A lot of the favorable factors that led to that expansion (of S&amp;P 500) earnings seem to be reversing. But the real source of optimism now is productivity enhancements through artificial intelligence. It’s clear to most investors that the immediate winners are in the technology sector. The real question for investors is who are going to be winners down the road.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Snider takes us down memory lane adding that during the tech bubble of 1999-2000, it would have been hard to think about companies like Facebook and Uber changing our lives. He sees the artificial intelligence space in a similar situation right now.</p>
<h2>Energy and Healthcare Attractive in Short Term</h2>
<p>Snider also recommended that investors should spread their investments in the cyclical and defensive sectors. Furthermore, he said that considering the current valuations, the energy and healthcare sectors look attractive.</p>
<p>In the short term, he also expects the US Federal Reserve to end its monetary tightening measures. Snider said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The question is: In which ways will that continue to affect the economy moving forward? One sign of concern in the recent earnings season is that S&amp;P 500 companies are starting to pull back a bit on corporate spending.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“If interest rates are high, as a company, you might be a little more averse to issuing debt and therefore you might pull back on your spending. And indeed if we look at S&amp;P 500 buybacks, they were down 20% year-over-year in the first quarter of this year &#8211; that is one sign perhaps we haven’t seen all the effects of this tightening cycle,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Sony could pursue a partial divisional spin-off by listing its finance unit within the next two to three years.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sony-finance-unit-listing/">Sony Mulls Finance Unit Listing amid Plans to Steepen Entertainment Interests</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony Group Corp</a> is reportedly mulling a partial spin-off and listing of its finance unit just three years after assuming full ownership. The Japanese multinational conglomerate could retain a stake of slightly less than 20% of Sony Financial Group. In addition to a possible spin-off, Sony is also focusing on other operational plans, including strengthening its entertainment and image sensor businesses.</p>
<p>The Tokyo-based company&#8217;s shares rose 6% on positive investor reception to the operational developments.</p>
<h2>Sony CFO Comments on Finance Unit Listing Plans</h2>
<p>In a strategy meeting, Sony chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki touched on the need to spin off the finance unit with a partial listing. According to Totoki, the company&#8217;s financial group, including life insurance and banking, requires substantial capital to sustain. &#8220;It is a challenge to balance this with our investment in other growth areas such as entertainment and image sensors,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Totoki also explained that Sony would deploy a government scheme that permits companies to divest their units without additional tax burdens. Furthermore, the company could achieve a partial spin-off of &#8216;finances&#8217; but still see the new listing retain the Sony branding. As it stands, Sony seeks a fine balance within all its business divisions.</p>
<p>On Sony&#8217;s public perception following the listing, which could take two to three years, LightStream Research analyst Mio Kato <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-eyes-partial-spin-off-sony-financial-group-2023-05-18/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t change anything drastically in terms of the outlook for Sony, but it does make it a more pure play entertainment company which the market generally likes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sony&#8217;s finance unit sustained a 5% revenue decline to 1.45 trillion yen ($10.74 billion) in the first quarter of the year. However, operating profit surged 49% to 223.9 billion yen, spurred by a one-off real estate sale gain.</p>
<p>Sony forked out $3.7 billion three years ago to fully own its financial unit. This move came despite some external pressure from activist investors to focus on entertainment. However, in the last five years, the PlayStation maker has expanded its entertainment portfolio with a slew of lofty acquisitions. These include purchasing EMI Music Publishing for $2.3 billion and Crunchyroll for $1.2 billion. Crunchyroll is an anime streaming service formerly owned by American telco giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/att/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AT&amp;T</a> (NYSE: T).</p>
<h2>Sony Entertainment</h2>
<p>Amid its entertainment-driven agenda, Sony previously said it expects to sell 25 million PlayStation consoles in 2023. As supply chain constraints taper, the Japanese corporation expects to achieve this record target in the financial year. Despite forecasting a decline in first-party software sales for 2023, Sony expects several notable title releases this year. This includes a sequel to its exclusive Marvel&#8217;s &#8220;Spider-Man&#8221; game.</p>
<p>MST Financial analyst David Gibson touched on Sony&#8217;s plans to steepen investments in entertainment. He opined that proceeds from listing Sony Financial could help fund the conglomerate&#8217;s &#8220;aggressive merger and acquisition&#8221; activities. &#8220;Consolidation in entertainment has been happening, and Sony doesn&#8217;t want to be left behind,&#8221; Gibson pointed out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Macquarie analyst Damian Thong hailed Sony&#8217;s latest operational decision as a brilliant opportunistic move.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/filecoin-security-sec-grayscale/">Filecoin Labeled as Security, SEC Asks Grayscale to Withdraw Filecoin Trust</a></p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) has tagged Filecoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/filecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FIL</a>) as an unregistered security. As a result, the regulator expects Grayscale Investments its application for Filecoin Trust.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/17/2671509/0/en/Grayscale-Investments-Shares-Update-Regarding-Grayscale-Filecoin-Trust-Registration-Statement-on-Form-10.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">update</a> given by Grayscale about the status of the Trust’s registration in a statement on Form 10, a letter was sent to it by the SEC detailing the categorization of FIL.</p>
<p>Noteworthy, the crypto investment management firm debuted the Grayscale Filecoin Trust in March 2021and this gives investors indirect access to the Filecoin token. To fulfill the firm&#8217;s outlined product lifecycle, Grayscale filed for Form 10 on Friday, April 14th, 2023 with the SEC to obtain SEC reporting status.</p>
<p>“On May 16, 2023, Grayscale received a comment letter from the SEC staff stating its view that the Trust’s underlying asset, FIL, meets the definition of a security under the federal securities laws and that therefore the Trust appears to meet the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940,” per a statement published by Grayscale while announcing the report of the SEC.</p>
<p>The categorization of FIL as securities does bode well with Grayscale and the crypto manager is preparing a response for the SEC which will outline the legal basis for its difference of opinion.</p>
<p>Pending when/if Grayscale convinces the regulator, the firm is left with only two options for the Trust; either find accommodations that would enable the Trust to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or eventually dissolve the Trust. Therefore, investors are expected to be ready for whatever eventualities the SEC and Grayscale arrive at.</p>
<h2>Beyond Grayscale and Filecoin, SEC Crackdown on Crypto Firms</h2>
<p>Obviously, the SEC crackdown on crypto firms has intensified significantly since the bear market of last year incited by several collapses and bankruptcy filings of crypto exchanges. Much to the disappointment of investors and crypto heavyweights, several crypto assets seem to fall under the securities category.</p>
<p>So far, only Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) has been excused from the group, according to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/gary-gensler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gary Gensler</a>, the Chairman of the SEC.</p>
<p>Due to this situation, a long list of crypto firms have faced enforcement actions with some issued lawsuits by the SEC and are currently trying to defend themselves. One of the longest of such lawsuits is the SEC’s case with Ripple. Ripple was <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-sec-sues-ripple-for-selling-xrp-as-unregistered-securities-xrp-tanks-over-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicted</a> for offering XRP for sale and based on the categorization of the regulator, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a> is unregistered securities. Also, BTC mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings was recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/marathon-digital-subpoenaed-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subpoenaed</a> by the SEC for violating federal securities laws.</p>
<p>Renowned American cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN) also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-enforcement-action-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a Wells Notice from the US regulator insinuating that it was involved in trading unregistered securities, hence the violation of securities laws. Other exchanges like Kraken and Bittrex have also received enforcement actions from the SEC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/revolut-business-australia/">Revolut Launches Business Offering in Australia, Seeking Banking License</a></p>
<p>Crypto-friendly fintech company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/revolut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revolut</a> has introduced an international payment-targeted business account for customers in Australia, as it is allegedly operating to safeguard a banking license.</p>
<p>The London-based company provides a wide range of fiat payment services for customers in Europe and Australia. It also rolls out crypto services like purchasing and selling a specific number of crypto assets that also include <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>In some particular regions, it also offers access to crypto-staking. In conversation with the CEO of Revolut&#8217;s Australian unit Matt Baxby, it was <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/british-fintech-revolut-launches-business-offering-chasing-australian-banking-licence/news-story/a99da34d79c4d5b27070fa1ace18dec0?amp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> that the company&#8217;s ultimate target is to offer an application or a medium where people can supervise and envision all their financial activities.</p>
<p>According to Baxby, the license is a vital piece of the puzzle to activate several other areas where the company can step in. The company seeks the license to achieve the regulatory standard that would impart confidence to the consumers for a longer time.</p>
<p>The multi-currency business accounts kickstarted this week, with Revolut allowing users to carry out up to 75,000 Australian Dollars ($49,950) worth of foreign currency exchange per month.</p>
<p>According to James Gibson, the head supervisor of Revolut Business, the company has acknowledged an enhanced interest from Australian small to medium projects which seek better international payment options. Revolut has more than hundred-thousand business customers across Europe.</p>
<p>In an interview, Gibson said that the company has several European customers who have Australian auxiliaries along, hence there is promise of extensive foothold in the region. The attempt appends to the personal records currently present in Australia, which is different from providing traditional financial types of help and international exchanges, but offers admittance to crypto, stock, and product contributions.</p>
<p>Initially, Revolut had collaborated with Koinly, a crypto tax solutions provider, to allow customers to synchronize their transaction history with Koinly and expedite tax calculations. The action represents the company&#8217;s devotion to offering a comprehensive financial solution to clients</p>
<p>Revolut was established in 2015 and became profitable a year ago with a pretax profit of £59.1 million on revenue of £636.2 million. However, the valuation of the fintech firm was cut by 46 percent by Schroders, one of Revolut&#8217;s most reliable investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/pantos-protocol-multichain-token/">Pantos Protocol Releases Multichain Token Creator for Developers</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/pantos-protocol-multichain-token-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pantos Protocol</a>, the blockchain network designed by the team behind the BitPanda blockchain, has announced the release of its highly innovative Multichain Token Creator as it seeks to empower developers within its ecosystem. As contained in a press release shared with Coinspeaker, the team said the Multichain Token Creator is ideal for creating cryptocurrencies that can be deployed and function on different networks.</p>
<p>The entire idea behind the development of the <a href="https://pantos.io/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Pantos</a> blockchain is to enable a broad token economy in the ultimate evolution of the industry. As one of its core flagship products, the Multichain Token Creator will empower developers by creating more opportunities for them.</p>
<p>Blockchain systems are generally known to be highly interoperable, however, the tools to help drive this innovation are almost difficult to develop. As such, we tend to see projects launching tokens that are confined within their primary underlying blockchains. This largely restricts the economics of the cryptocurrency, and limits the users to get the right benefits they ought to have when the token can be bridged to many protocols.</p>
<p>This is what Pantos seek to correct by launching the Multichain Token Creator.</p>
<p>“Our Multichain Token Creator is a defining innovation in the blockchain space, offering developers and projects an effortless way to adopt a revolutionary multichain token standard that drives unparalleled cross-chain collaboration and opens up endless possibilities for the future of decentralized technology,” said Marius Ciortan, the Director of Product Engineering at Pantos.</p>
<p>As described in the release, the product is on track to be showcased at the forthcoming EDCON Conference in Montenegro. This conference will be held from the 19th of May to the 23rd, an opportunity that will also push the team to unveil the Pantos Digital Asset Standard (PANDAS). The digital currencies being built by the Multichain Token Creator will be built using PANDAS.</p>
<h2>Pantos Protocol and Steady Evolution</h2>
<p>The Pantos Protocol is making impressive moves with respect to its plans to go fully functional with usable products. The project was conceived by the BitPanda team in partnership with TU Wien in Austria. After months of development, Technical University Hamburg joined the initiative to develop the open standard for blockchain interoperability.</p>
<p>The functionalities designed for the Pantos Protocol to exhibit include but are not limited to sending of tokens, wrapping of native coins of supported chains, and the creation and deployment of native multichain tokens. One unique incentive that developers get for all of these features is that they can all be done with a few simple clicks.</p>
<p>With thousands of different blockchain protocols around today, Pantos Protocol is launching with immediate support for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> (ETH), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/matic-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a> (MATIC), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/avalanche/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche</a> (AVAX), BNB, Cronos (CRO), Celo, and Fantom (FTM). In the near future, the team plans to expand the reach of the protocol to more EVM-compatible blockchain for wider adoption.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ron-desantis-bans-digital-dollar-florida/">Governor Ron DeSantis Bans Digital Dollar in Florida, Other States Prepare to Emulate Decision</a></p>
<p>Ron DeSantis, Governor of Florida recently signed a bill prohibiting the use of central bank-issued digital currencies (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDCs</a>) in the state. And now, his move may have set a precedent for other states to follow.</p>
<p>For DeSantis and many more like him, a CBDC defeats the aim of decentralization being that it is controlled by a centralized entity &#8211; the government. They also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/desantis-ban-cbdcs-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argue</a> that through CBDCs, governments may eventually be able to manipulate where the money goes and what it is being used for.</p>
<h2>Other States Speak Out</h2>
<p>As it stands, states like Alabama, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Texas are also kicking against a digital dollar, and they have drafted bills to that effect. However, none of the other bills is yet as advanced as Florida’s.</p>
<p>The Legislature of Louisiana lawmakers, for instance, simply asks the US Congress to not support CBDCs. According to the lawmakers, the technology poses a risk to the privacy of Louisiana-based individuals and businesses.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Texas lawmakers also proposed a bill against “the creation of a central bank digital currency”. They argued that the creation of a CBDC will give the government unprecedented power and control over people&#8217;s cash and business dealings.</p>
<p>North Dakota went even further in its bill claiming that a CBDC would mean that the government has control over the lives, freedom, choices, and overall sovereignty of its people.</p>
<h2>CBDC Ban in Florida: Ron DeSantis May Be Overreaching</h2>
<p>The decision of Governor DeSantis to ban CBDCs in Florida has drawn criticism from some legal experts. According to these experts, Florida’s effort is nothing more than an attempt to stifle innovation. In fact, they suggest that DeSantis may be doing more harm than good for the very digital assets sector he’s trying to protect.</p>
<p>Moreover, America is yet to give a clear statement concerning whether or not it will release a CBDC. The closest thing to a statement was in March when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the Fed hadn’t decided on whether the States need a CBDC. Besides, even if the federal government finally decides to adopt a CBDC, DeSantis knows that Florida will have to back down.</p>
