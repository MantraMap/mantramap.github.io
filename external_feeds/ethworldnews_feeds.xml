<p>Paradigm research partner and head of security, Sam (@samczsun), unveiled a joint effort between auditors, security professionals, and white hat hackers aimed at providing assistance during crypto hacks. </p>



<p>The working solution &#8211; a telegram bot &#8211; arrives amid multi-million rescue missions for Curve Finance, one of DeFi&#8217;s largest exchanges which was recently exploited for $73.5 million in cryptocurrencies. </p>



<p>According to Sam, SEAL 911 allows anyone to contact a professional from a pool of veteran security experts in emergency situations. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/samczsun/366b853a54391a97ab13cd2e3ca2d7c9" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://gist.github.com/samczsun/366b853a54391a97ab13cd2e3ca2d7c9" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">list</a> includes experts from MetaMask, ConsenSys, Peckshield, Polygon, Origin Protocol, Wintermute, Paradigm, and Yearn to name a few. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Over the past few days I&#8217;ve been working with a group of whitehats, auditors, and other security leaders to try and solve the hardest part of responsible disclosure: finding the right person to talk to.</p><cite>&#8211; Sam (<a href="https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1688613385565528064?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1688613385565528064?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@samczsun</a>) on Twitter.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The initiative hopes to provide vetted assistance during hacks, and potentially mitigate losses from decentralized finance protocols. </p>

<h2>Curve Recovers Loot From Vyper-Pool Exploit</h2>



<p>DeFi&#8217;s community remains watchful even as Curve Finance recovers almost 75% of exploited liquidity. CRV&#8217;s price dropped along with TVL on Ethereum&#8217;s DeFi scene after attackers leveraged a reentrancy vulnerability to steal millions from crypto pools on Curve&#8217;s decentralized exchange. </p>



<p>Over a week later, the DEX <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/52-million-recovered-curve-finance-heist/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/52-million-recovered-curve-finance-heist/" rel="noreferrer noopener">recovered</a> $52.3 million out of $73.5 million stolen in late July/early August. CRV&#8217;s price also buoyed back to 60 cents after dropping to 49 cents following the exploit. </p>



<p>Curve is offering 10% of the outstanding funds &#8211; worth $1.8 million &#8211; as a bounty in return for information about the exploiter. </p>

<ul><li>Huobi Global has announced its plans to list PayPal’s new dollar-pegged stablecoin on its platform.</li><li>The crypto exchange plans to offer PYUSD/USDT trading pairs with zero trading fees. </li><li>Huobi executive Justin Sun has also invited PayPal to issue PYUSD on his Tron network. </li></ul>



<p>Huobi Global is aiming to become the first exchange to support the launch of Paypal’s new dollar-pegged stablecoin, PYUSD. The crypto exchange plans to list PYUSD on its trading platform soon and start by offering PYUSD/USDT trading pairs to its users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Huobi’s push to add the newly launched stablecoin came just a day after customers withdrew $49 million worth of stablecoins from the crypto exchange, which translated to over 33% of its stablecoin balance. The significant outflow of stables came amid reports of several Huobi executives being arrested in China</p>



<h2><strong>Huobi Global To Offer Zero Trading Fees On PYUSD Pairs</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/44945804382445" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Huobi Global, PYUSD/USDT trading pairs will be offered with zero trading fee permanently. The crypto exchange stated that it would list the new stablecoin as soon as its market circulation and liquidity conditions become favorable. The exchange reiterated that it aimed to become the first to offer&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Huobi has always been committed to maintaining friendly communication with high-quality projects and institutions in blockchain industry to jointly promote the development of the industry.”</p><cite>Huobi Global</cite></blockquote>



<p>Following the launch of PYUSD on August 7, Tron founder Justin Sun, who holds a considerable stake in Huobi Global, invited PayPal to issue its new stablecoin on the Tron network. Sun took to Twitter to highlight Tron’s efficiency and secureness that facilitated transactions worth $12 billion every day. “Mutual benefits await in the digital payment landscape. Let&#8217;s collaborate for a thriving ecosystem,” Sun added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PayPal <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paypal-usd-pegged-stablecoin-on-ethereum/">unveiled</a> its PYUSD stablecoin on August 7 six months after it halted its development due to the regulatory crackdown on crypto in the United States. The new stablecoin will be issued by Paxos Trust Company, which will be 100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. treasury bonds, and similar cash equivalents. Paxos Trust Co. previously minted Binance’s BUSD stablecoins.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A group of FTX customers has brought a class action suit against the exchange’s law firm.&nbsp;</li><li>Fenwick &amp; West LLP is being sued for allegedly aiding fraud through its legal advice to the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>The law firm has been accused of setting up entities used to perpetrate fraud and structuring transactions to avoid scrutiny.&nbsp;</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried previously cited legal advice from Fenwick &amp; West to bolster his defense.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Fenwick &amp; West LLP, the California-based law firm that served as the primary outside counsel for FTX, is being sued by the bankrupt crypto exchange’s customers. The customers have brought a class action lawsuit against the law firm for its alleged role in aiding fraud through the legal advice it provided to the crypto exchange before its collapse last year.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Fenwick Was Aware Of FTX’s Shady Business Practices?</strong></h2>



<p><strong> </strong>A group of FTX customers filed a class action lawsuit against the exchange in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, though the plaintiffs plan to transfer it to the Southern District of Florida, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/ftx-law-firm-fenwick-faces-second-lawsuit-by-crypto-customers-2023-08-07/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> reported earlier today. Earlier this year, a judicial panel <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judicial-panel-consolidates-ftx-lawsuits/">ordered</a> the consolidation of multiple lawsuits related to the bankrupt exchange in Miami where they would be heard by Federal Judge Michael Moore. </p>



<p>The latest complaint alleged that the services extended to FTX by Fenwick &amp; West went beyond what a law firm usually provides to its clients. The crypto exchange’s customers accused the law firm of setting up “shadowy entities” that were used by founder Sam Bankman-Fried and his inner circle to commit fraud and structure the exchange’s transactions in ways that allowed them to circumvent regulatory scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“When asked by FTX Group executives for counsel, Fenwick lawyers were eager to craft not only creative, but illegal strategies.” </p><cite>Complaint against Fenwick &amp; West LLP</cite></blockquote>



<p>The customers further alleged that through its unique position and proximity to FTX’s operations, Fenwick &amp; West was aware of the exchange’s complicated organizational structure, lack of internal controls, and dubious business practices. The class action lawsuit is the second FTX-related legal matter to hit the law firm. Earlier this year, Sam Bankman-Fried attempted to subpoena Fenwick to prove that he was acting on legal advice provided by the law firm during his stint as the exchange’s Chief Executive.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>PayPal is set to launch its own dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum called PayPal USD (PYUSD).&nbsp;</li><li>The new stablecoin will be issued by former BUSD issuer Paxos Trust Company.&nbsp;</li><li>The fintech giant aims to establish itself in the growing digital asset space with PYUSD.&nbsp;</li><li>PYUSD comes just days after a key stablecoin bill was cleared by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>American fintech giant PayPal is set to launch its own stablecoin on Ethereum. The payment services company announced earlier today that its dollar-pegged PYUSD stablecoin would be 100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. With its ERC-20 stablecoin debut, PayPal is looking to venture into the growing digital asset space.</p>



<h2><strong>Paxos Trust Co. Will Issue PayPal’s PYUSD Stablecoin</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-08-07-PayPal-Launches-U-S-Dollar-Stablecoin" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from PayPal, the new PYUSD stablecoin will be issued by Paxos Trust Company, the New York-based blockchain firm that minted Binance’s BUSD stablecoin till February this year. Paxos is licensed by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which also issued a BitLicense to PayPal in June last year. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.&#8221; </p><cite>Dan Schulman, president and CEO, PayPal</cite></blockquote>



<p>PYUSD will initially be made available to U.S.-based PayPal customers, who will be able to purchase it through the payments giant’s online platform. Users will be able to transfer the stablecoin between the platform and compatible external wallets, use it for online purchases, and convert it to one of PayPal’s supported cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting September 2023, Paxos Trust Co. will publish monthly Reserve Reports for PYUSD outlining the composition of the reserves backing the stablecoin. The stablecoin issuer will also publish third-party attestation of the value of the reserve assets. The attestation itself will be carried out per the standards set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).&nbsp;</p>



<p>News of PayPal’s stablecoin comes nearly six months after the fintech giant <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paypal-halts-stablecoin-crypto-crackdown/">halted</a> stablecoin development following the crackdown on crypto by regulators in the United States. At the time, Paxos was being probed by the NYDFS for unknown reasons. </p>



<p>The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023, which was <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NASAA-Letter-to-Congress-Regarding-H.R.-4766-Clarity-for-Payment-Stablecoins-Act-of-2023.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">cleared</a> by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee last month may have played a role in PYUSD’s launch. Patrick McHenry, Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said in a statement earlier today that the stablecoin bill brought much-needed clarity surrounding the regulation of stablecoins and other digital assets. </p>

<p>Worldcoin’s warehouse in Nairobi was reportedly raided by Kenyan law enforcement agencies over the weekend. The raid came amid growing scrutiny of the controversial crypto project that was launched by ChatGPT founder Sam Altman last month. Privacy watchdogs around the world have expressed concerns over Worldcoin’s biometric data collection through iris scans in exchange for WLD tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Worldcoin Failed To Disclose Its True Intentions</strong></h2>



<p>Local media <a href="https://kahawatungu.com/police-raid-worldcoin-cryptocurrency-warehouse-in-nairobi-over-data/" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> earlier today that the Kenyan executed a search warrant on August 5, 2023, at one of Worldcoin’s facilities in the capital city of Nairobi. The raid, which involved officers from multiple agencies, resulted in the confiscation of documents and machines that are believed to be associated with the crypto project’s biometric data collection. </p>



<p>The raid was reportedly conducted under the supervision of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. The seized machines and documents are reportedly being analyzed at the headquarters of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. Immaculate Kassait, the Data Protection Commissioner, has accused Tools for Humanity, the crypto project’s parent firm, of failing to disclose its true intentions at the time of registration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The raid came just days after Kenya’s Ministry of Interior and National Administration <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/kenya-halts-worldcoin-activity/">ordered</a> the crypto project to shut down its operations and initiated an investigation into its activities in the country due to concerns over privacy and security. The Kenyan Capital Markets Authority (CMA) previously expressed concerns about biometric data collection and publicly stated that Worldcoin was not regulated in the country. </p>



<p>Kenya was the first African nation targeted by Worlcoin, given its booming tech industry and a four million-strong crypto trading community. The crypto project has maintained that its activities are in accordance with Kenyan regulations. However, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki told the Kenyan Parliament last week that the firm was not registered as a legal entity in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its launch last month, Worldcoin has come under scrutiny from multiple privacy and data regulators around the world, including Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. France’s CNIL and the Bavarian State Authority in Germany have launched a joint investigation into the crypto project’s activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Alchemix/CurveFinance Exploiter returned nearly $9 million in funds drained from the DeFi protocol following on-chain negotiations spotted via Etherscan on Friday. </p>



<p>Alchemix Finance received a blockchain transaction note asking the protocol to confirm its wallet address. The exploiter then <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xdce5d6b41c32f578f875efffc0d422c57a75d7d8#tokentxns" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etherscan.io/address/0xdce5d6b41c32f578f875efffc0d422c57a75d7d8#tokentxns" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">transferred</a> 4,820 ether over three transactions to Alchemix&#8217;s multi-sig wallet. At current prices, the assets are worth $8.9 million. </p>



<p>Friday&#8217;s transaction represents a portion of around $61 million drained from decentralized exchange Curve Finance. The attacker reportedly exploited a code bug in Vyper&#8217;s compiler, a smart contract programming language used by Curve across its platform. </p>



<p>The code bug allowed malicious attackers to drain liquidity pools affecting Metronome, Alchemix, and JPEGd. So far, exploiters have returned some of the looted assets to Alchemix and JPEGd. </p>



<p>Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix previously asked the exploiters to return 90% of the drained funds for a 10% bounty in return. CRV gained 5% in price on Friday following news of Alchemix&#8217;s recovery. </p>

<h2>Curve Founder Offloads CRV To Balance Debt</h2>



<p>CRV, Curve native token and a cryptocurrency widely used across Ethereum&#8217;s DeFi lending ecosystem dipped in price following exploits on the exchange&#8217;s in-house pools. </p>



<p>The drop in CRV&#8217;s price spelled danger for loans taken by founder Michael Egorov. Egorov deposited million of CRV tokens as collateral on DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Fraxlend. These loans risked liquidation if CRV&#8217;s price fell below $0.30. </p>



<p>In response to the CRV&#8217;s declining price amid last weekend&#8217;s exploit, Egorov <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-egorov-sells-72-million-crv/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-egorov-sells-72-million-crv/" rel="noreferrer noopener">spurred</a> a deluge of over-the-counter (OTC) deals with some 13 investors including Tron founder Justin Sun. </p>



<p>Egorov&#8217;s CRV sales from OTC trades total 106 million CRV tokens and he received $42 million USDT in return. This liquidity has seemingly gone into <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1687294816890347520?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1687294816890347520?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">balancing debts on Aave</a> and other lenders amid concerns of a DeFi implosion. </p>



<p>DeFi analyst Ignas opined that a CRV nosedive looked unlikely due to an increase in Curve&#8217;s 3Crypto pool featuring crvUSD+ETH+CRV. </p>

<ul><li>The U.S. Justice Department is seeking Sam Bankman-Fried’s incarceration over his role in the NYT&#8217;s controversial article.&nbsp;</li><li>The New York Times recently published an article with the private writings of former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison.&nbsp;</li><li>The Justice Department wants SBF’s bail revoked due to his continuous witness tampering attempts.&nbsp;</li><li>The New York Times recently wrote to the judge overseeing SBF’s case defending the latter’s recent actions.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The United States Department of Justice is seeking the revocation of Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail due to his role in an article published by the New York Times last month that has stirred up <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutor-revoke-sam-bankman-fried-bail/">controversy</a> over the past two weeks. In a recent <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.188.0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">letter</a> to SDNY Judge Lewis Kaplan, federal prosecutors from the Justice Department cited multiple attempts by the disgraced FTX founder to tamper with witnesses and urged the judge to put him behind bars. </p>



<h2>DOJ Wants Sam Bankman-Fried Detained Pending Trial In October</h2>



<p>The Department of Justice highlighted the acknowledgment by Sam Bankman-Fried’s defense team regarding his involvement in the New York Times article on former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Bankman-Fried provided Ellison’s diary to NYT, which contained private writings about her time at the now-defunct crypto firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors told Judge Kaplan that the FTX founder shared Ellison’s private writings to influence the public’s perception of her, given that she is set to testify against him after pleading guilty in the lawsuit against FTX. The prosecutors believe that Bankman-Fried’s actions amount to a federal felony while out on bail, and asked Judge Kaplan to revoke the same till his trial hearings begin on October 2, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, the New York Times wrote to Judge Kaplan on August 2, 2023, in what appeared to be an attempt to defend Sam Bankman-Fried’s decision to share Caroline Ellison’s private diary. The NYT argued their article was in the “public’s legitimate interest” given Ellison’s proximity to the case and knowledge of FTX and Alameda’s inner workings. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In all the years of bail revocation hearings I did, never did anyone or any organization claim a First Amendment right to facilitate witness intimidation.

<p>The New York Times also cited the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects freedom of speech and the press, among other things. The news giant asked the court to make its decision in Bankman-Fried’s bail revocation matter in accordance with the First Amendment. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, stated that NYT’s invocation of the First Amendment for a bail revocation hearing was unprecedented.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Matter Labs has denied allegations of source code plagiarism made by Polygon.&nbsp;</li><li>Polygon previously accused Matter Labs of copying part of its open-source code without giving due credit.</li><li>In response, Matter Labs claimed it had sufficiently attributed the copied code to Polygon.</li></ul>



<p>Matter Labs, the crypto firm behind zkSync, has responded to the recent plagiarism allegations made by fellow <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-ethereum-bridge-nft-base/">Ethereum</a> layer-2 scaling solution Polygon. Earlier today, Polygon accused Matter Labs’ developers of copying parts of its open-source code without giving due credit for the plagiarized code. Matter Labs has denied the allegations and argued that it had sufficiently attributed the copied part to Polygon. </p>



<h2><strong>Matter Labs: Polygon Is Making “Untrue Claims”</strong></h2>



<p>Earlier today, Polygon published a <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x70DF15b0208eFCeFaA541Da9A0ED6C4A884554Fc/gNi8coqXjd1ybFsQBAG7QARUkPHZECu7ihIRkpiVx2Y" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> titled “Protect the Open Source Ethos”, which accused Matter Labs of copying a “significant amount” of source code from the Plonky2 library to its recently unveiled proving system called Boojum. According to Polygon, the code was copied with copyrights or attribution to its original authors. </p>



<p>Polygon also called out Matter Labs’ founder Alex Gluchowski for claiming that Boojum is more efficient than Plony2. Polygon questioned the authenticity of Gluchowski’s claim, given that Boojum’s code concerning performance was directly copied from Plonky2. Polygon further cited Boojum’s introductory post, which failed to mention the layer-2 scaling solution or its developers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to Polygon’s allegations, Matter Labs clarified that its Boojum proof system derived 5% of its code from Plonky2, which was “prominently attributed” in the first line of its library. In a statement to CoinDesk, a Matter Labs spokesperson said that Polygon’s blog post made untrue claims about Boojum’s code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CEO Alex Gluchowski followed up with a detailed tweet where he expressed his disappointment with Polygon’s allegations. Gluchowski reiterated that only 5% of the Boojum code was based on the Plonky2 code. He added that Boojum and Plonky2 were both implementations of the Redshift, which he claimed was introduced by Matter Labs 3 years before Polygon published the Plonky2 paper. </p>

<p>The tension between Polygon and Matter Labs comes as both firms rush to deliver the first zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) to offer cheaper and more efficient transactions on the Ethereum network. Earlier this year, Polygon’s Mihailo Bjelic and Matter Labs’ Alex Gluchowski were involved in a heated exchange over the latter’s zkSync Era, particularly its security audits.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Coinbase Posts Net Loss Of $97 Million In Q2 ‘2023</h2>
