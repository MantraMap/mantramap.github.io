<p>Stablecoins have become an essential part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, providing stability and pegging their value to fiat currencies like the US Dollar. These digital assets offer traders and investors a means to mitigate the high volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The recent fluctuations in the circulation of stablecoins may be influenced by various factors, including market demand, user preferences, and regulatory developments.</p>



<p>The decrease in USDC circulation could be attributed to investors moving funds to other assets or platforms as market conditions evolve. As stablecoins aim to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US Dollar, the decrease may indicate a shift in investor sentiment or market dynamics.</p>

<p>Similarly, Aoki&#8217;s investment in The Cool Cat 8665 NFT, which he acquired for $123,000, has also suffered a drastic devaluation. The highest bid for this particular token now stands at a meager $4,700.</p>

<p>The 3 Moonbirds NFTs, previously acquired by Aoki for $297,000, have experienced an astonishing 97% decrease in value.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Cryptomories 1026, once purchased for $483,000, has been sold off for a mere $15,000, leaving Aoki with a staggering loss of $468,000 on this particular investment.</p>



<p>According to data from DappRadar, Aoki currently holds over 13,000 NFTs, with an approximate total value of $1.05 million. However, a few months ago, in early June, these NFTs were valued at an impressive $8.8 million, highlighting the substantial depreciation in their worth.</p>

<p>NFTs, which are unique digital assets that represent ownership of artwork, music, or other collectibles, have gained considerable popularity in recent years. The crypto art market witnessed a boom, with NFT sales reaching remarkable heights. However, the volatility of the market has also exposed investors to potential risks, as seen in Aoki&#8217;s case.</p>



<p>DJ Steve Aoki faces substantial losses as the value of his blue-chip NFTs experiences a significant decline. Herbie&#8217;s calculations reveal that NFTs once worth $1.6 million are now valued at just $33,000. The market volatility underscores the importance of careful consideration and research when investing in NFTs and the crypto art market as a whole. As the market continues to mature, investors must remain vigilant to make informed decisions in this dynamic and ever-changing industry.</p>

<p>Users reported that the account has been posting suspicious messages related to a token gifting scam. The fraudulent tweets claim to offer free tokens of the native Coinlist token, LIST, as a giveaway. However, authorities and Coinlist officials have confirmed that this is a phishing scam, and users are advised not to click on any links or engage with the fraudulent messages.</p>



<p>The hacking incident has caused concern among the crypto community, as scams and phishing attempts have become more prevalent in recent times. Social media platforms like Twitter have been prime targets for cybercriminals seeking to exploit the reputation of legitimate crypto companies for their malicious purposes.</p>



<p>Upon discovering the suspicious activity, Coinlist immediately took action to secure their account and alerted Twitter about the hacking incident. Coinlist representatives have emphasized that they never conduct token giveaways in this manner, and users should exercise caution when encountering such messages on social media.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, criticized the SEC&#8217;s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies and called for legislation to protect retail investors and foster innovation.</em></li>



<li><em>Clear rules and safeguards would enable businesses to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape.</em></li>



<li><em>With reasonable regulations in place, legitimate projects and companies can operate with confidence, while bad actors can be identified and dealt with more effectively.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of <a href="https://ripple.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ripple.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a>, has raised a crucial concern about the protection of retail investors in the cryptocurrency market. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ripple-CEO-Calls-for-Legislation-to-Protect-Retail-Investors-in-Crypto.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="467" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ripple-CEO-Calls-for-Legislation-to-Protect-Retail-Investors-in-Crypto.jpg" alt="Ripple CEO Calls for Legislation to Protect Retail Investors in Crypto" class="wp-image-205046" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ripple-CEO-Calls-for-Legislation-to-Protect-Retail-Investors-in-Crypto.jpg 700w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ripple-CEO-Calls-for-Legislation-to-Protect-Retail-Investors-in-Crypto-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="Ripple CEO Calls for Legislation To Protect Retail Investors In Crypto 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In a recent statement, Garlinghouse criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its approach to regulating cryptocurrencies and emphasized the need for legislation to provide clear rules and safeguards for retail participants.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An important topic has come up about protecting retail. The SEC created this mess by proclaiming it was the cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction Where’s that gotten us? Consumers left holding the bag in bankruptcy court while the SEC holds press conferences.</p>&mdash; Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1682869087511416832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Garlinghouse pointed out that the SEC&#8217;s actions had created confusion and uncertainty in the crypto space by positioning itself as the primary regulatory authority for cryptocurrencies without clear legal jurisdiction. This uncertainty has led to legal battles and hindered innovation, making it challenging for businesses to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape.</p>



<p>The CEO stressed that the current method of &#8220;regulation by enforcement&#8221; employed by the SEC was inadequate and ineffective. Instead, he advocated for a legislative approach that would establish comprehensive and unambiguous guidelines for the industry. Such legislation would not only protect retail investors but also foster innovation and growth within the crypto sector.</p>

<p>Garlinghouse&#8217;s call for legislation echoes the sentiments of many within the blockchain and cryptocurrency community who seek a more defined framework for compliance and accountability. With clear and reasonable regulations in place, legitimate projects and companies can operate with confidence, while bad actors can be more effectively identified and dealt with.</p>



<p>The CEO&#8217;s stance comes at a time when regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space is increasing worldwide. Governments and financial watchdogs are grappling with the need to strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers from potential risks associated with digital assets.</p>

<p>Adams emphasized the need to explore new use cases rather than merely building marginal improvements on existing ones like Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and lending platforms. He believes that crypto&#8217;s superpowers can pave the way for innovative solutions that could potentially revolutionize traditional industries.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want more crypto projects that try to disrupt popular web2 apps using crypto superpowers to discover new use cases rather than building marginal improvements on the few existing use cases (AMMs, lending, etc)<br><br>Vampire attack web2, not uniswap for the 5000th time</p>&mdash; hayden.eth <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f984.png" alt="🦄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@haydenzadams) <a href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1682718268568788993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Adams, a prominent figure in the blockchain space, has long been an advocate for the growth and diversification of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. His vision for<a href="https://uniswap.org/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://uniswap.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> crypto projects</a> to challenge established Web2 applications aligns with the overarching goal of the blockchain industry to foster greater decentralization, transparency, and financial inclusion.</p>



<p>Web2 apps, referring to traditional, centralized internet platforms, have been dominant for decades, controlling user data and interactions. The emergence of Web3, powered by blockchain and cryptocurrencies, offers an alternative paradigm that aims to shift control back to users. Key features such as decentralization, trustlessness, and immutability inherent in blockchain technology provide the foundation for disruptive innovations.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="930" height="620" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572.png" alt="image 1572" class="wp-image-205040" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572.png 930w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" title="Uniswap Founder Advocates Crypto Projects to Disrupt Popular Web2 Apps 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>AMMs and lending platforms are some of the primary use cases that have gained significant traction in the DeFi space, but Adams urges developers and entrepreneurs to think beyond these applications. He argues that the real potential lies in using &#8220;crypto superpowers&#8221; to create novel solutions that can address real-world problems in diverse sectors, including finance, supply chain, healthcare, and governance, among others.</p>



<p>The term &#8220;Vampire attacking web2&#8221; coined by Adams suggests a strategic approach, wherein DeFi projects leverage the advantages of blockchain to compete with and supplant established Web2 apps. This approach not only challenges the centralized incumbents but also offers users greater privacy, security, and control over their data and assets.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conic Finance recently faced a second hack, raising questions about security audits. PeckShield audited the project, but the hack occurred outside the scope. SlowMist warns that audits can be bypassed, while Shenyu suggests audit companies be accountable to users.</strong></h5>



<p>Conic Finance, a liquidity provider platform, was recently hacked for the second time, sparking discussions on security audits. The project had been audited by PeckShield, but the hack occurred in the CurveLPOracleV2 contract, which was not part of the audit scope. SlowMist pointed out that if a project intends to do evil, it can bypass an audit. Shenyu from Cobo suggested that audit companies should be accountable to and paid by users.</p>

<p>Despite the security concerns, <a href="https://conic.finance/whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://conic.finance/whitepaper.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conic Finance</a> offers an easy-to-use platform for liquidity providers to diversify their exposure to multiple Curve pools. They introduce Conic Omnipools, which allocate liquidity in a single asset across multiple Curve pools, giving liquidity providers exposure to multiple Curve pools through a single LP token. </p>



<p>Additionally, all Curve LP tokens are automatically staked on Convex to earn CVX and CRV rewards, while Conic LPs receive CNC, the Conic DAO token. Liquidity in an Omnipool is allocated to Curve pools based on target allocation weights, which get updated regularly through a liquidity allocation vote held by the vote-locked CNC holders.</p>



<p>Omnipools are liquidity pools that Conic utilizes to allocate a single underlying asset across various Curve pools. The core mechanisms of Omnipools are: deposits and withdrawals, Curve LP token pricing, and rebalancing liquidity across Curve pools.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Troubled crypto-finance company Delio announced it would suspend some services and pay interest on virtual assets.</em></li>



<li><em>The notice will be adequate starting July 24 for all users on the platform.</em></li>



<li><em>The company is currently temporarily suspending operations because the management agency has confiscated all documents and assets from July 18.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the official <a href="https://blog.naver.com/byrowa/223163205856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, Delio, a South Korean crypto-finance company, has announced that it will suspend some services and stop paying interest on virtual assets to users on July 24.</strong></h5>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/200193-haru-invest-delio-damage-up-to-230m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delio </a>announces the suspension of virtual asset interest payments for some services and users for the following reasons. Hearings on reinstatement cases filed by several depositors against the platform are underway, and an interim disposition decision has been made.</p>



<p>In addition, due to a search and seizure on July 18, 2023, all property owned by the customer and the company, refrigerators, and other things were confiscated by the prosecutor&#8217;s office. This has made it challenging to provide normal services, and it is also necessary to protect the interests of all depositors by preventing the dispersion of Delio&#8217;s assets.</p>



<p>Accordingly, Delio announced that they have suspended certain services and interest payments, which will inevitably require additional costs, such as operating costs, based on Article 5 of the Terms of Service and Article 8 of the Deposit Terms and Conditions.</p>



<p>South Korea-based Delio is under scrutiny as the country&#8217;s Financial Services Commission (FSC) investigates the crypto lending company for alleged fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust.</p>

<p>According to a report from local news outlet Digital Asset, the investigation stems from Delio&#8217;s unilateral decision to suspend user deposits and withdrawals on June 14, causing concern among investors.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s management is also under scrutiny for denying any connection or exposure to its troubled sister lender, Haru Invest, before its suspension.</p>



<p>During an extraordinary meeting of investors held on June 17, Delio&#8217;s CEO, Jung Sang-ho, announced that the company would gradually resume withdrawals without giving a fixed schedule.</p>



<p>Partial withdrawals for some of its staking services began on June 27, as Delio sought to assure investors of its commitment to guarantee capital for compensation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>GMX token experiences a 7.9% decline, becoming the worst-performing cryptocurrency in the top 100 by market capitalization.</em></li>



<li><em>The token drops to just above $50 per token, reaching its lowest level in over a month.</em></li>



<li><em>Decreasing trade value locked (TVL) in the protocol&#8217;s smart contracts indicates struggles to retain crypto capital, impacting the token&#8217;s performance amidst a competitive crypto market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://coincu.com/183712-gmx-voted-to-integrate-chainlinks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GMX</a>, the governance and utility token powering an Arbitrum-based decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading perpetual cryptocurrency futures with leverage, has faced a challenging 24 hours in the market.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1567.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1567-1024x341.png" alt="GMX Big Drop In Price With 7% In A Day" class="wp-image-205015" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1567-1024x341.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1567-300x100.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1567-768x256.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1567-1536x512.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1567-750x250.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1567-1140x380.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1567.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="GMX Big Drop In Price With 7% In A Day 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to TradingView, the token has tanked around 7.9%, making it the worst-performing cryptocurrency among the top 100 by market capitalization.</p>



<p>Over the past day, GMX/USD dropped to just above $50 per token, marking a disappointing performance when compared to other tokens that experienced only minor declines. Bitcoin&#8217;s attempts to reclaim the $30,000 mark were underway during this period.</p>



<p>The recent decline has led GMX to its lowest levels in over a month, with the cryptocurrency now down by 19.2% from its earlier highs of around $62.</p>



<p>Despite the significant drop, there is no apparent new catalyst behind GMX&#8217;s recent price decline. However, upon investigating DeFiLlama, it becomes evident that the protocol&#8217;s trade value locked (TVL) in its smart contracts has been steadily decreasing on both Arbitrum and Avalanche in recent months.</p>



<p>The falling TVL, particularly denominated in ETH, indicates that the protocol is struggling to retain crypto capital, which might explain the recent underperformance of the GMX token.</p>

<p>As the market continues to fluctuate, GMX faces challenges in maintaining its position within the highly competitive cryptocurrency landscape. Investors and analysts will closely monitor further developments and any potential catalysts that might impact the token&#8217;s performance in the coming days.</p>

<p>Looking at the current price, we can see the token is trading below the 38.2% Fib level and just above $50. This price zone is the last support level when there is no support level for GMX to support.</p>



<p>It seems that the bulls are dominating at the moment. Investors should wait for the next beneficial signals to buy. But now, with the severe drop in price and worrying performance, the token is not the right choice for us.</p>

<li><em>The proposed changes to the ArbitrumDAO Constitution aim to provide flexibility for the start date of the Security Council election.</em></li>

<li><em>The revised Constitution also suggests that all future security elections should be performed via the on-chain election process.</em></li>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1565.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1565.png" alt="ArbitrumDAO Proposes On-Chain Election Process For Increased Security" class="wp-image-205008" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1565.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1565-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1565-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1565-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ArbitrumDAO Proposes On-Chain Election Process For Increased Security 22"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The ArbitrumDAO Constitution specifies that the first Security Council election should start on the 15th of September alongside a specification for the election. However, an on-chain implementation of the entire election is still a work in progress. The Arbitrum Foundation has sponsored the implementation of a smart contract suite by Offchain Labs, an extension of Tally’s user interface, and the respective audits.</p>



<p>To provide flexibility for the start date of the election, a proposal has been made to revise the ArbitrumDAO Constitution. If passed by a Constitutional Vote, the new start date will be on the 15th of September or the earliest possible date in which an on-chain election can begin. </p>



<p>The motivation to change the election’s start date is to provide time for the implementation to be completed, security audits to be performed, for the community to gain confidence in the quality of its performance, and for the Arbitrum DAO to vote on a separate Constitutional AIP to install an on-chain election system. The overarching goal is to allow the election to begin on the 15th of September, but it is prudent to provide leeway and ensure all parties, especially the Arbitrum DAO, are confident in the election software’s security and completeness.</p>



<p>The proposal suggests that the first and all subsequent security elections should be performed via the on-chain election process. However, the activation of the Security Council election is dependent on the complete implementation for the on-chain smart contracts, complete implementation of the user interface, and smart contract audit by a highly regarded auditing firm, all parties, including the Arbitrum DAO, have gained confidence in the implementation’s completeness and security, and successful Constitutional Vote by the DAO to install the new election software.</p>

<p>Parrot Protocol, a DeFi project built on Solana that raised $85 million through IDO in September 2021, has <a href="https://twitter.com/spreekaway/status/1682393702147190785" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/spreekaway/status/1682393702147190785" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly </a>proposed a controversial plan to convert the project into a token-free protocol and redeem its Token PRT at $0.0045. The team controls 81% of the 14.2 billion PRTs available, with the majority of the team-controlled tokens being unlocked early without a DAO vote. </p>

<p>The community, comprising eight original investors who paid $80M into the project, owns the remaining 2.78 (19%) tokens. Parrot Protocol has $72M in assets, meaning that if 80% of the community redeems their 2.78 PRT at $0.0045, the team-controlled tokens will receive closer to $0.0055 per PRT, or 22% more per PRT token.</p>



<p>Following the threads, Spreek posted an image saying that unlocking unvested tokens is a controversial issue in the Parrot Protocol community. There is a significant supply overhang of unvested PRT tokens for the VCs that participated in the seed round. About 1/3 of these vesting tokens have already been unlocked in the first year, and a further 2/3 would be released over the next two years. </p>

<p>Parrot Protocol&#8217;s controversial proposal to convert it into a token-free protocol and redeem its Token PRT at $0.0045 has caused a stir in the community. The team controls the majority of the PRT tokens, and the community is concerned that this proposal will allow the team to obtain the remaining funds from the IDO. Unlocking unvested tokens is an issue that the community is grappling with, and the proposal to unlock them earlier could help to reduce uncertainties and support a more stable market for PRT tokens.</p>
