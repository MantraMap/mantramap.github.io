Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, thinks people rooting to have crypto shut down are &#8220;incredibly cringe.&#8221; Uniswap Founder: Let People Be In a tweet on January 26, Hayden emphasized that no one has forced anybody to use crypto, buy coins, or keep up with the latest events in the industry. He also added that no one asks for the &#8220;dumb&#8221; global fiat system to be shut down.

People rooting for crypto to be shut down are incredibly cringe. Like no one is trying to shut down the dumb fiat system you use, no one is forcing you to buy crypto; no one is forcing you to read crypto news or follow crypto Twitter. Let people do what they want and chill. It is not immediately clear what triggered Hayden to vent his frustrations on Twitter. However, what&#8217;s known is that no-coiners, individuals who are against crypto, hold no coin, or show no desire to participate, have been shooting down blockchain and crypto proponents. Tackling Nocoiners Over the years, crypto&#8217;s volatility has been called into question, with many regulators and heads of agencies slamming top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Billionaire Warren Buffet and economist Nouriel Roubini, nicknamed Dr. Doom, lead the pack. In the aftermath of the FTX collapse, while attending the Abu Dhabi Finance Week, Nouriel said Binance&#8217;s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, was a &#8220;ticking time bomb,&#8221; and he was surprised that Binance had been allowed to operate in the Gulf state. He wants regulators across the world to &#8220;think carefully&#8221; about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. As of January 27, the price of Bitcoin was changing hands at around $23,000. Like Warren, Dr. Doom says cryptocurrencies, with which Hayden made a platform for easy trading, hold no intrinsic value. He always insists that crypto is the biggest scam in financial history. Nouriel mainly blames regulators in the United States for being &#8220;lenient&#8221;. Crypto is the biggest scam ever in financial history. Their true value isn&#8217;t 0; it is rather negative, given their negative externalities. 100s of celebrities handsomely profited by peddling criminal shit coins and crypto scams, shafting suckers. The current fines are only a slap on the wrist. They should be prosecuted. Uniswap is a leading cryptocurrency exchange, allowing for the trustless exchange of various tokens and NFTs. Founded in late 2018, the exchange, under Hayden Adams, has grown to be one of the world&#8217;s largest DEXes, serving millions of users across the globe.  Related Reading: How Uniswap Was Saved From Critical Vulnerability By This Security Firm DeFiLlama data shows that the DEX has a total value locked (TVL) of $3.8 billion as of January 27.
