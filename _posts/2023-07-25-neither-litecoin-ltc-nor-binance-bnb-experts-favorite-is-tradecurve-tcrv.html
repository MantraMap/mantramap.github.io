<p class="s5">After the collapse of the FTX Exchange, and the bankruptcy of big banks like Silvergate Capital and Silicon Valley Bank, investors have become skeptical about most crypto projects, including Litecoin (LTC) and Binance (BNB). Hence, they have started to shift toward Tradecurve(TCRV), a new crypto project.</p>
<p class="s5">Investors in these projects have been on the losing side for quite a long time. Due to its novel features and huge growth potential, Tradecurve has been able to attract thousands of investors, who are looking at the project for long-term growth.</p>

Litecoin (LTC) Sees Increase In Trade Volume
<p class="s5">Litecoin (LTC) recently received positive support after the US regulators termed it a commodity. The development has come as a major relief for Litecoin, which is awaiting a halving event. It is also an encouraging development for the Litecoin community as the token is still 79% down from its peak price of $412.96.</p>
<p class="s5">Besides, Litecoin earlier launched its Litecoin Card Program across Europe to increase its adoption rate. This has benefited Litecoin as the number of transactions on the platform has seen an uptick in the past month. Subsequently, the price of Litecoin has witnessed a rise of 9% in the last month. Currently, Litecoin is changing hands at $86.22.</p>

Binance (BNB) Accused of Serious Irregularities
<p class="s5">The US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed a lawsuit against Binance(BNB) that could have serious repercussions on the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Binance has been falling on the price chart for the past many days. The trading price of Binancehas fallen by over 1% in the last week.</p>
<p class="s5">As a result, Binance is currently available to trade at $329.15. According to the lawsuit, Binancehas flouted many regulations, including those related to anti-money laundering and KYC. Along with Binance exchange, its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, has also been named in the lawsuit.
