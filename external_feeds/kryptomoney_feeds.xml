<p>During the early hours of Wednesday morning, crypto prices experienced an overnight surge. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-predicted-to-soar-to-100k-by-2024-declares-standard-chartered/">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s value rose by 3.7% over the past day, according to Binance data via <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">TradingView</a>, and was trading at $28,722 at the time of this post. Ether also saw a 2.2% increase in value during the same period. The increase in crypto prices coincided with banking issues at First Republic, a U.S. bank that saw $102 billion in deposit outflows during Q1 2023, $72 billion more than expected. The banking woes have also led to broader banking concerns, <a href="https://en.swissquote.com/newsroom#">according</a> to Swissquote.<br /><br />Standard Chartered declared that the recent U.S. banking issues have been the catalyst for Bitcoin&#8217;s rally to above $30,000 and a return to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s core use case. They believe that the <em>&#8220;crypto winter is over,&#8221;</em> a sentiment that has been echoed by other experts, such as Markus Thielen from Matrixport, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7056762542936772608/">predicts</a> that the price of Bitcoin could reach $45,000 by year-end.<br /><br />JPMorgan analysts have warned that Ether may face further selling pressure after Binance initiated Ethereum withdrawals this week, which could <em>&#8220;put further pressure on ETH over the coming weeks.&#8221;</em> Despite taking up to 15 days to be fulfilled, the withdrawals could still affect ether&#8217;s value. Additionally, liquid staking protocol Lido Finance plans to enable ether withdrawals in May.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-accused-of-deliberately-flouting-laws-by-cftc-chief/">Binance</a> also announced its liquid staking token, set to launch on Thursday. The recent dip in the crypto market caused futures traders going long to suffer over $700 million in liquidations, and the recent surge resulted in shorts suffering a similar fate, with about $77 million in short positions across derivatives exchanges being liquidated in the past 24 hours, mostly across Binance, OKX, and Bybit.</p>

<p>South Korean investigators have revealed that approximately $8.6 million<a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=2310&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter"> remains</a> in the Sygnum Bank account of Do Kwon, the CEO of Terraform Labs (TFL), while the investigation into his company is ongoing. Sygnum, a crypto bank established in Switzerland, was founded in 2017.<br /><br />Earlier this year, the U.S. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/u-s-congress-to-address-stablecoin-legislation-and-sec-oversight/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) reported that Kwon transferred a large sum of Bitcoins, valued at about $258 million, to a Swiss bank, which was later identified as Sygnum. The head of a financial securities crime investigation team in South Korea recently announced that they are keeping a close watch on the Bitcoin holdings of the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG).<br /><br />It was also disclosed during a press conference, following the indictment of several individuals without detention, that around $100 million had been cashed out and moved to the Sygnum account, as noted in the SEC complaint. <br /><br />Officials explained that the large sum of money had been allocated for various purposes and was not entirely present in the Sygnum account. Some of the funds were transferred to a law firm&#8217;s account as payment for legal services, leaving roughly $8.6 million in the account.<br /><br />Both South Korean and U.S. investigative agencies have requested a freeze on the Sygnum account, but it is still unknown whose appeal will take precedence.<br /><br />Swiss authorities and banks are obligated to present evidence before any decision can be reached. The investigators reiterated their commitment to assisting victims quickly and emphasized the need for Kwon&#8217;s extradition to South Korea.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bybit-introduces-merkle-tree-verified-proof-of-reserves/">Bybit</a>, a crypto exchange headquartered in <a href="https://twitter.com/sumitkapoor16/status/1648377443026345984">Dubai</a>, announced that it will require know-your-customer (KYC) checks on all its services starting May 8, 2023. <br /><br />Existing users who have not completed identity verification by that date will only be allowed to close existing open positions or orders, return loans, or withdraw. <br /><br />The policy shift was hinted at in December 2022, when Bybit introduced KYC requirements for peer-to-peer trading and some NFT services. Bybit has implemented various security measures to protect its users&#8217; funds, including multi-signature cold wallets, DDoS protection, and two-factor authentication. <br /><br />The exchange also regularly performs security audits and maintains an insurance fund to cover any potential losses due to security breaches. By making KYC mandatory for all users, the exchange aims to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities while ensuring compliance with global regulations.<br /><br />The exchange did not offer any explanation for the move, but the decision comes amid increased regulatory scrutiny of crypto exchanges worldwide, particularly in the U.S. Bybit is among the many crypto firms based in Dubai, and it<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-29/crypto-com-bybit-announce-plans-to-set-up-operations-in-dubai"> relocated</a> its headquarters from Singapore to Dubai last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/bitcoin-btc-price-could-hit-100000-by-end-2024-standard-chartered.html?&amp;qsearchterm=bitcoin">note published</a> by Standard Chartered on Monday, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other mid-tier U.S. lenders has strengthened the case for Bitcoin as a decentralized, trustless and scarce digital asset. <br /><br />Analyst Geoff Kendrick believes that the much-touted &#8220;crypto winter&#8221; is finally over, and he sees potential for <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-plunges-below-30000-amid-economic-concerns/">Bitcoin</a> to reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. Kendrick suggests that the current stress in the traditional banking sector is highly conducive to Bitcoin&#8217;s outperformance and validates the original premise for Bitcoin. <br /><br />Furthermore, Kendrick notes that, given Bitcoin&#8217;s advantages, its share of the total digital asset market cap could move into the 50–60% range in the next few months. The cryptocurrency was trading at $27,413 as at the time of this post. <br /><br />Kendrick argues that the stabilization of risk assets and speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary tightening further means the pathway to $100,000 is becoming clearer. Proponents of Bitcoin believe that it is an asset worth diversifying into in times of economic distress. <br /><br />As the theory goes, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million bitcoins, meaning it should appreciate as demand for alternative assets grows to avoid the effects of high inflation. Standard Chartered isn&#8217;t the only one predicting a strong rally in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. <br /><br />Multiple crypto industry insiders forecast Bitcoin to hit a new all-time high in 2023. Some crypto investors are pointing to the anticipation of the next so-called Bitcoin &#8220;halving&#8221; as a potential catalyst for another monster rally in the coin&#8217;s price.</p>

This move is aimed at allowing eligible customers to leverage their crypto assets to manage risk, generate returns, and gain directional exposure.<br /><br />Gemini has <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-foundation-a-non-us-crypto-derivatives-platform">announced</a> that the platform will be available in several countries, including Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Argentina, Bahamas, Bermuda, Brazil, El Salvador, Israel, Nigeria, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand, and Turkey.

Gemini&#8217;s move to expand its presence in international markets is expected to create more opportunities for users globally to access and trade cryptocurrencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bitcoin and <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ether-sets-daily-record-in-outflow-from-centralized-exchanges/">Ether</a> experienced significant price drops on Friday, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes remained relatively stagnant throughout the day. <br /><br />TradingView data showed that Bitcoin&#8217;s value had declined by 3.5% in the last 24 hours, with a trading value of $27,271, while Ether was down almost 5%. The cause for the downward trend in the volatile digital currency market is not always clear, but some suggest that it could be due to a decrease in excitement among speculators. <br /><br />Matt Klein, a portfolio strategist at Nascent, noted that DOGE&#8217;s rally leading into 4/20 and the meme coin PEPE dominating on-chain activities are signs of euphoria that have started to make speculators risk-off. Daniel Matuszewski of CMS investment firm described the trend as &#8220;pre-selling before May and go away.&#8221;<br /><br />Additionally, the Financial Times<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/29c67711-377c-4435-9c90-280852374e93"> reported</a> that the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan would steer clear of future crypto investments after it wrote off a $95 million investment into the failed FTX exchange.<br /><br />The OTPP chief executive, Jo Taylor, said, &#8220;We&#8217;re still working through what exactly happened there and you&#8217;re going to be careful.&#8221; Meanwhile, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, has expressed its intention to tighten risk assessment rules for nonbank companies.<br /><br />The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed the day with a modest gain of around 0.1%.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kucoincom/status/1649382189715578882">KuCoin</a>, a crypto exchange based in Seychelles, has ranked XRP as the second-most traded token after Bitcoin (BTC). <br /><br />In the past 24 hours, XRP achieved a spot trading volume of $94 million, accounting for 11.16% of the total trading volume on the exchange. <br /><br />Meanwhile,<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-plunges-below-30000-amid-economic-concerns/"> Bitcoin</a> garnered $187 million in spot trading volume, making up 22.18% of the 24-hour trading volume. Notably, XRP was among the top five coins by weekly search popularity on KuCoin, which boasts more than 20 million users across 200 countries worldwide.<br /><br />In other news,<a href="https://twitter.com/bit_castle/status/1649338462083092481"> Bitcastle</a>, a crypto exchange in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, announced a promotion for the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP communities, offering a chance for one lucky winner to win $1,000 each day until April 23.<br /><br />At the time of writing, XRP&#8217;s trading value has dropped by 4.85% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.467. The crypto market is currently experiencing profit-taking as investors react to the potential interest rate hike. The crypto market is also set to experience its third consecutive day of downturn, resulting in the liquidation of millions of dollars.<br /><br />Although <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-takes-lead-as-most-traded-token-on-this-major-korean-exchange-details/">XRP</a> trading volume has slightly increased by 9%, traders are watching for signals of the next market move. XRP has experienced a 13.63% decrease in April so far after recording a positive 42% surge in March.<br /><br />With the current market volatility, whales are moving their assets, as evidenced by WhaleAlert&#8217;s detection of a lump sum of 119,072,730 XRP worth $56,830,113 transferring between unknown wallets in the last 24 hours.</p>

She also highlighted Ripple&#8217;s eagerness to expand in the European market, joining other major <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/new-york-attorney-general-moves-to-shut-down-unregistered-crypto-firms/">crypto firms</a> such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken in welcoming the new legislation.<br /><br />MiCA aims to provide regulatory clarity and harmonization for crypto firms operating across Europe. With a significant majority of 517 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voting in favor and only 38 voting against, the legislation now moves to its final formal vote in the Council of the EU on May 16.<br /><br />According to Circle&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1649014582009110533">Patrick Hansen</a>, the regulation will take effect for stablecoin issuers in June 2024 and for all other crypto-asset service providers in December 2024, upon publication in the Official Journal of the EU.<br /><br />The EU&#8217;s primary objectives with MiCA are to protect consumers engaging in crypto transactions, create regulatory harmonization to allow companies to operate on an EU-wide basis, provide legal certainty for companies and institutions entering the space, and establish a leading role in global crypto regulation. This comprehensive framework offers companies a clear rulebook for various services, including token issuance, exchange, and custody, enabling fair competition and innovation.<br /><br />With the passage of MiCA, the EU is poised to become a global hub for crypto projects due to regulatory clarity and its large single market of 450 million consumers.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/coinbase-set-to-receive-470k-from-wahi-brothers/">Coinbase</a>, a major cryptocurrency exchange, has announced that it has been granted a Class F License under the Digital Asset Business Act by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Bermuda was one of the first countries to implement full digital asset regulation in 2018, and Coinbase has praised the BMA&#8217;s <em>&#8220;level of rigor, transparency, compliance, and cooperation.&#8221;</em> The company has chosen Bermuda as an international hub due to the BMA&#8217;s world-class leadership and involvement in global regulation.<br /><br />Coinbase is set to launch its offshore derivatives exchange in Bermuda by the end of this month, according to reports from <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/04/19/coinbase-gets-bermuda-license-plans-to-launch-offshore-exchange-in-coming-weeks/">Fortune</a>. In addition to its expansion in Bermuda, Coinbase has also provided updates on its progress in expanding to Singapore, Brazil, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, and Europe in a recent <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/an-update-to-coinbases-global-scale-to-go-broad-and-deep">blog post.</a><br /><br />Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong had previously stated that the company might consider leaving the US to operate in the UK due to regulatory challenges in the US. Coinbase has faced various actions in the US, including receiving a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission in March. The company settled with the New York Department of Financial Services on an unrelated issue in January and settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2021.<br /><br />While the Bermuda license and other expansions do not signify a complete move away from the US or address the aforementioned issues, Coinbase is taking a <em>&#8220;go broad and go deep approach&#8221;</em> to ensure that it can serve users globally. Kraken, another cryptocurrency exchange, has also recently obtained regulatory approval in Ireland, while Binance expanded to Sweden in January, indicating a growing trend of cryptocurrency exchanges expanding their global reach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are several places in Dubai in which there are the best ways to <a href="https://cryptodesk.ae/sell-usdt-in-dubai">Sell USDT in Dubai</a>. As a stablecoin tied to the value of the US dollar, USDT is widely used in financial dealings and investments. But, if you need to sell your USDT in Dubai, you&#8217;ll want to be familiar with the best options available to you. Here, we&#8217;ll go over some of the most effective strategies for selling USDT in Dubai, along with some helpful hints and advice.</p>
<h3>Cryptocurrency exchanges</h3>
<p>The role of cryptocurrency exchanges in buying and selling cryptocurrencies is crucial. These marketplaces allow users to trade and invest in various coins and tokens by exchanging them for fiat currency or other digital assets. Particularly notable is Crypto Desk, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges today to Sell tether in Dubai.</p>
<p>The trading platform provided by Crypto Desk, a registered exchange, is both safe and simple to use. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are some cryptocurrencies accepted on the exchange. One of the most promising features of the crypto desk is that you can sell tether coin, USDT crypto, exchange USDT for cash, and exchange USDT For Dirhams. It&#8217;s easy to purchase, sell, and trade and supports various currency pairs. The security measures at Crypto Desk prevent unauthorized access to customer funds or private data. Its superb customer service is another reason investors and traders should consider it.</p>
<h3>Over-the-counter (OTC) trading</h3>
<p>Trading cryptocurrencies directly between individuals, as opposed to through an exchange, is known as over-the-counter (OTC) trading. The benefits of over-the-counter (OTC) trading benefits include shorter processing times, reduced fees, and higher levels of individual attention. High-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, and major trading businesses sometimes engage in off-exchange (OTC) trading when they need to buy or sell substantial amounts of cryptocurrencies without affecting the market price.</p>
<p>In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, OTC trading desks offer access to many other cryptocurrencies. Over-the-counter (OTC) transactions are handled at a trading desk, where parties can discuss pricing and terms of the settlement. Although over-the-counter trading has many benefits, working with a trustworthy OTC trading desk that prioritizes safety and regulation is essential.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a trustworthy and safe OTC trading platform, go no further than <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/goldman-sachs-launches-crypto-trading-desk-focused-on-btc-derivatives/">Crypto Desk</a>. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and many other cryptocurrencies and altcoins are all available on the platform. Clients are assigned their personal account managers at the Crypto Desk, who are there to facilitate transactions and offer analysis of the market. Customers may feel at ease knowing their money and data are secure on the platform. In addition, all transactions are done openly and responsibly thanks to Crypto Desk&#8217;s adherence to regulatory regulations.</p>
<h3>Peer-to-peer (P2P)</h3>
<p>Without the participation of a central authority, P2P trading allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with one another. Buyers and sellers meet each other online, negotiate a price, and complete the transaction in a P2P trade. Peer-to-peer (P2P) trade benefits include reduced costs, shortened processing times, and enhanced confidentiality. It&#8217;s also a common choice in places with weak or underdeveloped banking infrastructures. For this reason, peer-to-peer (P2P) trading in the cryptocurrency market has exploded in popularity.</p>
<h3>Crypto ATM Machine</h3>
<p>In Dubai, you can use a crypto ATM to purchase and trade cryptocurrencies quickly and easily. Like standard ATMs, crypto ATMs let customers purchase cryptocurrency using cash or a debit/credit card. Due to the increasing demand for easy and quick access to buying and selling cryptocurrency, crypto ATMs have become increasingly popular in Dubai.</p>
<p>In Dubai, you can use cryptocurrencies from ATMs from several providers, including BCB ATM, Bitaccess, and Bitcoin Depot. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash are just some of the cryptocurrencies that may be purchased and traded at these ATMs. Several Dubai crypto ATMs also feature stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards that must be met before any transactions can be processed.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency ATMs provide a quick and easy way to purchase and sell digital currency, but their costs exceed regular exchanges. Before utilizing a cryptocurrency ATM, comparing costs is a good idea. To ensure a safe and secure transaction, use encrypted wallet addresses.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>One of the wisest financial moves you can make in Dubai is to include crypto assets in your portfolio. To acquire cryptocurrency, you need only use a trusted and regulated crypto exchange platform, such as Crypto Desk. It won&#8217;t take you more than a few minutes to complete the purchase procedure. A final invoice is issued as evidence of the transaction. Get on the bandwagon now by purchasing or selling USDT in Dubai through Crypto Desk.</p>
