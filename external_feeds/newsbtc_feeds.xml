					<description><![CDATA[Hamburg-based Berenberg Capital Markets recently highlighted the upcoming Bitcoin halving event as a potential trigger for the bullish case of Microstrategy, a United States-based software firm, in a recent research note. The research note emphasized that Microstrategy, with a bullish price target of $430, primarily derives its value from its substantial holdings of over 150,000 BTC. And Berenberg expects the historical trend of Bitcoin rallying after each halving to repeat. Halving Events And Bitcoin&#8217;s Market Impact Halving events are significant occurrences in the Bitcoin network that happen approximately every four years. During these events, the rate of new coin issuance is reduced by 50%, resulting in a slower influx of new Bitcoins into the market. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 26, 2024, is expected to follow this pattern. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Doubles Down On Bitcoin, Adds 12,333 BTC To MicroStrategy’s Holdings Berenberg&#8217;s recent research note highlighted the historical trend observed in the previous three halvings and suggested that a pre-halving rally could potentially commence in about four months. If this rally follows a similar trajectory to previous halvings. It could persist until approximately October 2025, according to the research note. Berenberg noted: If the historical pattern established by the first three Bitcoin halvings continues to play out with the fourth halving, then the pre-halving rally would begin about four months from now. If a rally were to occur after the fourth halving, and if it were as long-lived as the rallies that occurred after the past couple of halvings, then it would continue until around October 2025. Correlation Between Bitcoin And Microstrategy&#8217;s Stock According to the research note, there is a strong correlation between Microstrategy&#8217;s stock price and the price of Bitcoin, estimated to be around 0.90. If the fourth bitcoin halving triggers a significant rally in the price of the cryptocurrency, it is likely that Microstrategy&#8217;s stock will follow suit. This forecast is due to the positive outlook for Bitcoin&#8217;s post-halving performance contributing to the anticipation of a potential rally in Microstrategy&#8217;s stock price. Following the release of Berenberg&#8217;s research note, Microstrategy&#8217;s stock, with the ticker symbol MSTR, has already witnessed a notable surge of 7% in the past day. The stock, which was trading below its current price range in the previous month, is now valued at $407. The market&#8217;s positive response reflects the optimism surrounding the potential impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event on Microstrategy&#8217;s performance. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the concept of halving has since been associated with significant market movements in the past. And investors closely monitor these events for potential opportunities.

And, consequently, on companies like Microstrategy, which holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Featured image from Blockchain Reporter, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced a substantial surge on the price chart towards the end of June. However, despite this notable increase, it failed to ward off the sellers who swiftly entered the market.  Can Dogecoin regain its momentum and rise again, or will it succumb to the mounting pressure from the bearish sentiment? Bitcoin (BTC) also experienced a downturn in the previous week, and this negative trend had a noticeable impact on the sentiment surrounding Dogecoin. Unfortunately, the figures did not provide a strong basis for a potential recovery in DOGE. Instead, it indicated a looming decline towards the price range of $0.053 and $0.048. DOGE Bearish Indicators Emerge The current DOGE price on CoinGecko stands at $0.0652, experiencing a modest 0.7% rally within the past 24 hours. However, it is important to note that a decline of 5.8% has been recorded over the course of the past seven days. Source: Coingecko This price movement has prompted a closer examination of the market conditions, revealing some bearish signals and underlying trends.

This discrepancy, referring to the difference between the current rally and previous ones, implies that the present market upswing may be lacking an equivalent degree of enthusiasm and support from buyers.

These factors may contribute to increased selling pressure and further price declines. Considering the current market conditions, it is important to approach the outlook for DOGE with caution. The short-term rally, although relatively subdued compared to past performances, could still offer opportunities for traders looking for quick gains.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin has reached a critical juncture in its current market cycle, according to a recent analysis conducted by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. The data reveals striking similarities to historical patterns, raising questions about the potential emergence of a familiar phenomenon: the re-accumulation period. A Resilient Market: Bitcoin Holds Firm At Mid-Cycle The Glassnode analysis reveals that Bitcoin is consolidating around the $30,000 mark, which acts as a significant mid-point within the 2021-2023 cycle. The historical significance of this level is not to be overlooked, as it has been tested repeatedly in previous cycles. Remarkably, the mid-cycle phenomenon is not exclusive to the current cycle; similar mid-cycle points were observed in both 2013-2016 and 2018-2019, displaying analogous supply dynamics. As Bitcoin currently hovers around the $30,000 mid-point, approximately 75% of the total supply is currently held in a profitable state, while the remaining 25% remains in a loss position. This balance of supply held in profit versus loss is reminiscent of equilibrium points witnessed during previous cycles, indicating a potential re-accumulation period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Rate Retakes All-Time High As Miners Continue To Expand Capacity As Glassnode explains, &#8220;This 75:25 balance of supply held in profit:loss is the equilibrium point for Bitcoin. 50% of all trading days have seen a higher Profit-to-Loss balance, and 50% a lower one.&#8221; Such equilibrium points have historically required time for the market to digest and re-consolidate around, often accompanied by a period of sideways trading and volatility. This has become known as the &#8220;re-accumulation period.&#8221; At the moment, The supply held &#8220;in-loss&#8221; has declined to just 4.79 million BTC, reaching similar levels seen in July 2021 ($30k), July 2020 ($9.2k), April 2016 ($6.5k), and March 2016 ($425). Robust Recovery And Historical Comparisons According to Glassnode, Bitcoin&#8217;s price performance in 2023 has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with a maximum drawdown of only -18% thus far, a shallow correction compared to previous cycles. This suggests a substantial underlying demand for the asset and indicates a potential strong degree of investor support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Google Search Interest Stands At Critical Level, What This Forecast For BTC Glassnode&#8217;s analysis further highlights the similarities between the current recovery rally and those observed in prior cycles. Historically, recovery rallies following a similar magnitude move off the cycle&#8217;s bottom often marked the genesis of a new cyclical uptrend. While exceptions exist, the parallels between the current recovery and those of the past offer an intriguing possibility for Bitcoin&#8217;s future trajectory. The report notes, &#8220;With the exception of 2019, all prior cycles which experienced a similar magnitude move off the bottom were, in fact, the genesis point of a new cyclical uptrend.&#8221; Remarkably, previous re-accumulation periods were characterized by a lack of macro market direction and tending to trade sideways. “With the market back at this equilibrium point, it remains to be seen if a similarly lengthy and choppy process is needed to overcome it,” concludes Glassnode. The Takeaway: Will History Repeat For BTC? Glassnode&#8217;s analysis unveils a fascinating narrative within Bitcoin&#8217;s ongoing market cycle. The emergence of the mid-cycle point and the familiar supply dynamics indicate that historical patterns are repeating themselves. While no crystal ball can predict the future with certainty, these insights offer intriguing possibilities for Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory. At press time, the BTC price was at $30,626 and remained in the trading range of the last two weeks. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

The report notes, &#8220;With the exception of 2019, all prior cycles which experienced a similar magnitude move off the bottom were, in fact, the genesis point of a new cyclical uptrend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remarkably, previous re-accumulation periods were characterized by a lack of macro market direction and tending to trade sideways. “With the market back at this equilibrium point, it remains to be seen if a similarly lengthy and choppy process is needed to overcome it,” concludes Glassnode.</p>

<h2>The Takeaway: Will History Repeat For BTC?</h2>
<p>Glassnode&#8217;s analysis unveils a fascinating narrative within Bitcoin&#8217;s ongoing market cycle. The emergence of the mid-cycle point and the familiar supply dynamics indicate that historical patterns are repeating themselves. While no crystal ball can predict the future with certainty, these insights offer intriguing possibilities for Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
<p>At press time, the BTC price was at $30,626 and remained in the trading range of the last two weeks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Justin Sun, the co-founder of Tron, withdrew 30,000 ETH, worth roughly $56 million, via two addresses via Lido, a liquidity staking service provider, on July 10, Lookonchain reveals. Following his move, his Ethereum stake via Lido is down to 263,294 ETH, or $491.6 million at spot rates. Justin Sun Unstakes From Ethereum Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, notes that between February 25 and 27, Sun staked 288,100 ETH, or $538 million, and earned 5,194 ETH, or $9 million. This translates to average daily earnings of 38 ETH, or $72,000, going by the annualized percentage yield (APY) of around 4.87% offered by Lido on Ethereum stakers. Related Reading: Narrow Bitcoin Price Range Suggests Explosive Move Ahead The reasons behind Sun&#8217;s withdrawal of 30,000 ETH from Lido are unclear. It could indicate his intention to sell some of the ETH, transfer to a different staking platform, or even run his private Ethereum validator node. Despite this transfer, Sun remains one of the largest stakers at Lido, accounting for over 9% of the total ETH staked. While Sun&#8217;s decision to unstaked and transfer coins may be a cause of concern, ETH prices are firm when writing on July 10 and edging closer to $1,900. Contrary to fears ahead of the Shanghai upgrade in mid-April, the number of users staking ETH remains upward. Trackers show that over 21 million ETH has been locked by over 657,000 validators as of July 10.  With the Shanghai upgrade implemented, ETH holders who had staked at least 32 ETH in the Beacon Chain from December 2020 can withdraw their assets. Despite earlier fears that more coins will be withdrawn and sold in the spot markets, impacting ETH prices, more validators and more coins have been locked on the Beacon Chain and other staking solutions.  Will The SEC Dampen Coin Staking? Lido, the leading staking provider for ETH, is the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol by total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. As of July 10, Lido managed over $14.6 billion of assets, most of which are ETH.  Over $14.5 billion of ETH have been delegated and locked through Lido infrastructure. In Lido, users can stake ETH and other supported coins without needing lock-up periods or meeting high requirements, making it an attractive option for some investors. In lawsuits filed against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase in early June, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that some proof-of-stake coins, including Cardano&#8217;s ADA and Algorand&#8217;s ALGO, were unregistered securities.  Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Tallies 10% Gains On Weekly Chart – Will It Cross $25? Following this assessment, their prices tanked, even impacting ETH. This is partly because Ethereum is now a proof-of-stake network after transiting from a proof-of-work algorithm and uses the same consensus system as those employed by competing smart contract platforms accused of issuing unregistered securities. The situation is worsened by Gary Gensler&#8217;s failure to clarify whether ETH is a utility like Bitcoin.  Cover image from Canvas, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The difficulty of mining Bitcoin has been steadily climbing for some time now, as more and more miners compete with one another to be the one to mine the next block on the Bitcoin blockchain successfully. With the weather now clearing up in Texas, the world&#8217;s Bitcoin mining stronghold, miners are coming back online to double down on their operations. This time around, this has pushed the mining hash rate to a new all-time high. Hash Rate Reaches All-Time High Over the weekend, the mining hash rate reached a new all-time high. According to info from Hashrate Index backed by data from Ycharts, Bitcoin’s hash rate spiked to 465 EH/s on Saturday from 406 EH/s on the previous day. Related Reading: Analyst: Expect Altcoin Season After Bitcoin Halves In 2024 Specifically, the 7-day average hash rate hit 401 EH/s on Saturday, while the 3-day average has risen a more staggering 18% to 448 EH/s. Although the hash rate has now dropped to 425 EH/s at the time of writing, it is still at its highest levels and up more than 119.1% from one year ago.  The increase in the hash rate has naturally led to an increase in the block production rate. Over the last couple of months, BTC miners had been targeting a block production rate of 6 per hour, now, a block is produced at an average time of 9 minutes and 15 seconds. BTC price recovers above $30,600 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Mining Revenue Hits $184 Million In Q2 Bitcoin has seen a flurry of increase in transaction volumes this year, as the cryptocurrency continues to dominate the industry. In the past 24 hours alone, the total volume of bitcoin traded increased by 30.37%.  According to a report by published by Coin Metrics on July 5, BTC miners generated a remarkable revenue of $2.4 billion during the second quarter of 2023. Out of this amount, $184 million came from transaction fees alone, representing more than the five preceding quarters combined.  This increase in transaction fee revenue is traced to the increase in transaction volume after BRC-20 tokens were introduced on the Bitcoin blockchain. The BRC-20 came in as a token standard to allow the creation and transfer facilities of fungible tokens on the blockchain through the use of ordinal inscriptions.

Bitcoin miners have also experienced favorable macroeconomic conditions in the last quarter, including lower electricity rates for miners based in the United States. On the other hand, Bitcoin mining has been growing in the Middle East, with the UAE leading the charge. Miners in the UAE now produce approximately 13 EH/s, accounting for almost 4% of the total hash rate.  As for Bitcoin, the price of the cryptocurrency has been ranging in the $30,000 mark since late June.

					<description><![CDATA[The price of Bitcoin is stuck at its current levels as bulls and bears fight for control. The number one cryptocurrency by market cap experienced some gains in the past weeks, but volatility across the board declined, leading to the current dynamic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks And Whales Go On $2.15 Billion Buying Spree, Is It Time To Sell? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $30,500 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has recorded a 2% loss while the rest of the sector follows and records steeper losses. Google Metric Hints At Profits For Bitcoin? According to analyst Dylan LeClair, Google searches for Bitcoin Price have declined since 2023. The chart below shows that searches for this keyword decreased since 2021. At that time, BTC was on a bull run and managed to climb as high as $69,000 from a $3,000 low last seen in March 2020. In that sense, Google searches for Bitcoin Price operate as a proxy to gauge interest in the cryptocurrency. Interest from mainstream media and non-crypto investors follows the price of the cryptocurrency. The higher the interest the chart hints at, the higher the price. Conversely, interest declines as the price of the cryptocurrency declines. Historical interest in the keyword “Bitcoin price” on Google has fluctuated to the upside, as the chart below shows. In the 2017 to 2018 bull run, the monthly searches for this keyword rose to unprecedented levels, but the percentile has been consistent on the downside since 2019 before BTC can resume its bullish momentum. In other words, since 2017, BTC only enters a bull-run phase when interest declines to a certain point; the metric is close to those levels.
