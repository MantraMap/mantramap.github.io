title: Large cap altcoins push crypto through the $1 trillion mark

<p>Cryptocurrencies have run amuck over the last few days as Bitcoin has helped lead the sector out of the doldrums.&nbsp;</p>
An unexpected surge
<p>A huge pump to the upside has seen the total market cap of crypto push through the $1 trillion mark, a level not seen since early November of last year.</p>
<p>At only $830 million on the first day of January, things had not been looking particularly rosy for the crypto asset class, but bitcoin was about to have other ideas and a slow incremental crawl upwards suddenly saw the king of the cryptos catch fire and surge upwards.</p>
<p>Even though BTC dominance continued to climb over the last few days, various cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin&rsquo;s example in a big way. Probably one of the biggest turn-arounds among the large cap cryptos has been Solana.</p>
Solana
<p>When the FTX collapse happened things turned very bad for the Solana price, given that Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research had been big supporters and holders of Solana and the $SOL token.</p>
<p>At one point $SOL was under $8, and for some commentators, was heading for zero. However, such a supremely fast blockchain with such a large ecosystem was not going to keep on going down.</p>
<p>In fact, the price has trebled since that time and has currently settled at around $23. A pullback is possibly on the cards next, and $14 might well be a good place to start accumulating again.</p>
Avalanche
<p>Avalanche is another of the large caps to make some great gains over the last couple of weeks. Although not in the same league as $SOL, $AVAX managed to increase by 75% over this period. Most of this increase would have no doubt been due to the AWS partnership.</p>
Ethereum
<p>Obviously, when large cap alts are mentioned Ethereum will always spring to mind. A more than 35% increase over the last 2 weeks is not to be sneered at, and if Ethereum&rsquo;s market cap is taken into account, the increase in value here is probably more than for any of the other large cap alts.</p>
<p>In fact, it could be said that Ethereum is the main cryptocurrency leading the rest of the pack higher. The ETH/BTC pair has been on an upwards trajectory since June of last year. For many, the ETH flippening of BTC is only a matter of time.</p>
