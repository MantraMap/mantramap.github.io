<p>Earlier today, Binance and Huobi announced that they had thwarted a money laundering scheme involving funds stolen from Harmony Horizon Bridge last year.</p>



<p>According to Changpeng Zhao “CZ”, Binance assisted Huobi in netting the hacker who had earlier tried to launder the stolen crypto assets through Binance.</p>



<p>“<em>We detected Harmony One hacker fund movement. They previously tried to launder through Binance and we froze his accounts. This time he used Huobi. We assisted Huobi team to freeze his accounts,” </em>tweeted CZ.</p>



<p>According to the Binance founder, they recovered 124 BTC valued at approximately $2.5 million at press time. Huobi’s advisor Justin Sun later confirmed the news thanking the exchanges’ dedicated team for detecting and preventing the funds from being laundered. </p>



<p><em>“This is a prime example of how centralized exchanges (CeFi) can work together to keep the crypto community SAFU. We will continue to be vigilant in our efforts to protect our users&#8217; funds and promote a safe and secure trading environment,” </em>he said.</p>



<p>The announcement comes after on-chain crypto sleuth ZachXBT <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1614902410350301184">highlighted</a> that North Korea’s Lazarus Group had sent 41,000 ETH worth about $64M over the weekend and $63.5m to three exchange addresses. Confirming that the ETH was from the Harmony Horizon Bridge hack, the detective noted that the assets had originated from anonymizing service Tornado Cash to Railgun before being deposited to the exchanges.</p>



<p>“<em>Seems Binance and Huobi froze a portion of the funds,”</em> ZachXBT later wrote after CZ’s announcement.</p>



<p>This has been the largest seizure by the exchanges since the Harmony Horizon Bridge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/harmonys-one-token-nosedives-double-digits-after-hacker-drained-100m-from-horizon-bridge/">reported</a> that hackers had exploited a vulnerability to steal $100 million on June 24, 2022. Launched in October 2020, Harmony Horizon Bridge was one of the first cross-bridge protocols and helped users to send assets from one chain to the other. Some analysts believe that the hackers could have targeted login credentials belonging to employees of the firm before deploying programs to initiate the heist.</p>



<p>Several blockchain analysis providers linked the theft to the Lazarus Group, which is believed to be funding North Korea’s ballistic weapons program. The group has also been to the theft of over $2 billion, including a $620 million heist on the Ronin Network, a sidechain built for the popular Web3 game Axie Infinity last March.</p>

<p>Austin Federa, head of strategy and communications at the Solana Foundation, has hinted at major development for the Solana network in 2023, igniting a major spike in SOL’s price after more than three months in the doldrums.</p>



<p>Speaking to Bloomberg Friday, he noted that the foundation would focus on reinvesting in the fundamentals to create opportunities for builders in 2023, adding that the community was already angling towards that direction.</p>



<h2 id="h-moving-past-ftx-relationship"><strong>Moving Past FTX Relationship</strong></h2>



<p>The last half of 2022 was tough for the Solana community, particularly after it was revealed that Alameda’s Research and FTX had entanglements with Solana.</p>



<p>However, assuring the community, Federa noted that they had taken control of all projects linked to the collapsed crypto exchange and its founder. Sam and FTX got involved with the Solana network in the summer of 2020 when they started building Serum, a central limit order book built on-9chain “that couldn’t be built on any other blockchain network”. Serum would later become the first limit order book deployed on a blockchain.</p>



<p><em>“That code has been taken over by the community and relaunched as something called Open Book. So that’s kind of what I was talking about the community healing parts of the ecosystem that Sam and FTX were involved in,” </em>said Federa.</p>



<p>He went on to note that despite the FTX fallout bringing a lot of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/despite-solanas-tumble-amid-the-ftx-collapse-the-community-is-keeping-its-hopes-high/">doom and gloom</a> for Solana, active addresses and validators had shot up, meaning that “more people are using the network than were before.”</p>



<p><em>“The interesting part is that the technology wasn’t part of what happened at all</em>’ he said adding, <em>“What we’ve seen is the community and developers around the world really come together and replace the parts of the ecosystem that had FTX involvement and then expand from there.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 id="h-bye-bye-to-outages-network-instability"><strong>Bye-bye To Outages, Network Instability</strong></h2>



<p>He announced that they were working on improving the network’s processes by building a new validator client.</p>



<p><em>“One of those biggest investments is a second validator client which is really a second copy of the system that runs the network. That means that if one system goes down, there is a second system that can step in,” </em>he added.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The new client would help <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-over-10-network-outages-solana-proposes-a-genius-solution-to-solve-debacle/">eliminate outages</a> and instability problems that have plagued Solana for the past two years. Furthermore, apart from improving performance, it would introduce optimisations that allow people to build products and services that are just as efficient as their web 2 counterparts.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the announcement has sent SOL prices skyrocketing as investors took the news as bullish. In the past 7 days, SOL grew over 43% to tap $24- the highest level since Nov 2022. As of writing, the crypto was trading at $23.60, according to CoinMarketCap data.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter adds 30 more cryptocurrencies to its $Cashtags innovation, which shows real-time prices of assets. </li>



<li>XRP, Tether, and Solana, among others, join Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stocks in line with Twitter’s plan for virtual assets.</li>



<li>Dogecoin faithful celebrate their beloved asset’s inclusion after a shocking snub when the policy started in December.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Elon Musk’s leadership of Twitter has shown its commitment to crypto assets since his takeover last October with new crypto-friendly innovations and more promises for the future.</p>



<p>The social media giant has added 30 more digital assets to its $Cashtags feature which enables users to view the prices and other data of assets by the search icon. The newly listed tokens will join market leaders Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), whose price indexes were incorporated last year.</p>



<p>Twitter added 30 of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap, including (XRP), Binance USD (BUSD), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), etc. The Dogecoin community has been the most thrilled since the addition of DOGE to the feature, as it was surprisingly left out last year.</p>



<p>Despite the addition of 30 assets, there are still several snubs as Polkadot (DOT), Tron (TRX), and USD Coin (USDC) failed to make the cut, although following the initial announcement, the policy will continue to expand, covering more assets.</p>



<p>First rolled out on Dec 21, Twitter Business <a href="https://zycrypto.com/twitter-shows-support-for-bitcoin-and-ether-adds-price-indexes-to-search/">announced</a> the $Cashtags feature, making price indexes, data, and graphs available to Twitter users when they search or tweet the names of top financial assets with the dollar sign or the known symbol of the assets. The feature kicked off with the two digital assets, BTC and ETH, with partnerships with Robinhood and TradingView to provide real-time price indexes. </p>



<h2 id="h-doge-snubbed-for-twitter-coin"><strong>DOGE snubbed for Twitter Coin</strong></h2>



<p>After taking over the social media giant, Elon Musk shared big plans for the company, which included support for digital assets by integrating crypto payments with the platform. Although support has been shown for digital assets, their integration as a payment method has taken a step backwards with the Twitter Coin rumours.</p>



<p>The Twitter Coin feature will allow users to award other tweeps using Coins, but recent revelations show that the Twitter Coin will not be a cryptocurrency and will be bought through Stripe. Though not a digital asset, the use of Stripe keeps the hope alive as the company <a href="https://zycrypto.com/stripe-now-supports-cryptocurrencies-once-again-after-changing-its-mind-in-the-past-welcome-the-institutions/">supports</a> payouts in cryptocurrencies and has previously conducted tests on possible digital asset payments on Twitter.</p>

<li>It is part of a bigger digital currency adoption plan since El Salvador made BTC a legal tender.</li>
</ul>



<p>In 2021, the Republic of El Salvador announced that it would raise $1 billion through bitcoin bonds, also referred to as the Volcano Bonds, because of the use of renewable energy, including that generated from the country’s active volcanoes, to fund bitcoin mining.</p>



<p>The seemingly distant dream could soon be a reality after the Salvadorian Legislative Assembly passed a law governing the issuance of digital assets besides BTC. Although it was planned for March last year, the legislative agenda was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/el-salvador-postpones-issuance-of-bitcoin-backed-bond-citing-current-market-conditions/">postponed</a> severally due to the bear market.</p>



<p>Dubbed the ‘‘Digital Asset Issuance’’ securities law, the bill provides a legal framework involving the issuance of digital assets and classifies other non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies – including tokenized securities, alternative coins, and their virtual assets service providers (VASP).</p>



<h2 id="h-el-salvador-to-create-a-bitcoin-fund-management-agency"><strong>El Salvador to Create a Bitcoin Fund Management Agency</strong></h2>



<p>The 33-page legislation – which now awaits presidential assent – includes the establishment of a Bitcoin Fund Management Agency overseeing the public offering of digital assets in El Salvador. Within the framework, the Volcano Bond also referred to as Volcano token, is aimed to assist El Salvador in raising capital to repay sovereign debt, fund Bitcoin mining infrastructure, and create a Bitcoin City.</p>



<p>According to President Nayib Bukele, Bitcoin City would be a special economic zone located in the southern coastal city of El Salvador, with benefits to investors &#8211; like tax advantages and business incentives.</p>



<p>Sixty-two legislators supported the bill against sixteen who voted against it in the country’s Legislative Assembly, largely dominated by Bukele’s political party, Nuevas Ideas. The digital asset bill was introduced in November 2022. Per the announcement, crypto exchange Bitfinex would be the technology provider for the bond.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the bitcoin-loving country – also using the flagship crypto as legal tender since 2021 – recently commissioned the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) to manage the country’s Bitcoin projects and the international collaboration for policy development with other countries. BTC was changing hands for $21,157 at presstime, representing a price change of +21% in the past week.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is back above $20,000, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-looks-to-retake-20000-as-ether-xrp-cardano-traders-bank-on-a-massive-bull-run/">days after breaking</a> a two-month-long ranging-market spell and printing a string of green daily candles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past 24 hours, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization grew over 11%, tapping $21,000 in the wee hours of Jan 14 before recoiling to $20,817 at press time. In the past seven days, the asset’s price has surged by over 23%, with $76.61B added to its market cap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-4-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77185" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-4-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-4-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-4-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-4-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-4-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ether (ETH) followed closely, adding over 9% in the past day to trade just over $1,536 at press time. Ether has been rallying on the back of the upcoming “<a href="https://zycrypto.com/gargantuan-feat-staked-ether-withdrawals-are-coming-in-march-2023-core-developers-concur/">Shanghai hard fork</a>.” Apart from improving a range of functionalities on the Ethereum network, the upgrade, which is slated for March, is expected to help validators “unstake” and withdraw Ether which they had locked up in the beacon chain since 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other crypto’s also benefitted from the market-wide rally, with SOL, MATIC, DOGE, ADA, BNB and XRP adding roughly 71%, 21.92%, 18.58%, 20.76%, 13.36% and 13.46%. In the past 24 hours, the total value of liquidations reached $731.63 million, with 135,136 short positions being wiped out, according to data by Coinglass.</p>



<p>The current market rally comes on the back of improved economic indicators that have encouraged investors back into the market. CPI data released Thursday by the US Labor Department showed inflation cooled off slightly In December, once again re-igniting hopes of the Federal Reserve slowing the pace of interest rate hikes.</p>



<p><em>“Another month in which inflation falls, now lower than November 2021. Month-to-month even showing negative numbers. Fuel for a relief period of 2-4 months for the markets, but probably short-term correction soon for Bitcoin,” </em>said Michaël van de Poppe, a seasoned analyst and CEO&nbsp; of Trading Platform Eightglobal.</p>



<p>The resurgence has also been a pointer that investors are moving past the FUD&nbsp;created by the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire and other bad actors.</p>



<p>“<em>Bitcoin has now reclaimed $20,000 for the first time since before the FTX collapse. Symbolically shows that no one can stop this movement, not SBF or any other individual,”</em> crypto analyst Will Clemente tweeted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fundamentally, this week’s supernova rally has been attributed to large crypto investors buying BTC as market sentiment turned positive for the top cryptocurrency, particularly in the US.</p>



<p>“<em>Amongst many of the foreshadowing metrics for this 2023 breakout was the rapidly growing amount of addresses holding 100 to 1,000 $BTC. Price pumps generally occur marketwide when whales accumulate Bitcoin,”</em> on-chain data vendor Santiment tweeted.</p>



<p>Earlier yesterday, Ki Young Ju, Co-founder &amp; CEO of crypto analytics platform Cryptoquant, also wrote that an unknown entity bought $4B worth of BTC futures in market orders for three consecutive hours.</p>

<ul>
<li>The price of Solana has jumped by 60% over the past seven days, setting a new record as the highest gainer in the top 20 assets.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Cardano was also up over 21% on Sunday, trading at $0.34, a price it last hit in November 2022.</li>



<li>The newly released BONK coin and Cardano’s increased DeFi activities are reasons behind the surge of both assets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Community dubbed “Eth killers”, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) have kicked off 2023 with uphill movements showing signs of great months ahead. </p>



<p>Solana opened the year with an 11% increase and has gone uphill since then surging over 60% in 7 days. SOL now trades at $23.71 and is up over 22% in the last 24 hours. The growth of SOL this week means that it is the biggest gainer among the top 20 coins this year. </p>



<p>Bulls remain excited as SOL continues its rebound following last year&#8217;s turmoil in the wake of the FTX implosion. SOL <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-why-solanas-future-is-still-bright-despite-sol-price-nuking-97-below-ath-vitalik-buterin/">plunged</a> over 40% late last year due to FTX investments and top web3 projects migrating to new platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A key factor in the resurgence of SOL comes following the rollout of BONK coin, a Shib-themed asset created to rival Shib. So far, the coin has performed above others in the market, surging over 3000%.</p>



<p>Cardano has also been in the green zone this year as it also recovers from the bearish form of late 2022. ADA has seen gains of over 21% since the start of the year, with its price rising to $0.35, a price it last hit in November. So far, ADA has been up by 10% in the past 24 hours and 27% in the past seven days.</p>



<h2 id="h-ada-s-resurgence"><strong>ADA’s resurgence </strong></h2>



<p>As ADA taps a two-month high, digital asset enthusiasts see it as a sign of great things to come in line with its developers’ <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-developers-roll-out-new-ultra-bullish-innovations-ahead-of-2023/">plans</a> for the year. The spike in ADA can be linked to increased decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on the network.</p>



<p>DeFi activities on Cardano have increased by 40% in terms of total assets locked on the network since the start of the year. According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) on Cardano has hit 90 million rising to levels of Nov 2022. Although the figure is smaller when compared to Ethereum or BNB chain, it is a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the top five projects on Cardano have recorded double-figure gains, with TVL on Minswap DEX rising to 27% in the last seven days.</p>

<p>Cathie Wood, CEO of US-based investment management firm Ark Invest sees public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum coming out ahead after the ongoing market crisis subsides.</p>



<p>In a letter dubbed “What The Market Overlooked in 2022”, sent to clients on Jan 12, Wood highlighted the breakthrough technologies that are already transforming the world, praising blockchain and digital wallets.</p>



<p>The crypto sector has faced various headwinds since Terra collapsed in mid-2021. More than six leading crypto firms have folded since then, with some like Voyager and BlockFi filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy. The collapse of FTX two months ago dealt a further blow to the sector, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-blew-40-million-on-meals-private-jets-and-luxury-hotels-in-less-than-nine-months-before-its-collapse/">destroying billions of US dollars worth of user assets</a> and threatening the future of more crypto firms.</p>



<p>This, however, did not interfere with the substratum of blockchain technology which continues to operate as intended, according to Wood. </p>



<p><em>“Despite the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX, underlying public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have not skipped a beat in processing transactions, highlighting that their transparent, decentralized, and auditable ledgers could be a solution to the fraud and mismanagement associated with centralized, opaque institutions,”</em> she wrote.</p>



<p>The pundit also fronted Digital wallets as the next big thing, noting that they were replacing cash and credit cards. A recent report by California-based market research and consulting firm Grand View Research estimated the global crypto market wallet market to grow to about $48.27 billion in 2030 from 2022 estimates of about $8.42 billion. Crypto wallets help users keep their crypto assets safe and secure by storing their private keys. They also allow users to send, receive and spend cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin. Digital wallets overtook cash as the top transaction method for offline commerce in 2020 and accounted for ~50% of global online commerce volume in 2021.</p>



<h2 id="h-wood-buys-more-crypto-related-shares"><strong>Wood Buys More Crypto-Related Shares</strong></h2>



<p>Following the FTX collapse, the share of trading volume on decentralized exchanges, which allow investors to trade without a central intermediary spiked 37%. Centralized crypto exchanges such as Binance and Crypto.com also saw a drastic increase in outflows as investors took flight in fear of an FTX-like incident.</p>



<p>Wood <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-will-be-a-50-trillion-industry-by-2030-ark-invest-report/">continued to express hope in the crypto sector</a>, scooping more Coinbase shares. According to her, unlike other exchanges,  “<em>the fallout from Terra/Luna’s and FTX’s collapses propelled Coinbase’s share of fiat-based exchange volume (excluding Binance International) by 18 percentage points, from 22% in June to 40% in December.”</em></p>



<p>On Thursday, Ark Invest purchased 74,792 shares of Coinbase (COIN) for around $3.28 million, bringing its total holdings to 8.596 million shares valued at around $408.7 million based on Coinbase&#8217;s last closing price of $47.55 on Thursday. That stash now represents 2.92% of the firm’s entire portfolio allocation.</p>

<p>Following directives from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), Crypto.com has announced its plans to delist USDT from its platform for all users in Canada. The January 31st deadline was made public to Crypto.com users in Ontario, sparking wide FUD on the fate of the world’s largest stablecoin.</p>



<p>Crypto.com further added that the decision is in line with its operational license agreement in the North American country and part of a long-term commitment to fully comply with local laws in all its country of operation.</p>



<p>In many countries like Canada, where plans for CBDCs are in the works, stablecoins have continued to pose a threat with tighter scrutiny measures rolled out for their use within the territory. The OSC believes stablecoins strongly bear the features of a ‘security.’</p>



<p>Within the crypto community also, USDT has continued to come under intense fire, with many raising eyebrows about possible violations in its mode of operation. Last year the company received a $41 million US fine for falsely stating its asset as 1:1 backed. The CEO of Binance and proprietor of the third-biggest stablecoin has repeatedly taken a swipe at the market leader.</p>



<p>A fall for USDT, many believe, will be the extinction of crypto as we know it today.</p>



<p>The ‘fortune favours the brave’ exchange further allayed any fears of fund losses, assuring investors that all remaining balances will be converted to USDC, an alternative stablecoin by Circle. According to its report, staked assets and assets locked up in medium-to-long-term yields will not be affected.</p>



<p>USDC currently ranks second on the stablecoin table with a market capitalization of only $43 billion, shy of USDT’s $66 billion market cap.</p>



<p>Having faced several issues with its advertising and compliance strategies in the US, Crypto.com is towing the path of caution to avoid all possible regulatory complications in the neighbouring Canadian market. The Singapore-based exchange has continued to assure users of its healthy balance sheet and continuity of operations despite the fall of FTX.</p>



<p>Close to $10 million of its investments were sunk in the FTX drain, added to over 100 staff were laid off within the last six months, but the company’s CEO is confident of a continued healthy operation amidst one of crypto’s most brutal bear run – even if it means delisting USDT. </p>

<p>Brett Harrison, the former president of the crypto exchange FTX U.S. plans on spilling the beans on the exchange’s operations soon. The former executive disclosed his intentions early Monday when responding to a question on his knowledge of the firm by one of his followers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Why don’t more recent tech startups do what Amazon did and go public very early? Relatedly, how do companies reconcile the desire to stay private for long periods of time while rushing into token issuance?”</em> Harrison had asked in a general tweet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Almost instantly, the tweep known as James Christoph asked<em>, “What did you know about FTX Official US and when did you know it?”</em> prompting Harrison to respond- <em>“I’ll share in time.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harrison’s take comes just over two months after Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire came tumbling after its bad books were exposed. The former high-speed trading executive at Citadel Securities stepped down from FTX U.S. last September after serving in the position for less than two years. Notably, his exit coincided with the period when FTX sought<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-bags-voyager-digital-assets-after-highly-competitive-bidding-process/"> out distressed crypto assets</a> in the U.S. as it tried to expand its global market share during the so-called crypto winter.</p>



<p>In the lead-up to the pundit&#8217;s message today, the crypto community has been calling for a probe into all of FTX&#8217;s business partners, current and former employees, as, well as customers, even as the fallen crypto exchange battles bankruptcy proceedings.</p>



<p>Last week, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-05/us-closing-in-on-bankman-fried-s-inner-circle-with-singh-probe?leadSource=uverify%20wall">reported</a>, citing people familiar with the matter, that US prosecutors, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were probing Sam Bankman Fried’s inner circle. Among those mentioned was Nishad Singh, a former FTX engineer and close associate of Bankman-Fried for his alleged role in perpetuating multi-year fraud at FTX and trading firm Alameda Research.</p>



<p>According to reports, authorities may also be trailing a list of other associates who reportedly lived “lavishly” with Bankman-Fried in a Bahamas penthouse to charge them with a slew of criminal charges and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-feds-launch-ftx-task-force-to-trace-and-recover-stolen-investor-funds/">recover stolen assets</a>.</p>



<p>Last month, Caroline Ellison, who headed Alameda Research, the trading firm started by Bankman-Fried, pleaded guilty to fraud alongside FTX co-founder Gary Wang. The two lieutenants have reportedly been working with authorities.</p>



<p>Whereas Harrison did not immediately respond to our request for a comment, his observations are likely to shed more light on the inner workings of FTX, helping authorities tackle one of the most complex fraud trials in history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crypto-Market-Trades-In-Narrow-Range-–-Extreme-Volatility-Ahead.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Crypto Market Trades In Narrow Range – Extreme Volatility Ahead?" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crypto-Market-Trades-In-Narrow-Range-–-Extreme-Volatility-Ahead.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crypto-Market-Trades-In-Narrow-Range-–-Extreme-Volatility-Ahead-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crypto-Market-Trades-In-Narrow-Range-–-Extreme-Volatility-Ahead-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crypto-Market-Trades-In-Narrow-Range-–-Extreme-Volatility-Ahead-768x448.jpg 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crypto-Market-Trades-In-Narrow-Range-–-Extreme-Volatility-Ahead-610x356.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>The past year has no doubt been tumultuous for the crypto sector. Since tapping an all-time high, Bitcoin has lost over 70% of its value, 64% of which was depleted in 2022 alone. This has coincided with a severe drop in the top crypto’s realized market cap, which has declined by -18.8% since ATH, representing a net capital outflow of -$88.4B from the network.</p>



<p>Ethereum faced a similar fate, albeit it Realized Cap falling by an even larger relative scale of -29.2% since the ATH. Smaller cryptocurrencies were hit the hardest, with assets such as Solana, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin losing over 80% of their value.</p>



<p>The severe drop in crypto prices coincided with a battalion of events. Apart from harsh anti-inflation policies by the US Federal Reserve, the collapse of FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research deteriorated things further, forcing investors to take a safety flight.</p>



<h2 id="h-markets-are-still-in-slumber"><strong>Markets are Still in Slumber&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, despite cryptocurrencies being infamous for their volatility, the holiday break was exceptionally quiet, with Bitcoin’s realized volatility over the last month declining to multiyear lows of 24.6% “of which there are very few instances with similar levels.”</p>



<p>The market continued to experience quiet on-chain activity, with exchange-dominated inflows for BTC dropping below $500M/day, a far cry from the multi-billion-dollar levels seen throughout 2021-22. Ethereum’s light on-chain utilization also persisted into 2023, with the average gas price paid on the Ethereum chain remaining near cycle lows.</p>



<p>As per the report, the mean gas price since September has ranged between 16 and 23 Gwei; levels last seen during the June-July 2021 consolidation, and in May 2020, shortly after the pandemic market panic. Notably, the four leading sectors for Ethereum, MEV bots, Bridges, DeFi protocols, and ERC-20 tokens, now account for only 22.6% of network gas consumption, down from 45.5% between Sept-2020 and Sept-2021.</p>



<h2><strong>Calm Before the Storm&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Glassnode contends that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/what-to-expect-from-bitcoin-in-2023-the-bullish-and-the-bearish/">big price moves</a> are around the corner despite the crypto market gloom. The firm argues that it is rare for such conditions to stick around for long, pointing to the post-November 2018 and April 2019 explosive moves that preceded extremely low realized volatility.</p>



<p><em>“Such periods have historically preceded explosive market moves, with past examples both cutting asset valuations in half, and triggering new bull markets,” </em>wrote Glassnode.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In Nov 2018, BTC dropped -50% in 1 month, immediately after a long consolidation, while in April 2019, the top crypto rallied from $4.2k to a peak of $14k in July 2019. That said, whereas it is too early to infer price directions, pundits have pointed out that the market bottom is in for BTC, a clear reminder that it is time to be on the lookout for any major direction shifters. </p>

<p>Last year, many key figures in the cryptocurrency industry made it known that they were bullish on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin hitting new price levels.</p>



<p>As the year progressed, the market saw Bitcoin and other leading altcoins record a massive price drop. Many notably bearish events forced investors out of the cryptocurrency market as losses significantly skyrocketed.</p>



<p>However, the new year is showing to be more promising than the year before, and market players expect certain events to go into motion this year. Most of these events, if they happen, have the potential to ignite an ultra-bullish rerun.</p>



<p>One such event, which the crypto market has highly anticipated, is the possible addition of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoins-future-could-follow-this-bullish-trajectory-to-1-doge-price-thanks-to-elon-musk/">Dogecoin</a> to Twitter as a payment option for users on the platform.</p>



<p>Although Elon Musk is stepping down as the CEO of Twitter, he maintains that he remains in charge until he finds a fitting candidate to replace him.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the chances of Dogecoin, the meme coin that Musk had previously bought in the past, and also recently said was going “to the moon”, making it to Twitter, is very high. </p>



<p>If Musk remains CEO at Twitter this year and digital currencies are introduced to the platform, Dogecoin might be one of the few assets to debut on the platform. This will not only increase its adoption across the globe but also stir interest in crypto from traditional investors worldwide.</p>



<p>Another event poised to set the ball rolling for crypto in 2023 is the EIP-4844 rollout for Ethereum.</p>



<p>EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, is Ethereum’s attempt at reducing its sky-high gas fees while keeping Ethereum decentralized.</p>



<p>When asked by another crypto proponent what he is bullish on for 2023, Buterin says it is “Reaching the &#8220;basic rollup scaling&#8221; milestone in the roadmap diagram. That means: EIP-4844 rolled out, rollups partially taking off training wheels, at least to &#8220;stage 1&#8221;. </p>



<p>As many key players have explained, Ethereum could see massive adoption from investors and developers alike if it succeeds in solving its scaling issue.</p>



<p>If EIP-4884 debuts this year, Ethereum (ETH) could also benefit, as prices are bound to skyrocket with more adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another remarkable event that the market is on the look out for is the verdict of the ongoing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-win-in-xrp-lawsuit-against-sec-proves-pivotal-what-to-expect-from-the-market-this-year/">SEC vs Ripple lawsuit</a>. The SEC has received a lot of criticism for gathering multiple cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency firms.</p>



<p>As such, industry figures maintain that a win for Ripple is a win for the entire cryptocurrency community. Ripple has continued to sign numerous partnerships since the lawsuit was filed in December 2022. And as the market has speculated, XRP could hit roof levels as a result of the win.</p>



<p>Judge Torres, a U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres, is envisioned to make a summary judgment on or before the 31st of March 2023 </p>

<p>Shiba Inu’s choking token supply is about to get a massive cut once the much-awaited <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-whale-activity-surges-on-hype-around-the-upcoming-shibarium-launch/">Shibarium network</a> launches, a Saturday update by&nbsp; Shibarium’s official Twitter handle “Shibarium Network” has revealed.</p>



<p>According to the post, each transaction on Shibarium will burn SHIB.</p>



<p>“<em>While on our last post, we wanted to remind everyone that BONE serves as the required gas token for operability within Shibarium; we also would now like to formally announce that each Shibarium transaction will burn SHIB,”</em> read the announcement.</p>



<p>Burning refers to sending tokens to a dead wallet address to reduce the circulating supply. Since its launch in 2020, Shiba Inu, the world’s second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has always posed a problem for the community due to the massive number of tokens in supply.</p>



<p>Whereas close to half of SHIB supply has already been destroyed, its adherents continue pushing for more burning tactics to reduce the remaining 589.6 trillion tokens. Theoretically, token burning is anchored on the fundamental economic principle that when supply exceeds demand for a good or service, prices fall and vice versa.</p>



<p>The announcement comes after the team hinted at Shibarium layer-2 protocol “launching soon”. In a thread of tweets on January 5, the developers thanked the Shiba community for “bringing such energy and excitement” surrounding the upcoming Shibarium Beta Network, which they noted would be a phased introduction.</p>



<p>The SHIB community was also forewarned against falling for rumours that other tokens apart from BONE would be required to utilize Shibarium.</p>



<p><em>“</em><em>This is to confirm and validate, from us, the official source, that BONE is and remains the only token selected for gas fees and use. No other tokens will be necessary to operate within the protocol.”</em></p>



<p>According to the developers, Shibarium had been developed for Shiba Inu and not for the sake of other projects who claim ownership or speculation surrounding its operability dependency on any other tokens.</p>



<p>Furthermore, they noted that the layer 2 protocol belongs to the community adding that it would create a strong foundation for innovation and growth for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Although the developers have yet to issue a soft date for the protocol’s launch, rumours suggest it could happen within the first quarter of 2023.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu community has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-primed-for-strong-recovery-as-ecosystem-mulls-introducing-stablecoin-before-year-end/">buzzing with excitement</a> at the prospects of the launch providing a boon for the ecosystem’s tokens. In the past week, SHIB and BONE have grown by 23.68% and 29%, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<ul>
<li>The sidechain toolkit is aimed at scaling Cardano.</li>



<li>It is a milestone in Cardano’s Basho era – focusing on growth and adoption.</li>
</ul>



<p>Input Output Global (IOG), the developer of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-30-recovery-in-a-week-has-ada-whales-back-in-accumulation-mode/">Cardano</a>, is working on a toolkit for building customized sidechains &#8211; aimed to achieve scalability while maintaining the blockchain&#8217;s security. The toolkit also allows the building of DApps on top of the blockchain, leveraging the benefits of its infrastructure.</p>



<p>Described as a means to create a family of sidechains, the toolkit enables interoperability within Cardano. As a proof of concept, IOG has created an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible sidechain to be released as a public testnet before the end of the month.</p>



<p>Once the testnet goes live, according to the blog, developers could try out the platform by running Solidity apps. On the same note, IOG informs developers that for the EVM sidechain, data should be finalized on the main network before deployment on the sidechain.</p>



<p>According to the announcement, the toolkit&#8217;s components include the main chain, Plutus scripts, which allow for cross-chain transactions and asset transfers, and a chain follower for tracking main-chain data and events on the sidechain. It also comprises the sidechain module, which decrypts the mainnet data and executes the required ledger adaptations.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-sidechain-lets-users-maintain-their-consensus-on-top-of-the-main-chain"><strong>The Sidechain Lets Users Maintain Their Consensus on Top of the Main Chain</strong></h2>



<p>Besides, the new development enables the sidechain to operate its consensus and deploy its features, all connected to the main chain through a bridge that allows for the inter-chain transfer of tokens.</p>



<p>IOG has outlined some of the functions that can be completed with the sidechain and comprise the support for multiple consensus algorithms, ledger policies, and languages. Others are the secure launch of sidechains, small chains and experimentation, incubation, and research.</p>



<p>The company has also noted the benefits for the DApps developers using the toolkit: interoperability, testability, scalability, and compatibility. Interoperability &#8211; where a sidechain can maintain its consensus while benefiting from the infrastructure of the main chain, besides the transfer of assets.</p>



<p>The new toolkit is also scalable in that transactions are quicker and relieves the main chain from congestion. It is also ideal for testability, as with testing DApps on specific sidechains, where any adjustment can be made to the sidechains without touching the main chain. The sidechain toolkit is part of the Basho era of the Cardano – which focuses on scalability and throughput.</p>

<p>South Korean electronics giant, Samsung, will launch a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), opening up the possibility for exposure to Bitcoin in one of Asia’s biggest markets. The company&#8217;s asset management arm is looking to track the spot price of Bitcoin as it floats an ETF investment opportunity rooted in both Bitcoin and micro-bitcoin futures of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).</p>



<p>ETFs are aggregated funds allocated to a broad range of investment portfolio components and tradeable on exchanges. They function and fluctuate much like mutual funds but have the advantage of near-liquidity because of the possibility of sale on an exchange.</p>



<p>Though not exchangeable with an actual Bitcoin, this ETF—the second to happen in less than a month—will go a long way in signalling growing acceptance for digital assets in the region. Over $73 million was raised before the debut day of the first ETF, which took place in mid-December.</p>



<p>Hong Kong stands as Asia’s lone fertile ground for crypto-based ETF trading following China’s brutal clampdown on cryptocurrencies to pave the way for a native CBDC. The region, which promised to distinguish itself from China and ease the path for crypto investors, now joins Canada, Australia, the United States and Europe as countries and regions with a successful ETF launch.</p>



<p>Already swelling with speculation, Bitcoin notched up the ultra-formidable $18,000 support in the early hours of Thursday, leaving the crypto community a little positive effect on the prospects of new retail investors into crypto. Samsung has already disclosed its plans to remain at the forefront of crypto innovation.</p>



<p>The company, which ranked top amongst crypto’s top 40 institutional investors, currently has over 13 crypto companies under its investment belt and has so far, contributed significantly to the $6 billion poured into crypto in the past two years. In August last year, the company officially tendered its application for a virtual asset license in South Korea, gathering more grit to the rumours of a proposed digital exchange.</p>



<p>Its latest flagship Galaxy phone, the S22 series, is already pre-installed with hardware support for Bitcoin and a select other cryptocurrencies on its native Samsung wallet. With a $53 million LATAM- focused metaverse investment and a creator-driven partnership with Polygon’s Web3-based TV streaming feature, Savage App, Samsung believes strongly that the future lies in the advancement of technology and the creation of a market for younger generations who use them.</p>
