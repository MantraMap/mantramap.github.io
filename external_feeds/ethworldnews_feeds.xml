<ul><li>Liquidators of Three Arrows Capital have demanded key documents from the firm’s founders.</li><li>The subpoena was delivered over Twitter through the liquidator’s official Twitter handle.&nbsp;</li><li>The liquidators have alleged that both Su Zhu and Kyle Davies have not been cooperating.&nbsp;</li><li>The founders have been vocal on Twitter about their firm’s relationship with FTX and the Digital Currency Group.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a strange turn of events, the liquidators of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) have resorted to a rather unconventional avenue to subpoena the founders of the defunct crypto hedge fund. Teneo, the advisory firm appointed by a British Virgin Islands court to oversee 3AC’s liquidation, has delivered a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/3ACLiq/status/1611018579532742657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1611018579532742657%7Ctwgr%5E3f560200887619e2dcef4b5125db73d777405e83%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fthree-arrows-capital-founders-subpoenaed-on-twitter" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subpoena</a>&nbsp;to Kyle Davies and Su Zhu over Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Liquidators demand information from Three Arrows Capital founders</strong></h2>



<p>The Twitter handle named 3ACLiquidation, which is the official account for the court-appointed joint liquidators of the defunct crypto hedge fund, tweeted the subpoena earlier today. The subpoena requires 3AC founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu to turn over sensitive documents related to the downfall of Three Arrows Capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/three-arrows-capital-liquidators-demand-documents-via-twitter-1.1866228" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Teneo is diligently advancing the liquidation process for 3AC. “The founders have unfortunately resisted cooperating in these efforts, and as such, we have received authority from courts in both the US and Singapore to serve them targeted and comprehensive discovery demands through email and their frequently-used Twitter accounts”, a spokesperson for Teneo stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The liquidators are seeking key information related to Three Arrows Capital’s liquidation process, including account information, private keys for the crypto hedge fund’s digital and fiat assets, details pertaining to securities and unregistered shares, seed phrases, and information on accounts held on centralized as well as decentralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both founders have been active on Twitter over the past few months. The bulk of their content focuses on blaming other firms for the downfall of The Arrows Capital. Earlier this week,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1610093549651136512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1610093549651136512%7Ctwgr%5E8203793179c240afb6d7e930ae3c520f7b5b04da%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbeincrypto.com%2F3ac-co-founder-su-zhu-alleges-dcg-ftx-conspired-attack-luna-steth%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Su Zhu</a>&nbsp;took to social media to blame the Digital Currency Group for conspiring with bankrupt crypto exchange FTX to launch an attack against LUNA and stETH. In November 2022,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kyleldavies/status/1591704190900109312" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kyle Davies</a>&nbsp;alleged that Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried’s quantitative trading firm, had “hunted” 3AC’s positions before Terra’s collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teneo has been trying to deliver subpoenas to Three Arrows Capital’s founders since as early as October 2022. The firm had&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/three-arrows-capital-founders-to-subpoenas-on-twitter-bloomberg/" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a>&nbsp;a U.S. judge for permission to serve both the founders with subpoenas through their Twitter accounts as well as their email addresses. The liquidators resorted to this measure following futile attempts to serve said subpoenas through conventional methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Attorney General Letitia James accused former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky of leading investors &#8220;down a path of financial ruin&#8221;.</li><li>James&#8217; lawsuit seeks to ban Mashinsky from doing business in New York and secure restitution for aggrieved customers.</li><li>Mashinsky stepped down as CEO in September 2022 amid over $1.2 billion in bankruptcy claims from creditors. </li></ul>



<p>Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky is being sued for fraud by New York Attorney General Letitia James. According to Attorney General James’ lawsuit filed on Thursday, Mashinsky “promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin”.</p>



<p>The Crypto lender declared bankruptcy in July 2022 shortly after TerraUSD (UST) and Terra Luna (LUNA) imploded, plummeting digital asset prices and wiping out over $40 billion from the crypto market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mashinsky later <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-network-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-network-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped</a> down as CEO of the company amid reports of massive withdrawals from Celsius custodial wallets by Mashinsky himself and other top-ranking executives. </p>



<p>Attorney General James argued that Mashinsky continued to bait investors into depositing billions in crypto assets despite the company losing millions of dollars in risky investment strategies. Per Thursday’s <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-sues-former-ceo-celsius-cryptocurrency-platform-defrauding" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-sues-former-ceo-celsius-cryptocurrency-platform-defrauding" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filing</a>, James said Mashinsky failed to register as a securities and commodities dealer. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The law is clear that making false and unsubstantiated promises and misleading investors is illegal. Today, we are taking action on behalf of thousands of New Yorkers who were defrauded by Mr. Mashinsky to recoup their losses. My office will stay vigilant and ensure that bad actors trying to take advantage of New York investors are held accountable.</p><cite>&#8211; Attorney General Letitia James</cite></blockquote>

</figure>



<p>The lawsuit against Mashinsky seeks to ban the Celsius founder from conducting business in New York. Attorney General James’s lawsuit is also after damages, disgorgement, and restitution.</p>



<h2>$4.2 Billion In Earn Accounts Belongs To Celsius, Not Investors</h2>



<p>Judge Martin Glenn ruled that $4.2 billion in crypto assets deposited to Celsius yielding bearing accounts belongs to the bankrupt crypto lender. The ruling means that some 600,000 account holders in Celsius’ earn program must wait until bankruptcy proceedings play out which could take months or years.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Court concludes, based on Celsius’s unambiguous Terms of Use, and subject to any reserved defenses, that when the cryptocurrency assets (including stablecoins, discussed in detail below) were deposited in Earn Accounts, the cryptocurrency assets became Celsius’s property; and the cryptocurrency assets remaining in the Earn Accounts on the Petition Date became property of the Debtors’ bankruptcy estates (the “Estates”).</p></blockquote>



<p>The beleaguered crypto lender is expected to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-extend-bankruptcy-reorganization/">submit</a> a restructuring plan to the bankruptcy court by February 15, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.S. prosecutors investigating FTX’s collapse and Sam Bankman-Fried received inside knowledge of how customer funds were deployed to Alameda Research, Reuters reported on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The once mammoth crypto exchange crashed in late 2022 after reports exposed financial malpractice across Bankman-Fried’s $32 billion crypto empire. SBF resigned in November shortly after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams from the Southern District of New York (SDNY) indicted SBF on eight counts including fraud. Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas before law enforcement extradited the disgraced crypto tycoon to Manhattan, New York.

<p>Daniel Friedberg, who worked for Bankman-Fried and FTX,  told authorities of his willingness to cooperate after speaking with two FBI agents on November 14, per Thursday’s report. The former FTX lawyer then reached consensus with the bankrupt crypto exchange regarding information to be shared with investigators without violating attorney-client privileges. </p>



<p>On November 22, Freidberg met with prosecutors from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the SDNY, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

<ul><li>Coinbase has agreed to pay $50 million to the New York State Department of Financial Services.</li><li>The fine stems from a potential violation of AML laws by Coinbase due to improper background checks.&nbsp;</li><li>The settlement will require the crypto exchange to invest another $50 million to improve its compliance program.&nbsp;</li><li>The company’s share price has gone up more than 13% since the news of the settlement came out.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase has reached a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/Coinbase-and-NYDFS-reach-agreement-to-resolve-compliance-investigation" rel="nofollow noopener">settlement</a> with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) over charges related to improper background checks during the opening of new accounts. The American <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-calls-out-apple-blocking-nft-ios/">crypto exchange</a> will pay a $50 million fine to the New York regulator to settle the charges.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase will invest $50 million to improve compliance</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202301041" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the NYDFS, Coinbase’s compliance program had significant failures which led to the violation of NY Banking Law and the NYDFS’s transaction monitoring and cybersecurity regulations among other things. These violations exposed the crypto platform to serious criminal conduct including fraud, possible money laundering, and potential narcotics trafficking.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“It is critical that all financial institutions safeguard their systems from bad actors, and the Department’s expectations with respect to consumer protection, cybersecurity, and anti-money laundering programs are just as stringent for cryptocurrency companies as they are for traditional financial services institutions,”</p><cite>NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p>As part of the settlement, Coinbase will be required to pour in an additional $50 million in its compliance program over the next two years. This investment will go towards ensuring that the platform’s compliance procedures are in line with the NYDFS’s standards, in addition to addressing the present concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, acknowledged the settlement on <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1610646785369772039" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today. “We’re proud of our commitment to compliance, but we are also willing to acknowledge where we have fallen short” Grewal tweeted.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re grateful for today’s resolution – we’ve never shied away from working with regulators on making the industry a safer, more compliant space, and we share NYDFS’s commitment to protecting customers.</p>&mdash; paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1610646816273334275?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 4, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The settlement has sent Coinbase’s share price soaring. At the time of writing, the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/coin" rel="nofollow noopener">stock</a> was trading at $38.18, up more than 13% since market open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>

<p>Solana’s ecosystem enjoyed a boom in trading volume after the meme coin Bonk Inu launched on December 25, 2022. The viral Solana meme coin pumped as high as 2000% in the last week, up over 80% at press time per CoinMarketCap data. </p>

<h2>What is Bonk Inu?</h2>



<p>According to the project’s one-pager, BONK was <a href="https://www.bonkcoin.com/one-pager" rel="nofollow noopener">issued</a> as the first Dog-centered meme token on Solana’s blockchain. The protocol claims to be “for the people, by the people” and aimed at building “a fun meme coin where everyone gets a fair shot”. Also, the team supposedly grew tired of “toxic Alameda tokenomics”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alamadea Research and FTX were significant contributors to Solana’s ecosystem before SBF’s empire crumbled in November 2022.</p>



<p>Upon launch, 50% of the coin’s 100 trillion total supply was airdropped to Solana users. The allocated airdrop supply was distributed among Solana NFT collections, early OpenBook traders, Solana developers, and artists in the SOL’s ecosystem. The project also added a burn mechanism to stem inflation and manage token supply.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="748" height="611" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BONK-Tokenomics.png" alt="Crypto Traders Go BONK-ers For Viral Solana Memecoin, Token Up 80% Today 9" class="wp-image-580332" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BONK-Tokenomics.png 748w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BONK-Tokenomics-300x245.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BONK-Tokenomics-269x220.png 269w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BONK-Tokenomics-746x609.png 746w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" title="Crypto Traders Go BONK-ers For Viral Solana Memecoin, Token Up 80% Today 12"><figcaption>Image &#8211; BONK</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Orca Liquidity Providers Go BONK-ers</h2>



<p>Apart from massive returns for holders, the team announced rewards for liquidity providers on Solana-native crypto exchange Orca. Orca users can earn over 1000% in yield APIs on SOL, USDC, and USDH pairs with BONK.</p>



<p>The token is also available for trading on platforms like ByBit, Huobi, Gate IO, and Raydium to name a few.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="348" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-1024x348.png" alt="Crypto Traders Go BONK-ers For Viral Solana Memecoin, Token Up 80% Today 10" class="wp-image-580334" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-1024x348.png 1024w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-300x102.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-770x261.png 770w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-1536x522.png 1536w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-269x91.png 269w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-746x253.png 746w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-1376x467.png 1376w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield.png 1605w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Crypto Traders Go BONK-ers For Viral Solana Memecoin, Token Up 80% Today 13"><figcaption>Image &#8211; Orca </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Meme Coin Mania</h2>



<p>Bonk Inu joined the fray alongside other popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu amid lethargic cryptocurrency prices. The new token spots a Shiba Inu dog as well, much like its meme coin rivals DOGE and SHIB.</p>



<p>At press time, Solana’s first meme coin boasted trading volumes of over $100 million in the last 24 hours. In terms of market cap, BONK is still a far cry away from <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wrapped-dogecoin-coming-soon-bitgo/">DOGE</a> and SHIB with market caps of over $9 billion and $4.5 million respectively.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Lawyers representing the Bitcoin miner said the company was losing north of $53,000 daily due to a hosting agreement with Celsius.</li><li>The company will shutter hosting services for 37,000 Bitcoin mining rigs owned by the defunct crypto lender.</li><li>Both companies filed for bankruptcy following a harsh year for crypto asset prices in 2022. </li></ul>



<p>Bitcoin mining company Core Scientific will shut down Celsius mining machines following an agreement between the two crippled crypto entities. The deal was disclosed during a bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday, per reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celsius hired Core Scientific to provide hosting services for the crypto lenders&#8217; BTC mining business. The crypto mining company also received $54 million in funding from Celsius in 2021 as part of a $200 million fundraising effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Core <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-owes-5-4-million-core-scientific/">mounted</a> legal pressure on Celsius in October 2022 claiming that the crypto lender owed around $5.4 million in hosting fees. Core Scientific lawyers told the court that powering Celsius mining machines cost the company $53,000 in losses on a daily basis. The company also told U.S. Judge David R. Jones that the hosting capacity provided to Celsius could generate roughly $2 million in revenue per month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Tuesday, both entities agreed to unplug 37,000 mining machines owned by bankruptcy crypto lender Celsius. It’s unclear if the deal includes a payment of $5.4 million in hosting fees claimed by the troubled cryptocurrency mining company last year.</p>



<h2>Core Scientific Bankrupt, Riot Blockchain Rebrands</h2>



<p>A myriad of crypto companies collapsed amid sunken crypto prices and massive corporate failures among industry stakeholders. Core Scientific, previously a Bitcoin mining giant, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2022 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosemariemiller/2022/10/27/core-scientific-unable-to-pay-bills-warns-of-bankruptcy/" rel="noopener">citing</a> market conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another crypto miner, Riot Blockchain, rebranded as Riot Platforms in a bid to diversify as rising power costs in the U.S. threatens mining businesses. </p>



<p>Argo Blockchain also announced plans to sell its Helios mining facility in Texas to Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital for $65 million. Argo also secured an additional $35 million loan to help stave off bankruptcy in the bear market. </p>

<p>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin core developer who claims to be the longest contributor to the flagship cryptocurrency, fell victim to a hack earlier this week that led to a loss of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Lost basically all of his Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Dashjr&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1609613748364509184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">claimed</a>&nbsp;that he had lost &#8220;basically all&#8221; of his Bitcoin (BTC) holdings in a hack that occurred on New Year&#8217;s Day. In a Twitter thread, Dashjr revealed that he had traced some of the stolen funds to a wallet address that received almost 217 BTC. At the time of writing, the&nbsp;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1YAR6opJCfDjBNdn5bV8b5Mcu84tv92fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stolen BTC</a>&nbsp;was worth $3.6 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bitcoin dev stated that the hack was the result of a compromised PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key, and added that the IP address of the attacker was traced to a ColoCrossing server. He was unable to explain how his cold wallets were breached but noted that he had last accessed them in September.</p>



<p>Users on Twitter responded by speculating that the hack may be connected to a security breach that Dashjr tweeted about in November. In the wake of the attack, Dashjr called out ColoCrossing for allegedly &#8220;dropping the ball on abuse investigation last time&#8221; and vowed to change server providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also warned people not to use Bitcoin Knots, a Bitcoin wallet signed with his now-compromised PGP key. Dashjr reached out to the FBI for help but has not yet received a response.</p>



<p>Binance CEO <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/changpeng-zhao-takes-a-dig-kraken-kucoin/">Changpeng Zhao</a> was among those who responded to Dashjr’s plight. CZ&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1609663902610034691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reassured</a>&nbsp;him that he had asked his security team to monitor the situation. The Binance chief further offered to freeze the stolen funds, should they find their way to Binance.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Sorry to see you lose so much. Informed our security team to monitor… We deal with these often, and have Law Enforcement (LE) relationships worldwide,&#8221; &nbsp;</p><cite>CZ told Dashjr</cite></blockquote>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Lawyers representing Bankman-Fried in the criminal trial asked Judge Lewis Kaplan to redact the names of two sureties who co-signed Sam&#8217;s bail bond.</li><li>SBF was released in December 2022 after posting bail for $250 million, per reports.</li><li>U.S. Federal prosecutors charged the FTX founder with eight counts from fraud to money laundering. </li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers filed a motion to redact the name of two co-signers for SBF’s massive $250 million bail. Bankman-Fried posted bail in December after appearing before a Manhattan court.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sam’s Request</h2>



<p>Bankman-Fried’s court representatives submitted a letter motion in a bid to keep two of Sam’s bail co-signers a secret. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers requested a “limited modification to one portion of the bail conditions”, said the letter sent to U.S. Judge Lewis Kaplan and the criminal court.</p>



<p>In December 2022, authorities released the disgraced FTX Founder after Bankman-Fried posted bail for $250 million. The court included house arrest, location monitoring, and an international travel ban as part of SBF’s bail conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried’s lawyers asked the court to redact the two remaining names of the bail bond co-signers. SBF’s legal counsel also requested that the U.S. government keep the names of the individuals private as well.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Specifically, we request an order from the Court directing that the names and other identifying information of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s two remaining bail sureties (1) be redacted on the bond they will sign, and (2) not be publicly disclosed by the Government.</p></blockquote>



<p>The letter <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1610265485706240001?s=20&amp;t=bunj9iJUBGfJ25wvfnaDew" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> that the U.S. government “takes no position on the request”, suggesting that the decision is entirely up to Judge Kaplan and the court.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Extradited To America</h2>



<p>Former crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried was extradited to the United States in December after waiving his right to contest extradition in a Bahamian court. Following the court order, SBF as he’s known was flown to Manhattan, New York.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried faces multiple criminal charges from fraud to campaign finance violations. The CFTC, Department of Justice, and the SEC all filed charges against SBF over FTX’s collapse in November 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX Co-Founder Gary Wang signed plea deals, admitting to stealing customer funds, and supposedly flipping on Sam Bankman-Fried. The FBI also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened</a> investigations on a $400 million hack <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/11/21/ftx-hacker-moved-nearly-200-million-of-ether-to-different-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered</a> by FTX shortly after Chapter 11 bankruptcy was filed. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Securities Commission of The Bahamas addressed “material misstatements”  made by FTX CEO John Ray III after the crypto exchange collapsed in November.</li><li>The Commission accused Ray of making unfounded claims based on incomplete information.</li><li>Friction between both parties crossed into a new year amid ongoing bankruptcy proceedings and investigations into FTX&#8217;s billion-dollar crash.</li></ul>



<p>Tensions between the FTX’s bankruptcy administration and the Securities Commission of The Bahamas escalated on Tuesday as the watchdog fired back over claims made by CEO John Ray III</p>



<p>On January 3, the SCB published an announcement in a bid to dispel misinformation that emerged from the new FTX boss. Ray was hired to lead the fallen crypto exchange through bankruptcy shortly after Sam Bankman-Fried unwillingly filed for Chapter 11 protection.</p>



<p>According to the court documents, Ray’s team claimed that the Bahamas watchdog instructed Bankman-Fried’s exchange to mint roughly $300 million in fresh FTT tokens, the native token of the crippled platform. The SCB <a href="https://twitter.com/SCBgov_bs/status/1610084773472485380?s=20&amp;t=NZwY4oxkIRTTZhyLjhSx2w" rel="nofollow noopener">countered</a> this claim, calling the allegations “unfounded” and based on incomplete reporting.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The US Debtors’ continued lack of diligence when making public statements concerning the Commission is disappointing, and reflects a cavalier attitude towards the truth and towards The Bahamas that has been displayed by the current officers of the Chapter 11 Debtors from the date of their appointment by Sam Bankman-Fried.</p></blockquote>



<p>Back in later 2022, the SCB also addressed claims that Bahamas authorities gave FTX permission to open local withdrawals.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Securities Commission of The Bahamas Corrects Material Misstatements made by Chapter 11 Debtors <a href="https://t.co/FkSXEt9fz5" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/FkSXEt9fz5</a></p>&mdash; Securities Commission of The Bahamas (@SCBgov_bs) <a href="https://twitter.com/SCBgov_bs/status/1610084773472485380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>FTX Embroiled In Tussle With Bahamas Authorities</h2>



<p>Indeed, friction between the two entities sparked in November after FTX accused Bahamas regulators of stealing cryptocurrencies from the crypto exchange. The SCB countered that Ray publicly disclosed the claims without liaising with Bahamas regulators or responding to communication attempts.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Mr. Ray has not once reached out to the Commission to discuss any of his concerns before airing them publicly, The Commission has still not received a response to its 7 December 2022 letter to Mr. Ray offering cooperation with Chapter 11 Debtors.</p></blockquote>



<p>The SCB reportedly <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/3-5-billion-ftx-customer-crypto-bahamas/">secured</a> around $3.5 billion in FTX customer crypto after a hacker stole roughly $400 million in digital assets from the platform. Ray’s team asked the court for control over the digital assets as bankruptcy proceedings seek to settle creditors and debtors alike. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Bahamian Securities Commission took control of the assets on November 12 due to concerns that FTX was vulnerable to cyberattacks.</li><li>Hackers stole nearly $400 million in digital assets hours after Founder Sam Bankman-Fried filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 11.</li><li>Notably, the tokens secured from FTX Digital Markets Ltd were worth $3.5 billion in November.</li></ul>



<p>Digital currencies belonging to FTX customers are held by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, said a press statement published by the regulator on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission secured customer assets from FTX Digital Markets Ltd on November 12 following an exploit on the sunken crypto exchange a day before. An unknown hacker attacked the platform and stole nearly $400 million in crypto tokens. The FBI <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/">announced</a> investigations into the hack, per reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and Co-Founder Gary Wang were also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/12/14/ftx-founder-and-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas/" rel="noopener">charged</a> with fraud and money laundering by the Department of Justice, CFTC, and SEC.</p>



<p>Notably, the $3.5 billion held by the Bahamian regulator was valued using November 12 market prices. Crypto Twitter participants also speculated that a piece of the holding could be in FTT and Serum (SRM) tokens. The Commission has not responded to questions about the specific tokens held.</p>



<p>Thursday’s announcement also addressed claims that the Bahamas regulator told Bankman-Fried’s to open local withdrawals, denying such a request.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FTX Customer Assets Await Court Order</h2>



<p>The Bahamian Securities Commission said the assets will remain under custody until a Supreme Court issues an order. Per the official statement, the SCB will hold the assets in “digital wallets controlled by the Commission, for safekeeping”. The current market value of the tokens held by the watchdog is unclear at press time. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The digital assets transferred on 12 November 2022 to digital wallets under the exclusive control the Commission are being held by the Commission on a temporary basis, until such time as The Bahamas Supreme Court directs the Commission to deliver them to the customers and creditors who own them, or to the JPLs to be administered under rules governing the insolvency estate for the benefit of the customers and creditors of FTXDM</p></blockquote>



<p>Customers in Turkey and Japan could be the first to access their cryptocurrencies from the bankruptcy exchange. Per reports, Liquid announced a plan to return customer assets by mid-February 2023. Disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried bought Liquid crypto exchange after the Japanese crypto exchange was hacked for $100 million.&nbsp;</p>
