<p>Lucid announced revenue of $150.9 million in Q2 2023 driven by customer deliveries of 1,404 electric vehicles.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/lucid-q2-2023-lcid-shares/">Lucid Misses Wall Street Expectations on Q2 2023 Financial Results, LCID Shares Up 3% After Hours</a></p>
<p>Luxury electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ: LCID) shares closed on August 7, 2023, trading at $6.41, down 3.17 percent from the day’s opening value. However, Monday’s losses were almost obliterated during after-hours with a 3.12 percent gain. The tweak in Lucid shares on Monday was attributed to the announcement of the Q2 2023 financial results that largely missed Wall Street expectations. Notably, the electric vehicle company reported a revenue of $150.9 million versus the $175 million expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Additionally, Lucid announced a loss per share of about 40 cents whereas analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected a loss per share of 33 cents.</p>
<h2>Lucid and Its Q2 2023 Financial Statement</h2>
<p>According to the announcement, the company noted that it is on track for annual production guidance of more than 10k vehicles. During the second quarter, the company announced that it delivered 1,404 electric vehicles to customers. As a result, the company announced a $6.25 billion in total liquidity as of June 30, 2023, on its balance sheet.</p>
<p>However, Lucid failed to meet Wall Street expectations on vehicle deliveries by about 600 units during the second quarter. Worth noting that the company delivered 1,406 vehicles during the first quarter of 2023, and 679 vehicles in the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>In a statement through the announcement, Peter Rawlinson, Lucid&#8217;s CEO, and CTO, highlighted that the future is bright for the luxury electric vehicle industry, especially after signing a long-term strategic partnership with Aston Martin.</p>
<p>“We look forward to exciting new products in the second half of this year, including the planned start of production of the Lucid Air Sapphire and the Lucid Air Pure Rear Wheel Drive, plus the highly anticipated unveiling of our new SUV, Lucid Gravity, forthcoming in November,” Rawlinson <a href="https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lucid-announces-second-quarter-2023-financial-results-track" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>During the second quarter, Lucid announced that it raised $3.0 billion in capital, including $1.8 billion from the PIF. As a result, the company’s strong balance sheet is expected to bolster its production of more vehicles including Lucid Gravity.</p>
<p>“In addition, the targeted actions underway to invigorate our marketing programs in the luxury and premium segment have resulted in greater brand awareness, which we aim to capitalize on through the launch of our latest pricing program,” Sherry House, Lucid&#8217;s CFO, said.</p>
<p>In a bid to compete with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) in sales and production, Lucid announced price cuts of about $12,400 in the Air model. Additionally, the electric vehicle company reduced the price of the base-model Air Pure by $5,000, to $82,400. As for the company’s higher-end trims, Touring and Grand Touring, a price cut of $12,400 to $95,000 and $125,600, respectively was applied.</p>

<p>Palantir Technologies announced a 13 percent increase in Q2 2023 revenue to $533 million and also reported its third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/palantir-q2-2023-pltr-shares/">Palantir Meets Analysts&#8217; Expectations in Q2 2023 Results, PLTR Shares Up 2.67%</a></p>
<p>American big data analytics holding company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/palantir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palantir Technologies Inc</a> (NYSE: PLTR) shares closed Monday trading at $17.99, down 1.15 percent from the day’s opening price. However, the PLTR shares gained approximately 2.67 percent during the after-hours to trade at about $18.47. The sudden gain in Palantir Technologies stock was attributed to the Q2 2023 earnings results that narrowly met analysts’ expectations. Notably, the company announced adjusted earnings per share of about 5 cents versus 5 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Additionally, Palantir Technologies announced revenue of $533 million versus the $533 million expected by analysts according to a survey conducted by Refinitiv.</p>
<p>Amid the Artificial Intelligence (AI) hype, Palantir CEO Alex Karp told shareholders through a letter that it released the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which allows large language models to operate within the confines of the enterprise and on privately held data. Reportedly, the AIP has users across more than one hundred organizations, including some of the largest enterprises in the world from the healthcare, finance, automotive, and energy sectors.</p>
<p>“The demand for AIP is unlike anything we have seen in the past twenty years. We are currently in discussions with more than three hundred additional enterprises to deploy AIP within their organizations, all of which are searching for an effective and secure means of adapting the latest large language models for use on their internal systems and proprietary data,” Karp <a href="https://www.palantir.com/newsroom/letters/letter-to-shareholders/august-7-2023/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> in the letter.</p>
<h2>Palantir Technologies in Q2 2023</h2>
<p>During the second quarter that ended on June 30, 2023, Palantir Technologies reported a net income of about $28 million, which represented 1 cent per share, compared to a net loss of approximately $179 million or about 9 cents per share during the same quarter a year ago. Having reported almost a year of profitability, the company anticipates being included in the S&amp;P 500, more so after it reports its third-quarter earnings in November.</p>
<p>Moreover, the company anticipates reporting revenue of between $553 million and $557 million during the third quarter, ahead of the $552 million expected by analysts. Notably, the company announced that it expects the third quarter’s adjusted income from operations to come in between $135 million and $139 million.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Palantir Technologies expects to report full-year revenue of over $2.212 billion, whereas analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected $2.209 billion. Additionally, the company lifted its forecast for adjusted income from operations for the full year to more than $576 million, compared with a range of $506 million to $556 million in May.</p>
<p>During the first half of the year, the company announced a revenue of about $1.1 billion, thus managed to conduct a share buyback program of up to $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/kenyan-raid-worldcoin-nairobi/">Kenyan Authorities Raid Worldcoin Warehouse in Nairobi Following Last Week’s Suspension</a></p>
<p>Authorities in Kenya’s capital of Nairobi have conducted a raid of the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/worldcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldcoin</a> warehouse on Saturday. Kenyan police seized several documents and devices belonging to the crypto and blockchain company.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://kahawatungu.com/police-raid-worldcoin-cryptocurrency-warehouse-in-nairobi-over-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local report</a>, the police officers conducted the raid of Worldcoin’s offices along with multi-agency officials holding a search warrant. The report adds that the authorities left with several machines allegedly containing data the firm has collected so far. The seized data was delivered to Kenya’s Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters for analysis.</p>
<p>The report added that the raid was initiated by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC), Immaculate Kassait. According to Kassait, Worldcoin’s parent company, Tools for Humanity, was not honest about its true intentions when it registered the company.</p>
<p>Interestingly, CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/07/worldcoins-nairobi-warehouse-raided-by-kenyan-police-local-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that an ODPC representative said they had no knowledge of the raid.</p>
<p>The Kenyan government already <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/kenya-suspends-worldcoin/">suspended</a> Worldcoin’s activities in the country. Last week, the Ministry of Interior officially halted the company’s operations following concerns surrounding data privacy. Authorities in several other countries, including Germany, the UK, and France, have all started investigations into Worldcoin.</p>
<h2>Worldcoin Raid Happened Despite the Company’s Legality</h2>
<p>Worldcoin is a blockchain company launched by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI. The company pays free cryptocurrency to anyone willing to undergo its iris scans for verification. Following its launch, several thousand Kenyans have visited registration centers to partake in the scans and receive the crypto, worth about $49. Nonetheless, authorities have raised concerns about accessing and storing biometric data and also paying participants for the data collected. Authorities are also worried about all that data controlled by a private organization. Worldcoin’s aim is to create a platform for “proof of personhood” via iris biometrics.</p>
<p>After the suspension, Worldcoin said it would work with the government to control crowds at its center before resumption. It also assured that the data used was to build a global “identity and financial network” for public use and provide access despite individual backgrounds. According to the company’s website,“Worldcoin aims to establish universal access to the global economy regardless of country or background. It is designed to become the world’s largest human identity and financial network, giving ownership to everyone. All with the intention of welcoming every person on the planet and establishing a place for all of us to benefit in the age of AI.”</p>
<p>Last year, a German privacy watchdog launched an investigation into Worldcoin. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision began to investigate Worldcoin due to concerns about the retention and processing of sensitive biometric data on a large scale.</p>
<p>According to the German regulator, collecting and processing sensitive data on a large scale has more than a few risks. The regulator, among other things, is worried about a lack of consent from the owner of data, for the application of said data.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/paypal-paypal-usd-stablecoin/">PayPal Launches Its Native Stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD)</a></p>
<p>The payment giant is stepping into the crypto market with the introduction of its native stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD). The crypto which was <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/paypal-confirms-develop-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced in January</a> has finally been launched.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/stablecoins-how-manage-operate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stablecoins</a> are a type of cryptocurrency designed for relatively stable value. They&#8217;re typically pegged to a reserve asset, which could be a fiat currency, commodity, or another financial instrument. Like other stablecoins, PYUSD aims to ensure price stability and is pegged 1:1 to the United States dollar, making it redeemable for USD.</p>
<p>In a release, Dan Schulman, President and CEO of PayPal, <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-08-07-PayPal-Launches-U-S-Dollar-Stablecoin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the US dollar&#8230; Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, along with our track record of delivering new customer experiences, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Paxos Trust Company issues the stablecoin and fully adheres to regulatory oversight of the New York State Department of Financial Services. Among the regulations, customers are protected in cases of insolvency, as their funds cannot be used to settle debt. Paxos&#8217; potential bankruptcy would have a minimal impact on clients&#8217; funds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a> assures its users that PYUSD is fully backed by USD, with reserve funds supporting the stablecoin, addressing concerns about issuing unbacked tokens. Additionally, Paxos will publish a monthly reserve report starting in September 2023, to ensure transparency about the stablecoin&#8217;s reserve assets&#8217; value.</p>
<p>&#8220;Starting September 2023, Paxos will publish a public monthly Reserve Report for PayPal USD, outlining the reserve composition. Paxos will also provide a public third-party attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets. The attestation will be issued by an independent third-party accounting firm, following attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA),&#8221; the company wrote in its press release.</p>
<p>The launched stablecoin will become more accessible to United States users in the coming weeks. They will be able to transfer the stablecoin between PayPal users and compatible external wallets, send payments to others using the token, make purchases by selecting the option at checkout, and convert PayPal-supported crypto to and from PYUSD.</p>
<h2>PayPal&#8217;s Stellar Reputation and Vast User Base Could Accelerate PYUSD Adoption</h2>
<p>PayPal&#8217;s introduction of stablecoin aims to expand the options for stablecoin payments in the crypto industry. The company included crypto payment options for its clients in 2020, becoming one of the first payment processors to do so. Launching its stablecoin also appears to be a strategic move for the payment giant to maintain being a go-to option for payments.</p>
<p>With over 350 million users, PayPal has a large user base, and leveraging its reputation could potentially drive increased adoption of its stablecoin. Despite the regulatory challenges that many cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, are currently facing, the payment processor is confident that the regulatory environment surrounding stablecoins is gradually becoming clearer and that there is a need for additional stablecoin options within the crypto market.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/berkshire-hathaway-shares-q2-report/">Berkshire Hathaway Shares Up 2% after Impressive Q2 2023 Report</a></p>
<p>Monday brought good tidings for investors of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/berkshire-hathaway/">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</a> (NYSE: BRK) as the company’s shares surged following the release of its robust quarterly report for Q2 2023.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/berkshire-hathaway-rises-as-investors-cheer-strong-earnings-and-buffetts-near-record-cash-stockpile.html">report</a> from CNBC revealed that the Class B shares of the American multinational conglomerate, led by legendary investor Warren Buffett soared by 2.4% at the time of writing, edging to an all-time high closing.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the conglomerate recorded a remarkable 6.6% Year-over-Year (YoY) surge in operating earnings, amounting to a substantial $10.04 billion for the last quarter. This performance places Berkshire Hathaway on a trajectory of sustained success, solidifying its reputation as a heavyweight in the investment landscape.</p>
<h2>Factors Driving the Conglomerate’s Impressive Quarterly Report</h2>
<p>A standout feature of Berkshire Hathaway’s exceptional quarterly report is the astonishing 74% surge in insurance underwriting earnings. This segment earned a sizable $1.25 billion, owing to strategy alignment and strong market conditions. Higher interest rates and lower catastrophe losses aided these gains significantly.</p>
<p>While the insurance segment celebrated phenomenal gains, the railroad sector encountered a challenge due to reduced volumes. This softness was aptly offset by the impressive performance in the insurance division. Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s ability to balance the strengths of its various sectors demonstrates the company&#8217;s resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Amid these remarkable developments, Berkshire Hathaway’s cash reserves have also garnered attention. The conglomerate&#8217;s massive cash pile swelled to $147.38 billion by the end of June, nearing a record high and significantly surpassing the $130.62 billion mark in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, elevated interest rates have proven to be beneficial for Berkshire Hathaway, enabling it to earn substantial returns from its cash holdings. Notably, the conglomerate had more than $97 billion in short-term Treasury bills.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett’s weekly purchases of $10 billion in 3-month or 6-month Treasury bills have strengthened the conglomerate’s position, demonstrating his planned approach to maximizing returns on investments.</p>
<h2>Berkshire Hathway Records Impressive Gains</h2>
<p>Furthermore, Berkshire Hathaway has reported an astounding $26 billion unrealized gain from its investments. A significant portion of this gain can be attributed to the conglomerate&#8217;s massive stake in the tech giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/">Apple Inc</a> (NASDAQ: AAPL), which fueled a resounding market rally in the second quarter, propelling the stock to climb nearly 18%.</p>
<p>This successful Apple venture has transformed into a monumental bet worth a staggering $177.6 billion, further solidifying Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s position as a titan in the investment world. Berkshire Hathaway’s success story continued with its Class A shares reaching an unprecedented record close of $541,000, surpassing its previous high of $539,180 set on March 22, 2022.</p>
<p>With a steadfast commitment to delivering long-term value and maintaining an attractive position in uncertain times, Berkshire Hathaway stands as a testament to the enduring influence of strategic investment and sound financial principles.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/softbank-profit-vision-fund/">SoftBank Group May See Profit after Vision Fund Lost $48B</a></p>
<p>Analysts expect that the Vision Fund investment arm of SoftBank Group turned a profit and might announce as much in its upcoming report.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/softbank-profit-vision-fund/">SoftBank Group May See Profit after Vision Fund Lost $48B</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/softbank-profit-vision-fund/">SoftBank Group May See Profit after Vision Fund Lost $48B</a></p>
<p>SoftBank Group’s Vision Fund may finally turn a profit after multiple losses due to the current boom surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). After five quarters where the Japanese giant recorded losses, Vision Fund’s involvement in several startups working on AI tools may bring a profit.</p>
<p>According to analysts’ estimates, SoftBank Group would likely announce a profit of ¥73 billion in its expected report on Tuesday. Although they also expect a profit specifically for the fund for the quarter ended June, the figure may be moderate. Over the last two fiscal years, SoftBank’s Vision Fund lost ¥6.9 trillion &#8211; about $48 billion.</p>
<p>For the June quarter, Astris Advisory analyst Kirk Boodry <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-06/softbank-may-turn-profit-after-48-billion-in-vision-fund-losses?srnd=technology-vp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">estimates</a> that Vision Fund’s public holdings rose by $1.1 billion. According to Boodry, the largest influences on the increase are Grab Holdings Ltd. and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/doordash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DoorDash Inc</a> (NYSE: DASH), both of which rose 14% and 20%, respectively. SoftBank shares also contributed to the estimated rise, jumping 31%, while e-commerce company Coupang Inc. rose 9%. Boodry says public holdings climbed $3.9 billion in July alone. He believes that the Vision Fund will conclude its strongest performance since the January-March quarter of 2021 if its performance continues at the current pace.</p>
<p>In May, SoftBank’s Vision Fund <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/softbank-vision-fund-32b-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a ¥4.3 trillion ($32 billion) record loss for the fiscal year ended March 31st. The deficit was more than 68% worse than the loss reported for the same period in the previous year. Although SoftBank recorded gains from a few companies, including Uber (NYSE: UBER), it was unable to withstand losses from others. For instance, SoftBank said it lost $1.6 billion each in GoTo and SenseTime Group. DoorDash also cost the company $800 million.</p>
<h2>SoftBank and Vision Fund May See More Profit from Arm IPO</h2>
<p>In March, SoftBank <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/softbank-arm-us-only-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to pursue a US-Only IPO for its semiconductor technology firm, Arm. Although the initial plan was a listing in the UK, Arm CEO Rene Haas confirmed the US listing in a statement. According to Haas, the US option is the best way forward for the company and its stakeholders, despite continuous engagement with the British Government and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which lasted a few months.</p>
<p>Arm was listed in London until its $32 billion acquisition by SoftBank in 2016. At the time, the British government was criticized for losing its largest tech export.</p>
<p>Arm has announced an<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/softbank-semiconductor-arm-70b-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> IPO valuation target</a> of between $60 billion and $70 billion. The IPO is expected in September and could be the largest for 2023. Arm is a chip manufacturer for some of the world’s largest semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD. Already, some of these companies have expressed interest in participating as anchor investors in the IPO.</p>
<p>SoftBank might see its fortunes improve following the IPO. Arm currently hopes to raise between $8 billion and $10 billion. The IPO could be the largest-ever tech offering since <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms</a> in 2012 and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alibaba-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alibaba Group</a> in 2014.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/iraq-suspends-telegram-app/">Iraq Suspends Telegram Messaging App Due to National Security Concerns</a></p>
<p>The government of Iraq announced the suspension of the Telegram messaging application across the entire country, citing significant national security concerns.</p>
<h2>Telegram App in Iraq</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/telegram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telegram</a> enjoyed widespread popularity in Iraq, as it served as a communication tool for numerous individuals and organizations, including armed factions and pro-Iran political parties. The app amassed millions of users in the country who relied on it for interactions, and the ban will inevitably impact the ease with which they connect and exchange data.</p>
<p>The Iraqi Ministry of Communication argues that Telegram&#8217;s usage compromises the personal data of its citizens, prompting the suspension as a measure to safeguard their information. Notably, the app is not limited to messaging; it serves as a news source as well. Consequently, certain channels possess extensive personal data of Iraqis.</p>
<p>The government of Iraq acknowledged its prior attempt to communicate with Telegram before the ban, to address concerns about data leakage from the platform and how that can affect Iraq users.  A possible leakage was identified as a significant threat to both national security and peace. Regrettably, the messaging platform did not respond to these concerns.</p>
<p>In a release&#8217; by Reuters, the Ministry of Communication <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/iraq-blocks-telegram-app-cites-personal-data-violations-2023-08-06/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=Technology-Roundup&amp;utm_term=080623" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;{Platforms that leak the data of the official state institutions and the personal data of citizens&#8230; but the company did not respond and did not interact with any of these requests.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ministry also emphasized its respect for the fundamental human rights of its citizens, in this case, the right to freedom of expression and communication, but stated that it cannot be at the expense of national security. Telegram has access to information like names, phone numbers, and locations, among other sensitive information that could be misused if it falls into the wrong hands, posing privacy risks for Iraqis.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: center;">It was also revealed that &#8220;the Ministry of Communications affirms its respect for citizens&#8217; rights to freedom of expression and communication, without prejudice to the security of the state and its institutions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The messaging app service was blocked on Sunday, August 6, making messages undeliverable to the intended targets. Those who want to continue to use the app in the country would have to access it by employing a virtual private network (VPN). However, VPNs are not totally safe, and doing this can also result in some legal action from the government.</p>
<h2>Some Countries Have Also Suspended Telegram</h2>
<p>Telegram has encountered bans in other countries for varying reasons. Some bans were temporary, while others appear to be somewhat permanent. Pakistan was among the first nations to suspend the app, attributing the move to the platform&#8217;s alleged links to terrorism.</p>
<p>Years ago, Iran temporarily blocked Telegram and other social media channels to counter potential unrest. In April, Brazilian authorities ordered the shutdown of the messaging app to investigate alleged neo-Nazi groups using the platform to incite attacks on schools. In addition to its shutdown, Telegram was also slapped with a fine of $200,000 per day for failing to comply with certain court decisions in the past.</p>

<p>Crypto scammers are trapping gullible investors by creating replica websites and social media accounts of real-life projects. Later they ask the users to connect their wallets, and siphon off the funds. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fbi-report-crypto-scammers-nft/">FBI Report: Crypto Scammers Hiding Beneath Mask of NFT Developers</a></p>
<p>The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has recently raised caution about cybercriminals pretending to be real NFT developers and later stealing cryptocurrencies and other digital assets from gullible investors.</p>
<p>Besides, the FBI also exposes fraudulent schemes wherein criminals get direct access to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a> developer social media accounts. Later, they create look-alike accounts while promoting &#8220;exclusive&#8221; new NFT releases. These scammers are leveraging misleading advertising campaigns thereby creating a sense of urgency and FOMO among users.</p>
<p>In its advisory provided last week, the FBI noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Links provided in these announcements are phishing links directing victims to a spoofed website that appears to be a legitimate extension of a particular NFT project&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later, these duplicate or replica website urges users to connect their crypto wallets and purchase the NFTs. Soon as the users connect their wallets, the threat actors siphon the funds, digital assets, or NFTs to wallets that are under their control. &#8220;Contents stolen from victims&#8217; wallets are often processed through a series of cryptocurrency mixers and exchanges to obfuscate the path and final destination of the stolen NFTs,&#8221; the agency <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA230804" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, crypto users need to be extra vigilant while interacting with websites and their social media accounts. It could also help in mitigating the risks posed by such scams. An FBI spokesperson warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Unfortunately, criminals are getting more sophisticated, using the surge in NFT interest to target innocent enthusiasts. We urge the community to stay vigilant, report any suspicious activities to us immediately, and always remember the adage: if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Crypto Scamming Schemes on the Rise</h2>
<p>Nearly five months ago, the FBI issued a warning about a rise in fake cryptocurrency investment schemes known as pig butchering, which resulted in losses of $2 billion in 2022.</p>
<p>One such category is CryptoRom, where criminals create fake identities on dating apps and social media platforms to establish romantic relationships and gain victims&#8217; trust. Once they build up the trust, they introduce the idea of trading cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The scammers start initial conversations within the app where they initially connected with the victim. Then, they move the conversation to private messaging apps like Telegram or WhatsApp, where they persuade the victims to use fraudulent crypto websites or apps and make significant investments.</p>
<p>The FBI said that &#8220;criminals coach victims through the investment process, show them fake profits, and encourage victims to invest more. &#8220;When victims attempt to withdraw their money, they are told they need to pay a fee or taxes. Victims are unable to get their money back, even if they pay the imposed fees or taxes.&#8221;</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hua-hong-shares-public-debut/">Hua Hong Shares Up 13% Following Public Debut</a></p>
<p>The Chinese semiconductor landscape has witnessed a momentous event as shares of Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd (HKG: 1347) experienced an exhilarating 13% surge during its public market debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</p>
<h2>Strong Market Entry for Hua Hong Shares</h2>
<p>The excitement surrounding the shares of Hua Hong following its market debut was palpable, with shares <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/china-chipmaker-hua-hong-ipo-shares-jump-13percent-in-shanghai-debut.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly</a> launching on the market at 58.88 Chinese Yuan, an impressive 13.2% leap from its initial offer price of 52 Chinese yuan ($7.23).</p>
<p>This robust market entry underscores the optimism and confidence shared by investors and industry insiders alike in the company’s potential for growth and innovation. This spectacular rise, however, was short-lived, demonstrating the fickle nature of stock markets and the complexities of investor sentiment.</p>
<p>Hua Hong’s Shanghai-listed shares promptly surrendered gains and began trading at a diminished value of 53.99 Chinese Yuan by Monday afternoon. While the exact reasons behind the reversal are subject to speculation, factors such as profit-taking, market sentiment shifts, and broader economic conditions can all contribute to such swift changes in stock prices.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Hua Hong’s grand debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange was more than just a show. The company’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-initial-public-offering-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initial Public Offering</a> (IPO) has raised a staggering 21.2 billion Yuan ($2.95 billion), making it the largest IPO in mainland China for the year, as stated by EY’s global IPO <a href="https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_gl/topics/ipo/ey-global-ipo-trends-2023-q2-v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>.</p>
<p>Remarkably, Hua Hong has solidified its standing as China’s second-largest chip foundry, trailing only behind Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).</p>
<p>The company has carved out a niche for itself in the competitive semiconductor industry, specializing in the creation of semiconductors using advanced wafer process technologies. This expertise has garnered significant attention, setting the stage for its high-stakes market debut.</p>
<h2>Hua Hong’s IPO: A Strategic Move Amid Global Tensions</h2>
<p>In a dynamic global landscape marked by technological prowess and geopolitical tensions, Hua Hong’s triumphant market debut stands as a resounding testament to China’s unyielding commitment to attaining self-reliance in the chip and semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>China’s pursuit of chip self-sufficiency unfolds against a backdrop of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/smic-shares-slump-8-following-u-s-export-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escalating friction</a> with the United States, over access to advanced chip technology. Faced with Washington&#8217;s efforts to sever Beijing from crucial chip advancements, China has embarked on a path of self-reliance, leveraging its vast resources and formidable ambition to propel its domestic chip industry to new heights.</p>
<p>Hua Hong’s IPO emerges as a strategic maneuver within this larger narrative, a testament to the nation&#8217;s determination to establish an indigenous chip ecosystem. As the latest in a series of semiconductor firms to launch an IPO on the mainland, Hua Hong joins the ranks of trailblazers in China&#8217;s relentless drive for technological sovereignty.</p>
<p>Other noteworthy examples include Semiconductor Manufacturing Electronics (Shaoxing) Corporation and Nexchip Semiconductor, both of which made their debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange earlier this year.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/oil-saudi-drop-q2-2023/">World&#8217;s Largest Oil firm Saudi Aramco Reports 38% Drop in Q2 2023 Profits</a></p>
<p>Oil giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/saudi-aramco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saudi Aramco</a> reported its Q2 numbers with 112.81 billion riyal ($30.07 billion) in net profit, a decline of 38% from the same period last year amid the drop in hydrocarbon prices. Interestingly, the second-quarter profits stood at $29.8 billion, slightly above the analysts&#8217; expectations.</p>
<p>In its filing to the Saudi stock exchange Tadawul, Aramco said that the substantial drop in revenue came due to lower crude oil prices as well as the pressure on refining and chemicals margins. The company is following the trend of its competitors by increasing dividend payments, even though its profitability has declined significantly.</p>
<p>During the first quarter, Saudi Aramco declared a dividend of $19.5 billion to its shareholders. It plans a similar dividend payout during the second quarter. Saudi Aramco investors shall receive the dividend during the third quarter. Aramco also plans to distribute performance-linked dividends over six quarters, starting with a $9.9 billion distribution in the third quarter. During the company&#8217;s earnings call on Monday, August 7, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Despite the economic headwinds, we see signals that global demand remains resilient, supported by an ongoing recovery in the aviation sector. Our plan to maintain a sustainable and progressive dividend for our shareholders remains intact&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Saudi Aramco Financially Strong in Q2 2023</h2>
<p>In the second quarter (Q2) of this year, Saudi Aramco&#8217;s net income dropped by 38% compared to the same period last year. In the previous year&#8217;s second quarter, they had made a huge net income of $48.4 billion, which was a 90% increase from the previous year due to a surge in energy prices caused by Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>This decline in profitability is similar to what other companies in the industry are experiencing. For example, British oil giant BP reported a nearly 70% drop in second-quarter profit, and ExxonMobil, Shell, and TotalEnergies also reported significant decreases in earnings due to weaker oil prices affecting the sector.</p>
<p>Despite all the current headwinds, Saudi Aramco&#8217;s financial position remains strong. On Monday, August 7, Carole Nakhle of Crystol Energy <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/oil-giant-saudi-aramco-posts-sharp-drop-in-second-quarter-profit-as-lower-prices-bite.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> CNBC’s “Capital Connection”:</p>
<blockquote><p>This quarter’s result “is still a strong financial position. Yes, it’s not as astonishing as the results that we saw last year – but this is aligned with the overall industry trend&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>In June, Saudi Arabia said they would produce 1 million fewer barrels of oil each day, starting in July. They have now extended this production cut for both this month and the next one. However, the Saudi Press Agency also stated that they would extend the decline beyond September.</p>
<p>In addition to other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, the production cut amounts to a total decrease of 1.66 million barrels per day until the end of 2024. Nakhle added that “it has definitely put an award pressure on prices. Those announced cuts are helping OPEC+ in achieving its long-promoted mantra of achieving market stability&#8221;.</p>
<p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that oil prices are likely to increase during the third and fourth quarters this year. These analysts expect the Brent Crude price to touch $86 per barrel by December 2024, and $93 per barrel by next year, with OPEC+ tightening the supply and demand growing simultaneously.</p>
