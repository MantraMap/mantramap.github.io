			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Finishes 2022 Off 64%:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 1 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) capped a very bearish year with additional weakness early in the Asian session as the pair continued to trade below the psychologically-important 17000 figure after recently trading as low as the 16326.16 level.&nbsp; Late last year, BTC/USD has generally been orbiting the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460. &nbsp;Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 64% year-to-date, and is off more than 3% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16705.87 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16598.31.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Securities Commission of The Bahamas announced that it seized $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency assets from the now-bankrupt and collapsed crypto exchange FTX. </p>
<p>Per a media release issued on Thursday, the Bahamian authority said the total amount taken from FTX&rsquo;s Bahamian subsidiary, FTX Digital Markets, along with added funds has been moved into its own digital wallets &ldquo;for safekeeping.&rdquo; The Commission had previously said that it was holding some of the exchange&rsquo;s assets but failed to disclose the total sum thereof.</p>
<p>According to the regulator, the funds were valued at over $3.5 billion based on market pricing at the time of transfers and added that the transfer took place the day after FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 12. Reports by American news agency CNBC indicate that the Bahamian Securities Commission said that the funds are only being held on a &ldquo;temporary basis&rdquo; or until they receive instruction from the Bahamas&rsquo; Supreme Court to deliver the assets to customers and creditors, or in the case of the insolvency estate to the liquidators. The Commission said that it seized the assets after receiving information from former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, regarding cyberattacks on the systems of FTX&rsquo;s Bahamian arm.</p>
<p>According to the media release, there was a &ldquo;significant risk of imminent dissipation&rdquo; of the assets as long as they remained under the control of FTX Digital Markets.</p>
<p>Apparently, there was cause for concern as the day after FTX filed for bankruptcy, it became under attack from a suspected hack that over $400 million drained from the firm&rsquo;s crypto wallets. The events surrounding the suspected hack remain unclear and the matter is now being investigated by the United States Justice Department.</p>
FTX Debtors Seek the Return of Assets Held by Bahamian Regulators
<p>According to a press release, FTX Trading, and its affiliated debtors announced on Friday that it would seek the return of the crypto assets held by the Bahamas Securities Commission to their Chapter 11 estates for the benefit of creditors. The group added:</p>

<p>The FTX Debtors have informed the&nbsp;Bahamas&nbsp;Commission that none of Mr. Bankman-Fried, Mr. Wang or the&nbsp;Bahamas&nbsp;Commission had a right to take cryptocurrency of the FTX Debtors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Some eyebrows were raised when Microstrategy sold a part of its Bitcoin holdings, even though the company then bought more. A tax loophole was the reason.</p>
Sell at a loss then immediately repurchase
<p>Crypto investors can reduce their capital gains tax in 2022 by selling their crypto assets at a loss and immediately repurchasing them, thanks to a regulatory distinction that crypto assets have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategy was recently used by business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which bought 2,395 bitcoin on Wednesday, sold a portion at a loss, and bought 810 bitcoin just two days later.</p>
Crypto still an asset and not a security
<p>Unlike other securities, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not consider crypto to be a security, but rather an asset, which means that certain tax laws, such as the "wash rule," do not apply to it. This allows investors to sell crypto at a net loss and buy it back instantly while still being able to claim the loss on their tax filings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other investors who sell securities for a net loss at the end of the tax year can deduct up to $3,000 from their capital gains tax and carry any additional losses over to the next tax year.</p>
IRS could change its policy
<p>Crypto investors will continue to have this advantage as long as the IRS maintains its current policy of treating crypto as assets rather than securities. This allows investors to sell their crypto assets at a loss and immediately repurchase them, allowing them to claim the loss on their tax filings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the IRS has not made any official statements on this matter, and it is possible that they may change their policy in the future. It is worth noting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers many widely-traded cryptocurrencies to be securities, which has been a source of controversy in the crypto community.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>David Marcus, advocate of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, thinks there is more pain to come in 2023 as market tries to recover from bad actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>David Marcus is the CEO and co-founder of Lightspark, and ran Payments/Crypto and Messenger at Meta. He also led PayPal, and has built three startups. On Friday he published his thoughts for the future in a Medium article.</p>
Recession plus obsolete workforces
<p>The experienced executive is not bullish in the short to medium term on the economy nor on crypto. He thinks that a full-blown recession is approaching, probably caused by the Federal Reserve raising rates as they seek to tame inflation.</p>
<p>He believes that large tech companies are going to realise that they can cut their workforces drastically, and do more with few people. He thinks that AI will &ldquo;see the beginning of a Cambrian explosion&rdquo;, that will serve to automate many work areas, and also lead to human obsoletion across many industries.</p>
Crypto will recover
<p>As for crypto, he is of the opinion that the sector will need a couple of years to recover from the bad actors that have plagued it. He thinks that regulation will need time to be responsibly developed and implemented.</p>
<p>He sees a sea change in crypto and states:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In crypto, years of greed will make room for real-world applications. The years of creating a token out of thin air and making millions are over. The music has stopped. We&rsquo;re back to our regular programming of having to create real value and solving real world problems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the solving of these problems he expects to see:</p>

<p>&ldquo;key innovations in the areas of payments, asset securitization, DeFi, zero-knowledge applications including proof of reserves and layer 1 scaling solutions, and a renewed development energy and interest on the Bitcoin network.&rdquo;</p>

Sceptical on regulation
<p>Once more on regulation, Marcus is not very hopeful that the regulators will get it right. He believes that new regulation is necessary for digital assets and crypto, contrary to the belief of Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, who believes that crypto must be shoehorned into existing regulation. He says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sadly, I&rsquo;ve become increasingly skeptical of our ability to reach consensus on legislative or regulatory approaches that achieve the right balance in these areas. I think we will therefore see more of the same in 2023 with increased responsibility on leaders of industries to do what they believe is right in the vacuum left by our deadlocked legislative system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, he is of the firm belief that &ldquo;destruction comes with an opportunity to rebuild anew&rdquo;, and that despite an extremely challenging environment, digital assets and crypto will come out of this next period stronger and better.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto Assets Manager Valkyrie Investments has unveiled a proposal to become the sponsor and manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the world&rsquo;s largest Bitcoin fund and has been trading at a record discount compared to the price of BTC.&nbsp;</p>
The Valkyrie Proposal&nbsp;
<p>In a blog post published this week, Valkyrie Investments proposed becoming the sponsor and manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which will see the company manage its much larger rival. The Nashville-based asset manager, which manages around $180 million in assets, announced the launch of the Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund, which is looking to take advantage of the significant discount in the value of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plan is considered extremely ambitious, considering the fact that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust manages over $10 billion in assets, compared to Valkyrie&rsquo;s $180 million. The Valkyrie fund plans to increase its holdings of GBTC, enabling the company to realize the true value of the underlying Bitcoin for its investors. In a letter posted on its website, co-founder and CIO of Valkyrie Investments, Steven McClurg, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done. However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change. Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly.&rdquo;</p>

A Long Shot?
<p>In the proposal, Valkyrie highlighted several ways through which they aim to improve the current management of GBTC. The fund stated that it aims to facilitate redemptions at a net asset value (NAV) for investors through a Regulation M filing, allowing investors to redeem their shares at a fair price. The proposal also seeks to lower the fee to 75 basis points, compared to the current 200 basis points, and offer redemptions in BTC and cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a move to manage and sponsor the trust could be a long shot, considering Grayscale filings have stated that shareholders can play no part in the management or control of the trust. Additionally, they also have limited voting rights. It also states that no amendments to the trust agreement that could impact the interest of shareholders can be made without a vote of at least a majority (50%) of the shares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Valkyrie also noted that it has a proven track record of success, running its own Bitcoin Trust since January 2021. It added that it has launched a host of Bitcoin-related ETFs and was, along with VanEck and ProShares, one of the firms to launch the first Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
Trading Below Value&nbsp;
<p>Currently, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is trading around 50% below the value of the Bitcoin it holds. This is because of the structure of the GBTC, where while new shares can be created, they cannot be destroyed as demand for the trust&rsquo;s underlying Bitcoin faces a bit of a downturn, leading to a discount in the net asset value. On its part, Grayscale tried to convert the GBTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) which would allow for share redemptions.</p>
<p>However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denied the application to convert GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale was highly critical of the move by the SEC, calling it arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory, and filed a lawsuit against the agency.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bearishness at Year End:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 31 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) retained acutely bearish technical sentiment early in the Asian session as the pair spiked lower to the 16326.16 level after recent selling pressure that intensified around the 16654.81 level.&nbsp; The pair has generally been orbiting the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460. &nbsp;Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 64% year-to-date, and is off more than 3% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16731.07 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16.561.09.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">The crypto market is always active. With more people investing in cryptocurrencies, market volatility has also increased. The competition between the crypto coins and trading platforms is intense. But what does it mean for new tokens in the market? Let&rsquo;s find out how Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is racing ahead with 805% presale gains, while Polygon (MATIC) and Aptos (APT) are struggling to attract investors.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s11">Polygon (MATIC) is Gaining Attention, But it May Not be Enough</p>
<p class="s7">Polygon (MATIC) platform offers several attractive features like security and speed. However, Polygon (MATIC) tokens couldn&rsquo;t influence the crypto market. Things are changing with Polygon (MATIC) gaining visibility through Reddit and Donald Trump&rsquo;s NFT collection. Polygon&rsquo;s (MATIC) tokens have suddenly become popular.</p>
<p class="s7">The whale activity is evident as the price showed an increase last weekend. Yet, Polygon (MATIC) is down to $0.768, as of mid December. The current price of Polygon (MATIC) has improved a bit, though it is still at $0.79, at the time of writing. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that Polygon (MATIC) hasn&rsquo;t gotten anywhere close to $2 after January 2022. Despite the sudden interest and whale activity, Polygon (MATIC) cannot be a worthy choice for crypto investment.</p>
<p class="s11">Is Aptos (APT) Going to Lose the Price Marathon</p>
<p class="s7">Aptos (APT) is one of the latest blockchain platforms in the crypto market. Aptos (APT) touched its highest point on 23rd October 2022. The price of Aptos (APT) token hovered around the all time high for a brief period and then fell below the $8.5 mark on 28th October. Unfortunately, Aptos (APT) hasn&rsquo;t succeeded in attracting crypto lovers in large numbers.</p>
<p class="s7">The Aptos (APT) price graph had more lows than highs during the last two months. The Aptos (APT) token price fell to its lowest point at $3.67 on 10th November 2022. Aptos (APT) is at $3.76, at the time of writing. The Aptos (APT) platform is planning the Aptos World Tour Hackathon in 2023 and will travel to four cities in different countries. This might bring some traction for Aptos (APT), but experts say it may not be enough to create a long-term impact.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s11">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is the New Token Taking the Crypto Market by Storm</p>
<p class="s7">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a venture capital platform aiming to revolutionize crowdfunding through its unique NFTs as a service. Startups seeking to raise capital on the platform can mint equity-backed, fractionalized NFTs available for as little as $1. This allows startups to raise capital more efficiently, while everyday investors can buy into startups with comparatively low capital.</p>
<p class="s7">ORBN, the project&rsquo;s native token, has seen significant growth and attention during presale. ORBN grants holders various benefits like staking rewards, access to exclusive investor groups, and more.</p>
<p class="s7">ORBN has already risen from $0.004 to $0.0362 in presale, however analysts expect this to continue until ORBN has risen by a factor of 6000% in January.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange Binance will now allow users to buy cryptocurrencies on its platform using the payment services of Apple Pay and Google Pay.&nbsp;</p>
Binance Build Update
<p>In their latest Binance Build update, the crypto exchange announced that the platform had adopted the two payment services into its platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Binance team tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apple Pay and Google Pay payment options are now available on Binance! Purchase crypto, with ease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This means that customers can now pay for cryptocurrencies using either Apple Pay or Google Pay. The update has already been implemented, and early responses indicate that the new functionality is working properly.&nbsp;</p>
Increasing Crypto Accessibility&nbsp;
<p>This move would be helpful for drawing in more customers to Binance, especially owing to the 44 million strong userbases of Apple Pay and 25 million strong userbases of Google Pay. Both of these payment platforms are the most popular worldwide and occupy the first two rankings in the total number of users. The decision to incorporate these two payment services will open up Binance and cryptocurrencies in general to a massive potential customer base, thus increasing its accessibility. This update has the potential for the greatest customer acquisition into crypto for Binance and the rest of the crypto world. However, the fact remains that these two payment services are not functional in all countries around the globe. It remains to be seen how Binance plans to increase accessibility in these zones.&nbsp;</p>
Other Crypto Firms Adopting Apple Pay
<p>Binance is not the first crypto firm to adopt more mainstream payment services. Apple Pay itself has been adopted by other crypto platforms, like MetaMask. This crypto wallet, which is the preferred mode of interaction with the Ethereum blockchain (DeFi, Web3 dApps, NFTs), integrated Apple Pay into its platform in March 2022. Another crypto wallet, Klever, also added Apple Pay functionality back in April 2021 to provide users with an easier payment option.</p>
Binance In The News
<p>The crypto exchange has been in the news lately since word spread that Binance.US was planning on buying Voyager Digital assets. The crypto exchange put forth a bid of $1 billion and was successful in acquiring the Voyager assets just a few weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance had also paused USDC stablecoin withdrawals for several hours, leading to some market-wide FUD around mid-December. The reason given for the pause was insufficient USDC reserves, which warranted a BUSD to USDC swap, after which the service was resumed as normal.&nbsp;</p>

This crypto wallet, which is the preferred mode of interaction with the Ethereum blockchain (DeFi, Web3 dApps, NFTs), integrated Apple Pay into its platform in March 2022. Another crypto wallet, Klever, also added Apple Pay functionality back in April 2021 to provide users with an easier payment option.</p>
Binance In The News
<p>The crypto exchange has been in the news lately since word spread that Binance.US was planning on buying Voyager Digital assets. The crypto exchange put forth a bid of $1 billion and was successful in acquiring the Voyager assets just a few weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance had also paused USDC stablecoin withdrawals for several hours, leading to some market-wide FUD around mid-December. The reason given for the pause was insufficient USDC reserves, which warranted a BUSD to USDC swap, after which the service was resumed as normal.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Car manufacturing company BMW has integrated blockchain solutions through BNB Chain and Coinweb for its loyalty program.</p>
BMW x Coinweb Partnership&nbsp;
<p>The luxury car brand has partnered with blockchain company Coinweb to integrate blockchain technology into its organization. This integration will greatly benefit BMW&rsquo;s customers in Thailand through a cross-chain customer loyalty program and will be executed in two phases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinweb will also be introducing a cross-chain Smart Contract set-up and implementation for BMW. Additionally, the BNB Chain has been chosen as the anchor chain to broadcast transactions to multiple blockchains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO of BMW Leasing (Thailand) spoke on the partnership and the blockchain loyalty program, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are very excited to be working with such a great team at Coinweb, and anticipate all the positive outcomes of embracing DLT into our ecosystem. We foresee this shift of manual paperwork towards immutable records on the blockchain to immensely contribute to infallible efficiency and transparency. For our long-time customers here in Thailand, we look forward to continually cultivating their loyalty while rewarding them at the same time through the blockchain-based rewards system delivering real value to be rolled out in 2023."</p>

<p>BMW had previously joined forces with Ford and the non-profit alliance MOBI (Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative) to release the second part of the Vehicle Identity Standard (VID II)</p>
First Phase Plans
<p>In the first phase of the project, both parties will be testing if it is feasible to cross-chain parallel-execute Smart Contracts. The focus will be to automate time-consuming manual processes and streamline vehicle finance operations as offered by BMW. This assessment will have to incorporate checks like fully integrated Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes abiding by Thailand laws.&nbsp;</p>
Second Phase Plans
<p>In the second phase of the project, Coinweb will develop a customized SaaS Web3 application for a customer loyalty program for BMW customers to be able to earn rewards through the blockchain-based rewards program. Owners will collect and accumulate loyalty points through various activities and then be able to redeem them against certain products and services from the BMW ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinweb CEO Toby Gilbert has also spoken on the partnership,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is an honour to be piloting such an exciting project with BMW, Coinweb's first collaboration with such a prestigious household brand. We hope that once this project is fully launched, it can be used as a benchmark to prove that traditional businesses can fully leverage blockchain technology and benefit hugely from it, without deviating from their core values and mission."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Venezuelan banking watchdog, Sudeban, is working on a system to monitor crypto-related transactions in real-time in order to control any negative impact on the stability of the exchange market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This move is reportedly in response to the recent drop in the value of the bolivar, which some analysts have attributed to activity in the peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto market. To further protect the value of the bolivar, the government is reportedly seeking to monitor the movements of P2P exchanges that involve cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an article first published by Bitcoin.com, Sudeban, in conjunction with the national cryptocurrency regulator Sunacrip, is said to be developing a system with the goal of "fighting the irregular practices that attack our currency and the stability of the exchange market."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The organisation has not provided any additional details on the system, but it is believed that the government is examining the relationship between the volumes exchanged in the cryptocurrency market and the exchange rate between the bolivar and the US dollar.</p>
<p>Some analysts have suggested that the recent drop in activity in peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto markets, caused in part by the collapse of FTX, may be contributing to the rise in the bolivar-dollar exchange rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it is also believed that other factors, such as the influx of fiat currency into the market during the holiday season, may also be contributing to this trend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Venezuelan government has not explicitly stated that there is a direct relationship between crypto and the bolivar, it obviously has its suspicions for it to monitor crypto transactions so closely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In relation to the government's efforts to monitor these crypto-related transactions, Legalrocks, a national law firm focused on cryptocurrencies, has reported that more than 75 bank accounts have been blocked due to suspicious activity involving crypto transactions since the end of 2021.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Reserve Bank of India has released its Financial Stability Report, in which it says that crypto needs the same regulation applicable to traditional finance.</p>
No change on crypto from the RBI
<p>Noises coming out of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have not changed in tone at all as regards all things crypto. The latest salvo to be fired at crypto came in the form of the bank&rsquo;s Financial Stability Report.</p>
<p>It does seem rather odd, given the incoming recession, which was undoubtedly caused by central banks printing far too much currency. This in turn sent inflation spiralling up across the world, impacting on the ordinary citizen by reducing their purchasing power by another huge amount.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the leading bank in India to spend so much time and effort on maligning such a tiny and still fairly inconsequential asset as crypto might appear to be a case of bringing in a cannon to kill a fly.</p>
<p>However, the RBI is not alone in its endeavours. Central banks from across the world also seem eager to join in the crypto-bashing, given that crypto is in the midst of a particularly harsh bear market, and various centralised exchanges have collapsed, they are having quite a field day.</p>
<p>Despite the entire crypto market cap amounting to less than $800 billion, the RBI said in its Financial Stability Report:</p>

<p>"Although the crypto assets market remains volatile, there have not yet been any spillovers onto the stability of the formal financial system. The accumulated experience, however, suggests that they form an unstable ecosystem and there is growing evidence that they remain highly concentrated and interconnected,"&nbsp;</p>

3 options to deal with crypto
<p>The RBI stated in the report that in its view there were 3 options that might be applied to crypto. The first option, and the only one with any vestige of credibility, is to regulate crypto the same as any traditional finance company.</p>
<p>Crypto is a completely new asset class that has brought incredible innovation to finance. Should it be allowed to continue with fair and well thought out regulation that protects investors while encouraging more innovation, then there wouldn&rsquo;t be many who would argue with it.</p>
<p>Option number two is to completely ban it given (in the bank&rsquo;s view) that it has &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; real-life use cases. However, the bank does acknowledge that other countries might choose not to go along with this given their differing regulatory approaches and their laws on individual rights.</p>
<p>Option number three was to just allow crypto to collapse and to let it become &ldquo;systemically irrelevant&rdquo;. For all that, crypto undeniably has use cases and investors will be keeping an eye on it as fiat currencies slip further in value and begin to lose trust across wider populations.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it could be expected that central banks and regulatory agencies across the world might seek to combine their approach to crypto in an effort to crush it enough that their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can be implemented.</p>

Coti revealed the launch of the mainnet on the 29th of December, during which Explorer 2.0 and the Bridge 2.0 app were also deployed. The team behind a protocol released a statement stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This launch signifies a massive step for the crypto industry, as well as COTI, as the MultiDAG 2.0 will increase the growth of the widespread adoption of crypto payments for enterprises that are yet to adopt crypto payment solutions. The transition from a single currency infrastructure to a multi-token network is an exciting step for us, and we&rsquo;re glad to have your support on this important path.&rdquo;</p>

MultiDAG 2.0&nbsp;
<p>MultiDAG 2.0 leverages the COTI MultiDAG (CMD) standard, which facilitates the issuance of tokens on the COTI Trustchain. This is similar to the concept of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. However, in the case of the COTI Trustchain, the issuance takes place on a single DAG. The MultiDAG 2.0 release will help enhance Coti&rsquo;s position in helping enterprises launch their own Private Payment Network (PPN), which would also include the issuance of CMD-branded payment tokens, CMD-branded loyalty tokens, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The launch of the MultiDAG 2.0 protocol heralds the full transition of COTI from a single currency infrastructure to a multi-token network. We believe COTI is uniquely positioned to serve enterprises, enabling them to launch their own Private Payment Network (PPN), which includes the issuance of CMD [COTI MultiDAG] branded payment tokens, issuance of CMD branded loyalty tokens, and more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coti added that the new tokens would retain the same capabilities of the Trustchain in terms of security, scalability, and throughput, helping manage any requirement of enterprises. Additionally, the Bridge 2.0 app released along with the protocol also comes with a refund feature, allowing users to apply for a refund in case a swap fails due to technical difficulties.&nbsp;</p>
Change In Fee Model&nbsp;
<p>COTI also announced a change in its fee model. The firm revealed that deposit fees would see a decrease of 50%. Meanwhile, withdrawal fees will see a switch from a set price to a dynamic one. However, the early withdrawal fee will remain intact. Other changes in the fee include a fixed multiplier charge which is applicable to multiplied deposits, and a liquidation fee between 1% to 5%, which will also be applicable to multiplied deposits. According to the team, the new fee model will go into effect on the 15th of January, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
Coti&rsquo;s Association With Djed Stablecoin
<p>The Coti ecosystem is also heavily involved with Djed, the Cardano ecosystem&rsquo;s new stablecoin. The protocol is the official issuer of the over-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin, which is expected to launch on the mainnet in January 2023. The co-founder of Coti, Shahaf Bar-Geffen, is quite optimistic about the upcoming launch of Djed, despite the catastrophic failures of previous algorithmic stablecoins such as TerraUSD (UST). He shared his views on Djed when speaking at the Cardano summit, stating that he expected the stablecoin to act as a &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo; in the Cardano network.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Pacific Island of Fiji has elected a new Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, who took office on December 24, and the good news is &ndash; he is reportedly pro-Bitcoin. </p>
<p>Fiji, a nation made up of over 330 islands and located in the Pacific Ocean, elected a new Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, who took office on December 24. The news was shared by Lord Fusitu&rsquo;a, a Tongan noble and a former member of the Tongan parliament. Lord Fusitu&rsquo;a said that he explained to the newly elected PM &ldquo;how Fiji can do Bitcoin legal tender like Tonga&rdquo; and hinted that could be two &ldquo;BTC Legal Tender Bills for the Pacific in 2023.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A new pro-#Bitcoin friendly Prime Minister in the South Pacific.☀️🌊🏝️ Fiji 🇫🇯&lsquo;s newly elected Prime Minister @slrabuka.Let&rsquo;s go 2 for 2 - BTC Legal Tender Bills for the Pacific in 2023 👊🏽💯🇹🇴🇫🇯</p>
&mdash; Lord Fusitu'a (@LordFusitua) December 29, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>Cointelegraph reports that Lord Fusitu&rsquo;a explained to them that &ldquo;The new PM is definitely pro-Bitcoin&rdquo; and quotes Fusitu&rsquo;a as saying:</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>He asked to meet with me which we did via zooms since last year to walk him through step by step, how he could adopt bitcoin legal tender.</p>

<p>Tonga has its own plans to implement Bitcoin as a legal tender and reportedly has legislation in the works which could go live as early as Q2 2023. Tonga started initiating its plans to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender soon after El Salvador&rsquo;s Bitcoin Law came into effect.</p>
Bitcoin Would Benefit Pacific Islands
<p>Both Fiji and Tonga stand to gain a lot from adopting Bitcoin with respect to remittances. Both countries face similar economic and developmental challenges given their location and history. Fiji reports strong growth in terms of financial inclusion recently, but just half of the female population has access to bank accounts making Bitcoin a brilliant tool to improve remittances and aid in banking the unbanked. Bitcoin Magazine reports that remittances sent to Fiji accounted for 11.33% of the country&rsquo;s GDP in 2021, while in Tonga the situation is even more severe &ndash; remittances accounted for a massive 45.5% of Tonga&rsquo;s GDP over the same period.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">December 28, 2022, Tallinn, Estonia: Vulcan Blockchain has just announced that its&rsquo; novel auto-rebasing Layer 1 protocol will launch in Q1 of 2023. The protocol, which has been under development for some time aims to balance supply side issues affecting market stability. In this vein, the primary key feature of the Vulcan Blockchain is its Auto-Rebasing mechanism, which adjusts the circulating supply of $VUL (the native coin) every 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s5">Vulcan, named after the god of fire and forge, features unique never before seen blockchain technology. Auto-Rebasing is a unique feature that allows a blockchain to automatically adjust its supply of circulating coins. This can be an important tool for maintaining the stability and value of the native coin over time, as well as providing a more predictable and transparent monetary policy.</p>
<p class="s5">The Vulcan Blockchain is also Auto-Compounding, which means that as a holder of $VUL, your ownership of coins increases with each epoch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s11">&ldquo;In addition to providing stability, an Auto-Rebasing blockchain can also help to provide greater transparency and predictability,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s11">said Jason Matthison, COO of Vulcan.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s11">&ldquo;By clearly outlining the rules and conditions under which the supply of tokens will be adjusted, an auto-rebasing blockchain can give users and investors a better understanding of the monetary policy of the network. This can help to increase confidence in the network, making it more attractive to users and investors,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s5">To add to its Auto-Rebasing, Auto-Compounding capabilities, the Vulcan Blockchain also has a unique burn mechanism, known as the "Fire Pit&rdquo; (a null address). 80% of all transaction fees on the network are automatically sent to the Fire Pit, which is totally inaccessible and burns the coins from the circulating supply forever. This feature allows $VUL to become hyper deflationary and a trusted store of value cryptocurrency over time.</p>
<p class="s5">The combination of these features, along with the commitment to decentralization, makes the Vulcan Blockchain the ideal platform for DeFi applications. Whether you are a user, developer, or investor, the invitation exists to join the Vulcan Network on this exciting journey and be a part of the future of DeFi.</p>
<p class="s13">About Vulcan Blockchain</p>
<p class="s5">Vulcan Blockchain is the first blockchain with a built-in Auto-Rebasing mechanism, which adjusts the circulating supply of $VUL (the native coin) every 15 minutes.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ryan Selkis, the co-founder and CEO of Messari, recently published his 2023 Crypto Theses report where he looks at key trends and his predictions for the coming year.</p>
<p>Selkis writes his reports on an annual basis, and this is the sixth consecutive Messari Theses Report. He starts with stating that while cryptocurrency portfolios are down 80% since the last report, the question is:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the dark before the dawn, or the beginning of a long Arctic winter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He outlines that both Bitcoin and Ethereum appear to be &ldquo;on long-term stable ground&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;DeFi will take major strides forward next year.&rdquo; He believes that privacy tech will either be integrated into public blockchains, or that it will be banned on &ldquo;dystopian and vague &ldquo;national security&rdquo; grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also gives his view of the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Infrastructure investments around code security, decentralised hardware, virtual worlds, custody, protocol governance, and blockchain scalability are all in vogue. There will be less NFT speculation. Fewer moon fumes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He says that there is a certain amount of &ldquo;rage&rdquo; that fuels the report, given all the bad actors in crypto that have hogged the stage and set back the years of progress of the good actors.</p>
<p>He includes a short tweet thread in the report, which sums up how he feels about crypto today:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The report is split into 2 parts: the first part is titled &ldquo;What H-A-P-P-E-N-E-D in 2022&rdquo;. Very likely a humorous reference to a certain tweet by Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>The second part of the report is titled &ldquo;Why crypto matters in 2023&rdquo;. He begins this with a tribute to Hal Finney for being a visionary who had inspired and motivated him.</p>
<p>Selkis writes with integrity and honesty when he says of Bitcoin that it has &ldquo;big carbon footprints&rdquo;, but then writes of it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;as a single purpose, commodity money, and secure settlement system, it has held up miraculously. It has proven durability and will continue to serve as a powerful check on absolute sovereign authority&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rest of the report is more on Bitcoin, Privacy Coins, Stablecoins, and finally a chapter on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their dystopian character.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire</p>
<p>On December 16-17 2022, the International Blockchain Summit was held at TechFest at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). Encryptus CEO Shantnoo Saxsena used the platform to encourage crypto users to educate themselves before investing in digital assets.</p>
<p>The summit in Mumbai, India, brought together over 10,000 industry leaders, experts, and enthusiasts to exchange ideas about the crypto and blockchain ecosystem. Speakers included Shiv Kumar Bhasin, COO and CTO of the National Stock Exchange; Shantnoo Saxsena, Founder and CEO of Encryptus; and Mru Patel from My Tokenized Capital. These experts shared their thoughts on crypto, the metaverse, and NFTs.</p>
<p>During the summit, Encryptus and other attendees discussed pain points in the industry and collaboratively explored solutions to improve the digital asset space and promote crypto adoption.</p>
<p>The International Blockchain Summit also focused on emerging trends in different industries such as Defence, Technology, and Machine Learning. Mr. Shiv Kumar spoke about the implementation of a CBDC in India. He highlighted the challenges, government plans, and the future of the E-Rupee. Mr. Patel discussed NFTs and the metaverse and how they can play an active role in driving web3 adoption.</p>
<p>Shantnoo Saxsena had a house full of students as he spoke about the basics of cryptocurrency: its adoption, scams, and how to stay safe at all times. He commented: &ldquo;Users must educate themselves before investing their hard-earned money. There are over 20,000 projects out there and not all the projects are legit. Buying cryptos is not tricky, but buying the right cryptos, clean cryptos, with proper storage is more critical.&rdquo;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire</p>
<p>On December 16-17 2022, the International Blockchain Summit was held at TechFest at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). Encryptus CEO Shantnoo Saxsena used the platform to encourage crypto users to educate themselves before investing in digital assets.</p>
<p>The summit in Mumbai, India, brought together over 10,000 industry leaders, experts, and enthusiasts to exchange ideas about the crypto and blockchain ecosystem. Speakers included Shiv Kumar Bhasin, COO and CTO of the National Stock Exchange; Shantnoo Saxsena, Founder and CEO of Encryptus; and Mru Patel from My Tokenized Capital. These experts shared their thoughts on crypto, the metaverse, and NFTs.</p>
<p>During the summit, Encryptus and other attendees discussed pain points in the industry and collaboratively explored solutions to improve the digital asset space and promote crypto adoption.</p>
<p>The International Blockchain Summit also focused on emerging trends in different industries such as Defence, Technology, and Machine Learning. Mr. Shiv Kumar spoke about the implementation of a CBDC in India. He highlighted the challenges, government plans, and the future of the E-Rupee. Mr. Patel discussed NFTs and the metaverse and how they can play an active role in driving web3 adoption.</p>
<p>Shantnoo Saxsena had a house full of students as he spoke about the basics of cryptocurrency: its adoption, scams, and how to stay safe at all times. He commented: &ldquo;Users must educate themselves before investing their hard-earned money. There are over 20,000 projects out there and not all the projects are legit. Buying cryptos is not tricky, but buying the right cryptos, clean cryptos, with proper storage is more critical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TechFest was attended by the likes of Mahindra, Netradyne, Kebbi, and BrahMos. There were also representatives from LBank, Google, TATA Consultancy Services, Jio Mobile, and Boeing at the two-day event.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bounces from 16460:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 30 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) attempted to add to its recent bounce early in the Asian session as the pair retraced some of its recent losses after trading as low as the 16460 area, its weakest print since trading as low as 16273.40 earlier this month.&nbsp; The pair was recently unable to move back above the 17000 figure, peaking around the 16777.35 area in a test of the 50-bar, 4-hour simple moving average.&nbsp; The pair has generally been orbiting the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460. &nbsp;Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16770.19 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16632.91.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto investment firm Midas is shutting down its DeFi platform after suffering irrevocable losses in the Terra, Celsius, and FTX crashes.&nbsp;</p>
$63M Deficit Forces Midas Shutdown
<p>In the aftermath of the heavy losses incurred in the series of crashes in the industry this year, Midas Investments is closing down its DeFi-based yields platform. The news broke when Midas CEO and founder Iakov &ldquo;Trevor&rdquo; Levin wrote and published a blog announcing the news on Tuesday, claiming a deficit of $63 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Levin wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Trevor, the CEO of Midas Investments, and I am writing to you today with a heavy heart to announce that the Midas platform is closing down. Based on this situation and current CeFi market conditions, we have reached the difficult decision to close the platform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blog also detailed the heavy losses suffered by the platform in 2022, as Levin claimed that the Midas platform suffered a cumulative loss of $50 million. According to the founder, the platform needs to be shut down since the respective crashes of the Celsius and FTX ecosystems wiped out over 60% of all assets under the management of the Midas portfolio and created a significant asset deficit.&nbsp;</p>
CeDeFi Shows Way Forward
<p>Furthermore, Levin also outlined the way forward for Midas, claiming that the company will be focusing on its CeDeFi or centralized decentralized finance initiatives in order to create fully transparent, on-chain investment options</p>
<p>He wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the past eight months, our team has been focused on identifying and capitalizing on opportunities to balance our assets and liabilities. This included launching CeDeFi strategies, seeking fundraising, and exploring opportunities with DeFi protocols. Despite these efforts, the extensive withdrawals due to the insolvency of Celcius and FTX, coupled with reduced yield opportunities on the market, made it impossible for us to cover daily payouts to users due to the assets deficit.&rdquo;</p>

Balance Adjustments With MIDAS Tokens
<p>The company has already started its process of shutting down the DeFi platform. On Tuesday, all deposits, swaps, and withdrawals were disabled. The team is working on calculating and adjusting account balances by deducting 55% from user balances held in BTC, ETH, and stablecoins. The remaining amount will be compensated with MIDAS tokens that users will be able to exchange for the new tokens of the upcoming project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Levin wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goal of the new project is to create a win-win situation by connecting competing protocols with liquidity and offering a simplified yield to a range of DeFi and CeFi audiences.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After claiming for days that platform users had just fallen for phishing scams, 3Commas CEO finally admitted that compromised API keys were behind the loss of funds.&nbsp;</p>
User API Keys Compromised
<p>3Commas admitted that the platform was compromised on Wednesday after an anonymous Twitter user published around 100,000 API keys belonging to users. However, there has been word around the blockchain that the platform&rsquo;s API database has been compromised for a while now. Just last week, there was news of crypto funds worth $22 million being siphoned away through these compromised API keys. Back then, the platform&rsquo;s CEO claimed that the loss in funds happened due to the poor decisions taken by some users who fell for phishing scams. However, dozens of users had claimed that their API keys were used to execute trades on exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase without their consent.&nbsp;</p>
Not An Inside Job
<p>With the confirmation of the API database compromise, however, CEO Yuriy Sorokin has been forced to eat his words and admit the real problem with the platform. On Wednesday, he tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw the hacker&rsquo;s message and can confirm that the data in the files is true. As an immediate action, we have asked that Binance, Kucoin, and other supported exchanges revoke all the keys that were connected to 3Commas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorokin also revealed that the team has been investigating the possibility of an inside job, owing to the nature of the hack; however, no such evidence was discovered. The inside job was suspected since a very small number of technical employees had access to the infrastructure. Sorokin claimed that their access had been removed since November 19.&nbsp;</p>
3Commas Failed To Prevent API Compromise
<p>The 3Commas platform allows users to link more than one account held in different crypto exchanges to automated trading software via application programming interfaces or APIs. However, if unwanted parties get hold of these API keys, then they can control all of the linked accounts and drain funds, which is exactly what happened in this situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorokin spoke about focusing on implementing tighter security measures to prevent a repeat of this incident. He tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since then, we have implemented new security measures and will not stop there; we are launching a full investigation involving law enforcement. We are sorry that this has gotten so far and will continue to be transparent in our communications around the situation.&rdquo;</p>
