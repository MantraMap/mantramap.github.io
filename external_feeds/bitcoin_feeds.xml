This means that, even when the metaverse narrative was substituted by meme tokens and artificial intelligence (AI), 43.68% of these investments were directed to metaverse-linked initiatives.</strong></p>
<h2>Interest in Metaverse Still Present, Though Severely Reduced</h2>
<p>Interest in metaverse projects is still present in some investors and venture capital companies that keep pouring millions into these initiatives since the start of 2023. A report published in June by Dappradar, a Web3 tracking site, found that the interest in virtual worlds fell enormously, with trading numbers hitting $56 million during Q2, falling more than 80% compared to Q1.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/metaverse-report-q2-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> attributes this fall to the public&#8217;s loss of interest in topics like the metaverse and virtual worlds while meme coins and artificial intelligence (AI) reached mainstream status. This is also evidenced by the strepitous fall in funding raised by startup companies developing activities in this sector.</p>
<p>Dappradar found that the total funding received by metaverse projects since the start of 2023 fell to $707 million, a little less than 10% of what metaverse projects raked in during 2022 &#8211; $7.6 billion. However, the metaverse shows its strength in the Web3 environment, commanding 43.68% of all the investments in the sector, according to data presented in the report.</p>

<h2>The Future of the Market Is in Asia</h2>
<p>Dappradar&#8217;s report profiles Asia, including regions like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hong-kong-university-of-science-and-technology-to-build-metaverse-campus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hong Kong</a>, mainland <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-china-will-become-a-metaverse-tech-leader-during-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-tech-and-finance-giants-launch-japan-metaverse-economic-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japan,</a> as a continent where the metaverse will thrive, as governments and companies are investing heavily in the sector and its development.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is mentioned as an international metaverse hotspot, as the government has committed to creating an innovation-friendly environment with real estate and luxury goods sectors as a significant part of this nascent metaverse industry.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Dapparadar notes mainland China has been one of the few countries that have formulated a metaverse plan that includes the implementation of initiatives in the education and tourism sectors. Furthermore, Chinese companies like Bytedance, Alibaba, Baidu, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tencent-to-offer-metaverse-building-services-for-asian-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tencent</a> have invested in developing metaverse hardware and software.</p>
<p>Japan, quoted as a leader in the entertainment and gaming environments, is also poised to take advantage of the metaverse, as it integrates national intellectual properties (IPs) into virtual and augmented reality applications, such as Pokemon Go.</p>

<h2>Kids and Crypto &#x2014; Reality TV Star Phaedra Parks&#x2019; Sons &#x2018;Love Anything About Making Money in Cryptocurrency&#x2019;</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
While most cryptocurrency exchanges do not allow minors to trade digital assets, parents can open accounts on their behalf and permit them to engage in trading. Nowadays, it is not uncommon for the younger generation to invest in digital currencies, and there are numerous stories of children investing in crypto since the creation of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
For example, Erik Finman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/18-year-old-erik-finman-bitcoin-millionaire/">received</a> a $1,000 investment when he was 12 years old, and by the time he reached 18, he had become a millionaire from his <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> investment. According to a study published last year by the teen neobanking platform Gohenry, <a href="https://www.altfi.com/article/8838_the-kids-areall-investing-in-crypto">1.33 million children</a> from the U.K. have invested in cryptocurrency.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Furthermore, in April 2022, T. Rowe Price released the 14th annual Parents, Kids, and Money Survey, which revealed that <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/millions-of-kids-are-crypto-curious-here-are-3-key-lessons-to-teach-yours/">57% of children</a> aged 8-14 are familiar with digital currencies. In fact, the survey&#x2019;s research indicated that children were more knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies than their parents, as 47% of parents reported being familiar with the technology.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Last week, in an <a href="https://people.com/phaedra-parks-gave-her-13-year-old-son-usd150-000-to-invest-in-his-first-property-to-teach-building-wealth-exclusive-7555856">interview</a> with People magazine, reality TV star <a href="https://twitter.com/PhaedraParks">Phaedra Parks</a> from &#x201C;Real Housewives of Atlanta&#x201D; revealed that she provided her 13-year-old son, Ayden, with $150,000 to invest.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Parks, who comes from a middle-class family of educators, mentioned that her own parents would have aspired to provide such an opportunity, but lacked the financial resources to give a child $150,000 for a purchase. While discussing the investment, Parks specifically mentioned her son&#x2019;s interest in cryptocurrency assets.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Ayden is big into cryptocurrency and big into researching how to become a millionaire before he is 25,&#x201D; Parks stated during her interview. The cast member of the reality show added that both of her sons &#x201C;love anything about making money in cryptocurrency.&#x201D; Her other son, Dylan, aged ten, shares the same aspiration to be &#x201C;financially stable&#x201D; in the future, as explained by Parks.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
There is a multitude of guides and books available that explain how parents can introduce their children to digital currencies, as kids of all ages have <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nzexkg/meet-the-bitcoin-family">embraced</a> decentralized cryptocurrency technology. Moreover, there are dedicated applications aimed at helping kids begin their journey into cryptocurrency investing, such as the platform <a href="https://www.getearlybird.io/crypto">Earlybird Crypto</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In November 2021, Earlybird raised $4 million from Seven Seven Six and Gemini, and on June 13, 2022, the firm secured an undisclosed amount of funding. In Los Angeles, an annual <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23020971/crypto-kids-nfts-web3-education-summer-camp">Crypto Kids Camp</a> is held for children aged 5 to 7, where they learn about cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence (AI).&#13;<br />

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will also restrict lending and staking activities facilitated by crypto service providers for their retail customers.</strong></p>
<h2>Singapore Has New Crypto Rules</h2>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on Monday ânew requirements for Digital Payment Token (DPT) service providers to safekeep customer assets under a statutory trust before the end of the year.â Singaporeâs central bank detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>This will mitigate the risk of loss or misuse of customersâ assets, and facilitate the recovery of customersâ assets in the event of a DPT service providerâs insolvency.</p></blockquote>
<p>The central bank noted that these measures were introduced following a public consultation in October last year &#8220;on regulatory measures to enhance investor protection and market integrity in DPT services.â The monetary authority is now seeking public feedback on the draft legislative amendments to the Payment Services Regulations to put these requirements into effect.</p>
<p>MAS started the consultation just before the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November last year. Temasek Holdings, a Singaporean government investment company, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/singapore-governments-temasek-writes-down-275m-investment-in-collapsed-crypto-exchange-ftx/">invested $275 million</a> in FTX and wrote down the entire value of its investment after the crypto firm filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In addition, the Singapore central bank stated Monday that it will also impose restrictions on crypto lending and staking activities. According to the announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>MAS will also restrict DPT service providers from facilitating lending and staking of DPT tokens by their retail customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The regulator emphasized that âthese activities are generally not suitable for retail public.â However, MAS clarified that DPT service providers can continue to facilitate such activities for their institutional and accredited investors.</p>
<p>MAS further cautioned investors that &#8220;while the segregation and custody requirements will minimize the risk of loss of customersâ assets, consumers may still face significant delays in recovering their assets in the event of insolvency of the service providers.&#8221; The central bank stressed: &#8220;Consumers must also remain vigilant and not deal with unregulated entities, including those based overseas, as they risk losing all their assets.&#8221;</p>

The analysts assert that higher oil revenues and a liberalized import regime will likely see Nigeria record current account surpluses in the medium term. </strong></p>
<h2>Freely Floating Naira</h2>
<p>Just under a month after Nigerian monetary authorities abandoned the fixed exchange rate regime, analysts at Bank of America recently <a href="https://leadership.ng/naira-now-undervalued-after-free-float-bank-of-america/">now</a> argue that the local currency â the naira â is presently undervalued. However, according to analysts, the naira, which is hovering above NGN700 per US dollar, will likely end the year trading at around NGN680 per U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The latest forecast by Bank of America analysts came more than nine months after an economist with the financial institution <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-bank-of-america-economist-predicts-20-devaluation-of-the-nigerian-currency-in-2023/">predicted</a> a 20% devaluation of the naira which would translate to an exchange rate of NGN520:USD1.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-currency-falls-by-more-than-30-after-central-bank-announced-new-forex-market-rules/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in mid-June, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)âs decision to allow the naira to freely float initially saw the currency tumble from just under NGN470 per dollar to NGN634 per dollar. Since then the currency has continued to lose ground versus the dollar.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-596001 size-full" title="Nigeria Currency Presently Undervalued Says Bank of America Analysts" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/naira-exchange-rate.png" alt="Nigeria Currency Presently Undervalued Says Bank of America Analysts" width="749" height="589" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/naira-exchange-rate-300x236.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/naira-exchange-rate.png 749w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></p>
<p>As shown by the CBNâs June 26 <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/rates/exchratebycurrency.asp">data</a>, the naira to dollar exchange rate stood at NGN753:USD1. Meanwhile, on the parallel market, one U.S. dollar was buying NGN768 on July 1, 2023.</p>
<h2>Nigeria&#8217;s High Debt Burden</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in their latest note on Nigeria, the analysts shared some of the reasons which made them conclude that the naira will start 2024 trading at around 680 per dollar. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The caution is transition time, aligning rates and still to unlock more USD into the formal market will take some time. When the dust has settled, the value of the naira should be stronger and appreciating.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, in their latest note on Nigeria, the analysts also stated that higher oil revenues ($12 billion more) and a liberalized import regime could still see the West African country recording consistent current account surpluses.</p>
<p>The note also urged Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to consider tackling oil theft because doing this could easily result in the country earning more from hydrocarbons. Doing this will in turn ease Nigeriaâs high debt service burden.</p>

Similar to Cboe&#x2019;s refiling of registrations from Fidelity, Vaneck, Invesco, and Wisdomtree, Nasdaq amended the Blackrock spot bitcoin ETF filing, by incorporating Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) partner.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Nasdaq Amends Blackrock Spot Bitcoin ETF Application Alongside Industry Competitors</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Last week, a report from The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/insiders-say-sec-deems-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-and-other-applications-as-inadequate/">revealed</a> that individuals with knowledge of the situation said the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) expressed dissatisfaction with the numerous spot bitcoin ETF filings submitted in the past two weeks.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The leading U.S. options exchange, Cboe, informed the WSJ that it intended to revise its filings. Subsequently, Cboe <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cboe-resubmits-spot-bitcoin-etf-filings-with-coinbase-as-surveillance-sharing-partner-amid-sec-dissatisfaction/">updated</a> the spot bitcoin ETF filings for Wisdomtree, Vaneck, Invesco, and Fidelity.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At that time, it remained undisclosed whether Blackrock had updated its registration for its spot bitcoin ETF. However, on June 29, 2023, records indicate that Nasdaq revised the Blackrock spot bitcoin <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/rulebook/NASDAQ/filings/SR-NASDAQ-2023-016_Resubmission.pdf">19b-4 filing</a>. Like the other ETF resubmissions, Blackrock and Nasdaq designated Coinbase as the fund&#x2019;s surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) partner.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In essence, an SSA partner is an organization that has consented to share surveillance information with another entity. Regarding an exchange-traded fund, an SSA cooperates with the manager to exchange surveillance information aimed at enhancing security and ensuring public safety.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One of the primary concerns regarding a spot bitcoin ETF, as stated in the SEC&#x2019;s numerous denials of spot bitcoin ETFs over the years, is market manipulation and insufficient investor protection.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Nevertheless, Blackrock, being the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager, carries significant credibility, leading some to speculate that the financial powerhouse&#x2019;s credentials could facilitate the approval of Blackrock&#x2019;s spot Bitcoin ETF.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The Spot <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> SSA is expected to be a bilateral surveillance-sharing agreement between Nasdaq and Coinbase that is intended to supplement the exchange&#x2019;s market surveillance program,&#x201D; according to details in Blackrock&#x2019;s filing.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the ETF filing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">submitted for approval</a> to the U.S. securities regulator, Coinbase is also designated as Blackrock&#x2019;s custodian. Blackrock&#x2019;s filing elaborates that there is an agreement and term sheet between Coinbase and Nasdaq, which took effect on June 16, 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Some market observers suggest that this could give Blackrock an advantage, as opposed to stating that the funds are simply &#x201C;expecting to enter into an SSA,&#x201D; as <a href="https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1675929147795709957?s=20">explained</a> by Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

As indicated by Fed policymakers, they estimate the benchmark bank rate to fall within the range of 5.5% to 5.75% by the end of this year. While there are those who predict the possibility of the Fed raising the rate to as high as 6% in 2023, not all market observers share the same level of certainty regarding the central bank&#8217;s decision to raise interest rates before the year concludes.</strong></p>
<h2>Some Doubt Fed&#8217;s Rate Hike Plans, While Others Brace for 6% Ceiling</h2>
<p>For the next 23 days, the market will await the Federal Reserve&#8217;s next rate hike decision. On July 2, 2023, at 7:18 p.m. ET, the CME Fedwatch tool <a href="https://archive.ph/MCT7A#selection-2451.0-2513.4">indicates</a> an 84.3% probability that the central bank will raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points (bps) to approximately 5.25% to 5.5%.</p>
<p>There is a 15.7% chance that the Fed will pause again at the July 26, 2023, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, according to the Fedwatch tool. Although the Fedwatch tool is generally accurate, its projections are based on market sentiment and are subject to change due to economic conditions and other factors.</p>
<p>Some believe the Federal Reserve policymakers&#8217; current projection of ending the year with the federal funds rate at 5.5% to 5.75% will be realized. Last week, Mary Daly, the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/san-francisco-fed-president-deems-2-rate-hikes-in-2023-reasonable-urges-caution-in-monetary-policy/">said</a> she considers two more rate hikes this year to be &#8220;reasonable,&#8221; but she also cautioned that the Fed should balance the risks of both &#8220;under- or over-tightening.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are still those who believe that the U.S. central bank will not raise rates further this year. For instance, Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/how-much-will-fed-raise-rates-in-2023/">stated</a> to bankrate.com that he does not anticipate any additional hikes this year.</p>
<p>Economist Tuan Nguyen from RSM informed bankrate.com that there is the possibility of one more rate hike. âItâs important for the Fed at the moment to have all the options on the table,â Nguyen explained. âWhether itâs the July meeting or the September meeting, all of those meetings will be live, meaning the Fed will have the options of whether to pause or hike.â</p>
<p>In late May, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-boss-warns-everyone-should-be-prepared-for-interest-rates-going-higher-from-here/">informed</a> analysts and reporters that individuals âshould be prepared for rates going higher from here.â At the time, Dimon mentioned the federal funds rate could potentially reach 6% or 7%.</p>
<h2>Study Says 6.5% Bank Rate is Needed to Tame Inflation, Expert Insists &#8216;We&#8217;ll Wind Up Somewhere Around 6%&#8217; This Year</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-24/fed-may-need-to-hike-to-6-5-to-cool-prices-new-study-says">research paper</a> written by Kermit Schoenholtz, a professor emeritus at New York University, Stephen Cecchetti from Brandeis University, Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Frederic Mishkin from Columbia University, and Peter Hooper of Deutsche Bank AG suggests that the U.S. central bank might have to increase the federal funds rate to 6.5% in order to address inflation.</p>
<p>âOur analysis casts doubt on the ability of the Fed to engineer a soft landing in which inflation returns to the 2% target by the end of 2025 without a mild recession,â the paper details.</p>
<p>Tom Luongo, the publisher of âGold, Goats &#8216;n Gunsâ told Kitcoâs lead anchor and editor-in-chief Michelle Makori that he believes the rate will end up at 6% this year. &#8220;I think [Powell] will raise again, and possibly even raise multiple times before the end of the year,â Luongo <a href="https://youtu.be/B4dsDLrBZZ0">said in an interview</a>. âWe&#8217;ll wind up somewhere around 6 percent by the end of the year,â he added.</p>
<p>Luongo also said that he believes more bank failures are coming. After the three largest bank failures in the U.S. in 2023, more banks are due to fail he said. &#8220;I just see the entire banking system imploding, detonating like a nuclear bomb,&#8221; Luongo told Makori.</p>

Revolut cited evolving regulations in the United States, and users will need to sell the three tokens by September 18th. </strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Revolut Joins Bakkt, Robinhood, and Etoro in Delisting Specific Crypto Assets</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
<a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/">Revolut</a> is joining the ranks of Bakkt, Robinhood, and Etoro as it plans to delist <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/MATIC/">polygon (MATIC)</a>, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/SOL/">solana (SOL)</a>, and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA/">cardano (ADA)</a>, according to a <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/237499/revolut-polygon-solana-cardano-crypto-tokens?utm_source=telegram2&utm_medium=social">report</a> by Yogita Khatri from The Block. The report reveals that Revolut sent an email to its U.S. customers, stating that the decision was prompted by &#x201C;changing laws and regulations around cryptocurrency in the [United States].&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Revolut, based in London, United Kingdom, was founded on July 1, 2015, by Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko. Over the past eight years, the company&#x2019;s neobanking business has grown significantly, with a presence in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. As per Khatri&#x2019;s report, Revolut informed the publication that one of the reasons for delisting the coins is the decision by Revolut&#x2019;s partner, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bakkt-takes-proactive-measures-delists-polygon-solana-and-cardano-amid-regulatory-crackdowns/">Bakkt</a>, to delist the tokens.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crackdown on exchanges such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bittrex-requests-dismissal-of-sec-lawsuit-arguing-for-congressional-approval-in-crypto-regulation/">Bittrex</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">Binance</a>, numerous crypto assets have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sec-identifies-12-crypto-tokens-as-securities-in-binance-lawsuit/">categorized</a> as unregistered securities by the regulatory agency. MATIC, SOL, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> have been implicated in the SEC lawsuits and have been designated as investment contracts. In response to the lawsuits, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robinhood-to-delist-cardano-solana-and-polygon-amidst-sec-regulatory-pressure/">Robinhood</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/etoro-to-delist-algo-mana-dash-and-matic-for-us-customers-amid-evolving-regulatory-landscape/">Etoro</a>, and Bakkt have all removed multiple crypto assets from their platforms, citing U.S. regulations as the reason for the decision.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The report also states that Revolut customers in the U.S. are now unable to purchase these tokens, and they have until September 18th to trade them. According to the email reviewed by Khatri, if the delisted crypto assets are not sold by that deadline, they will be liquidated at the prevailing exchange rate on that day, converting them into U.S. dollars.&#13;<br />

The move comes as the global crypto market cap was marginally higher on the first working day of June. Cosmos also extended recent gains, hitting a one-month high in the process.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>) was one of Monday&#x2019;s notable gainer&#x2019;s, as the cryptocurrency climbed to a five-month high.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>/USD hit an intraday peak of $172.11, which comes a day after trading at a bottom of $163.37.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of the rally, monero peaked at its strongest point since February 4 last year, when price reached a top at $174.95.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Overall, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a> has now traded in the green for sixteen of the last nineteen sessions, climbing by over $40.00 in that time.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Earlier gains have now eased, as bulls failed to sustain the breakout ceiling at the $172.00 level, with price now trading at $170.73.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One of the reasons for this was the relative strength index (RSI), which has hit a resistance of its own at 73.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Another notable gainer on Monday was cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>), which climbed to a four-week high to start the week.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $9.40 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>/USD raced to a high at $9.93 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The move saw cosmos climb to its highest level since June 7, which is the last time it was above $10.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, this level also appears to be a resistance level, with bulls so far struggling to break this zone.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This will likely occur once price strength, which is currently tracking at 59.33, moves past a ceiling at 60.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should this take place, the next target for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a> bulls could possibly be a higher ceiling at $11.00.&#13;<br />

&#13;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Litecoin Climbs Over 40% in 2 Weeks &#x2014; Network Hashrate Taps an All-Time High</h2>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thirteen days ago, the crypto exchange EDX, with backing from Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-backed-by-fidelity-schwab-citadel-launches-with-trading-of-4-cryptocurrencies/">revealed</a> its plans to list four different cryptocurrencies: <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>. Since the exchange&#x2019;s launch, both <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> have experienced significant price increases over the past fortnight, outshining many other digital assets. In the span of 30 days, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> has risen by 13.7%, and in the last two weeks alone, it has surged over 40% against the U.S. dollar. Year-to-date, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> has gained 119.7%, propelling the digital currency into the top ten ranks of the crypto economy.</p>

<p>&#13;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to coingecko.com, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> is currently ranked 10th, while coinmarketcap.com (CMC) places <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> in the ninth position. The discrepancy arises because coingecko.com includes lido&#x2019;s staked ether (STETH) in the top ten, whereas CMC does not. As of 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on July 3, 2023, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> is being traded between $110 and $114 per unit, with a market valuation slightly exceeding $8 billion. Among nearly 10,000 crypto assets, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> ranks seventh in terms of global trade volume on Monday, with $1.274 billion traded within a 24-hour period. Coinbase emerges as the most active exchange for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> trades on Monday, with the most popular <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> trading pair being tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>).</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&#13;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Litecoin&#x2019;s hashrate has also witnessed a significant increase, with approximately 100 terahash per second (TH/s) of hashpower added to the chain since June 19. At that time, the chain had a dedicated hashrate of 660 TH/s, while presently it stands at 760 TH/s. The surge in hashrate has propelled Litecoin&#x2019;s hashpower to reach an all-time high this year. On June 28, 2023, specifically at block height 2,499,942, Litecoin&#x2019;s hashrate reached a <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/litecoin/hashrate-chart">record-breaking 958.36 TH/s</a>. Around 22 mining pools are involved in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> mining, with Viabtc taking the lead by contributing a total hashrate of 254.91 TH/s over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">30 Days Remain Until the Next Litecoin Halving</h2>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the meantime, the Litecoin network is preparing for a <a href="https://explorer.viawallet.com/halving">reward halving</a> expected to occur in 30 days, around August 3, 2023. During this event, the subsidy will be reduced by 50%, from 12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> to 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>. With just over 17,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> blocks left until the next halving, blocks are mined on average every 2.5 minutes. Presently, there are approximately 73,280,183 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> in circulation, with 10,717,762 blocks remaining until the block subsidy ceases. Statistics indicate that there are 7,145,978 unique addresses holding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> today, with the top ten wallets accounting for 13.58% of the total supply. Moreover, the top 100 holders control approximately 38.58% of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>&#x2019;s entire supply, as per the current rich list data.</p>

<p>&#13;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Similar to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-hashrate-gains-momentum-miners-flock-to-bch-as-profitability-surges/">bitcoin cash (BCH)</a>, only time will tell whether the price, hashrate, and overall activity of the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> network will be sustained beyond the EDX announcement and the upcoming halving. Just like bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> has historically experienced a price surge leading up to each block reward halving. It has been quite some time since <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> held a position in the top ten largest market caps, although it was once a prominent contender for many years in its early days. Despite <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>&#x2019;s year-to-date increase of 119.7%, its current value remains 73% lower than its all-time high on May 10, 2021, when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> reached $410 per unit.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was once again in consolidation, as the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency remained below a key resistance level for a third straight day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD moved to a peak at $30,789.11 earlier in the day, less than 24-hours after nearing a drop below $30,000.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite the marginal gain, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> remained below a key level of resistance at the $30,800 for the third straight session.&#13;</p>

&#13;<br />
One of the reasons for this was due to the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovering below a ceiling of its own at 69.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index is now tracking at 66.64, which is near a point where it has flat lined for the past few days.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
There is a strong chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> may continue this trend until U.S. markets return from the Independence Day break.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) on the other hand, made steady gains to start the week, moving towards the $2,000 mark in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD jumped to an intraday high at $1,973.64 on Monday, a day after the price fell to a bottom at $1,895.91.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this rally, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency once again reached its strongest point since May 6.&#13;</p>

&#13;<br />
Should this new found momentum continue to intensify there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will be above $2,000 in the coming days.&#13;<br />
