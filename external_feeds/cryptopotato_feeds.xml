            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Geneva, Switzerland, May 12th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://messari.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Messari</a>, a leader in crypto market research and intelligence, recently released reports on both the USDD stablecoin as well as the TRON blockchain ecosystem. “The <a href="https://trondao.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">TRON DAO</a> team appreciates Messari’s work overall, and like normal, its objective research in these latest TRON-related reports offers data-driven, insightful remarks,” a TRON spokesperson commented.</p>
<p><a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-usdd-q1-2023?referrer=all-research" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>State of USDD Q1 2023</strong></a></p>
<p>USDD is an overcollateralized stablecoin managed by the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR). The number of USDD holders consistently remained above 130,000 in Q1 2023. The quarter also saw USDD expand its reach through various partnerships, and integrations with platforms like SwapFish, LayerZero Labs&#8217; Aptos Bridge, and SushiSwap on the BitTorrent Chain (BTTC).</p>
<p><a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-tron-q1-2023?referrer=all-research" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>State of TRON Q1 2023</strong></a></p>
<p>The TRON ecosystem overall held steady in Q1 2023.</p>
<p>There was a growth of 193,000 new accounts per day, surpassing the 12-month average of 172,000. Daily transactions grew by 7.7%, and TRON&#8217;s deflation rate was around 1% in Q1. Additionally, TRON&#8217;s position in the stablecoin landscape remains substantial, second only to Ethereum. The network&#8217;s integration with platforms like Blockbank, Fireblocks, and Uphold has improved access to the ecosystem, while initiatives like the TRON Climate Initiative and TRON Academy highlight its commitment to sustainability and next-gen education.</p>
<p><strong>Other highlights of note from the TRON report were: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JustLend and JustStables benefited from the market rebound throughout Q1 as both were up QoQ (26% and 21%, respectively)</li>
<li>TUSD value on the network grew by 420% QoQ to ~$1.3 billion</li>
<li>Average amount of stake for Energy increased by 37.8% QoQ</li>
<li>Technical developments advanced steadily</li>
<li>TRON initiated developments to expand DeFi, including liquid staking and a decentralized resource marketplace.</li>
<li>While USDT maintained 95% of the stablecoin value on TRON, there was a notable uptick in TUSD.</li>
<li>TRON positioned itself in the AI space by partnering with Oraichain and launching a $100 million AI development fund.</li>
</ul>
<p>TRON looks to remain competitive and continue its growth strategies to expand DeFi, stablecoin adoption, AI, and other use cases through 2023.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[He bought Twitter for $44B in October 2022 and indicated that he'd only lead the company for a limited time to complete the organizational overhaul.  ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk announced that he has found a new leader for Twitter and will shift into a new role as chief technologist.</p>
<p>While Musk is yet to name his successor, reports suggest that NBC Universal executive Linda Yaccarino could potentially replace him as the new leader of the microblogging platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1656747082571722753" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">tweet</a> on May 11th, Musk said the company&#8217;s new CEO will start in about six weeks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Excited to announce that I’ve a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks! My role will transition to being exec chair &amp; CTO, overseeing product, software &amp; sysops.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Other rumors suggest that former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg could also lead the firm.</li>
<li>Since the controversial <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/eu-chief-fires-another-warning-shot-at-elon-musk-over-twitters-content-moderation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">takeover</a> of Twitter in a $44 billion deal last year, Musk carried out several changes to the platform, including announcing the end of the old verified program and instead introducing a new paid version.</li>
<li>The buyout of Twitter was expected to be instrumental for the digital asset industry with integrations of crypto and blockchain features into the social media platform. However, not much has transpired in the last six months since the acquisition.</li>
<li>Musk&#8217;s decision to file for Twitter to become a financial services company did spark speculation of crypto payment integration. However, these efforts appeared to have taken a backseat.</li>
<li>In April, Twitter briefly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoin-explodes-25-after-elon-musk-changes-twitter-icon-to-doge-meme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">changed</a> its iconic bluebird logo to the Shiba Inu mascot used by Dogecoin (DOGE), which Musk has been vocal about supporting.</li>
<li>Twitter was also reportedly developing a payments platform that could eventually accommodate digital assets.</li>
</ul>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Please Read Disclaimer]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://airdao.io/?utm_source=news&amp;utm_medium=cryptopotato&amp;utm_campaign=flatdao" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AirDAO</a>, formerly known as Ambrosus, announces its transition towards true decentralization and community governance. With a renewed vision and new leadership, AirDAO has embraced a community-first approach and is now empowering its global community to take the reins of its future. This groundbreaking shift marks a significant leap forward for AirDAO and decentralization in web3.</p>
<p>AirDAO’s story is one of constant change and growth. The transition from Ambrosus to AirDAO allowed for a clean slate and an opportunity for the new team to think creatively and explore daring new ideas. The emphasis on putting the community first has cultivated widespread support for AirDAO worldwide.</p>
<p>In a pioneering move, AirDAO will adopt a flat DAO structure, decentralizing its leadership and eliminating traditional roles such as ‘Director’ and ‘CEO.’ The AirDAO blockchain will no longer be maintained, controlled, or built by a single developer or development company. Instead, AirDAO will be developed and governed by the people, for the people.</p>
<p>The next phase of the AirDAO journey involves electing a nine-member AirDAO Council. This council will assume control over AirDAO’s finances, operational budget, and blockchain core-engineer multi-signature wallet in the coming weeks. By May 31st, 2023; the council will have complete control over all AirDAO assets and convene regular meetings to make roadmap and operational decisions.</p>
<p>The community will conduct the voting process for the AirDAO Council, with fairness and transparency ensured through on-chain voting. Community members will nominate candidates of their choice without a predetermined list. The community will also shape the council’s role — establishing rules, drafting the AirDAO constitution, and developing the voting process. The internal AirDAO team will support the community during the formation process and council elections.</p>
<p>During the transition period, Lang Mei — the current Director of AirDAO — will oversee the change to decentralized leadership. By May 31st, 2023, his CEO/Director role will be retired, allowing the elected council to assume total control of the roadmap, HR, financial, and operational decisions.</p>
<p>A community-led web3 ecosystem thrives on active participation. As such, AirDAO invites the community to play an instrumental role in shaping its future. Get involved in the governance process, contribute to AirDAO development, vote in the council elections, and be the change you want to see.</p>
<h2>About AirDAO:</h2>
<p><a href="https://airdao.io/?utm_source=news&amp;utm_medium=cryptopotato&amp;utm_campaign=flatdao" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AirDAO</a> is a community-governed layer one blockchain and ecosystem of web3 dApps, powered by the native token, AMB. AirDAO brings the benefits of Web3 to a global audience with a suite of powerful products in an intuitive, all-in-one interface that makes DeFi more accessible to the average user.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The total crypto market cap declined by over $40 billion in just a day.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The landscape around bitcoin took another turn for the worse in the past 24 hours as the asset fell to its lowest price position in almost two months.</p>
<p>The altcoins are in no better shape, with ETH, MATIC, SHIB, DOT, LDO, and many others dumping hard in the past 48 hours.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Falls Toward $26K</h2>
<p>Bitcoin was trading sideways for a few days until Tuesday and sat calmly around $27,500, anticipating the US CPI announcement, which was scheduled for Wednesday. Once the numbers came out and it turned out that the inflation increase is slightly lower than expected, the cryptocurrency actually <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-soars-above-28k-as-us-april-inflation-lower-than-expected/" data-wpel-link="internal">went on the offensive</a> and spiked by $800 to just under $28,400.</p>
<p>However, that was short-lived, and BTC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-pumped-and-dumped-1-5k-following-us-cpi-numbers-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">fell hard</a> in the following hours to under $27,000. Despite recovering some ground at first, the asset started losing value once again in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>This culminated in a drop to $26,100 (on Bitstamp) early today, which was bitcoin&#8217;s lowest price position since mid-March. Despite recovering a few hundred dollars since then, BTC is still over 4% down on the day.</p>
<p>As such, its market cap has slipped to $510 billion, and its dominance over the alts has taken a hit and is down to 46.3%.</p>
<p>Somewhat expectedly, the enhanced volatility has resulted in roughly $150 million in liquidations on a daily scale, <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according</a> to CoinGlass.</p>

<h2>Alts in Red</h2>
<p>Ethereum is another notable loser in the past 48 hours. Despite the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-crashes-to-6-week-lows-despite-eth-on-exchanges-declining/" data-wpel-link="internal">declining amount of ETH</a> sitting on exchanges, the asset&#8217;s price has slumped by $250 in this timeframe to drop to a 6-week low registered earlier today.</p>
<p>Binance Coin is close to breaking below $300 after a 2.3% daily drop. MATIC, DOGE, SOL, DOT, TRX, LTC, and SHIB are also well in the red from the larger-cap alts. Interestingly, XRP is the only alt with a minor daily increase.</p>
<p>Further losses are evident from TONCOIN and LDO &#8211; both are down by around 6%.</p>
<p>In total, the crypto market cap has seen $40 billion gone daily, and the metric is at just over $1.1 trillion.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[ETH is down by over $200 in the past few days alone.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of ETH sitting on crypto exchanges continues to decrease and is now down to its lowest position since public trading began almost a decade ago.</p>
<p>However, that has not stopped the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency from further dropping to a new 6-week low.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/for-the-first-time-since-2015-nearly-90-of-the-eth-supply-now-in-self-custody/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> in late March that the Ethereum supply held on exchanges had declined to just 10.31%.</li>
<li>It seems investors have only continued withdrawing their ETH portions from trading platforms, as Santiment updated that the percentage has further declined to 10.1%.</li>
<li>The analytics resource asserted that this is the lowest figure since the asset began public trading after its launch in 2015.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<ul>
<li>At first, this data should sound bullish for the asset. This is because the selling pressure should be lower, given the fact that there are fewer coins sitting on trading platforms.</li>
<li>However, this has not been the case for the past few days. ETH touched $2,000 less than a week ago, but the subsequent rejection pushed it down hard.</li>
<li>After the CPI <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-soars-above-28k-as-us-april-inflation-lower-than-expected/" data-wpel-link="internal">announcement</a> on Wednesday, it pumped to $1,900 once again.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Laval, Canada, May 11th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>Groundbreaking Initiative Revolutionizes ASIC Repair Services, Encourages Sustainability and Decentralization in Cryptocurrency Mining.</p>
<p>D-Central Technologies Inc., a pioneer in the cryptocurrency mining industry, is excited to announce the expansion of its revolutionary &#8220;Hash No Cash&#8221; program to all cryptocurrency miners in North America. This innovative initiative, previously accessible only to select clients, is now available to miners of all scales, dramatically transforming the landscape of ASIC repair services.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Hash No Cash&#8221; program allows D-Central to provide high-quality repair services for mining hardware at no cash cost, instead accepting broken hardware as payment. This innovative approach is a testament to D-Central&#8217;s commitment to fostering sustainable, accessible, and cost-effective solutions for miners.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency mining, the need for efficient and affordable repair services is more important than ever,&#8221; said Jonathan Bertrand, CEO of D-Central. &#8220;With the &#8216;Hash No Cash&#8217; program, we&#8217;re making it easier for miners to maintain and repair their hardware, allowing them to keep their capital for strategic investments such as new hardware purchases.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Hash No Cash&#8221; program also contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing electronic waste. By repairing and repurposing broken hardware, D-Central minimizes the demand for new equipment production, thereby reducing the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the program promotes decentralization in cryptocurrency mining. By making repaired hardware available to retail customers at affordable prices, D-Central is putting the power of ASICs into more hands, fostering the wider distribution of mining power.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;D-Central is committed to driving change within the cryptocurrency mining industry,&#8221; said Jonathan Bertrand. &#8220;Our goal is not just to provide repair services, but to create solutions that are financially viable, environmentally friendly, and conducive to the decentralization of mining power.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Miners across North America are invited to take advantage of the &#8220;Hash No Cash&#8221; program. To learn more about the program or to get started, please visit: https://d-central.tech/</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stablecoin issuer Circle no longer has Treasury holdings that mature beyond early June as it does not want to get tangled in a potential US debt default.</p>
<p>The development follows US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen&#8217;s warning that the government could be unable to pay its bills by June 1st and could default on its debt at a later date, sparking widespread concern.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a recent <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2023/05/10/rewriting-crypto-00096124" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">interview</a>, Chief Jeremy Allaire noted that Circle doesn’t want to carry exposure &#8220;through a potential breach of the ability of the US government to pay its debts.&#8221;</li>
<li>As such, the fintech firm has adjusted its mix of reserves that back USDC by switching to short-dated US Treasuries to avoid a catastrophic fallout.</li>
<li>Circle Reserve Fund Disclosures, which are managed by BlackRock, <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/cash/en-us/products/329365/circle-reserve-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">revealed</a> that current holdings mature no later than May 31.</li>
<li>A Treasury bill, aka T-Bill, is a short-term government debt obligation backed by the US Treasury that can have maturities ranging from four weeks to 52 weeks.</li>
<li>The Republicans and Democrats failing to reach a deal might put the country at risk of defaulting on the national debt. To avoid a default, both sides will have to raise the debt ceiling.</li>
<li>However, negotiations on raising the debt ceiling got off to a rocky start this week as White House talks concluded with no agreement.</li>
<li>As for Circle, its US Dollar-pegged stablecoin &#8211; USDC &#8211; suffered a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/why-did-usdc-depeg-circle-ceo-gives-the-inside-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">depeg</a> after the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) earlier this year. The token has since stabilized and is currently sitting at a $30.12 billion market cap.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The authorities of New York state proposed certain amendments to the law that could allow residents to settle bail bonds in stablecoins instead of fiat currency.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawmakers pointed out the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, outlining that the court might require further guarantees if the valuation of stablecoins dropped over 50% from the value when bail was posted.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;If the court directs that bail be posted as provided in paragraph (j) of subdivision of this section and the value of the stablecoins falls more than fifty percent from the value of the stablecoins at the time bail was posted, the court may in its discretion, request the posting of additional bail as provided in subdivision one of this section,&#8221; the bill reads.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies or precious metals are supposed to have a fixed price, but there have been some examples of the opposite.

			            <description><![CDATA[PacWest lost over $10 billion in deposits since the start of the banking crisis. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">California lender PacWest Bancorp (PACW) fell over 20% on Thursday after the company revealed it had lost a significant portion of its deposits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This follows a string of US regional bank failures this year that were preceded by similar red flags. </span></p>
<h2>Depositors Flee From PacWest</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Per its quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, PacWest said its deposits declined by 9.5% last week – mostly occurring on May 4 and 5. This, according to the bank, was in response to “heightened market and customer fears” surrounding the bank after First Republic Bank was closed by regulators on May 1st. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the afternoon of May 3, 2023, PacWest was featured prominently in the financial news headlines with reports that PacWest was &#8220;exploring all of its options and having talks with potential investors and partners&#8221;,” wrote the firm. “The news headlines increased our customers&#8217; fears of the safety of their deposits.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among the </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/multiple-bank-stocks-slide-while-bitcoin-pumps-after-first-republic-failure/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">many banks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> caught up in banking sector fear during First Republic’s fall, PacWest was one the hardest hit. During the week from April 28 to May 5, its stock price fell from $10.15 to $5.96, and trades for $4.70 as of Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bank clarified that it has already funded its decline in deposits with available on-balance-sheet liquidity. As of May 10, the firm held immediately available liquidity of $15 billion, against uninsured deposits of $5.2 billion, representing a coverage ratio of 288%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Much of that liquidity stemmed from having pledged $5.1 billion on Wednesday to the Federal Reserve’s discount window, giving PacWest another $3.9 billion in additional borrowing capacity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">PacWest was also hit hard during the initial string of bank failures in March that claims Silvergate, Signature Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The event caused PacWest to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/multiple-bank-stocks-stop-trading-amid-post-svb-volatility/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">plummet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> 47% the day after SVB depositors were bailed out, and to lose deposits in excess of what federal deposit insurance could cover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first quarter, PacWest’s deposits fell by $16.9% total – or $5.7 billion. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“These recent events, and the ongoing news coverage of these events, has increased certain risks and uncertainties related to our business and future prospects,” stated the bank. </span></p></blockquote>
<h2>The Current State of Banks</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Phoenix-based bank Western Alliance (WAL) also underwent significant volatility after March’s bank failures, dropping a whopping 76% on March 13. After First Republic went down, its stock </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/multiple-bank-stocks-slide-while-bitcoin-pumps-after-first-republic-failure/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">slid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> 20% on May 2 from $36.18 to $28.96. It currently trades for $28.96. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bank </span><a href="https://investors.westernalliancebancorporation.com/news-releases/news/news-details/2023/Western-Alliance-Bancorporation-Issues-Deposit-Update/default.aspx" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">appeared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to fare better than PacWest on the deposit front, however, reporting a $600 million increase in deposits between May 2 and May 9. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After First Republic’s failure, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted that PacWest would be the next bank to fall in the ongoing banking crisis. “Guess we know who is next to be deaded by the FDIC,” he </span><a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1653403052899192833" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in response to its sliding stock prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last week, US Senator John Kennedy </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-senator-calls-banks-sophisticated-ponzi-schemes/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">referred</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to banks as “sophisticated Ponzi schemes” due to their reliance on their depositors’ trust in them.</span></p>
