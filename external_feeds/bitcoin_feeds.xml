<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Holesky Set to Replace Goerli Testnet in 2023</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1692283671481573538?s=20">reported</a> by Tim Beiko, a core developer, during the Ethereum <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DyAtbK2MQG4?feature=share">Execution Layer Meeting 168</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/parithosh_j">Parithosh Jayanthi</a> shared an update on the recently launched devnet-8. Beiko mentioned that while some clients faced challenges, most have been addressed or are being fixed. Notably, Lighthouse encountered a problem due to nplex support removal – an issue they plan to resolve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Beiko <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1692284398312538144?s=20">revealed</a> that Ethereum JS rectified a bug related to multiple &#8220;forkChoiceUpdated calls&#8221; during block production. Pre-launch glitches in Geth and Nethermind were identified and corrected. The Ethereum developer also stated that the Ethereum Foundation&#8217;s Devops team joined forces with <a href="https://twitter.com/KurtosisTech">Kurtosis Tech</a> for pre-launch testing and anticipates utilizing it in augmenting test scenarios.</p>
<p>The developer also emphasized that Besu and Erigon have not yet participated in the devnet but plan to once their respective implementations are finalized. Alongside these discussions, Ethereum developers aim to unveil a new testnest called <a href="https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky">Holesky</a> in mid-September. Intended to foster development, an abundance of testnet coins will be introduced to the testing layer.</p>

<p>Core developers agreed to incorporate 1.6 billion Holesky testnet ether. Holesky is set to be a public testnet and will &#8220;replace <a href="https://github.com/eth-clients/goerli">Goerli</a> as a staking, infrastructure, and protocol-developer testnet in 2023,&#8221; according to Holesky documentation. As of now, Holesky is scheduled for launch on September 15, 2023, at 14:00 UTC. This upcoming testnet will be employed for testing purposes in line with future Ethereum upgrades. The next Ethereum core developer Execution Layer Meeting is set for August 31, 2023.</p>

<h2>U.S. Judiciary Designates Tornado Cash as &#8216;Person&#8217; in OFAC Case</h2>
<p>In a legal face-off with the U.S. government, specifically the OFAC, the plaintiffs posited that Tornado Cash is simply decentralized software. On the contrary, the government viewed it as an organization facilitating cryptocurrency mixing. Central to the dispute was whether the OFAC held the power to impose sanctions on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-bans-ethereum-mixer-tornado-cash-platform-added-to-ofacs-sdn-list/">Tornado Cash</a>, and if such an action infringes on the plaintiffs&#8217; freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Yet, the court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1211705/gov.uscourts.txwd.1211705.94.0.pdf">dismissed</a> the plaintiffs&#8217; stance, recognizing Tornado Cash as an entity fit for OFAC designation. The court reasoned that Tornado Cash aligns with the regulatory description of an &#8220;association,&#8221; given the collaborative efforts of its founders, developers, and its DAO governance model towards shared objectives. U.S. judge Robert Pitman declared:</p>
<blockquote><p>The record sufficiently supports OFAC’s determination that the founders, the developers, and the Tornado Cash DAO have acted jointly to promote and govern Tornado Cash and to profit from these activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Judge Pitman identified that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/github-partially-reinstates-tornado-cash-codebase-open-source-code-set-to-read-only-mode/">Tornado Cash</a> holds a vested interest in the smart contracts it establishes, which aligns with the regulatory classification of &#8220;property.&#8221; These contracts, which autonomously generate revenue as fees for Tornado Cash, represent a tangible benefit. Pitman elucidated this perspective in the court documents.</p>
<p>When it comes to First Amendment concerns, Pitman clarified that the government&#8217;s moves don&#8217;t infringe upon safeguarded speech. The designation solely curtails transactions linked to Tornado Cash&#8217;s property rights, without restricting engagement with its open-source code or other services.</p>
<p>Pitman’s judgment emphasized, “The fact that smart contracts do so without additional human intervention, like a vending machine, or that they are immutable, does not affect its status as [a] type of contract and, thus, a type of property within the meaning of the regulation.”</p>
<p>The court documents also revealed that the plaintiff&#8217;s Fifth Amendment claims were essentially set aside, given their lack of follow-through beyond the preliminary grievance, even as the government sought a summary judgment for all claims. In conclusion, judge Pitman negated the plaintiffs&#8217; request for summary judgment while endorsing the government&#8217;s counter-claim.</p>
<p>He said he firmly believed that the OFAC acted within its legal boundaries in its decision concerning Tornado Cash, ensuring no breach of the plaintiffs&#8217; constitutional privileges. The verdict concerning Tornado Cash mirrors a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/notions-of-dao-immunity-sink-as-cftc-lawsuit-declares-ooki-dao-a-person-under-the-law/">preceding lawsuit</a> involving Ooki DAO, initiated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>On June 9, 2023, the CFTC clinched a victory when the judge determined that the Ooki DAO qualifies as a “person” under the Commodity Exchange Act. “This decision should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who believes they can circumvent the law by adopting a DAO structure,” CFTC Division of Enforcement director Ian McGinley said at the time.</p>

Opensea revealed that the &#x201C;cost to continue supporting BSC outweighs the impact.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Opensea Pivots Away From <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> Smart Chain in Strategy Re-evaluation</h2>
<p>On August 18, 2023, Opensea <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1692598153244020776?s=20">proclaimed</a> that they would cease BSC support after incorporating multiple blockchains over recent years. This announcement coincides with Opensea&#x2019;s strategy to phase out the enforcement of NFT royalties. Concerning BSC support, Opensea stated that as the industry advances, the company needs to &#x201C;align resources with the most promising efforts.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve decided the cost to continue supporting BSC outweighs the impact,&#x201D; Opensea said. &#x201C;Starting today, you will no longer be able to create new listings for or make new offers on BSC NFTs. However, you will still be able to view, discover, and transfer BSC NFTs on our site.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In response to Opensea&#x2019;s X thread publication, some individuals <a href="https://twitter.com/CosmicRichy/status/1692629965735711179?s=20">claimed</a> they were <a href="https://twitter.com/NFTmmAAXXii/status/1692621790814892187?s=20">unaware</a> of BSC support&#x2019;s existence. Others seized this chance to voice their grievances about the royalty ruling. One individual <a href="https://twitter.com/MemeNFTOfficial/status/1692747312148176929?s=20">commented</a>, &#x201C;IDK what kind of system you guys are running over there but it&#x2019;s not that expensive to run BSC if you do it right.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Opensea concluded by asserting their continued optimism regarding a multi-chain future and shared that they recently added support for layer two (L2) blockchains <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bases-rapid-ascent-136000-daily-users-and-175-million-tvl-in-ethereums-l2-defi-space/">Base</a> and Zora. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re confident this decision will help us direct resources to keep pace with the rapid innovation in our ecosystem,&#x201D; added Opensea.</p>

Notably, within the last week alone, it saw a decrease of more than 11%. Interestingly, within the past 24 hours, WLD showcased a rise of more than 15% against the greenback. Furthermore, four days prior, the count of distinct wallets containing WLD surpassed the 500,000 mark.</strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin Plummets Over 50% Since Its All-Time High</h2>
<p>According to statistics, the iris-scanning crypto project <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-opens-probe-into-worldcoin-personal-data-treatment-procedures/">Worldcoin</a>&#x2018;s native token, WLD, has increased 15% in the last 24 hours. Data from July 24 to <a href="https://archive.ph/g6SUj">August 18, 2023</a>, shows WLD has declined 29.1% against the U.S. dollar. Currently, WLD ranks 156 out of more than 10,000 crypto assets listed, with a market value of about $194 million. There&#x2019;s a circulating supply of <a href="https://archive.ph/K46Da#selection-699.0-699.11">178.9 million WLD</a>, trading at $1.53 each. WLD is down 53.46% from its all-time high on July 24, 2023, its listing date.</p>

<p>Of the 178.9 million WLD in existence, <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2766822/4605343">17.45 million</a> are claimed tokens, according to data from Dune Analytics. On August 14, 2023, the number of wallets holding WLD surpassed 500,000, and as of August 18, there are 531,236 unique addresses. The top wallet, which is the contract, holds 97.52 million WLD, or 54.52% of the supply. The second wallet, also under Worldcoin control, holds 30.98 million WLD, or 17.33% of the current supply. The third-largest WLD holder is <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xF977814e90dA44bFA03b6295A0616a897441aceC">Binance&#x2019;s cold wallet</a> with about 11.7 million tokens or 6.54%.</p>

<p>&#x200B;&#x200B;The market maker Wintermute holds the <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0x55697d6ef379C6324e41f350A3db4ee19BAb82A0">fourth-largest WLD wallet</a> with 7.19 million, or 4.03% of the supply. Worldcoin operates the fifth-largest WLD address with about 3.45 million tokens (1.93%), while the sixth-largest Worldcoin wallet belongs to the crypto exchange Okx. As of August 18, the <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xEbe80f029b1c02862B9E8a70a7e5317C06F62Cae">Okx wallet</a> holds approximately 2.13 million WLD, or 1.19% of the total supply. The six aforementioned WLD wallets control 85.53% of the 178.9 million WLD. The top 100 Worldcoin (WLD) holders collectively own 94.04% of the supply.</p>

<p>In the past 24 hours, WLD has seen about $89.76 million in trade volume. The crypto asset&#x2019;s $194 million represents 0.018% of the $1.09 trillion crypto economy. The four most traded pairs for WLD are tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>), bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), USD Coin (USDC) and the Korean won, followed by the U.S. dollar. Tether trades make up 96% of WLD&#x2019;s 24-hour trade volume. About $1.01 million of the $89.76 million comes from Uniswap v3 on Ethereum, and roughly $190,000 was recorded in the last day on the Optimism version of Uniswap v3, with the most traded pair being WETH.</p>

Prices recently fell lower for six straight days, however, bulls have reentered the market snapping this streak in the process. Dogecoin also rebounded today. </strong></p>
<h2>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>)</h2>
<p>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>) rose higher on Saturday, following a recent six-day losing streak which pushed the price to a multi-month low.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>/USD climbed to an intraday peak at $0.12 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes following a low of $0.1115 the day prior.</p>
<p>The move comes as stellar continued to move away from a support point at $0.110, which was hit on Thursday.</p>

<p>This was the first time the price collided with this floor since mid-June, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) hit its own floor at 30.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index has also rebounded and is now tracking at 34.84, which is marginally below a ceiling at 36.00.</p>
<p>Should it push past this point, the next likely price target will be around a ceiling of $0.1340.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>, dogecoin (DOGE) was also in the green to start the weekend, as it bounced from a floor of its own.</p>
<p>After trading at a low of $0.06079 during Friday&#x2019;s session, DOGE/USD surged to a peak of $0.06385 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The jump in price came as the meme coin moved away from a support point of $0.0600, which is near a recent two-month low.</p>

<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>, the RSI on the dogecoin chart has bounced from a support point at the 30.00 mark, and is now tracking at 34.13.</p>
<p>The next visible point of resistance is at the 44.00 mark, and should this point be hit, DOGE will likely be near $0.06600.</p>

Market sentiment was bearish following reports that Spacex liquidated its bitcoin holdings. Ethereum remains below $1,700.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bears continued to circle bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) to start the weekend, as the cryptocurrency had its biggest one-day decline since the collapse of FTX.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to a low of $25,668.92 on Saturday, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $26,598.65.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s move, bitcoin remains close to a two-month low, with some traders targeting a breakout below $25,000.</p>

<p>Overall, the relative strength index (RSI) is deep in bearish territory, with a current reading of 18.56.</p>
<p>Price strength hasn&#x2019;t tracked below 20.00 since January last year, which for some was the beginning of the so-called &#x201C;crypto winter&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Should there be further declines this weekend, the target will likely be a support point of $24,900.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was marginally higher on Saturday, as the price rebounded from a recent move below $1,600.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,695.45 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD fell to a bottom of $1,644.93 to start the weekend.</p>
<p>On Thursday, ethereum dropped to a low of $1,540, which was its weakest point since March 12, when the price was trading below the $1,459 level.</p>

<p>The 10-day (red) moving average is now firmly on a downward trend, after appearing as though it was nearing an upwards cross earlier in the week.</p>
<p>As of writing, ethereum seems to have found a firm floor around the $1,660 level.</p>

Blockchain.com, Human Capital, Vy Capital, Sky9 Capital, and Jane Street Capital, among others, participated in the funding round. Zetachain will use the funds to launch its solution on mainnet and grow its app ecosystem.</strong></p>
<h2>Zetachain Raises $27 Million in Series A Funding Round</h2>
<p>Zetachain, an interoperability-focused blockchain project, has <a href="https://blog.zetachain.com/zetachain-raises-27m-for-interoperable-layer-1-blockchain-that-connects-all-chains-including-7584dc0c673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> $27 million in a Series A funding round. Blockchain.com, Human Capital, Vy Capital, Sky9 Capital, Jane Street Capital, VistaLabs, CMT Digital, Foundation Capital, Lingfeng Capital, GSR, and others participated in the round. Funds will be used to launch the mainnet of the chain and also to grow its decentralized app ecosystem.</p>
<p>Zetachain wants to tackle the isolation problem that affects blockchains, where resources are siloed and cannot be used in separate chains or applications. Zetachain states its mission is to &#8220;establish a new standard for blockchain interoperability where users can access all of their assets and data from one wallet on a single platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>This includes non-smart-contracts-enabled blockchains, like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Zetachain&#8217;s architecture allows the users to leverage these assets without using structures to bridges or wrapped tokens and the security liabilities they present.</p>

<h2>A Growing Testnet Ecosystem</h2>
<p>While Zetachain&#8217;s solutions are still in testnet stages, there are already more than 27,000 decentralized application contracts used in several applications in various fields, including decentralized finance (defi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), universal Web3 social, identity, and gaming protocols.</p>
<p>Zetachain claims that 1.7 million users have participated on its testnet, with over 13 million transactions completed. With its design approach, the company expects that fees, slippage, and complexity will be reduced for the average user to reach global audiences and introduce them to crypto. For them, solving the fragmentation problem is &#8220;critical to enabling Web3 apps and services to reach a larger audience in the hundreds of millions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next step for Zetachain is to launch its product on mainnet, which still does not have a definitive launch date. However, the interoperability issue is complex, and several competitors are trying to offer their own particular solutions to this problem. In March, Layerzero Labs <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/layerzero-labs-secures-135-million-to-bolster-cross-chain-interoperability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> $135 million in a Series A+ funding round for developing cross-chain decentralized applications.</p>

Crypto asset businesses will be required to take &#8220;all reasonable steps&#8221; to ensure compliance with the travel rule. When the rule becomes effective, compliance with the rule is still expected even when a crypto asset business uses a third-party supplier.</strong></p>
<h2>Delays in Implementing Travel Rule</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom’s financial services industry regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has said crypto firms based in the country will soon be required to adhere to the so-called travel rule. According to the regulator, crypto firms are expected to start complying with this rule from Sept 1, 2023.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-sets-out-expectations-uk-cryptoasset-businesses-complying-travel-rule">statement released</a> on Aug. 17, the FCA suggested that its decision to enforce the requirement aligns with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s call for the swift implementation of the travel rule. Despite the FATF’s call, many countries have failed to implement the travel rule due to delays &#8220;in adoption and different timelines for enforcement of the Travel Rule across jurisdictions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Explaining why the UK is proceeding to implement the rule compelling crypto firms to collect, verify, and share information, the FCA said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have worked closely with industry to provide guidance on how to comply and what we reasonably expect of firms ahead of other countries following the UK’s position.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result of this step taken by the U.K., crypto asset businesses based in the country will be required to take &#8220;all reasonable steps&#8221; to comply with the rule. Compliance with the rule is still expected even when a crypto asset business uses a third-party supplier.</p>
<h2>Crypto Firms Expected to Collect and Verify Information</h2>
<p>In instances where funds are being sent to a jurisdiction without the travel rule, the FCA said crypto firms must still collect and verify the information before a transfer is made. If the funds are being transferred from a jurisdiction without the travel rule, the necessary risk-based assessments must be undertaken before deciding to avail these to the beneficiary or not, the regulator said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FCA said it has been working on a guidance to help firms comply with the travel rule. The financial services industry watchdog added that crypto asset businesses can also share their thoughts about the guidance on or before Aug. 25, 2023.</p>

One such strategy, dubbed &#x201C;Method B,&#x201D; asserts it elevates the likelihood by a remarkable 260% compared to traditional mining searches, simultaneously slashing energy use by 4.3%.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>QBT&#x2019;s Innovation Claims to Find Hashes Faster</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The crypto sphere is <a href="https://twitter.com/SimplyBitcoinTV/status/1692137247129141402?s=20">abuzz</a> over a freshly uncovered research firm, <a href="https://quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk/">Quantum Blockchain Technologies</a> (QBT). For over two years, they&#x2019;ve been diving deep into <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> mining and the intricacies of the SHA256 algorithm. QBT boasts a breakthrough: using machine learning to predict blockchain movements, allowing for advanced block computations. Their claimed cutting-edge <a href="https://quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk/rd">research</a> taps into quantum computing, cryptographic enhancements, deep learning, AI, and the design of FPGA and ASIC, among other innovative methods.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-blockchain-technologies-hard-filing-114238925.html">recent conversation</a> with Thomas Warner, QBT&#x2019;s chief Francesco Gardin shed light on this groundbreaking tech shortly after the <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/QBT/patent-application/16052227">U.K. patent filing</a>. Gardin is confident that their insights surpass the prevailing wisdom in today&#x2019;s mining sector, thanks to collaborations with North American experts. Their patent unveils a novel strategy named &#x201C;MSFCA&#x201D; or &#x201C;ASIC Enhanced Boost,&#x201D; enabling miners to commence work on upcoming blocks even before wrapping up the current one. QBT insists this forward-thinking approach conserves both time and computing power, particularly for application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
QBT believes this innovation tackles a significant hiccup in <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> mining: the waiting period between blocks. While MSFCA doesn&#x2019;t turbocharge the primary SHA256 computations, it greenlights some preemptive work, optimizing energy and resources. The trick? Minimizing the use of specific components (logic gates) on the ASIC chip. Gardin shared with Warner that QBT&#x2019;s innovation might slash logical gates, potentially whittling circuits down by 8%. Researchers say while some extra gear is required for this anticipatory work, its footprint remains negligible.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite facing a few tech hurdles, such as memory chip constraints, QBT is bullish on MSFCA&#x2019;s prospects. Their &#x201C;<a href="https://quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk/products-services">Method B</a>&#x201D; rapidly runs myriad terahashes within the typical ten-minute block window, expertly steering the hunt to zones where winning hashes might lurk. By blending machine learning with mathematical techniques, this approach cherry-picks hashes from the most promising sectors, eliminating redundant calculations.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Lab tests by QBT indicate that Method B spots winning hashes a staggering 260% faster than conventional methods, cutting energy use by roughly 4.3%. This tech revelation coincides with Bitcoin&#x2019;s hashrate soaring to record-breaking levels, nearing an impressive half zettahash. As of today, Friday, August 18, 2023, the <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">total network hashrate</a> stands at 358.58 exahash per second (EH/s). Mining manufacturing bigwigs like Bitmain, Microbt, and Canaan are in a race, crafting rigs equipped with ultra-efficient chips.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Microbt&#x2019;s newest unit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microbt-unveils-new-whatsminer-bitcoin-mining-rig-with-320-th-s-setting-new-standard-for-hashpower/">churns out</a> 320 terahash per second (TH/s), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/samsungs-3nm-gaa-chip-discovered-in-microbts-next-gen-bitcoin-mining-rig/">rumored</a> to harness Samsung&#x2019;s 3-nm GAA semiconductor. Bitmain just <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitmain-to-reveal-groundbreaking-antminer-s21-at-2023-world-digital-mining-summit/">unveiled</a> a rig set to revolutionize energy efficiency, dipping below the 20 joules per terahash (J/T) mark. Meanwhile, Canaan is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/canaan-to-debut-groundbreaking-bitcoin-mining-product-at-10th-anniversary-singapore-event/">teasing</a> a game-changing product set to debut in September, aligning with Bitmain&#x2019;s latest launch.&#13;<br />

The unit said players can reduce the chances of losing money to scammers by doing their own research before committing funds. </strong></p>
<h2>Role Played by Custom-Made Gaming Apps</h2>
<p>The Philippines’ cybercrime fighting unit, the National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP ACG), has told residents to be wary of rewards offered by play-to-earn (P2E) games as such games are increasingly being used to steal crypto assets worth millions of dollars. In a warning published in the unit’s latest <a href="https://acg.pnp.gov.ph/main/images/CSB/CSB_292.pdf">cyber security bulletin</a>, the cybercrime unit said the theft of unsuspecting victims’ crypto assets is perpetrated via custom-created gaming apps.</p>
<p>According to the unit, these gaming apps lure victims with promises of &#8220;huge financial rewards directly proportional to investments to potential targets.&#8221; Such promises are usually made after criminals have succeeded in cultivating relationships with victims over time. The group added:</p>
<blockquote><p>They then introduce victims to an online or mobile game, in which players purportedly earn cryptocurrency rewards in exchange for some activity, such as growing &#8216;crops&#8217; on an animated farm. The mobile games have been designed to display fake rewards that accumulate as the victim plays.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once a victim stops depositing crypto assets into an already compromised wallet, the cybercriminals then siphon the funds. The cybercrime unit added that hackers usually get away with such crimes because &#8220;cryptocurrency is relatively new and not well-regulated.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Advantages of Crypto Gaming Over Traditional Games</h2>
<p>The police bulletin nevertheless acknowledges the advantages of crypto gaming over traditional games, citing the popular P2E gaming platform Axie Infinity which is said to offer players a variety of ways to earn money.</p>
<p>However, the level of investment which is sometimes needed to play can put off some players. On the other hand, players can also lose their digital assets when they sent them to a &#8220;wallet that does not support the asset.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bulletin further says players can reduce the chances of losing money to scammers by doing their own research before committing funds. They should also be on the lookout for fake individuals and deceptive links.</p>
