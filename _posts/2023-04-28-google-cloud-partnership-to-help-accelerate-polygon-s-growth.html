<p>Google Cloud has announced a strategic partnership with Polygon Labs. The partnership will help developers to build, launch, and grow their decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 products on the layer-2 blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
The Blockchain Node Engine Comes To Polygon&nbsp;
<p>The partnership will see Google Cloud bring its node hosting service, the Blockchain Node Engine, to the Polygon ecosystem. In a statement during the Consensus 2023, this will help developers on Polygon to build on the protocol and retain complete control over where nodes are deployed. Ryan Wyatt, Polygon President, added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement with Google Cloud aims to increase transaction throughput enabling use cases in gaming, supply chain management, and DeFi. This will pave the way for even more businesses to embrace blockchain technology through Polygon.&rdquo;</p>

Advancing Polygon&rsquo;s Zero-Knowledge Innovation Strategy&nbsp;
<p>According to Google Cloud, the partnership with Polygon will enable the protocol to grow, advance its zero-knowledge innovation strategy, and help make transactions cheaper and quicker. In a statement, Polygon stated that initial test runs running Polygon zkEVM&rsquo;s zero-knowledge proofs on Google Cloud presented faster and cheaper transactions when compared to the existing setup and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Initial tests to run Polygon zkEVM&rsquo;s zero-knowledge proofs on Google Cloud, for instance, resulted in significantly faster and cheaper transactions as compared to the existing setup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Polygon had announced the release of its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) beta for the public only last month.&nbsp;</p>
Google&rsquo;s Push Into Web3&nbsp;
<p>Google has established itself as one of the most prominent players in the Web2 ecosystem. However, the tech behemoth has been actively making a push into the Web3 ecosystem over the past few years, bringing its technical expertise to developers on Polygon to build and launch its projects. Recently it launched a &ldquo;Google for Startups Cloud Program&rdquo; designed to support startups and emerging projects in the Web3 ecosystem, helping them scale their projects faster and more securely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, the Celo Foundation revealed that it was working with Google Cloud to offer cloud computing services and workshops to developers and Web3 founders building in the Celo ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mitesh Agarwal, the managing director of customer engineering and Web3 go-to-market, Asia Pacific of Google Cloud, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Google Cloud is helping the industry achieve escape velocity by directing our engineering efforts toward areas like improving data availability and enhancing the resilience and performance of scaling protocols like zero-knowledge proofs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Google Cloud is the cloud computing arm of Google and had created its Web3 and digital assets engineering team only last year. Since its inception, Google Cloud has established multiple partnerships with a host of blockchains, including Casper, Celo, Tezos, Solana, Aptos, and BNB Chain.&nbsp;</p>
