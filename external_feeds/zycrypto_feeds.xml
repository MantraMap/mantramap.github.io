<p>Despite displaying an admirable measure of strength year-to-date, Bitcoin has not been off to a good start this month, with the top cryptocurrency losing momentum due to recent market dynamics.</p>



<p>At press time, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bulls-put-on-defensive-amid-fears-of-damaging-inflation-and-job-data-this-month/">Bitcoin</a> was trading at $25,537, reflecting a 6.18% drop in the past 24 hours, with investors now closely observing its movements and assessing the possibility of a new low in its price.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81809" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Recently, &#8220;Grizzly&#8221;, an analyst with onchain analysis firm Cryptoquant, highlighted the short-term support level for Bitcoin. According to him, the realized price for the 1–3-month age band is $27,200, which has historically been a crucial support level. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim this level, he noted that further support can be found at $25,300. Accordingly, failure to hold this level would likely send the price towards $20,000, the current realized price of the 3–6-month age band, according to the analyst.</p>



<p>However, according to &#8220;DanCoinInvestor&#8221;, an analyst at the same firm, a further decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s price to a new low is &#8220;very unlikely.&#8221; On Monday, June 5, the pundit noted that the crypto market was transitioning into a bull market phase, pointing out two key indicators supporting this notion. First, he highlighted the unrealized loss indicator, which measures how many market participants are currently losing money.</p>



<p><em>“The Unrealized Loss reached the bottoming zone (green) and then escaped, and now we are in the transition zone towards the bull market. FYI, it is normal for the peaks of this model to decrease from cycle to cycle, as shown in the chart, as BTC&#8217;s width of peaks and bottom narrow as the volume of the crypto market continues to grow,” </em>he wrote.</p>



<p>Moreover, the analyst highlighted Bitcoin&#8217;s dip and recovery above the realized price (represented by the yellow line), stating BTC was now trading within a stable range. The realized price metric signifies the average purchasing price of the market participants. Despite the temporary drop, Bitcoin has maintained stability and is holding its ground within the established price range.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="561" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-1024x561.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81808" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-1024x561.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-300x164.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-768x421.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4.png 1431w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>DanCoinInvestor further mentioned that although the crypto market may experience a decline in the fourth quarter of 2023 or early 2024, it is highly unlikely that Bitcoin will make a new low. Instead, he noted that any recession-induced drop would represent the last chance before entering the strong bull zone.</p>



<p>That said, whether Bitcoin can break through the abovementioned resistance and regain upward momentum or experience a deeper pullback remains to be seen as its price evolves. Moreover, perhaps the recent purchase of over 1 million BTC by about 2.36 million addresses between the $26,360 and $27,160 levels could keep price buoyed, as <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1665377439940313088">highlighted</a> by popular analyst Ali Martinez on Sunday, June 4.</p>

<p>Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/revolutionizing-cardano-decentralization-how-staking-baskets-enable-seamless-ada-delegation-to-stake-pools/">Cardano</a>, has sounded the alarm about the increasing threat of crypto scams, particularly with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology.</p>



<p>Speaking in a June 4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AnksNTWbIc&amp;ab_channel=CharlesHoskinson">video</a>, Hoskinson addressed the prevalence of scams in the cryptocurrency space where individuals impersonate prominent figures like him, Elon Musk, or Bill Gates to deceive unsuspecting victims into handing over their hard-earned crypto.</p>



<p>The pundit shared a recent video from Nvidia, a leading technology company, demonstrating their advancements in generative AI. The video showcased the ability to create realistic video game graphics and generate lifelike human images using AI technology. Hoskinson expressed his worry that this rapidly evolving technology could be used to manufacture videos and audio, making it appear as if he is soliciting money or offering investment opportunities.</p>



<p>The crypto millionaire warned that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/scammers-hack-openai-ctos-twitter-account-to-promote-crypto-scam/">scammers</a> could leverage generative AI to create convincing content, leading thousands of people to fall victim to these sophisticated scams. Despite his efforts to educate and raise awareness about scams, Hoskinson predicted millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies, including ADA, would be stolen in the next 12 to 24 months.</p>



<p><em>“Millions of dollars worth of ADA and other cryptocurrencies will be stolen. This is the world we&#8217;re heading towards because of generative AI. It&#8217;s one of the dark sides and unintended consequences, but scammers are already doing this,” </em>he said.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, while Hoskinson admitted feeling helpless in the face of this growing threat, he stressed the need for individuals to remain vigilant and authenticate any communication they receive. He further suggested using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption to verify identity, given that AI is currently unable to crack such encryption.</p>



<p>Hoskinson also highlighted&nbsp;Atala Prism, a solution built on Cardano to create authenticated communication channels. He hoped that integrating this technology into various platforms and communication channels could mitigate the impact of scams fueled by generative AI.</p>



<p>In conclusion, Hoskinson reiterated his warning: &#8220;<em>You don&#8217;t get something for nothing. It&#8217;s always a scam.&#8221;</em> He urged viewers to adopt a sceptical approach, assuming all content is unauthenticated until proven otherwise.</p>



<p>As cryptocurrency evolves, the battle against scams becomes increasingly challenging. Earlier last month, Facebook’s parent company Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-scams-are-the-new-crypto-scams-meta-warns-120006510.html">highlighted</a> the uptick in AI-driven crypto scams.</p>



<p>As per the firm, the scams often come disguised as browser extensions or mobile apps posing as ChatGPT and AI software to steal user credentials. And whereas the firm stated it is working on building tools to detect and block these types of malware, it emphasized prevention being better than cure, asking users to be more vigilant online.</p>

<p>Franklin Templeton, one of the world&#8217;s largest asset managers with over $1.5 trillion in assets under management, plans to invest heavily in Bitcoin as well as its underlying technology.</p>



<p>This strategy was revealed by Sandy Kaul, the Senior Vice President of Franklin Templeton&#8217;s burgeoning crypto business, during a Sunday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSm-mrJAqNg&amp;t=5s&amp;ab_channel=ScottMelker">interview</a> with Scott Melker, host of the Wolf Of All Streets podcast. </p>



<p>Discussing how Franklin Templeton entered the digital asset space, Kaul explained that the company was intrigued by the technology behind Bitcoin and had decided to experiment on blockchain to bring operational efficiency and cost savings for its businesses.</p>



<p>As such, the company commenced research on individual coins, created multi-coin portfolios, and even invested in various crypto firms through a dedicated venture capital fund created in 2021.  Furthermore, she disclosed that Franklin Templeton operates its node operations to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Bitcoin network and its growth.</p>



<p>Kaul also emphasized that Franklin Templeton&#8217;s interest in crypto extends beyond Bitcoin. She highlighted the vast opportunities presented by the cryptocurrency’s blockchain and expressed her belief in investors exploring emerging opportunities.</p>



<p>“<em>I think one of the issues we have right now is that people fixate too much on just Bitcoin and oftentimes don&#8217;t think about the broader ecosystem….Bitcoin is a huge Innovation, and we think it&#8217;s going to have massive opportunities in the future,</em>” said Kaul.</p>



<p>Kaul also predicted a continued surge in institutional investors dabbling with cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. She highlighted the cyclical nature of the crypto market, with waves of bull markets occurring every few years since 2011.</p>



<p>According to her, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/arks-cathie-wood-says-bitcoins-upsurge-as-global-banks-roil-will-attract-new-institutional-investors-in-droves/">institutions</a> prefer to enter the market when prices are low, and the sector is not in the spotlight. Thus, the current crypto winter was a period in which institutions strategically positioned themselves in the market, similar to the gradual adoption of alternative assets that took around 10 to 15 years. Furthermore, Kaul emphasized the importance of institutional involvement in creating a solid foundation for the market, which would play a crucial role in propelling cryptocurrencies to new heights following substantial price declines.</p>



<p>“<em>I know they&#8217;re not worried about the price. They salivate at low prices…If you&#8217;ve seen Bitcoin go to $69,000 and you see it at $15,000, you know $69,000 can happen again.”</em> She added.</p>



<p>That said, as Franklin Templeton commits to investing further in Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem, the asset manager joins prominent hedge funds, such as Grayscale Investments, Ark Invest and Pantera Capital, that have already made substantial investments in the space.</p>



<p>Furthermore, with Franklin Templeton&#8217;s commitment to education and promotion alongside its investment activities, mainstream acceptance of digital assets in investment portfolios will likely accelerate.</p>

<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101">filed fresh charges</a> against the world’s largest crypto exchange, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-to-delist-monero-zcash-and-other-privacy-coins-as-regulatory-pressure-intensifies-in-europe/">Binance</a> and CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao.</p>



<p>The commission is bringing 13 charges against the exchange, accusing it of transferring billions of dollars in user assets to a European company controlled by CZ.</p>



<p>Binance is also accused of “blatant disregard” of federal laws and subverting the SEC’s control to let high net-worth individuals trade on the exchange, which it describes as unregulated.</p>



<p><em>“Through thirteen charges, we allege that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a release.</em></p>



<p>Binance is already in court over charges by the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which alleges that Binance willfully disregarded federal laws, similar to the charges by the SEC. CFTC is asking the court to, among other things, stop the crypto giant from operating in the US.</p>



<p>The allegations are coming in the wake of a massive crackdown on crypto companies in the US, which is still ongoing. The SEC through its chairman Gensler has stated severally that any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin is most likely a security, which places every crypto exchange under the commission&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Coinbase has challenged this position in court, requesting that the SEC develop proper regulations for the crypto industry. The SEC in its response, said it takes time to make such regulations and that there’s sufficient guidance for the industry currently.</p>



<p>Because of this regulatory “war”, Coinbase and other indigenous crypto exchanges are looking to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-plans-to-move-offshore-due-to-severe-lack-of-clarity-from-sec-how-avorak-ai-helps-amid-these-developments/">increase their presence</a> outside the US, even though they have no near-term plans to leave the country.</p>



<p>Binance seems to have faced more issues than any of them, though. As a result, the US arm of the exchange, Binance.US, is already reducing CZ&#8217;s share. The pressure has also made it necessary for CZ to step down as CEO, with Richard Teng as a potential successor.</p>

<p>Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, has said that he expects Bitcoin&#8217;s bull market to begin around October or September.</p>



<p>In a Thursday blog, Hayes discussed the current state of the financial markets and the factors that he believes will contribute to the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-at-70000-arthur-hayes-reveals-why-this-price-level-is-unlikely-to-happen-till-2024/">rise of Bitcoin</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fiat-holders-expect-more-trouble"><strong>Fiat Holders, Expect More Trouble</strong></h2>



<p>Delving into the situation in the United States, Hayes predicted the country&#8217;s financial sector would continue experiencing problems, leading to a mass exodus from the fiat monetary financial system. In terms of the US Federal Government, the pundit projected that politicians would continue to prioritize spending. At the same time, the government&#8217;s borrowing would persist, resulting in trillions of dollars of debt being accumulated every year.</p>



<p>He also highlighted the public awareness of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s endless money printing, which he noted would contribute to Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish momentum as people seek to protect against potential inflation.</p>



<p><em>“As more and more pundits start talking about what is happening to the billions of dollars printed by the Fed and US Treasury and handed out as interest, it will become common knowledge once more that the money printer is going brrr. And when the printer goes brrr, Bitcoin goes boom!” </em>he wrote.</p>



<p>Additionally, he touched on the US banking system, noting that banks were likely to keep struggling due to inflation and rising short-term policy rates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brace For The Bull Run</strong></h2>



<p>That said, he predicted a flow of liquidity into Bitcoin and assets such as gold, noting that the real Bitcoin bull market will begin in the late third and early fourth quarter of this year. He also emphasized the importance of patience in the markets, noting that nothing goes up or down in a straight line.</p>



<p><em>“I believe the fireworks and the real Bitcoin bull market will begin in the late third and early fourth quarter of this year. Between now and then, chill…Take a vacation, and enjoy nature and the company of your friends and family. Because come this fall, you better be strapped into your trading spaceship, ready for liftoff,”</em> <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/patience-is-beautiful">wrote</a> Hayes.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Hayes shared his analysis of Bitcoin, stating, <em>&#8220;I expect that Bitcoin will remain resilient at this level. I do not anticipate a retest of $20,000 or anything close to it</em>.”</p>



<p>He emphasised that the market&#8217;s typical lacklustre performance during summer was primarily due to waning interest and boredom among traders. He noted that the gradual influx of funds into global risk asset markets is crucial to Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience and strength.</p>



<p>Utilizing this period of relative tranquillity, the pundit concluded by disclosing that he intends to gradually increase his allocation to Bitcoin after replenishing his general trading account.</p>

<p>Ripple is reportedly considering an initial public offering (IPO) as its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approaches its conclusion.</p>



<p>During a May 31 interview with Digital Perspectives, Linda P. Jones, a seasoned Wall Street veteran with 25 years of experience, alluded to this possibility by providing her expert analysis on the potential implications of a Ripple Initial Public Offering (IPO).</p>



<p>Jones performed an initial assessment to approximate the potential stock value of Ripple. Using the latest data from private investments firm Linqto, she determined Ripple&#8217;s current share price to be $35, which corresponds to a valuation of $5.7 billion. Linqto offers interested investors the opportunity to purchase stocks before the company goes public in an IPO. However, Jones highlighted a disparity in Linqto&#8217;s valuation, suggesting that it seems disproportionately low when considering Ripple&#8217;s historical performance and its significant holdings of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-new-boom-for-xrp-record-breaking-address-activity-indicates-upturn-ahead-to-1-xrp-price/">XRP</a>.</p>



<p>Drawing attention to Ripple&#8217;s extensive XRP reserves, Jones emphasized that the 42 billion XRP tokens held in escrow are currently valued at $21 billion, assuming a market rate of $0.50 per token. In her view, this valuation alone exceeds Ripple&#8217;s current market value by four times, indicating a significant undervaluation and suggesting that Ripple&#8217;s true worth could be considerably higher.</p>



<p>The pundit further drew a comparison to Coinbase&#8217;s successful IPO, speculating that Ripple&#8217;s valuation could reach $107 billion, 20 times its current value, meaning $600 per share.</p>



<p>According to her, if the XRP lawsuit concludes favourably and the token regains its previous high of $3.59, the XRP escrow value could surge to $150 billion, potentially driving Ripple&#8217;s stock price even higher. She further expressed her belief in Ripple’s potential to achieve a half-trillion-dollar valuation, considering the successes of companies like Nvidia and Apple.</p>



<p>Ripple has previously expressed its desire to go public. In May 2022, CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated during a conference in Davos that Ripple would explore the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO) once the ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reached its conclusion. Recently, he expressed his belief in the case <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-boss-confident-groundbreaking-verdict-is-coming-in-weeks-after-hinman-speech-docs-win/">concluding in weeks</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, according to Eleanor Terrett, a Fox Business reporter, the blockchain firm reportedly conducted a successful private &#8220;roadshow&#8221; in April to meet with potential investors ahead of its IPO. Terrett tweeted on Thursday that the event was attended by numerous respected institutional investment firms on Wall Street, indicating strong interest in Ripple&#8217;s offering.</p>



<p>That said, as the lawsuit nears its end, a win for Ripple could have far-reaching implications for the firm and the broader cryptocurrency market. It could also enable the company to go public, increasing its popularity and potentially pushing the value of XRP to the long-awaited milestone of $10.</p>

<p>According to the “2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report”, 139.3 million cryptojacking attempts were recorded in 2022 compared to 97.1 million in 2021, a 43% year-over-year increase. The observed attack volumes exceeded the 100-million mark for the first time. The report stated that cryptojacking volume increased in North America, Asia, and Europe. However, the Latin America region recorded a 66% drop year-over-year.</p>



<p>Despite skyrocketing attack volumes in Europe, the United States (U.S.) remained the country with the highest volume with cryptojacking attempts rising 41% year over year. Retail had the highest total cryptojacking attack volumes by industry, followed by Education, Finance, Healthcare, and Government.</p>



<p>In cryptojacking, attackers gain access to the victim’s computer or mobile device’s computing power and use them for cryptocurrency mining without the knowledge and authorization of the victim.</p>



<p>Cryptojacking attacks have occurred across various industries. Launched in 2017, Coinhive allowed website owners to embed JavaScript code onto their websites, thereby using the website visitor&#8217;s computer to mine the cryptocurrency, Monero.</p>



<p>In another cryptojacking incident, researchers at the cloud monitoring and defence firm RedLock reported that Tesla’s cloud system had been cryptojacked in February 2018 after hackers exploited a password vulnerability to mine cryptocurrency. Tesla said that the data exposure was minimal and quickly addressed the vulnerability.</p>



<p>In 2018, a cryptojacking code was discovered on the Los Angeles Times Homicide Report page. The code used minimal computing power such that users could not easily detect when their devices were used to mine the Monero cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>In 2018, a European water utility control system was cryptojacked and used to generate the Monero cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>As per the 2022 SonicWall’s Threat Mindset survey, 66% of organizations were more concerned about cyberattacks in 2022 than in previous years. 29% of organizations reported that they have roughly the same amount of concern about attacks as they did in 2021, with only 5% reporting as being less concerned.</p>



<p>Respondents ranked Ransomware (91%) as the top cyber attack concern. Other concerns by the respondents were; Phishing and spear-phishing (76%), Encrypted malware (66%), File-less attacks (39%), Memory-based malware (24%), Cryptojacking (23%), IoT malware (22%), and Side-channel attacks (18%).</p>



<p>Sonicwall recommends the following to detect and prevent cryptojacking in your organization: Keeping computers and web browsers up to date, using reputable anti-malware software, regularly updating antivirus and security software on all devices, and educating users to be cautious when opening emails and attachments.</p>



<p>Further recommendations from SonicWall to detect cryptojacking include preventing unauthorized downloads, using ad blockers, using zero-day protection, Implementing strong authentication, protecting cloud resources, and using anti-bot protection to help prevent malware from spreading to a computer or network.</p>

<p>Scammers hijacked the Twitter account of OpenAI CTO Mira Murati to promote a crypto scam. The account was found promoting a fake cryptocurrency airdrop claimed to be conducted by OpenAI, the company behind the popular AI tool, ChatGPT.</p>



<p>A phishing link to a scam airdrop of the purported OPENAI token was live on the account for about an hour before it was taken down. The verified Twitter account asked its over 126,000 followers to send ETH to a designated address in exchange for the non-existent OPENAI token.</p>



<p>Indeed, there is a crypto token known as OpenAI ERC, but it is a token linked to a free-to-use telegram bot that provides users access to ChatGTP and DALL-E via chat commands. It is not linked to OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT.</p>



<p>As expected, the tweet got significant traction, with almost 80,000 views and 83 retweets, while no one was allowed to comment. Blockchain security firm, Beosin told Cointelegraph that the hackers used a crypto wallet-draining kit that could drain non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and ERC-20 tokens from any wallet that authorizes it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there was no evidence that any of her followers fell for the scam at the point of recovering the account, but it is hard to tell since no comments were allowed for any victim to warn others.</p>



<p>This is just one of many Twitter hack incidents this year in which hackers used the accounts of prominent people with large followings to promote their crypto scams. The governor of Madhya Pradesh, an Indian state, suffered a similar attack on his official Twitter account earlier this year, alongside other top public figures, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.</p>



<p>It appears such attacks usually target communities of projects that are either popular or bullish. Most attacks initially targeted the Ripple community at the beginning of the year when XRP rallied to new levels, and now OpenAI since ChatGPT has become a household name.</p>



<p>To avoid being a victim, take your time to verify from reliable sources before engaging in any such offers, ideally published on official websites. Also, try to report suspicious offers like this one, as some accounts did on Twitter, which helped to get the attention of the account owner, who could have been the victim of a sim swap attack.</p>

<p>Top crypto trading platform Crypto.com has received what it describes as a major Payment Institution (MPI) License from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. In a blog post on 1 June, the exchange said the license is for Digital Payment Token (DPT) services.</p>



<p>The platform will now continue to extend its Digital Payment Token (DPT) services to customers in Singapore, where it has its global headquarters.</p>



<p><em>“The Monetary Authority of Singapore is recognized globally as a regulator that ensures responsible innovation of the digital assets sector,” said Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com.</em></p>



<p><em>“We are proud to receive the license from a regulator prioritising consumer protection, safety, and security. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with MAS and leading at the forefront of crypto in our home market of Singapore,” he added.</em></p>



<p>Crypto.com is a crypto exchange known for its strict compliance with the regulatory standards of the countries where it operates. It has over 80 million users worldwide, who enjoy the high security and privacy that the platform provides.</p>



<p>The company’s primary aim is to make financial services available to all by facilitating crypto adoption, and this license is a big step towards achieving this. MAS issued an in-principle or preliminary license in June last year but is giving a full license to the crypto giant this time.</p>



<p>Indeed, Singapore has been a crypto hub over the years, and this license further demonstrates its commitment to the industry.</p>



<p><em>“Singapore continues to be a hub for blockchain and fintech innovation. The Major Payment Institution license underscores our ongoing commitment to build with the Web3 community in Singapore,” said Chin Tah Ang, General Manager of Singapore of Crypto.com.</em></p>



<p>Crypto.com has a number of other licenses it secured before now. It had in November 2022 obtained a Major Payment Institution license for e-money issuance, account issuance, cross border and domestic money transfer services from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>



<p>Similarly, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) in France licensed the company as a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) in September 2022. It also has business licenses from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), to name a few.</p>

<ul>
<li>Russia terminates plans to launch a state-owned digital asset exchange with plans to back private investors.</li>



<li>According to authorities, the rules will be a model for the entire industry to facilitate cross-border payments amongst others.</li>



<li>Experts weigh in on the Kremlin’s stance on digital assets amid financial restrictions by the EU and other international organizations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Russia has long been criticized for its mixed signals towards digital assets. However, this could change soon as the news of backing private exchanges marks a new dawn for the country’s relationship with cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Russian lawmakers plan to cease the formation of government-owned cryptocurrency exchanges with talks of introducing a new regulation template for private firms. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/wublockchain/status/1663188043178844162?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">reports</a>, the country will move forward with a broad regulatory framework to be monitored by the Central Bank.</p>



<p>Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the lower House Committee on Financial Markets, stated that private firms would be encouraged to facilitate cross-border payments subject to certain restrictions that the government will impose.</p>



<p>“<em>Instead of creating one national crypto exchange, it is planned to establish rules for the establishment and operation of such infrastructures,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throwing more light on the government’s position, Ivan Chebeskov, the Director of Financial Policy in the Ministry of Finance, stated that “<em>The Ministry did not support the establishment of one national crypto-exchange. The idea, instead, is to legally regulate the possibility of creating such sites by business.”</em></p>



<p>Industry experts have hailed the move describing it as a step in the right direction. Olieg Ogienko, the founder of BitRiver, said that the move will help cushion the risk of sanctions and cyber attacks on crypto infrastructure and eliminate monopolies. Similarly, GIS Mining boss Ivan Gostev added,</p>



<p>“<em>It would allow for more competitive and innovative companies to develop</em>.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-russia-s-move-to-digital-assets"><strong>Russia&#8217;s move to digital assets</strong></h2>



<p>Mixed signals have plagued Russia’s relationship with cryptocurrencies for years, beginning with the government’s desire for total fiscal control. Last year, the Bank of Russia announced plans for an outright ban of Bitcoin payments before the Ministry of Finance proposed a deal for crypto regulation.</p>



<p>Months later, President Vladimir Putin signed a law prohibiting digital asset payments citing risk and economic sabotage. Sanctions imposed on Russia due to the Ukraine invasion led to the country <a href="https://zycrypto.com/russia-turns-to-stablecoins-in-droves-as-sanctions-bite-even-harder/">exploring</a> stablecoins to bypass financial restrictions. </p>



<p>This new move will strengthen the country’s position as a virtual currency-friendly country. In 2020, Russia was ranked #2 in terms of digital asset adoption, with 12% of the country&#8217;s population owning crypto.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin Miladys rolls out a “bridge” that lets Ethereum NFT users migrate to the Bitcoin Network through Ordinals.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The process automatically destroys the original NFT on Ethereum when transferred, earning the tag “<em>a one-way trip”&nbsp;</em></li>



<li>The move puts BTC enthusiasts in a frenzy as they count on the benefits of having sought-after Ethereum NFTs on their network.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Six months after its launch and with over 10 million inscriptions, Ordinals is paving the way for top developers looking to integrate the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem with the cryptoverse.</p>



<p>The developers behind Bitcoin Miladys have announced the possibility of Ethereum non-fungible token (NFT) holders transferring their assets to the Bitcoin Network. Still, there is a little caveat, the Ethereum copy gets permanently destroyed.</p>



<p>The project was launched in partnership with Xverse Bitcoin Wallet, and Ordinals Market leverages a burn and mint process to move assets between both networks. The BRC- 721E token standard bridge, as it is fondly called, sends the Ethereum NFTs to a burn address, making it completely inaccessible to the holder after it is destroyed. The token is then re-created on Bitcoin through Ordinals. </p>



<p>Several cross-chain bridges act as escrow platforms that hold user tokens even after minting secondary tokens on another network. If the user wants to reclaim the primary asset in the future, the secondary asset is burned.</p>



<p>Although more beneficial to users, this escrow process is not compatible with the BRC-721E process as it is only a one-way trip. This process can lead to issues for NFT holders, including loss of assets if not implemented properly. A similar issue occurred earlier this year when a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) holder burned his NFT on Ethereum and tried to mint it on Bitcoin. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-community-laud-btc-ordinals-development"><strong>Community laud BTC Ordinals&#8217; development</strong></h2>



<p>Earlier this year, there were endless debates on the utilities of Ordinals to the Bitcoin Network. While many saw it as an opportunity to bolster an upward momentum, others felt the network should be left as it was without “<em>worthless tokens.”</em></p>



<p>Recent events may have proved doubters wrong as users now BTC Ordinals have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ordinals-attract-ethereum-devs-to-bitcoin-as-projects-mass-adoption-skyrockets/">ignited</a> forces even outside the network to create tools for its expansion. The BRC-721E projects can swing millions into the Bitcoin ecosystem and place it in direct competition with Ethereum and Solana.</p>



<p>The project which enables immutable and verified Ethereum NFTs to Bitcoin has been described as “<em>the turning point.” </em>The project works with all Ethereum NFTs and is not limited to Miladys, according to the Ordinal Market page.</p>

<ul>
<li>Apple will kick off its metaverse push with a mixed-reality headset. </li>



<li>The technology giant is developing RealityOs software to complement its high-end hardware in creating the perfect metaverse solution.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Meta is on its way to roll out a cheaper headset with more compatibility (Quest 3), setting the stage for a big tech rivalry. </li>
</ul>



<p>The battle for the ideal metaverse platform enters top gear, with Meta and Apple leading the quest to create the perfect augmented reality experience despite a few roadblocks.</p>



<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-29/when-is-wwdc-2023-when-will-apple-announce-mixed-reality-headset-june-5">report</a>, Apple will launch its first virtual reality headset on June 5 at the company’s WWDC conference. The much-anticipated headset is termed a mixed reality headset because it offers both argument reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) functionalities, although AR-specific hardware will be released subsequently.</p>



<p>Apple began planning its foray into the metaverse in 2015 and is currently on track to release multiple gaming experiences for its users. Based on its previous trademark filings, the high-end headset is reportedly called the Reality Pro or Reality One. </p>



<p>The Apple headset is expected to have two Micro OLED screens with a detailed 8K resolution which internal cameras will boost. Apple plans to erase criticisms heaped on Metaverse platforms for spending billions of dollars while delivering poor quality graphics and overall user experience.</p>



<p>The team also deployed the popular M2 processor from the company’s MacBook, including sensors that can recreate and detect user leg movements, a feature its rival Meta is yet to get a hang on. Furthermore, retina scanners will be incorporated for extra biometric security during logins and will be used for payments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meta-vs-apple-battle-for-the-metaverse"><strong>Meta vs Apple: Battle for the metaverse</strong></h2>



<p>Meta has more metaverse buzz around it, with its founder Mark Zuckerberg backing the creation despite losses encountered so far. Apple’s Tim Cook is very bullish on Augmented Reality, stressing the use cases it can bring to the real world.</p>



<p>“<em>I think AR is a profound technology that will affect everything. Imagine suddenly being able to teach with AR and demonstrate things that way. Or medically, and so on. Like I said, we are going to look back and think about how we once lived without AR,” </em>he stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Analyzing the business model of both companies, one can predict that Meta will offer more interoperability than Apple because of the former’s “wall garden” approach to products. Zuckerberg has also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/mark-zuckerberg-reiterates-metas-plan-for-an-open-interoperable-metaverse-heres-how/">noted</a> that an “<em>open and interoperable metaverse is better for everyone.”</em></p>



<p>Most observers expect Apple to beat Meta in terms of graphics and user interaction, a feature that Meta has struggled with in past releases. Meta has announced the launch of Quest 3, a cheaper headset many view as a direct response to Apple’s planned release.</p>

<ul>
<li>Coinbase has unveiled plans to introduce Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts for institutional investors on June 5.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The institutional-sized futures contracts will be sized at 10 ETH and 1 BTC to reduce risk in the market.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Coinbase’s push for regulatory clarity takes center stage around crypto circles as the exchange seeks to release more products for users.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The United States leading digital asset Coinbase has announced its plans to launch institutional Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures trading contracts on its derivatives exchange on June 5.</p>



<p>The product, which will <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-will-launch-institutional-sized-bitcoin-and">launch</a> on the Commodity and  Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) regulated derivatives exchange, will be sized at 1BTC and 10 ETH to help investors manage exposures. In its release, the exchange noted that this service would help investors “<em>target attractive returns” </em>for lower fees.</p>



<p>Coinbase Bitcoin (BTI) and Coinbase Ethereum (ETI) futures contracts will both be available to investors through regulated futures commission merchants (FCMs) and other associated brokers. The exchange also announced additional incentive programs for institutions that participate in the contracts.</p>



<p>The future trading contracts were borne out of popular demand as a result of its past products. The exchange introduced nano Bitcoin (BT) and Ethereum (ET) contracts and recorded a massive spike in institutional demand for advanced derivatives products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company reiterated its commitment to creating a secure and transparent trading system with the necessary tools to make participants successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>”<em>Introducing institutional-sized contracts marks another milestone in our ongoing mission to provide accessible and cutting-edge financial instruments to market participants and underscores our dedication to solutions tailored to the needs of institutional clients,” </em>the statement reads.</p>



<p>On May 2, Coinbase announced its plans to open a derivatives exchange in Bermuda in its international expansion plan and will let users trade perpetual future contracts with 5X leverage. Per the announcement, all trades will be settled in USDC stablecoin as it seeks to balance and value for participants.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-march-on-amid-regulatory-uncertainty">Coinbase march on amid regulatory uncertainty</h2>



<p>Coinbase has restated its commitment to comply with regulatory practices across jurisdictions as it continues its international expansion. The announcement of futures trading contracts comes with the exchange seeking regulatory clarity from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission in its reply to Coinbase&#8217;s writ of mandamus stated that the rulemaking process could stretch into many years but will continue to employ enforcement actions to bring clarity to the sector. The SEC also added that public statements do not constitute guidance or policy statements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While regulations in the United States remain unclear, Coinbase continues its global push as it seeks to fight for a higher market share with competitors.</p>

<p>The Russian bank Rosbank has become the first <a href="https://zycrypto.com/russian-banking-giant-sber-adds-ethereum-and-metamask-support/">biggest bank</a> in the country to launch cross-border cryptocurrency payments, with the help of an intermediary fintech to carry out the transactions.</p>



<p>According to Vedomosti, a representative of Rosbank it was stated that the bank is already conducting tests with corporate and private clients. The new solution allows the purchase of cryptocurrencies abroad using the funds of the importer, which are then transferred to the foreign provider.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rosbank-joins-forces-with-b-crypto-to-launch-new-services"><strong>Rosbank joins forces with B-crypto to launch new services</strong></h2>



<p>The Russian fintech company B-crypto is responsible for providing technical support for cryptocurrency transactions. Therefore, all Russian companies must go through a verification or KYC process that needs to be approved by both Rosbank and B-crypto in order to utilize the new cryptocurrency service.</p>



<p>Once the KYC verifications are approved, the importer and B-crypto sign a contract in which the client agrees to deposit fiat funds into an account at Rosbank to purchase cryptocurrencies. Subsequently, the bank transfers the money to B-crypto, which handles cryptocurrency purchases in friendly countries and transfers them to the foreign provider.</p>



<p>Alexei Voilukov, Vice President of the Russian Banks Association, affirmed that while Rosbank is the first major bank to offer this solution, larger banks still do not provide similar services &#8220;due to the lack of cryptocurrency liquidity&#8221; required to cater to their larger clients.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s where smaller banks come in to meet the needs of retail customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sanctioned countries embrace cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions</strong></h2>



<p>Eduard Davydov, Senior Partner at Emet Law Firm, stated that using cryptocurrencies in cross-border transfers may raise concerns regarding sanctions evasion, as many countries are taking measures to include cryptocurrency transactions in their sanction regimes.</p>



<p>In the long run, using cryptocurrencies for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/russia-to-legalize-crypto-for-cross-border-settlements/">cross-border payments</a> could lead to legal consequences for participating countries attempting to evade sanctions using cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, for a country under sanctions, legalities might not be their most pressing issue. Numerous such nations, including Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/russia-turns-to-stablecoins-in-droves-as-sanctions-bite-even-harder/">Russia</a>, find themselves denied the liberty to trade their primary commodities freely.</p>



<p>Currently, Russia is the most heavily sanctioned country in the world following the invasion of Ukraine, accumulating over 13,263 sanctions, mostly from the US and Switzerland, according to Castellum data.</p>
