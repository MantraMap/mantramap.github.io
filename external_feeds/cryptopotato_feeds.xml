			            <description><![CDATA[Logan Paul, a multifaceted entertainer and crypto enthusiast, has received criticism from various quarters regarding his recent $1m bet proposition.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Logan Paul is gearing up for his next event, a boxing match against Brazilian Dillon Danis scheduled for October 14 in Manchester, England.</p>
<p>Danis, widely recognized as an MMA fighter and Conor McGregor&#8217;s training partner, will be coached by the Irishman for the upcoming fight.</p>

<p>Upon learning about this, Paul launched an explicit rant, accompanied by insults, while offering a one million dollar bet on the match.</p>
<h2>Logan Paul Faces Criticism</h2>
<p>This move has drawn heavy criticism from the crypto community, mainly due to Paul&#8217;s failure to reimburse victims of his CryptoZoo (ZOO) project.</p>
<p>Launched in 2021, CryptoZoo promised a cryptocurrency game featuring the ZOO token and NFTs. Despite initial hype during the bull market, the project has failed to meet expectations. Earlier this year, Paul <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/change-of-heart-logan-paul-apologizes-to-coffeezilla-amidst-fallout-over-nft-project/" data-wpel-link="internal">pledged</a> to rectify the situation for affected investors, but this has yet to materialize. He is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/logan-paul-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-alleged-cryptozoo-nft-rug-pull/" data-wpel-link="internal">facing</a> a class-action lawsuit associated with regard to the above.</p>
<p>Consequently, his willingness to wager $1 million on a match outcome has left many unamused. In response to Paul&#8217;s outburst, Danis took to Twitter, highlighting that Paul may have money to bet, but has failed to pay off those he scammed.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Kusama has confirmed that Shibarium is nearly complete, while also revealing another important partnership.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu has shared yet another announcement with its community.</p>
<p>The ecosystem&#8217;s marketing strategist took it to Twitter (now known as X) to reveal that the SHIB Doggy DAO has partnered with a leading digital asset advisory and investment firm.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266593" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266593" style="width: 537px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-266593 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img.jpg" alt="shiba_inu_img" width="537" height="429" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img.jpg 537w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img-300x240.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img-50x40.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266593" class="wp-caption-text">Source: X</figcaption></figure>
<h2>SHIB Doggy DAO Shakes Hands with ATH</h2>
<p>The new partnership is struck between Alpha Transform Holdings (ATH) and SHIB Doggy DAO. The latter is the decentralized autonomous organization that&#8217;s governed by holders of the SHIB token and funds the projects that are now built on Shibarium.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ATH is a digital asset advisory and investment firm that&#8217;s comprised of a team of veteran leaders from heavyweights like Nasdaq, News Crop, and Disney and has advised projects like Tether and even Ethereum, per the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/14/2724869/0/en/Alpha-Transform-Holdings-Joins-SHIB-Doggy-DAO-Foundation-as-Advisor.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
<p>Commenting on the matter was Chief Investment Officer and CEO at Alpha Transform Holdings, Enzo Villani, who said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“SHIB continues the incredible trajectory. Shibarium has already seen great momentum. With over 21 million wallets and over 250,000 smart contracts written to their Layer 2 blockchain testnet, there are many brands in entertainment, media, and finance that will be interested in engaging with this vibrant community.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Shibarium Nearly Complete</h2>
<p>In a comment on the partnership, the lead developer behind the Shiba Inu ecosystem &#8211; Shytoshi Kusama &#8211; said that Shibarium is &#8220;nearly complete.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now that Shibarium is nearly complete, and our full structure placed at the feet of the world, we couldn&#8217;t ask for a better partner to help shepherd this next phase of the Shiba global phenomenon. [&#8230;] We look forward to Alpha Transform helping our Foundation swiftly and effectively chart the best course possible for the future of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The SHIB price hasn&#8217;t yet reacted to the news, trading 2% down in the past 24 hours but 11% up for the day, following an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shib-rallies-14-weekly-but-warning-signs-flash-3-things-to-watch-this-week-shiba-inu-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">impressive weekly rally.</a></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prime Trust &#8211; a once-leading cryptocurrency custodian &#8211; filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware approximately two months after the Nevada Financial Institutions Division claimed it operates in an &#8220;unsafe and unsound manner.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company was among the leaders in its field a few years ago, holding funds on behalf of other fallen behemoths such as FTX and Celsius Network.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Latest to Go Bankrupt</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the firm&#8217;s </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/X274/12452/PLEADINGS/1245208152380000000024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, its estimated liabilities (on a consolidated basis) range from $100 million to $500 million, while the number of creditors is up to 50,000.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite being based in Las Vegas, Nevada, Prime Trust filed for bankruptcy protection in the district of Delaware since it had its domicile, principal place of business, or principal assets in this region for 180 days prior to the date of the petition.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency custodian had regulatory issues with the Nevada watchdogs in June when they issued a cease and desist order, claiming the firm had major liquidity cracks and could not honor clients&#8217; withdrawal requests. Shortly after, the Nevada Financial Institutions Division </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/prime-trust-placed-in-receivership-by-nevadas-regulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a petition to place Prime Trust in receivership.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;With consideration of the above, Prime is in an unsafe financial condition and/or is insolvent. Additionally, Prime&#8217;s condition will only progressively worsen as customers continue to withdraw from Prime,&#8221; the agency maintained at the time.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The regulator estimated that the crypto firm owed more than $85 million in fiat currency to customers but had only $2.9 million. It also had $69.5 million worth of cryptocurrency debt, while its digital asset holdings equaled $68.6 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prime Trust was once an industry leader, storing assets and providing services to the defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the crypto lender Celsius Network. Both firms filed for bankruptcy last year, adding their names to the long list of entities that collapsed amid the prolonged bear market or some alleged fraudulent actions.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">SHIB appears at a crossroad as the price is quickly losing its bullish momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.000010; $0.000094</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.000012 </strong></p>
<h2>1. Rejection under Key Resistance</h2>
<p>The rally continued until Sunday when the price started to fall. This is the first time in over a week when sellers showed strength and were able to stop the rally. If this continues, then SHIB may enter a correction.</p>

<h2>2. Bearish Divergence</h2>
<p>The daily RSI is showing a clear bearish divergence. The price made a higher high, while the RSI momentum indicator made a lower high. This shows that bulls are starting to lose control over the price.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266541" style="width: 2447px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266541" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04" width="2447" height="1199" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04.png 2447w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-1024x502.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-768x376.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-1536x753.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-2048x1003.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2447px) 100vw, 2447px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266541" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. Momentum Shifting Bearish?</h2>
<p>Similarly to the RSI, the MACD histogram has been making lower highs for four days. This is a clear warning sign that momentum may soon change if buyers don&#8217;t return soon.</p>
<p>While a bearish cross is still some distance away, this price action may encourage sellers to step up their pressure.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for SHIB is neutral.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for SHIB Price</h2>
<p>Even if a correction unfolds this week, SHIB has good support at $0.000010 and $0.000094. Only if these levels fail to hold would the price action turn bearish. The resistance remains at $0.000012.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[In response to the upcoming event, miners have shifted from a selling spree that began in August 2022 to the recent accumulation trend.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On-chain data analyzed by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex shows that bitcoin (BTC) miners have entered an accumulation phase in preparation for the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 2024.</p>
<p>According to the latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report, the miner reserve metric <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitfinex-Alpha-67-1.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">indicates</a> a significant accumulation trend from May 27, 2023, which has increased since bitcoin&#8217;s recent downturn from the $30,000 price level.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Miners Accumulate BTC</h2>
<p>The bitcoin halving, which <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/breakdown-of-btcs-price-performance-after-previous-halvings-will-history-repeat/" data-wpel-link="internal">occurs</a> every four years or after 210,000 blocks, is a mechanism that slashes the network&#8217;s miners&#8217; rewards by half to reduce the speed at which new BTC is created and possibly increase the asset&#8217;s value. The upcoming one is the fourth since BTC&#8217;s inception and is expected to reduce the network&#8217;s rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.</p>
<p>In response to the upcoming event, miners have shifted from a selling spree that began in August 2022 to the recent accumulation trend. Bitfinex found that July recorded restrained on-chain BTC outflows with a sudden increase towards its end. The exchange noted that the move was &#8220;likely a protective measure against potential resistance against buyers.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/whats-the-cost-to-mine-1-btc-for-top-bitcoin-miners-bernstein-clarifies/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin mining firms</a> have enhanced liquidity positions, reducing their tendency to sell more BTC. This can be attributed to the surge in their stock prices following the buzz around BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With their strong financial reserves, the miners can expand their mining equipment and handle potential price downturns.</p>
<h2>Institutional Crypto Investors Apply Caution</h2>
<p>As bitcoin miners increase their holdings, institutional crypto investors are applying caution to their investments. Bitfinex said this is because the broader market is &#8220;languid,&#8221; and trading volumes have slumped by 62% year-to-date.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Volatility indicators show that we are in for quieter times overall. Bitcoin&#8217;s historical metrics seem to be settling, pointing towards an impending stabilization in market swings, with traders indicating a balanced market,&#8221; the exchange said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, bitcoin funds continue to see large outflows, while institutional investors have stopped shorting BTC via investment products for the first time in 14 weeks. The movement of funds aligns with investors locking in their profits.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The overall behavior of institutional investors has been reflective of a cautious investment strategy into crypto assets and increasing profit-taking in the wake of a languid summer trading season,&#8221; Bitfinex added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, several altcoins, including Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, have registered positive cash inflows.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a token that&#8217;s closely related to the Shiba Inu ecosystem has been making headlines. The cryptocurrency in question is called BAD, and it&#8217;s short for Blockchain + AI + DAO.</p>
<p>Throughout the past 24 hours alone, BAD&#8217;s price is up 20%, bringing its total monthly gains up to around 440%. But why?</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266519" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg" alt="bad_shib_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu and Bad Idea: What&#8217;s the Relationship?</h2>
<p>Right off the bad, it&#8217;s important to note that BAD is a token that brings forward a decentralized experiment, seeking to combine Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-dao/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</a> in a &#8220;risky, meme-worth concoction.&#8221;</p>
<p>In essence, the planning of the project, as well as other tasks, are handed to the community.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also been a notable relationship between BAD and Shiba Inu. Earlier in August, the lead developer of SHIB &#8211; Shytoshi Kusama &#8211; pointed out how he sees the partnership going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>BAD has more to do with our next phase than just a silly voice in a keynote. It&#8217;s about being thought leaders in a world of copycats.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Why is BAD Price Pumping?</h2>
<p>BAD&#8217;s been on a roll during the last 30 days, as the cryptocurrency has surged by more than 440% throughout the period.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266517" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266517" style="width: 689px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266517" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-15 135321" width="689" height="463" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321.jpg 689w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321-300x202.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266517" class="wp-caption-text">BAD Price. Source: CoinGecko</figcaption></figure>
<p>As it can be seen in the chart above, the surge started more or less when Kusama posted about the long-term plans of Shiba Inu, including Bad Idea.</p>
<p>Moreover, Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing strategist, Lucie, has also recently highlighted the partnership between both projects, pushing the community to vote in favor of a free audit for BAD through CertiK.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the US SEC continues to reject or delay, at best, all spot Bitcoin ETF applications, such a product has seen the light of day in Europe.</p>
<p>Called the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF, it will be the first similar product compliant with SFDR Article 8 through its decarbonization strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230815404630/en/Jacobi-Asset-Management-lists-Europe" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">press release</a> dated August 15 informs that the spot Bitcoin ETF will be the brainchild of Jacobi Asset Management and Wilshire Indexes. It will be under the ticker BCOIN and has already been listed on Euronext Amsterdam.</li>

<li>Spot Bitcoin ETFs have launched in a couple of other countries in the past few years, including Brazil and Canada. However, the US securities watchdog &#8211; the SEC &#8211; continues to reject all applications for such a product.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, the landscape can change soon as the world&#8217;s largest asset manager &#8211; BlackRock &#8211; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrocks-etf-success-rate-with-the-sec-is-575-to-1-what-about-its-bitcoin-application/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> for a spot Bitcoin ETF in mid-June.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has gained significant popularity recently due to its fast transaction speed and low cost.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transactions on the XRPL are processed within seconds and at a fraction of a penny, making it an efficient and cost-effective platform for payments, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA).</p>
<p>A recent study <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/xrp/markets/BTC" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">conducted</a> by CryptoCompare revealed that XRPL is the fastest and most cost-effective blockchain network for payments.</p>
<p>The study found that XRPL transactions were processed in an average of just 3.3 seconds, with a transaction cost of only $0.00003. This represents a significant improvement compared to BTC, ETH, and ADA, which have average transaction times of 10 minutes, 15 seconds, and 20 seconds, respectively.</p>
<h2>XRP’S Scalability and Mechanism</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the study highlighted the scalability of XRPL compared to BTC, ETH, and ADA. While BTC, ETH, and ADA can only handle 7 transactions per second, 15 transactions per second, and 100 transactions per second, respectively, the XRPL can process up to 1,500 transactions per second.</p>
<p>Unlike BTC, which relies on energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, the XRPL utilizes a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>This not only contributes to its speed, cost-efficiency, and scalability but also makes <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/two-things-to-watch-for-in-ripple-xrp-price-this-week-volatility-ahead/" data-wpel-link="internal">XRPL</a> a more sustainable choice for businesses seeking fast and affordable payment solutions.</p>
<p>Overall, the attributes of the XRP Ledger position it as an attractive platform for payments, surpassing BTC, ETH, and ADA in terms of speed, cost-efficiency, and scalability, and it offers a more environmentally conscious alternative.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s also the other side of the argument &#8211; decentralization. Unlike Bitcoin&#8217;s distributed ledger, which relies on open-source technology developed and maintained by hundreds of independent developers and runs on tens of thousands of nodes across the world, XRP remains a largely centralized solution operated by a single entity &#8211; Ripple Labs.</p>
