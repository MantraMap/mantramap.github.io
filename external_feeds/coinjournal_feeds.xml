<li>Dutch Central Bank announces a $3.6 million fine on Coinbase.</li>
<li>It says the crypto exchange has been in a regulatory violation.</li>
<li>Shares of Coinbase Global Inc ended roughly flat on Thursday.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coinbase Global Inc seems to be up for another regulatory fine.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Dutch Central Bank forced a $3.60 million penalty on the cryptocurrency exchange for failing to comply with the domestic regulations.</p>
<h2>What regulation did Coinbase not comply with?</h2>
<p>In May 2020, Netherlands made it mandatory for businesses wanting to launch crypto-related services to register with the DNB first.</p>
<p>But Coinbase, as per the central bank, did not go through such a registration and, therefore, was in regulatory violation for nearly two years; between November 2020 and August 2022. The DNB said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase has enjoyed a competitive advantage in that it has not paid any supervisory fees to DNB or incurred other costs in connection with DNB&rsquo;s regular supervision activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last year, the regulator had hit its peer <a href="https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/financial-stability/7951006/dnb-fines-binance-for-grave-regulatory-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> with a $3.35 million fine as well.</p>
<h2>Coinbase recently settled with the NYDFS as well</h2>
<p>According to the Dutch Central Bank, the said non-compliance might have made the Financial Intelligence Unit miss a bunch of suspicious transactions through September of 2022.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Coinbase can appeal the penalty until March 2<sup>nd</sup>. Earlier in January, it signed a $100 million <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-financial-regulator-notches-100-million-settlement-with-coinbase-11672878334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settlement</a> with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as well.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev warned of a potential 40% downside in Coinbase stock (as Coin Journal reported <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinbase-stock-could-tank-40-from-here-mizuho/">HERE</a>) that ended roughly flat on Thursday.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the crypto company to report a $2.39 per share loss in its current quarter. A year ago, it had $3.32 of EPS instead.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Aave holders approve major technical upgrade dubbed Aave Ethereum V3.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The vote results showed a total of 706,258 AAVE, or 100% support.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Aave Ethereum V3 is set for activation following the governance vote.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/aave/">Aave</a> community has approved an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP), a governance proposal seeking to activate Aave V3 on the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> network.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A total of 706,258 AAVE was staked as 100% of the vote supported the technical upgrade, which will also list WBTC, WETH, wstETH, USD Coin (USDC), DAI, LINK, and AAVE. The community had already pre-approved the tokens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>The community has spoken and we have the light to deploy Aave Protocol V3 on Ethereum Mainnet. More details to come tomorrow</em>,&rdquo; the Aave team <a href="https://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1618584316401025076" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The proposal was created on 22 January 2023, while voting started a day later and ended on 26 January 2023 at 05:48 UTC +03:00 (Block height 16488207). Currently, the proposal is shown as &ldquo;queued&rdquo; on the Aave <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=147" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, with details that this can be executed within 12 hours.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Aave V3 already deployed on other major chains</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Aave V3 is a highly anticipated upgrade set for the Ethereum mainnet,with the improvement proposal following the decision to have V3 deployed afresh instead of a software update to the existing V2 pool.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notably, AAVE V3 is already live on various major networks, having deployed in March on 2022 on Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon. But while V3 introduced architecture flexibility and improved composability, the same features did not go live on Aave&rsquo;s largest market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, Ethereum accounts for over $5 billion in total value locked (TVL) on Aave&rsquo;s V2 protocol.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The upcoming upgrade will increase compatibility across V3 pools and reduce general complexity, the AIP read.</p>

<li dir="ltr">SEC has denied the Ark Investment and 21 Shares joint spot Bitcoin ETF application.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The agency says proposal failed to meet requirements as per securities laws, citing fraud and manipulative practices once again.</li>
<li dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s the second time the SEC has rejected an ETF proposal by the two firms, after denying the first one in April last year.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has disapproved a proposal seeking to list a spot <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> exchange-traded fund (<a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/exchange-traded-fund-etf/">ETF</a>) for the US market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2023/34-96751.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">document</a> published on Thursday, the US securities market watchdog said it had rejected the application by Cathie Wood&rsquo;s Ark Investment and Swiss cryptocurrency investment firm 21Shares.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Ark 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF had been proposed for listing on the Cboe BZX Exchange.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SEC denies Ark 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF again</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Commission&rsquo;s order disapproving the two companies&rsquo; ETF application noted that BZX did not &ldquo;<em>demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5)</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Specifically, the exchange failed to demonstrate that it could prevent fraud and other manipulative practices as well as protect those looking to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/invest/">invest</a> in the product.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>The Commission further concludes that BZX has not established that it has a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to spot bitcoin, the underlying bitcoin assets that would be held by the Trust,</em>&rdquo; reads part of the SEC&rsquo;s reasoning for disapproval.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the second time the agency has rejected a spot Bitcoin ETF proposal by Ark Investment Management and 21Shares. The SEC dismissed a similar application in April, a move that prompted the two firms to submit a fresh one last May.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SEC has also disapproved of multiple other spot bitcoin ETF applications, including one by Grayscale Investment, which sought to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a BTC spot ETF. The asset manager filed a lawsuit against the agency following the agency&rsquo;s move in June 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">El Salvador is the first country that recognised Bitcoin as legal tender.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin City has been recognised as a sustainable and highly efficient project.</li>
<li dir="ltr">El Salvador is building the new city in the country&rsquo;s East, with clean energy entirely sourced from nearby volcanoes.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">El Salvador made history when it became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin (<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) as legal tender. The country also announced an ambitious project dubbed &lsquo;Bitcoin City&rsquo; &ndash; a move that continues to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/lugano-switzerland-takes-leaf-out-of-el-salvadors-book/">inspire</a> many other nations and jurisdictions across the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Importantly though, and in one of the many positive news around the El Salvador Bitcoin bet, the eco-friendly project Bitcoin City has just received international recognition.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a <a href="https://www.noticiasdebariloche.com.ar/la-bitcoin-city-de-el-salvador-gana-premio-de-diseno-arquitectonico/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news report</a> by Noticias de Bariloche, Bitcoin City won an award after getting a thumbs up approval from a panel of experts over its architectural design.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The award was given by LOOP, a Costa Rica-based sustainable architecture and design studio. Per the the LOOP Designs Awards 2022 <a href="https://www.loopdesignawards.com/project/bitcoin-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, Bitcoin City was picked as category winner from a pool of 705 submissions from 56 countries.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Volcano-powered Bitcoin city</h2>
<p dir="ltr">EL Salvador&rsquo;s Bitcoin City is a new city project under development in the country&rsquo;s East, and is designed by Fernando Romero Enterprise EE, a Mexico-based design studio. The project features revolutionary urban planning with Bitcoin and nearby volcanoes powering financial investments and everyday activities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two volcanoes (Tecapa and Conchagua) will provide clean energy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>A number of incentives for investors will make this city a reference on how to make a city both efficient and sustainable at the same time</em>,&rdquo; LOOP wrote in a brief description of the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-city-construction-will-take-around-ten-years-says-jan3-ceo/">previously reported</a>, building Bitcoin City is expected to take at least ten years.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">El Salvador proves critics wrong on Bitcoin bet</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On Tuesday, El Salvador president Nayib Bukele slammed international media for their negative reporting on the country since it adopted BTC as legal tender. His comments came as the country repaid in full its $800 million in maturing bonds &ndash; despite Bitcoin price plummeting in 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mainstream media reports had pointed out that El Salvador risked defaulting on the payments if it failed to strike a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). President Bukele slammed the forecasts by &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and rating firms for their &ldquo;lies&rdquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday, El Salvador demonstrated that the big media, the &ldquo;experts&rdquo;, the financial analysts and the credit rating agencies, shamelessly lie to the people, their audiences and their clients.</p>
<p>The next time they say anything, remember that. <a href="https://t.co/Lb2uDPlYxr">https://t.co/Lb2uDPlYxr</a></p>

<li dir="ltr">Toncoin (TON) options went live on the crypto derivatives exchange BIT on Thursday, 26 January.</li>
<li dir="ltr">TON is now the third cryptocurrency available for options trading on BIT, adding to Bitcoin and Ethereum.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The options product will also go live on institutional liquidity network Paradigm in early February.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto derivatives exchange BIT has launched options trading for Toncoin (TON), the cryptocurrency native to The Open Network (TON) ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Options, which is a contract that allows a trader the right to buy or sell an asset, is one of the most popular <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/best-cryptocurrencies-for-trading-crypto-derivatives/">crypto derivatives products</a> in the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to details shared with CoinJournal via a press release on Thursday, trading options for the digital token will also go live on Paradigm in early February. Paradigm is a leading institutional-focused derivatives liquidity network.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BIT adds TON to product suite</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Until BIT&rsquo;s launch of the TON options trading, market participants could only access options pegged on the world&rsquo;s two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap &ndash; Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The product is a result of a partnership between BIT, leading crypto market maker DWF Labs and liquidity provider Darley Technologies,, the BIT team noted in the press release.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the derivatives exchange, the launch of Toncoin options could see the digital token attract more institutional investors and other big money players, offering a low-risk avenue for this group of investors to gain exposure to the market.</p>
<p>Data from CoinGecko shows that TON ranks 23rd among the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. At the time of writing, the Toncoin market cap stood at around $3.5 billion, with the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/toncoin/">price of TON token</a> changing hands near $2.38 and up 6.4% in the past 24 hours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s a rare occasion for a project to come along that looks to have the potential to disrupt a <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-media/video-games/worldwide#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Video%20Games,to%20hit%2034.9%25%20by%202027." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$200 billion</u></a> industry massively. It&rsquo;s even rarer to find that project as a crypto presale, where investors have the chance to acquire tokens at discount prices before the value explodes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is looking like it could be one of those opportunities, with more and more savvy investors quietly flocking to the presale, as shown by the project making an incredible $3.5 million in just 9 weeks.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Metacade?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade has <a href="https://metacade.co/whitepaper.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>laid out</u></a> plans to build an incredible play-to-earn (P2E) arcade in the metaverse, revolutionizing gaming by redistributing gaming industry profits back to the gamers themselves, allowing them to connect with friends and play their favorite gaming titles all in a single, comprehensive gaming community hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This P2E arcade looks set to become the largest across the entirety of the crypto world, which would put Metacade in a pole position to benefit from a huge network effect and capture a huge slice of the growing crypto-gaming space.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How does Metacade work?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade, currently in its crypto presale, is centered around the fantastic P2E arcade but also features a broad set of complementary features. One continuous theme across the platform is rewards, with many opportunities for users to earn tokens for a range of different actions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Users are rewarded not only for playing games in the P2E arcade but also through competitive and tournament gaming, allowing those who enjoy the challenge to take on the community of players for the chance to earn prizes and token rewards. Users who contribute to the platform, through providing alpha or writing game reviews, for example, can also earn rewards which provide an incentivization structure for users to help improve and grow the platform over time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The use of rewards in this way means that the project is likely to see a surge in adoption as its roadmap goes live, building a large amount of momentum for the project and enabling it to reach critical mass very quickly. Once that user base is in place, the project will benefit from the network effect, helping user retention and ensuring ongoing growth of the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project is fuelled by the utility token MCADE, which plays a key role in the functioning of the platform. Not only is MCADE a critical component of the arcade system and entry to the platform for users, but it&rsquo;s effectively the project&rsquo;s currency. Tokens are used for everything from buying merchandise to tournament entry, ensuring that as adoption grows, there is more and more demand for MCADE generated in parallel.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE can also be staked, meaning that holders patient enough to wait for the inevitable price increase over time can also earn a passive income. Temporarily committing their MCADE tokens will support the platform&rsquo;s security and development.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another key innovation is the Metagrants initiative, which provides MCADE holders with the ability to vote on projects pitched to the community by talented game developers. MCADE holders&rsquo; votes determine which projects are funded &ndash; and then released on the platform &ndash; meaning that they have a direct say in the future direction of the platform.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Can MCADE reach $1?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With the extremely high potential that Metacade offers, it won&rsquo;t surprise anyone that there is already talk about just how high the token price for MCADE might go, despite it being in the early stage of its crypto presale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While $1 might sound like a huge increase from the presale prices, if Metacade can secure even just 2% of the $200 billion gaming market as their market cap, the price of MCADE would be $2 &mdash; a staggering 250x on the token price during the beta stage of the presale!</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is Metacade a good investment?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is already shaping up to be a strong candidate for the best coin to invest in during 2023, with an incredible amount of interest in the project due to its potential. Investors looking to get involved will need to act quickly, as the Metacade crypto presale does not look like it will last long. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You can participate in the MCADE presale&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<li dir="ltr">How does a crypto rug pull fraud look like?</li>
<li dir="ltr">The three main types of rug pulls in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Expert tips on how to avoid falling victim to rug pull fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Do you know that a minor rug pull can lead you to bankruptcy? Now, you must be thinking what exactly is rug pull? A rug pull in cryptocurrency refers to the abrupt and deliberate abandonment of a startup by project developers after gaining the trust (read: tokenized funds) of the investors in them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These criminals steal the money and then flee, leaving behind a useless asset they created. In order to entice a community of investors, they make use of the marketing capabilities of social media by launching a buzz-worthy and hype-filled promotional campaign.</p>
<p>Here, malicious code can be used by developers to take advantage of self-executing programs that verify transactions and literally insert traps into a project&rsquo;s code. Rug pulls are quite prevalent among <a href="https://coinjournal.net/research-center/crypto-crime-statistics/">crypto crimes</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis company, con artists stole $2.8 billion, or $7 million per day, in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How does a rug pull crypto fraud look like?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A barren, low-quality website, a guarantee of high returns, and unknown or anonymous project leaders lead this list of red flags.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A startup&rsquo;s homepage may be adorned with lofty objectives that must be accomplished in an unreasonably short amount of time. It also includes suspicious social media activity, buzzwords, and a desperate sense of urgency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though a failed project and a rug pull both ends up in the same place, their paths are very different. Many projects fail despite the best efforts of a team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the most recent data from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 80% of new businesses survive their first year. Startups have a survival rate of half within five years. It is designed to deceive investors for financial gain.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Types of rug pulls&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are two primary types of rug pulls: soft and hard. A hard rug pull happens suddenly and without warning, as the name suggests. Investors are informed that they have been duped and that the project&rsquo;s creators have abandoned it.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">When the numbers fall to zero and all tokens immediately lose value. Rug pulls fall into three categories, regardless of the pace of a hustle: stealing liquidity, restricting sell orders, and dumping&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Liquidity stealing</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The most common type of exit strategy, liquidity stealing, involves token creators stealing all of the coins that were invested in a project or pooled together.. However, if the security system&rsquo;s developers designed it with malicious intent, they can easily breach this safeguard and gain privileged access to the locked funds upon exit.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Restricting sell order</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The native token is completely compromised, and its value drops to zero. Backend fraudsters may alter a project&rsquo;s code to only allow traders to buy into a platform once an exchange has received a significant amount of traffic. In the meantime, all but malicious accounts are prevented from selling the native token, which effectively funds the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/wallets/">wallets</a> of dishonest developers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Dumping</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Virtual honeypots are rug pull strategies that use <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/smart-contract/">smart contract technology</a> to direct money in one direction. Their goal is to entice a large number of crypto investors who are eager to increase the value of a shiny new token that is connected to an emerging trending project.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Developers sell their shares and leave at the right time by lowering the value of the token for the remaining investors who were caught off guard. If you do not wish to become a victim of rug pull then <a href="https://crypto-genisus.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sign up here</a> today. It also leaves us with the next question which is:&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How to avoid rug pulls&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Haupt, who is now the CEO of his own Web3 startup, Bad Astro Society, is paving the way for its 10,000 members to launch into space. He humbly considers the mistakes he made in his early crypto career to be essential learning curves. He was also a victim of rug pulls&mdash;more than he could count. Here are some tips to avoid rug pulls:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Expert tips </h3>
<p dir="ltr">The term &ldquo;crowdfunding,&rdquo; has developed a negative reputation that is sealed in skepticism. This is due to the numerous rug pulls, honeypots, and other schemes that took advantage of the bull market that lasted from 2017 to 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claudiu Minea, a software engineer and project coordinator, hopes to change that with SeedOn, a crowdfunding platform he co-founded that uses a rigorous validation process as an alternative to conventional methods. Minea&rsquo;s best advice is as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Invest in projects whose code has been examined by certified businesses.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before spending any money, it&rsquo;s critical to check out the project team to see if they&rsquo;re up to the task of achieving the company&rsquo;s goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only projects with a fixed amount of liquidity should be taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to boost investor confidence because it means they won&rsquo;t be able to get away with their money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that the project&rsquo;s team is actively involved in the community of its platform.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always include regular updates that transparently discuss the project&rsquo;s progress.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The white paper&rsquo;s definition of a trajectory should be reflected in the results.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion </h2>
<p>It is highly recommended to stay alert and save yourself from these rug pulls. These scams frequently assign membership in Ponzi schemes or make empty promises that are too good to be true. The reach of a platform and the value of its token both increase with sufficient traction. The core development team sells its tokens at the peak of the price, leaving behind the treasury of investor funds. It is important to take precautionary steps to avoid rug pulls.

<li dir="ltr">Cryptpcurrencies, Bitcoin and are altcoins &ndash; what&rsquo;s the difference?&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">What are the different types of altoins?</li>
<li dir="ltr">Ethereum (ETH) and Tether (USDT) &ndash; the two most popular altcoins.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Do you know there are thousands of alternative coins, or altcoins? In the ten years since Bitcoin&rsquo;s genesis block was created, thousands of alternative <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a>, or altcoins, have emerged as a result of blockchain innovation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Altcoins are any coins or tokens that isn&rsquo;t <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>. Altcoins and their respective platforms can be created by anyone with an internet connection because blockchain is open-source. The variety of altcoins is growing.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Needless to say, altcoins have come a long way since Namecoin, the main altcoin, introduced the idea of colored coins that resembled non-fungible tokens, also known as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/non-fungible-token-nft/">NFTs</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Popular altcoins: What exactly are they?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Traditionally, altcoins are created to fill a need that arises from perceived market gaps that Bitcoin does not fill. Each digital asset is created with a specific goal in mind, some of which are similar to one another.</p>
<p><strong>Tokens of use</strong>: Within a network, these offer services like purchasing services, paying network fees, and redeeming rewards.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tokens of payment</strong>: These are exchanged for value in the form of currency.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tokens for security</strong>: The Securities and Exchange Commission is in charge of these tokenized assets, which are traded on stock exchanges and held by an organization.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Stablecoins</strong>: In order to provide relative price stability, the value of a stablecoin is tied to an external reserve asset, such as precious metals or fiat currencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Memecoins</strong>: Memecoins are often created to take advantage of short-term gains and are based on viral internet trends.Heard of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tokens for governance</strong>: Users can vote with these utility tokens on a decentralized blockchain.</p>
<p>Altcoins can be created from scratch or, more frequently, forked from a code that already exists. When a blockchain separates from its parent chain to form a new network that adheres to a different software protocol, a fork takes place. The parent network is typically Bitcoin or Ethereum. Forks typically occur when developers disagree about the direction of a platform. They might change the source code to start a new chain.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why an altcoin?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are numerous factors that draw crypto investors to altcoins. They are what Bitcoin calls the &ldquo;better mousetrap,&rdquo; which means that they operate on improved versions of their previous blockchain networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Altcoins are the result of inventive solutions to previously unsolved software flaws, inefficiencies, and vulnerabilities. Due to their adaptability, altcoins have a better chance of long-term survival and more utility. They are better prepared for market developments in the future thanks to their adaptability in the crypto economy, which is unmatched by Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, because tokenomics is still in its infancy and there is room for expansion, altcoins are much more accessible. Altcoins, on the other hand, is regarded as a more risky investment. Altcoins have limited liquidity, a high level of market saturation, a smaller market cap, and a lack of credibility. They are also susceptible to scams, despite their relative price resilience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are highlighting the 20 market-favored altcoins that have come out on top halfway through 2022, which is another year marked by high volatility and a loss of $2 trillion. Major players ought to take advantage of the view while it lasts because, in crypto, tomorrow is not promised.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How to know DAO?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao/">Decentralized autonomous organization</a>, also known as an entity structure in which token holders, as opposed to a centralized authority, participate in the management and decision-making DApps for decentralized finance: software that can run entirely on a blockchain, also known as decentralized applications&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>NFTs</strong>: non-fungible tokens, also known as digital assets.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>ERC-20</strong>: a token standard that is part of Ethereum and lets dApps use smart contracts to make their own coins or tokenized assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>PoW lines</strong>: A consensus mechanism known as proof of work (PoS) only verifies a transaction after a certain amount of computational effort has been put into it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Popular altcoins</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Ethereum cryptocurrency logo is a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that avoids the computational power required in a PoW model by designating a class of its users to validate transactions.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Ethereum (ETH)</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum (ETH) is the preferred blockchain for developers. Ethereum is a global decentralized software platform that uses blockchain technology and introduced smart contract functionality to DeFi.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In essence, Ethereum makes it possible for computer programs to automate transactions between two parties, eliminating the requirement for a middleman and reducing transaction costs while simultaneously increasing reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It serves as a layer 1 or base network that can be built upon by anyone in the public. It currently supports 2,970 dApps and has more than 48,000 daily users. Many people consider Ethereum to be a pillar of the cryptocurrency space rather than an altcoin because of its centrality to the infrastructure of DeFi as we know it.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Tether (USDT)&nbsp;</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Stablecoin vanguard, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/tether/">Tether</a> is a first-generation centralized coin that guarantees a one-to-one fiat currency match and is fixed to the value of the US dollar.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The stablecoin, formerly known as Realcoin, was created in 2014 by developers Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins, and Craig Sellars to give investors a way to enter the cryptocurrency market without having to deal with its notoriously high volatility. Tether supports a variety of international currencies in addition to Ethereum and Bitcoin, as well as other well-known blockchains like the British pound and the Mexican peso.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The USDT, its native coin, consistently surpasses Bitcoin&rsquo;s trading volume record for any cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an $18.5 million settlement in February 2021, a New York attorney general found Tether to have &ldquo;<em>recklessly and unlawfully covered up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going</em>,&rdquo; despite the company&rsquo;s assertion that all transactions are fully backed by its reserves. Since then, Tether has changed its focus to U.S. Treasury holdings rather than commercial paper holdings and increased transparency across its website. Treasury Bills, while 28% are made up of commercial paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to an official statement released in June, Tether intends to eventually reduce that number to zero. When the algorithmic stablecoin Terra crashed for $40 billion, it sparked a Tether run, prompting a large number of investors to withdraw their coins out of fear of insolvency. This provided an opportunity to disprove rumors and allegations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By redeeming $16.3 billion, the company reduced the USDT supply by 20%.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>
<p>We hope now you are familiar with alcoins. Either centralized or decentralized, all cryptocurrency-selling platforms fall into one of the above-mentioned altcoins. Similar to an issuing bank, a centralized authority is responsible for approving transactions and maintaining the blockchain ledger in centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX), like Tether and Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A trustless, encrypted ledger that is validated by consensus and distributed to everyone in the chain is used in decentralized exchanges or trading platforms like <a href="https://thequantum-ai.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thequantum-ai.com</a>. Ownership is yet another important consideration. In contrast to centralized systems, token holders in a decentralized system retain full ownership of their digital assets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase Global Inc will likely give up its entire year-to-date gain in the coming weeks and months, says Dan Dolev, a senior analyst at Mizuho.</p>
<h2>Coinbase stock could make a new low</h2>
<p>This week, Dolev reiterated his &ldquo;underperform&rdquo; rating on the cryptocurrency exchange and announced a $30 price objective that represents an alarming 40% downside from here.</p>
<p>His warning is based primarily on a new survey that suggested retail traders are not participating much despite the recent surge in <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&rsquo;s price</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Retail trading is COIN&rsquo;s bread and butter, as it accounted for 83% of revenue in 2021. Our survey, coupled with disappointing market share data and potential signs of take rate pressures in Q4, may mean more headwinds are brewing for 2023 revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase stock is currently up over 50% for the year with a recent surge, despite <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinbase-terminates-japan-operations-why-is-share-price-still-up-50-in-two-weeks/">Coinbase&rsquo;s recent announcment</a> it is ending its operations in Japan.</p>
<h2>Retail traders are sitting on the sidelines</h2>
<p>According to the quoted survey, roughly 90% of the traders that were on the sidelines in December continue to be inactive this month.</p>
<p>On top of that, over 33% that traded last month are sitting it out in January. Dolev&rsquo;s bearish note on the Coinbase stock reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>We measured COIN&rsquo;s volumes against those of 25 largest crypto exchanges. We found that COIN&rsquo;s share of combined volumes during the rally (bitcoin) was 5.3%, about in line with levels prior to the rally.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/coin/earnings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expectations</a> for the company&rsquo;s current quarter are pretty negative as well. It&rsquo;s expected to lose $2.39 a share &ndash; significantly worse than $3.32 of EPS it had in the same quarter last year.</p>
