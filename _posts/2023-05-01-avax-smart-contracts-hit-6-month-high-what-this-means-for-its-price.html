AVAX has been expanding its reach in various areas over the past few months, but one aspect that has seen tremendous growth is its smart contract deployment.¬† With this significant milestone, many investors and traders alike are speculating whether this development could be the catalyst that propels the Avalanche Network native token&#8217;s price to new heights.¬† Will this newfound growth in smart contracts lead to a surge in AVAX&#8217;s value?

The contract deployment of $AVAX has recently hit its highest levels in over six months.

This increased adoption and usage can ultimately drive up demand for AVAX. If the trend of contract deployment continues to rise, it could be a sign of a healthy and growing ecosystem on Avalanche. This, in turn, can further boost the token&#8217;s value. Avalanche Network TVL. Image: Defillama Avalanche‚Äôs DeFi Performance Disappoints Despite a significant increase in smart contract deployment on the Avalanche network, the platform&#8217;s performance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has been less than stellar.¬† Recent data shows a sharp decline in the platform&#8217;s decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, falling from 311 million to 13.74 million in just a few months. This has had a direct impact on Avalanche&#8217;s total value locked (TVL), which has also seen a decline. One of the contributing factors to the decline in Avalanche&#8217;s DeFi performance has been the decreasing interest in BTC.b, a wrapped Bitcoin token on the network used for DeFi purposes. According to data from Dune Analytics, all DEXes on the Avalanche network have witnessed a decline in BTC.b usage, indicating a lack of interest in the platform&#8217;s DeFi offerings.
