			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The popular Bitcoin investor and permabull, Michael Saylor, has released a new prediction for Bitcoin. Saylor has said that under the right conditions, the price of Bitcoin will jump by 10x to set a new trading high at $250,000. In other news, Tradecurve, a new hybrid exchange has outlined plans to overtake Binance as the number one crypto exchange, and some experts believe it is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Saylor has predicted a 10x price jump for Bitcoin, predicting the crypto will trade as high as $250,000 in the next bull run.</li>
<li>According to Saylor, regulatory clarity will be the catalyst for the next bull run.</li>
<li>While Binance suffers due to regulatory clarity, a new hybrid exchange has tapped into markets that could see it overtake the number one crypto exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
Michael Saylor Predicts 10x Price Jump for Bitcoin (BTC)
<p>In an interview with Bloomberg, Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Microstrategy, an enterprise business intelligence provider, predicted that the price of Bitcoin could jump by 10x. In explaining the reasoning for his prediction, Saylor said regulatory clarity in the U.S. will drive the next Bitcoin rally.</p>
<p>The presence of regulatory clarity will encourage venture capitalists that have avoided cryptocurrencies to jump into the industry. He adds that the recent crackdown on many top crypto exchanges by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would lay the groundwork for the next major Bitcoin bull run.</p>
<p>Congress is already working on a unified crypto regulatory framework and assigning crypto-specific roles to SEC and CFTC, meaning the next Bitcoin bull run couldn&rsquo;t be far away. If Saylor&rsquo;s prediction holds true, we would witness Bitcoin set a new all-time high at $250,000, beating its previous ATH at $68,789.</p>
<p></p>
Binance Has a New Challenger, And the Hybrid Exchange Could Overtake It
<p>On the journey to regulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency industry, the leading crypto exchange, Binance, has been caught in the web of the SEC. The crackdown on centralized exchanges has opened a window for the newer hybrid exchanges, which many crypto experts have called the future of crypto trading because they combine the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>One hybrid exchange, Tradecurve, has set out to challenge the dominance of Binance by incorporating into its platform trading features that Binance lack, including more trading options (forex and derivatives), negative balance protection, self-management of private keys, low latency ultra-fast order execution, and algorithmic trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By looking to offer wider assets for trading and features that will make for a seamless trading experience, Tradecurve plans to topple Binance as the number one crypto trading platform. With the current regulatory crackdown on Binance, many crypto analysts believe Tradecurve has a chance to steal market share from Binance to reduce its dominance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve is on track to enact its plan, currently in the fourth presale phase expecting to raise $20 million to launch its platform. The project has enjoyed massive support from investors currently buying its native token, TCRV, at $0.018 per token.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, companies are consistently pushing for new technological advancements and investing millions towards creating the best possible chatbot that users can utilize to get the information they need with ease, and one of the most recent use cases has been making price predictions for the crypto market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency traders are now asking ChatGPT, the most popular AI-driven chatbot globally, to tell them everything they need to know surrounding the future value of Binance coin, Tradecurve, and Bitcoin during the current bear market.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Asking ChatGPT About Binance coin
<p>According to ChatGPT, the price of Binance coin at the end of 2023 is difficult to predict with 100% accuracy; however, based on the current market conditions and historical price data, the AI is able to make some educated guesses as to how far it can climb.</p>
<p>On June 9, 2023, Binance coin traded at $259.21 per coin. This represents a lower point of value than the one Binance coin had at the start of the month, but there are factors that could impact its price in the future, including Binance's continued push towards creating new features and products, market demand, and overall regulatory compliance of the exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price of Binance coin at the end of 2023, according to some piece predictions made for the Binance coin, places it at a value of $465.85.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
The Answers ChatGPT Gave for Bitcoin
<p>The price of Bitcoin as of June 9, 2023, is at $26,607.05. Analysts went to ChatGPT to get accurate predictions about the future of Bitcoin. However, the AI did note that nothing can be predicted with 100% certainty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key factors that can affect the value of Bitcoin, according to ChatGPT, include the overall momentum of the market, mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, and the development of new, innovative features on top of the network or the creation of Layer-2 scaling solutions for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price of Bitcoin at the end of 2023 could see an increase, however, and based on estimates, BTC is expected to reach $65,000 by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
What ChatGPT Thinks about The Performance of Tradecurve
<p>Investors and traders are also curious about new projects, and Tradecurve has stood out due to its popularity, appeal, and the freedom it provides investors as it does not require KYC checks whilst also having the lowest fees in the industry.</p>
<p>Tradecurve is a hybrid exchange that combines the best elements of CEXs and DEXs to provide a truly unique, decentralized experience that will enable anyone on a global scale access to markets that are otherwise unavailable to them due to banking restrictions or regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each user of Tradecurve can effectively and effortlessly trade cryptocurrencies, as well as any other derivative, from one account while also maintaining privacy through the platform's DeFi capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TCRV is the utility token behind the platform, and it is currently undergoing Stage 3 of its presale, where it is offered at $0.015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked about the future of the cryptocurrency, ChatGPT noted how it could climb to 100x at launch, bringing it to $1.5 in value, because of the increased demand for such a solution after heightened regulation of CEXs, and because of the fast sales of the TCRV tokens, where the team has already sold millions of tokens and can generate $20 million before the presale ends.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Frax Finance, creators of one of the most innovative decentralized stablecoins and DeFi-focused stablecoin infrastructure, has unveiled its plans to roll out an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, aptly named Fraxchain. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The objective is simple but ambitious: to cultivate a smart contract platform with an unwavering focus on decentralized finance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Frax Protocol: A Trio of Stablecoins and Integrated Subprotocols</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Frax Protocol represents a pioneering development in the crypto world. At its core, it issues three distinct decentralized stablecoins: FRAX, a USD pegged asset; the Frax Price Index (FPI) stablecoin, which uniquely ties its value to a basket of consumer goods, creating a new unit of account independent of national currencies; and FraxEther (frxETH), a stablecoin pegged to ETH, designed to replace WETH in smart contracts. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Complementing these stablecoins, the protocol also houses three subprotocols: Fraxlend, Fraxswap, and Fraxferry. Fraxswap, the first Automated Market Maker (AMM) using time-weighted average market maker orders, helps in rebalancing collateral, minting/redemptions, adjusting stablecoin supply, and deploying protocol-owned liquidity on-chain. Fraxlend creates a lending market for Frax-based stablecoins, allowing the origination of debt, bespoke non-custodial loans, and the incorporation of collateral assets into the Frax Finance economy. Lastly, Fraxferry enables the transfer of Frax Protocol tokens across multiple blockchains. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Frax Share (FXS) serves as the primary governance token across the Frax ecosystem, accruing fees, revenue, and excess collateral value. An additional governance token, FPIS, is specific to the FPI and shares its value capture with FXS holders. A Gauge Rewards System allows the community to propose rewards for strategies that integrate Frax-based stablecoins. The fixed, halving annual FXS emissions flow to different gauges based on veFXS staker votes.</p>
Frax Finance Sets Sights on Layer 2 with Fraxchain
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Fraxchain, a project by the makers of the Frax stablecoin, is set to strengthen the hold of decentralized finance in the blockchain landscape. &ldquo;Fraxchain marks the zenith of the entire Frax ecosystem and mirrors the traction and usage we&rsquo;ve attained,&rdquo; Frax founder Sam Kazemian explains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A Glimpse into the Fraxchain Framework</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The slated release date for this network is by the end of this calendar year. The network's governance will hinge on the holders of Frax Shares (FXS) tokens. The modus operandi of the network includes leveraging the Frax stablecoin and Frax Ether, the project's liquid staking derivative, for transaction fees. What's more, the fees garnered by the roll-up network could partially be burned or funneled back to the Ethereum mainnet, to be dispersed among stakers of the FXS governance token, Kazemian outlined. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Fraxchain hinges on a Layer 2 rollup model. In this arrangement, it will publish state roots to the Ethereum mainnet for securing the network. The rollup network will also incorporate decentralized sequencers&mdash;these nodes order transactions into batches in a rollup network. Any entity can operate them, as long as they secure the nod via a governance vote. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Kazemian further elaborated on this feature:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;Fraxchain proposes a solution where sequencer roles can be auctioned off and rotated, creating a decentralized sequencer base. If a sequencer is forced to shut down, Fraxchain would allow the next elected sequencer to pick up from where the previous one left off,&rdquo; he explained. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Fraxchain: By the Numbers</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As per the numbers, Frax's ecosystem has made a significant mark on the world of crypto. As of this writing, the total supply of Frax stands at over $1.23 billion, while Frax Shares (FXS) have a market cap exceeding $371 million. The Frax stablecoin is listed on major exchanges and is integrated into numerous DeFi platforms, while FXS token is used for governance decisions, further cementing its position in the decentralized finance space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of Fraxchain encapsulates the pivotal move of Frax Finance to fortify its position in the DeFi world. It will be interesting to monitor the progress of this Layer 2 solution, with an eye on the continued growth and traction of the Frax ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) joins the list of several other tokens caught up in the price drops due to the recent US Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto analysts study the charts to see what this means for the meme coin while also discovering a new token, rising against all odds&mdash;Uwerx.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article explores what the SEC lawsuit could mean for Dogecoin (DOGE) while exploring the unique benefits Uwerx has to offer its users.&nbsp;</p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): The Fate of the Meme Coin
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE), like several other tokens, has been caught in the SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. While several media platforms spread uncertainty and fear regarding Dogecoin (DOGE), crypto analysts take a different approach to the token&rsquo;s price predictions.</p>
<p>Most media outlets have communicated that the recent sell-offs and price drops in Dogecoin (DOGE) forewarn investors of an even bleaker future. But crypto analysts have stated that the sell-offs and price drops were not driven by long-term traders but by short-term investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to industry experts, the fate of Dogecoin (DOGE) in the crypto market is less bleak than media outlets will lead most to believe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Dogecoin (DOGE) sells at $0.061421, with a live market cap of $8,554,931,776. Dogecoin&rsquo;s (DOGE) market supply is presently at 139,736,336,384 DOGE. Due to market sentiments, Dogecoin (DOGE) is predicted to reach $0.092 by 2024.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): A Brighter Future
<p>Uwerx is positioned to be the leading freelance platform globally. Uwerx is set to be different and preferable compared to other freelancing platforms. Considering Uwerx&rsquo;s increasing numbers, one might state that Uwerx is already meeting its goals.</p>
<p>With over 6,200 sign-ups on the Uwerx platform, over 1,600 followers on Twitter, and over 1,600 subscribers to the Telegram community, the Uwerx platform is growing beyond all expectations. While other platforms might take this as a sign to work less hard, the Uwerx team remains unrelenting. With the current listing on CoinSniper and the scheduled Uwerx listing on Uniswap by the 1st of August, the Uwerx Team is doing all it can to ensure that Uwerx reaches its target audience.</p>
<p>The confidence of the Uwerx team in expanding its reach can be traced to several factors. Firstly, Uwerx has successfully passed its audit approval by InterFi Network and SolidProof. This implies that the platform is excellent by all standards in the industry. In addition, Uwerx is set to only offer a 1% transaction fee, a very affordable fee compared to Upwork and Fiverr&rsquo;s 10 and 20%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx will also be offering its users incentivization and gamification features to serve as more motivation for their work. Uwerx will also put a 25-year liquidity lock in place for its tokens. Uwerx team tokens are included in the mix as team tokens have already been locked for nine months, further assuring Uwerx users of the security and stability of their tokens. Once Uwerx is unveiled on the 4th of August, 2023, contract ownerships will be renounced, thus eliminating the likelihood of scams and fraud.</p>
<p>The Uwerx Vault has now been unveiled, allowing Uwerx users to store their tokens securely, just like staking, as they get rewarded dependent on the variables existing within the platform. The&nbsp; Alpha platform has also been unveiled, and Uwerx will soon be transitioning from the Alpha Platform to the Beta platform, allowing Uwerx users to test the platform for themselves. The Uwerx team encourages users to send their feedback via email to the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the 31st of July, 2023, when Uwerx&rsquo;s presale ends, WERX token holders will receive their tokens in a 6-week vesting period. Uwerx will also carry out a Test Airdrop when the Uwerx presale ends.&nbsp;</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Presale: Beyond the Stars
<p>The Uwerx team has been in awe of Uwerx&rsquo;s incredible growth and sell-out of its presale. The first four stages of Uwerx&rsquo;s presale were all sold out in a very short time. The Uwerx team has also had to modify the critical token allocations due to the high demands for Uwerx.</p>
<p>WERX tokens sell at $0.041 per token with a 15% bonus on all purchases. Considering that Uwerx will be launched officially on the 4th of August, this price is bound to increase soon.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange with roughly 62 million users, is reportedly under scrutiny from French financial regulatory authorities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to a breaking report from Le Monde, investigations into the exchange's activities were to have been underway since at least the early quarter of 2022.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The inquest, led by the judicial investigation service of finance and under the specialized interregional jurisdiction of Paris, has brought into question the exchange's adherence to legal norms.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Reportedly, the focus of the probe revolves around "acts of illegal exercise of the function of service provider on digital assets (PSAN), and acts of aggravated money laundering." Particularly, the exchange is being examined for its participation in investment operations, concealment, and conversion - all purportedly carried out by offenders that generated profits.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Offhand, however, these allegations appear to be more a matter of misinterpretation and miscommunication withe the regulatory body than a wilful abandonment of due diligence from the side of Binance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance Commits To KYC Procedures</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Simultaneously, questions have been raised about Binance's commitment to 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) procedures, a regulatory framework meant to curb money laundering activities. Reports suggest that Binance may not have been fully compliant with these protocols, leading to further speculation about the exchange's operations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To further complicate matters, it's alleged that Binance had been offering services to French customers without obtaining an appropriate operating license. Regulations enacted in 2019 require crypto exchanges to gain the approval of the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to legally operate in France. Binance commenced operations in France in 2020 but purportedly only secured AMF approval in May 2022, fueling further controversy.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In response to the claims, a Binance spokesperson maintained that the company cooperates with global law enforcement and abides by all local laws. However, they refrained from commenting on specifics about the investigation.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Binance invests considerable time and resources into cooperating with law enforcement globally. We abide by all laws in France, just as we do in every other market we operate," the exchange said in a tweet thread responding to reportage on the matter.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">To clarify:In France, on-site visits by regulators and inspectors, are part of regulatory obligations to which all financial institutions must adhere.

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance: Between Compliance and Current Charges</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This French investigation comes amidst Binance facing litigation in the United States. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has brought forward 13 charges against the crypto exchange's U.S. subsidiary and CEO Changpeng Zhao. Recent reportage also indicate that Binance.US has also cut off staff amid the ongoing legal troubles.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These revelations underscore the challenging terrain for Binance, as well as for similar platforms such as Coinbase. As of mid-2022, the SEC stated that out of the 62 million users on Binance globally, only 25 million had filled in KYC documents. This implies a substantial proportion of users on the platform are operating without the requisite KYC documentation.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance&rsquo;s US affiliate conducted a round of layoffs after the SEC charged the exchange with securities violations last week. </p>
<p>Crypto giant Binance&rsquo;s US affiliate, Binance.US, has reportedly laid off some of its staff after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the exchange with securities violations and sought a temporary restraining order to freeze the exchange&rsquo;s assets.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that around 50 people, or 10%, have been laid off. Sources say employees in the exchange&rsquo;s legal, compliance, and risk departments have been dismissed.</p>
<p>Media outlet CoinDesk cites documents in which Binance.US management described the SEC as a &ldquo;politically motivated regulator&rdquo; that forced the company to become a &ldquo;crypto-only exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The documents read:</p>

<p>As part of this transition, and because of our preparation for a multi-year and very costly litigation process, the Board has asked Management to shrink the size of our teams across the company and reduce our burn rate.</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>Unlike every other US crypto company, we have been working to avoid this scenario, but circumstances have now shifted. This was a very hard decision &ndash; one that we didn&rsquo;t take lightly. We are sad to see our colleagues depart, but we wish them the best and will do what we can to assist them in this transition.</p>

Binance.US Suspends USD Deposits and Withdrawals
<p>Last week, the SEC sued Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, accusing the exchange of allegedly mishandling customer funds and lying to investors and regulators about its operations.</p>
<p>The next day, the agency filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of two of Binance&rsquo;s US units.</p>
<p>Days after the SEC filed suit against Binance and requested to freeze Binance.US&rsquo;s assets, the exchange announced that it was suspending US dollar deposits, and its banking partners were preparing to halt fiat withdrawals from June 13.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange OKCoin has come under the scrutiny of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over accusations of making false promises to customers.&nbsp;</p>
FDIC-Insured Accounts - False Claims
<p>On June 15, 2023, the FDIC addressed a cease-and-desist to the CEO of OKCoin, Hong Fang, intimating the latter of a potential violation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. According to the government agency, the company has falsely claimed a level of customer protection that it does not provide.</p>
<p>The letter claims that OKCoin has misrepresented the extent to which customer assets are protected by federal deposit insurance. The FDIC insurance, which only covers traditional bank accounts, does not extend to customer accounts on crypto exchanges. In its list of offerings, OKCoin stated that it offers &ldquo;FDIC-insured accounts,&rdquo; which is a misrepresentation. The FDIC claimed that this misrepresentation makes a false promise to the customers and misguides them into making riskier moves due to this false sense of security.&nbsp;</p>
FDIC Issues Cease-And-Desist
<p>In the letter, the FDIC sought to bring the discrepancy to the attention of the firm and asked them to take corrective steps to alert customers about the limitations of their services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An excerpt from the letter reads,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;OKCoin is not FDIC-insured and the FDIC does not insure non-deposit products. By not distinguishing between U.S.-dollar deposits and crypto assets, the statements imply FDIC insurance coverage applies to all customer funds (including crypto assets).&rdquo;</p>

<p>The agency pointed out that users and potential customers should be properly intimated about all the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. The FDIC also claimed that the crypto firm needs to further explicitly clarify the lack of regulatory protections on crypto held on its exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to properly inform the customers of this information, the government agency has asked the company to review its marketing materials, website content, and other public statements.&nbsp;</p>
OKCoin To Revise Communication
<p>The FDIC's intervention serves as a reminder of the regulatory challenges surrounding the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space. As the popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies increase, regulatory bodies are striving to keep pace with emerging risks and ensure consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OKCoin, founded in 2013, is one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges globally, serving a significant number of users. The allegations by the FDIC could potentially impact the trust and confidence of OKCoin's customer base. Users who may have relied on the falsely claimed FDIC insurance could be reevaluating their positions on the platform.</p>
<p>The exchange will need to revise its marketing communications and provide clear and accurate information to its customers about the level of asset protection offered by its platform. The outcome of this situation will have implications not only for OKCoin but also for the broader cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing the need for responsible practices and regulatory compliance.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Banco de la Republica, Colombia&rsquo;s Central Bank, has announced a partnership with Ripple as it looks to explore the use of blockchain technology in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colombia will conduct a pilot project to test Ripple&rsquo;s CBDC platform for its high-value payments system. The country already uses Ripple&rsquo;s technology for land distribution efforts being undertaken.&nbsp;</p>
The Banco De La Republica And Ripple Partnership&nbsp;
<p>Ripple has stated that Colombia&rsquo;s Central Bank, in partnership with the Ministry for the Information and Communications Technologies (MinTIC), will conduct a pilot for Ripples CBDC (central bank digital currency) platform to help improve its high-value payments system. The initiative is part of a larger blockchain experimentation phase being conducted by the Ministry for the Information and Communications Technologies. According to Ripple, its CBDC platform will be experimented with and tested in a controlled environment without the risk of compromising public resources. In a statement, the Minister of Information Technologies and Communications of Colombia said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Potential efficiencies can be evaluated through the results obtained in the development of a solution with blockchain technology, which manages to improve and complement the processes in the entities in a safe and efficient way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vice president of Central Bank Engagements and CBDCs at Ripple, James Wallis, added that he believed the project could clear a path for significant transformative advancements regarding the use of blockchain technology in the public sector.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By harnessing the power of the CBDC Platform, based upon the XRPL, this project will pave the way for transformative advancements in the utilization of blockchain technology within the public sector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the announcement did not disclose when Colombia plans to launch its own central bank digital currency.&nbsp;</p>
CBDCs Picking Up Steam&nbsp;
<p>In simple terms, a CBDC is a digital version of a country&rsquo;s fiat currency, such as the Euro and US Dollar, or in Colombia&rsquo;s case, the Colombian Peso. CBDCs are backed by the country&rsquo;s central bank and are digital assets different from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This is because CBDCs are controlled by a centralized entity, the central bank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Atlantic Council&rsquo;s central bank digital currency tracker, a total of 120 countries are actively exploring a CBDC. Out of this, 11 countries, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, and St. Lucia, have launched their own CBDC. A further 18 countries are in the pilot stage. These include India, China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Australia, Iran, and several others. A further 32 countries have CBDCs in the development stage. These include the United States of America, Brazil, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland, Turkey, Canada, Bhutan, Bahrain, Indonesia, and others.&nbsp;</p>
Colombia and Ripple Have Partnered Before&nbsp;
<p>The partnership between Colombia and Ripple is not the first time the two have partnered together. Last year, the Colombian government, in partnership with Ripple Labs, launched an initiative to rectify the government&rsquo;s land distribution efforts. The project was backed by Peersyst Technology, a blockchain development company, and Ripple and will permanently store and authenticate property titles on Ripple&rsquo;s public blockchain. This would help eliminate cumbersome bureaucratic procedures and make land distribution more equal in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ripple was launched to help banks and financial institutions move funds around quickly without incurring extra fees. Currently, XRP is the world&rsquo;s 6th largest cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
Colombia&rsquo;s Pro-Crypto Stance&nbsp;
<p>Colombia has adopted a pro-crypto stance since electing Gustavo Petro as president in August 2022. The new president is extremely pro-Bitcoin and has spoken strongly in favor of the cryptocurrency during speeches. He has also taken a proactive approach towards cryptocurrencies in general and has hinted that he truly believes in the power of digital assets. President Petro has made several pro-Bitcoin statements in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin removes the power of issuance from the states and the seigniorage of the currency from the banks. It is a community currency that is based on the trust of those who carry out transactions with it. Since it is based on the blockchain, trust is measured and grows, hence its strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No surprise then that Colombia has taken several initiatives towards adopting cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Right after his election, the government of Colombia launched its digital currency initiative and confirmed its plans for a digital currency. The initiative would be developed in partnership with the country&rsquo;s central bank. It would make Colombia part of an exclusive group of Latin American countries, such as Venezuela and El Salvador, adopting blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2023, Binance announced that it would be launching its prepaid crypto card in Colombia. This would mark the third country in Latin America where Binance debuted its crypto card after Argentina and Brazil. According to Binance, its new crypto card would allow holders to pay with crypto instead of using standard debit or credit cards.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The world&rsquo;s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has announced that it has filed an application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If approved, BlackRock&rsquo;s Bitcoin spot ETF will become the first crypto spot ETF in the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Application&nbsp;
<p>News about BlackRock being close to submitting an application for a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) was recently revealed by a source familiar with the matter. According to a filing by the Nasdaq stock exchange with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the custodian of the fund&rsquo;s Bitcoin holdings would be the Coinbase Custody Trust Company. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon would hold custody of the fund&rsquo;s fiat currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust. Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (the &ldquo;Bitcoin Custodian&rdquo;) is the custodian for the Trust&rsquo;s bitcoin holdings, and Bank of New York Mellon is the custodian for the Trust&rsquo;s cash holdings (the &ldquo;Cash Custodian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The application, filed on the 15th of June, 2023, states,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Shares have been designed to remove the obstacles represented by the complexities and operational burdens involved in a direct investment in Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the filing, the Bitcoin price will be updated every 15 seconds during regular market trading through the CF Benchmarks Index.&nbsp;</p>
Previously Approved Spot Exchange Products&nbsp;
<p>The filing also noted that previously approved spot exchange-traded products in the commodities and currency markets were generally unregulated and that the commission relied on the underlying futures market as the basis for approving or rejecting trust shares in previous instances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As such, the regulated market of significant size test does not require that the spot bitcoin market be regulated in order for the Commission to approve this proposal.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a single spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund despite several applications in the past. After a spate of rejections, Grayscale had filed a suit against the Securities and Exchange Commission. The investment firm had challenged the SEC&rsquo;s refusal to approve Grayscale&rsquo;s application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund. In its arguments, Grayscale stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fundamental problem with the order is that it contradicts previous SEC orders giving the green light to Bitcoin futures ETPs that pose the same risk of fraud and manipulation and have in place the same CME [Chicago Mercantile Exchange] surveillance mechanism to protect against those risks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Others, such as Cathie Wood&rsquo;s ARK Invest and European investment firm 21Shares, have also been pushing hard for their own spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund approval, having filed their third application back in April. Canada&rsquo;s Purpose Bitcoin ETF was the world&rsquo;s first spot-traded Bitcoin ETF, having been set up in early 2021.&nbsp;</p>
BlackRock&rsquo;s Previous Exchange-Traded Fund&nbsp;
<p>BlackRock had announced the launch of a Europe-focused exchange-traded fund in September 2022. The ETF looked to provide its European customers with greater exposure to crypto and the blockchain ecosystem. Other reports at the time also indicated a metaverse-focused ETF was also in the pipeline. The ETF was called the iShares Blockchain Technology UCITS ETF and had around 75% of its holdings consisting of exchanges and blockchain companies. The remaining 25% was made up of companies that supported the larger blockchain ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ETF gave BlackRock&rsquo;s European customers to several major companies in crypto, including Galaxy Digital, Marathon Digital, and Coinbase. Furthermore, the biggest holdings in the fund included USD Cash (13%), Block (11.40%), Coinbase (13.20%), Riot Blockchain (10.50%), and Marathon Digital Holdings.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Blockchain Association has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with an inquiry into the regulator's interactions with Prometheum, a relatively lesser-known cryptocurrency exchange that has recently garnered significant attention.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Prometheum's co-CEO Aaron Kaplan was recently invited to testify before Congress, a rare occurrence for an executive from a relatively obscure company in a nascent industry. During the session, Kaplan voiced his support for the SEC's existing regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges, while casting criticism on a significant portion of the industry. His statements have sparked intense discussions within the industry, and have elicited skepticism from some quarters.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Possible Inconsistencies: Prometheum's Relationship with the SEC</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Adding to the intrigue surrounding Prometheum's operations is a revelation that the company paid over $1.5 million in sales commissions to a Chinese-affiliated entity, which carries a less-than-stellar regulatory track record. This has raised concerns within the Blockchain Association, leading it to further investigate the company's regulatory dealings.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The criticisms are mainly centered on the fact that, despite being approved as a SPBD, Prometheum faces a considerable challenge in terms of regulatory compliance, and, for its end, the capacity to do so. The company's trading platform will not be able to facilitate the trading of any tokens until the projects behind those tokens have registered with the SEC.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As it stands, there is no clear pathway for such registration under the existing SEC regime. This highlights a glaring contradiction in Prometheum's claims of offering a regulatory compliant platform for digital asset securities.The skepticism is well-founded, with several red flags raising questions about Prometheum's operations. The company reportedly paid in excess of $1.5 million in sales commissions to a Chinese-affiliated entity, which carries a dubious regulatory record. Such practices would typically invite scrutiny, but they appear to have been overlooked in Prometheum's case. These findings are the result of diligent work by the Blockchain Association, which continues to investigate the company's actions and interactions with the SEC.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Further, Prometheum's claims of being a compliant path were brought into question during Kaplan's congressional hearing and an interview with journalist Laura Shin. It was suggested that Kaplan misinterpreted the legalities surrounding the crypto industry, thereby misrepresenting his company's position. This was reflected in the words of Representative Mike Flood, who dismissed Prometheum's assertions as unfounded.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Regulatory Concessions</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite its status as a SPBD, Prometheum's Alternative Trading System (ATS) faces a considerable regulatory hurdle. The platform will be unable to trade any tokens until those tokens' creators have first registered with the SEC. This presents a roadblock, given the lack of a clear path to registration under the current SEC regime&mdash;a reality at odds with Prometheum's proclamations of offering a regulated platform for digital asset securities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prometheum's unusual trajectory underscores the broader struggle within the crypto industry to navigate the complex and rapidly evolving regulatory environment. It highlights the critical need for greater transparency and a well-defined regulatory framework that can keep pace with innovation in the digital asset space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prometheum has been under scrutiny since its co-CEO, Aaron Kaplan, testified before Congress and made statements supporting the SEC's regulatory approach towards crypto exchanges, while criticizing much of the crypto industry. Prometheum claims to be a broker-dealer approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority as an alternative trading system.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Current Tensions In U.S. Crypto Regulation</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prometheum's position comes at a time when the crypto industry has been expressing concerns over what they perceive to be an antagonistic regulatory environment in the U.S., especially in the wake of recent lawsuits filed by the SEC against major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prometheum plans to list regulated cryptocurrencies. However, this has been met with criticism. Rodrigo Seira, special counsel at Paradigm, pointed out that the SEC's stance is that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities, and therefore cannot be traded even on regulated exchanges.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In response to a question during the congressional hearing from Congressman Mike Flood about whether Prometheum lists bitcoin or ether, Kaplan confirmed that the platform does not list either of these. Kaplan's statement seems to contradict the idea that no additional legislation is needed, as argued by Flood.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prometheum had previously announced plans to support digital asset securities, including Flow, Filecoin, The Graph, Compound, and Celo. The company has yet to provide a public disclosure on the matter.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prometheum had previously announced plans to support digital asset securities, including Flow, Filecoin, The Graph, Compound, and Celo. The company has yet to provide a public disclosure on the matter.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Hong Kong government has proactively advocated for major banks to embrace clients engaged in digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional financial institutions such as HSBC and Standard Chartered are finding themselves confronted with mounting pressure to adapt to Hong Kong&rsquo;s desire to become a hub for crypto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to an article on CoinTelegraph, both UK- based banks as well as the Bank of China, were pressured by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in a May meeting to start accepting crypto companies such as exchanges, as clients.</p>
Embracing the Crypto Community
<p>The Hong Kong government's initiative to encourage major banks to accommodate cryptocurrency clients marks a noteworthy milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognising the demand for crypto-related services, the government appears to be looking to allow crypto-related companies to do their thing and continue to come up with innovations that can disrupt the existing financial system.&nbsp;</p>
Navigating Regulatory Challenges
<p>While the acceptance of cryptocurrencies presents exciting possibilities, it also poses regulatory challenges for traditional banks. Striking a delicate balance between fostering innovation and ensuring compliance with existing regulations is a key consideration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government's push for banks to embrace crypto clients is accompanied by a call for enhanced risk management and regulatory frameworks. This comprehensive approach aims to establish a secure and transparent environment that protects both banks and their cryptocurrency clients from potential risks.</p>
Embracing the Potential of Blockchain
<p>The Hong Kong government's push for banks to embrace crypto clients says much for China&rsquo;s rethinking of the crypto digital asset economy. It also signifies a deeper recognition of the transformative capabilities that blockchain technology holds.&nbsp;</p>
Catalysing Global Innovation
<p>Hong Kong's proactive approach to embracing crypto and its encouragement of banks to accommodate crypto clients sends a resounding message to the global financial industry. By positioning itself as a progressive and innovative hub, Hong Kong aims to attract international businesses and investors who see the potential in crypto and blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Since inception, LEVEL has designed a protocol to serve as a functional alternative to centralized counterparty risk. After half a year of product testing, it&rsquo;s finally time to expand, and the LEVEL DAO has determined that Arbitrum will be the next ecosystem where Level will be deployed on.</p>
<p>LEVEL&rsquo;s Success Story</p>
<p>LEVEL has experienced phenomenal growth. In just the first month, LEVEL witnessed a notable $320 million in volume traded, generating over $400k in fees and bringing in more than 1000 community members.</p>
<p>As a testament to the product-market fit they found, it took just 55 days for the ecosystem to hit $1 billion in trading volume, leading to collecting $8.3 million in fees during that time &ndash; going from strength to strength with over $20 billion traded in the first half of 2023 alone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Impressively, the most significant daily trading volume was $339 million on April 14, 2023, accounting for around a third of the total volume across Perp DEXs (Delphi Digital).</p>
<p>A Quick Look On-Chain</p>
<p>Total Volume: $17.4 billion, of which leverage trading volume accounts for $14.5 billion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total Collected Fees: &gt;$22 million&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, these collected fees are distributed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>LLPs (supply-side revenue) = 45%</li>
<li>LVL Stakers (protocol revenue) = 10%</li>
<li>LGO Stakers (protocol revenue) = 10%</li>
<li>DAO Treasury (protocol revenue - redeemable against LGO) = 30%</li>
<li>Reserved for Protocol Development (5%)</li>
</ul>
Assets Under Management (AUM): $30 million
<p></p>
<p>During this time, LEVEL has established itself as the leading perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) on BNB Chain, rivaling even the likes of GMX &ndash; a significant achievement considering the difference in total value locked (TVL) and market cap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Setting itself apart from competitors, LEVEL wrote its own codebase from scratch and pioneered the tranche system in DeFi. By leveraging its innovative dual tokenomics model (LVL and LGO), which perfectly fits a perpetual DEX platform, LEVEL has created a strong protocol growth flywheel, reflected in the simultaneous growth of platform volume and Treasury assets. This has resulted in achieving close to $10M in treasury liquid assets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Last but not least, LEVEL is taking DeFi on-chain governance to the next level, with more than 19 DAO Proposals submitted.</p>
<p>Truly decentralized governance, driving rapid iteration in product and incentive models for a fast-paced marketplace.</p>
Why Arbitrum?&nbsp;
<p>Even at a glance, Arbitrum looked like the most immediate choice for LEVEL, and this sentiment resonated with the majority of their community.</p>
<p>All new possible chains were evaluated according to their:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liquidity</li>
<li>User profile</li>
<li>Daily active users</li>
<li>Daily number of TXs</li>
</ul>
<p>Arbitrum crushes all of these criteria, securing itself as the fourth chain by TVL, thanks to its deep liquidity and a DeFi-native user base. An equally important factor included the sustained growth of unique addresses in the network, even after the ARB Airdrop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many critics speculated that activity on Arbitrum would sink after the airdrop. Nonetheless, the daily transactions on the network are steadily increasing, averaging around 1m per day &mdash; close to ATH if one does not take into account the days of the airdrop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering these factors, it is understandable why the DAO voted for Arbitrum, securing 53% of the total votes across 4 options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitrum is the home of DeFi, and a place full of open collaboration. The composable nature of DeFi on Arbitrum offers endless possibilities for new products and partnerships with other protocols. Some remarkable examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yield Aggregators</li>
<li>Money Markets</li>
<li>Other Derivatives (e.g., hedging, structured products)</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, this Layer 2 protocol is a fantastic fit for LEVEL as it houses a native niche of perp DEX traders who can benefit from the ecosystem&rsquo;s incentivized program for traders, shrewdly configured to drive protocol and treasury growth.</p>
<p>While the expansion to Arbitrum is the project&rsquo;s main priority, LEVEL is not stopping there. LEVEL will continue to expand in its goal to become a key piece of the wider omnichain infrastructure.</p>
Practical Developments
<p>Cross-chain infrastructure is being built to cement the marketplace as an omnichain protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of these developments, LEVEL is migrating the LVL and LGO tokens to the &lsquo;Omnichain Fungible Token&rsquo; (OFT) standard.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to enable the cross-chain aggregation of fees distributed to its stakeholders so that LEVEL users can earn yield anywhere in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The DAO treasury will also be united across the entire ecosystem, meaning LGO redemptions against the treasury will occur on all chains.</p>
<p>Following the recently approved proposal, LEVEL is utilizing LayerZero&rsquo;s technology to bridge 5M LVL to Arbitrum, to bootstrap liquidity and trader activity through auctions and other incentive programs.</p>
They have also begun migrating:
<ul>
<li>LVL/USDT Liquidity &mdash; to make LVL tokens more accessible to users on Arbitrum, LEVEL migrating the entire LVL/USDT pool (currently ~ $713,214) to Trader Joe Arbitrum ensures that new users trading for the first time will have the liquidity to access LVL tokens.&nbsp;</li>
<li>LEVEL Trading Pool Liquidity &mdash; enabling access to all trading features, migrating 3,555,192 Senior LLP (currently ~ $4,061,500) from the BNB Chain to seed trading liquidity on Arbitrum (50% of the protocol-owned Senior LLP supply).</li>
</ul>
<p>Future Plans</p>
<p>When it comes to future footprints, a key priority for Level Protocol is for the DAO to steer Level&rsquo;s journey towards exceptional growth.</p>
<p>LEVEL also remains committed to delivering an exceptional user experience, ensuring that their customers receive premium service and can trade using a top-notch UX.</p>
<p>Further solidifying its position in the DeFi space, LEVEL is actively seeking, discussing, and moving forward with several partnerships with additional Tier-1 projects, enabling them to expand its reach and utility across the industry.</p>
<p>LEVEL's success to date was achievable through the tremendous support from its community of users. Expanding to a cross-chain liquidity marketplace, the marketplace will release a first-in-kind utility-based NFT in just 60 days. All of these unique items will be exclusively for LEVEL's community of users, with allocation retroactively determined based on interactions with the protocol on both Arbitrum and BNB Chain.</p>
<p>Three categories will correspond to the three main facets of LEVEL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock Broker's Vest, Earned through proving yourself as a trader. The life blood of any financial hub, a Trader needs to look the part at his desk.</li>
<li>Auctioneer's Hammer &ndash;A key group of mechanisms at LEVEL, Auctions serve to widen the reach of the ecosystem as a whole. Embody the power of the Auctioneer with their Hammer.</li>
<li>Tattered Farmer's Hat &ndash; LEVEL wouldn&rsquo;t we be anywhere without liquidity. LPs take on risk enabling the entire marketplace to function. It ain&rsquo;t much, but it&rsquo;s honest work.</li>
</ul>
<p>LEVEL's vision is to become a leading omnichain trading platform, and their recent expansion to Arbitrum marks the first step towards realizing this goal.</p>
<p>Expanding their services into other DeFi sectors is another avenue they are exploring. The goal is to become a multi-chain liquidity aggregator where fragmented liquidity across different ecosystems can be unified in a single pool, allowing users to trade, swap, and borrow seamlessly.</p>
<p>LEVEL is excited to embark on this omnichain journey, transforming the way people engage with DeFi and revolutionizing their trading experience.</p>
Step into the LEVEL Ecosystem!
<ul>
<li>Trade a range of blue chip assets on LEVEL now!</li>
<li>Buy LVL and begin participating in our ecosystem</li>
</ul>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Stockholm, Sweden, June 15th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM bridging the Physical and Virtual Worlds of Fashion through Blockchain Innovation</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Swedish-American fashion brand BLK DNM today unveils the first-ever example of connected fashion (garments that exist both physically and virtually, each aspect &lsquo;twinned&rsquo; via technology) with the launch of BLK DNM Society and integration of blockchain-powered hardware and software into its products.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM Society, built on tech designed by blockchain innovator and BLK DNM owner ChromaWay, will grant each garment a unique and recordable identity in both the physical and virtual worlds, while also rewarding ethical behaviour and granting brand influence to owners.</p><ul><li class="ql-align-justify">Blockchain-powered &lsquo;digital garment ID&rsquo; microchips will give each item a unique identity and record of its history</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Chips form the hardware element of BLK DNM Society, which launches in tandem and rewards responsible behavior and ownership</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Tech will first appear in BLK DNM&rsquo;s FW 2023 collection</li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify">The Hardware: Digital Garment IDs</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Future BLK DNM clothing will be fitted with a &lsquo;digital garment ID&rsquo; - an undetectable chip that gives each physical item a unique and recordable identity. Some of the first features of the digital garment IDs will include:</p><ul><li class="ql-align-justify">Authentication of the garment as genuine, eliminating fakes and counterfeiting</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Rewarding responsible behaviours of treasuring and caring for clothing long-term, such as refurbs and second-hand purchases</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Recording each individual garment's unique history - owners, events and places worn, repairs and alterations - enabling the item to accrue emotional and monetary value over time</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Acting as a digital ticket for entry to events</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Access to and voting rights within BLK DNM Society</li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM Society</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The digital garment IDs are the first hardware elements of BLK DNM Society, which launches in tandem. The first example of connected fashion, BLK DNM Society is a community of BLK DNM owners, connected virtually by their physical items, who are rewarded for responsible behaviours and are granted voting rights on key brand decisions based on item ownership - thereby beginning the first ever process of decentralising a fashion brand&rsquo;s stewardship.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Each digital garment ID will create a &lsquo;digital reflection&rsquo; of the physical garment: a twin in the virtual world where the physical item&rsquo;s history and place within BLK DNM Society is recorded. The digital reflection can also be worn in the metaverses, catering especially to younger generations whose identities in virtual worlds are equally as important as in the physical.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">FW 2023</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Digital garment IDs will be revealed at BLK DNM&rsquo;s FW event in Paris on June 21st. For this first collection, the chips will be embedded in only leather items, with subsequent collections introducing more items to BLK DNM Society through embedded blockchain-enabled hardware.</p>Henrik Hjelte, CEO and Co-founder of ChromaWay, comments: &ldquo;This is totally futuristic. Nothing like this has been attempted in fashion before. It&rsquo;s very exciting for us, after much hard work, to see our technology elevating one of fashion&rsquo;s iconic brands into something completely unique. This has the potential to transform people&rsquo;s relationships with the clothes they wear and the brands they buy. No longer does the relationship with the customer end at the checkout. And each beautiful garment now becomes its own living, evolving piece of history.&rdquo;<p class="ql-align-justify"></p><p>Toni Collin, CEO of BLK DNM, and Henrik Hjelte, CEO and Co-founder of ChromaWay</p>Toni Collin, CEO of BLK DNM, comments: &ldquo;BLK DNM&rsquo;s philosophy is one of community, and our clothing is designed, through both its craftsmanship and timeless aesthetic, to be treasured and passed down through generations - the antithesis of irresponsible fast fashion. Now, with the introduction of BLK DNM Society and the first embedded hardware in our garments, we take those two pillars to a revolutionary new level. By embedding intelligence in every item, we hope we can inspire our industry to join us in using connected fashion to do better.&rdquo;<p>About BLK DNM</p><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM is a Swedish-American fashion brand that specialises in timeless tailoring, leather, and denim of extraordinary quality.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stockholm, Sweden, June 15th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM bridging the Physical and Virtual Worlds of Fashion through Blockchain Innovation</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Swedish-American fashion brand BLK DNM today unveils the first-ever example of connected fashion (garments that exist both physically and virtually, each aspect &lsquo;twinned&rsquo; via technology) with the launch of BLK DNM Society and integration of blockchain-powered hardware and software into its products.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM Society, built on tech designed by blockchain innovator and BLK DNM owner ChromaWay, will grant each garment a unique and recordable identity in both the physical and virtual worlds, while also rewarding ethical behaviour and granting brand influence to owners.</p><ul><li class="ql-align-justify">Blockchain-powered &lsquo;digital garment ID&rsquo; microchips will give each item a unique identity and record of its history</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Chips form the hardware element of BLK DNM Society, which launches in tandem and rewards responsible behavior and ownership</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Tech will first appear in BLK DNM&rsquo;s FW 2023 collection</li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify">The Hardware: Digital Garment IDs</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Future BLK DNM clothing will be fitted with a &lsquo;digital garment ID&rsquo; - an undetectable chip that gives each physical item a unique and recordable identity. Some of the first features of the digital garment IDs will include:</p><ul><li class="ql-align-justify">Authentication of the garment as genuine, eliminating fakes and counterfeiting</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Rewarding responsible behaviours of treasuring and caring for clothing long-term, such as refurbs and second-hand purchases</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Recording each individual garment's unique history - owners, events and places worn, repairs and alterations - enabling the item to accrue emotional and monetary value over time</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Acting as a digital ticket for entry to events</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Access to and voting rights within BLK DNM Society</li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM Society</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The digital garment IDs are the first hardware elements of BLK DNM Society, which launches in tandem. The first example of connected fashion, BLK DNM Society is a community of BLK DNM owners, connected virtually by their physical items, who are rewarded for responsible behaviours and are granted voting rights on key brand decisions based on item ownership - thereby beginning the first ever process of decentralising a fashion brand&rsquo;s stewardship.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Each digital garment ID will create a &lsquo;digital reflection&rsquo; of the physical garment: a twin in the virtual world where the physical item&rsquo;s history and place within BLK DNM Society is recorded. The digital reflection can also be worn in the metaverses, catering especially to younger generations whose identities in virtual worlds are equally as important as in the physical.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">FW 2023</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Digital garment IDs will be revealed at BLK DNM&rsquo;s FW event in Paris on June 21st. For this first collection, the chips will be embedded in only leather items, with subsequent collections introducing more items to BLK DNM Society through embedded blockchain-enabled hardware.</p>Henrik Hjelte, CEO and Co-founder of ChromaWay, comments: &ldquo;This is totally futuristic. Nothing like this has been attempted in fashion before. It&rsquo;s very exciting for us, after much hard work, to see our technology elevating one of fashion&rsquo;s iconic brands into something completely unique. This has the potential to transform people&rsquo;s relationships with the clothes they wear and the brands they buy. No longer does the relationship with the customer end at the checkout. And each beautiful garment now becomes its own living, evolving piece of history.&rdquo;<p class="ql-align-justify"></p><p>Toni Collin, CEO of BLK DNM, and Henrik Hjelte, CEO and Co-founder of ChromaWay</p>Toni Collin, CEO of BLK DNM, comments: &ldquo;BLK DNM&rsquo;s philosophy is one of community, and our clothing is designed, through both its craftsmanship and timeless aesthetic, to be treasured and passed down through generations - the antithesis of irresponsible fast fashion. Now, with the introduction of BLK DNM Society and the first embedded hardware in our garments, we take those two pillars to a revolutionary new level. By embedding intelligence in every item, we hope we can inspire our industry to join us in using connected fashion to do better.&rdquo;<p>About BLK DNM</p><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM is a Swedish-American fashion brand that specialises in timeless tailoring, leather, and denim of extraordinary quality.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, has announced the launch of its new subscription-based Bitcoin cloud mining services. The move comes as a surprise amidst the ongoing regulatory challenges Binance is facing in the United States.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance's Bitcoin Cloud Mining Service</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance announced the launch on Twitter, claiming that users who are interested in Bitcoin mining but lack the necessary hardware can subscribe to these new cloud mining services and purchase hashrates. Currently, Binance offers 1 Terahash per second (Th/s) at a rate of $10.7280. An increase in the purchased hashrate corresponds to an increased probability of higher Bitcoin earnings through mining.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The BTC mining subscription service will remain active for six months. During this 180-day period, for every TH/s purchased, users could potentially earn 0.0004338 BTC. However, as of now, this product is only available on Binance's global website, indicating that users from the United States cannot access it.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Current Regulatory Trouble</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance's decision to launch these cloud mining services comes at a particularly challenging time for the cryptocurrency exchange. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken legal action against Binance, alleging violations of securities laws. Alongside this, the SEC has filed for a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of Binance.US.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC has accused Binance of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, and CZ has been accused of failing to prevent U.S. customers from using the platform and providing misleading information about its market surveillance measures. According to the lawsuit, Binance and CZ were involved in an "elaborate scheme" to evade U.S. federal securities laws, which included creating separate U.S. entities and diverting billions of dollars in customer funds to Merit Peak Limited, a separate company under Zhao's control.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a press release, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that the charges against CZ and Binance detail an "extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law." He further accused the defendants of misrepresenting their risk controls, manipulating trading volumes, and actively concealing crucial information, such as the platform's operations, manipulative trading by its affiliated market maker, and the custody of investor funds and crypto assets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance Building Forward</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the wake of these accusations, CZ has remained unfazed, choosing to dismiss the charges with a tweet stating "4", a reference used within the Binance community to encourage users to ignore fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). He assured the community that Binance's systems remain stable and that deposits and withdrawals are operating as normal.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In preparation for the legal proceedings, Binance.US has already added former SEC enforcement co-director George Canellos to its legal team. Meanwhile, last week, Binance.US revealed that it has suspended USD deposits on its platform, a significant step in its transition to becoming an exclusively crypto-based exchange. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance is not the only crypto exchange facing regulatory pressures. Coinbase, another prominent cryptocurrency exchange, also found itself on the receiving end of a lawsuit from the SEC for alleged failure to register as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Binance's cloud mining services launch amid such regulatory challenges is a notable step, reflecting the exchange's commitment to advancing its services, even as it grapples with legal and regulatory issues. </p>
