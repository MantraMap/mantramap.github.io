<p>Following the launch of its successful beginner-level program in late 2022, Binance Academy, the education arm of the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, announced the launch of the free-to-learn intermediate-level courses this Tuesday. The courses aim to extend learning about Web 3 and crypto fundamentals and provide learners with an NFT certificate upon completion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The launch of the intermediate track bonds well with Binance&rsquo;s goal of &ldquo;making [crypto] education accessible to all&rdquo;, as Binance co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Yi He explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the industry leader, we are committed to driving innovation not just through our technology but also by making education accessible to all,&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;The Web3 sector is maturing rapidly. That&rsquo;s why we think it&rsquo;s important to equip people with the necessary knowledge - a mission we take to heart at Binance Academy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The intermediate-level courses will include a series of six courses (similar to the beginner track) expounding knowledge on blockchain, cryptocurrencies, DApps, DeFi, NFTs, and crypto trading. Each course will include five lessons designed to be completed within 60 to 90 minutes, with engaging quizzes at the end of each lesson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, Binance Academy has launched the first intermediate course &ndash; Blockchain Deep Dive &ndash; an online course that spans advanced concepts of blockchain, crypto, and Web3 information for the crypto-curious,&nbsp; delivering it in a structured curriculum. The course is currently available in English, with plans to launch the remaining five courses in multiple languages over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every learner will be eligible to receive an NFT certificate upon completing each of the six courses, which they can share on their resumes or social profiles.&nbsp;</p>
