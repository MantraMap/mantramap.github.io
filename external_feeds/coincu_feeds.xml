<li><em>Fireside Forum is a Web3 social platform that uses tokenomics to encourage positive social interactions and behavior online.</em></li>



<li><em>Pi Network</em>&#8216;s<em> vision with Fireside Forum is to revolutionize social interactions online by addressing societal issues and unlocking the full potential of the digital world.</em></li>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-7.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="309" height="642" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-7.png" alt="Pi Network Announces Fireside Forum, A New Web3 Social With Pi Cryptocurrency" class="wp-image-191355" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-7.png 309w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-7-144x300.png 144w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" title="Pi Network Announces Fireside Forum, A New Web3 Social With Pi Cryptocurrency 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The Forum aims to foster authenticity, constructive conversations, and healthier online social interactions. The tokenomics mechanism, powered by Pi cryptocurrency, allows Pioneers to create and organically curate content, and moderate behavior, providing the community with tools to manage the online environment in a decentralized way.</p>



<p>The forum intends to solve current popular Web2 social network issues using blockchain-powered technology to design the future of Web3 social experience. Pi team believes that a true Web3 social network should make advancements and improvements on the flaws of many Web2 social networks, such as propagating misinformation and disinformation, trolling, internet violence, information overload, low signal-to-noise ratio, information silos due to overuse of machine learning algorithms, etc.</p>

<p>Pi Network has been creating innovative designs and products to differentiate from Web2 in all three facets, ownership, distribution, and social interactions and experience. Fireside Forum was built based on Pi’s vision of how Web3 should work, prior academic research on issues of social networks and online behavior, and their own hypotheses about how blockchain and cryptocurrencies can mitigate such issues in the old web.</p>



<p>By revolutionizing social interactions online, Pi Network aims to foster a healthier and more responsible digital environment where people can engage in meaningful exchanges, be well-informed, and positively impact the global community. Reinventing our social interactions online is a matter of improving user experience, addressing broader societal issues, and unlocking the full potential of the digital world.</p>



<p>The design uses costs, rewards, disincentives, and intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. It strikes a balance among all of them to achieve its goals of improving online social interactions. Fireside Forum is another testament to Pi team’s commitment to developing utility-focused applications, where blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are used to solve real human needs, create innovations addressing larger social problems, and facilitate meaningful human connections worldwide.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the official announcement from the LSDFi unshETH protocol, the project confirmed a private key leak and has halted emergency withdrawals to protect users&#8217; funds.</strong></h5>

<p>The LSDFi protocol unshETH officially responded to last night&#8217;s security incident on Twitter at dawn this morning. The project said that around 22:00 on May 31, one of the implementation private keys of the unshETH contract was leaked.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At approximately 14:00 UTC (6 hrs ago), one of the deployer private keys for unshETH contracts was compromised.<br><br>Out of an abundance of caution, we emergency paused withdrawals on unshETH Ether.

</div></figure>



<p>Out of an abundance of caution, the official urgently suspended unshETH&#8217;s ETH withdrawals. According to the security model, unshETH&#8217;s ETH deposits (TVL up to $35 million) are protected by multi-signatures and time-locks, so there is no risk.</p>



<p>Additionally, several backend agreement contracts (liquidity mining pools, cross-chain bridges, etc.) have been hacked and are collaborating with white hat security experts from Coinbase, Stargate, Paladin Blockchain Security, Github, and ogle for the safety of user funds and Impact Area is expected to be restricted.</p>



<p>At the same time, the official contacted the hacker to try to negotiate the return of money and contract ownership to limit the impact on existing users.</p>

<p>Earlier, several KOLs tweeted that the protocol&#8217;s vault was suspected of having security issues and reminded users to move funds out as soon as possible.</p>



<p>The reason is that the contract owner has been tampered with, and the project official has been informed, but this official has yet to have an official response. However, the official said in Discord that emergency measures had been activated and the Ethereum funds involved are safe.</p>

<p>On-chain information shows that the contract owner&#8217;s rights were transferred two hours ago and are now moved to an unknown address 0xb815114245B6E0f7d31910ae87c58b35C7D39827.</p>



<p>On May 27, the LSDFi protocol hit a significant milestone seeing an unprecedented $25 million inflow in just one day.</p>



<p>Unsheth, a real-world commodity-backed synthetic asset offering, holds 12.9% of LSDFi TVL. Its inclusion in the LSDFi protocol underscores the need for diversified investment opportunities in the DeFi space.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has issued a circular on transitional arrangements for a new licensing system for virtual asset trading platforms.</em></li>



<li><em>This circular only applies to VATPs that provide trading services with non-security tokens.</em></li>



<li><em>During the transition period, the platform can continue to provide services from June 1, 2023, to May 31, 2024.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Yesterday, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/intermediaries/licensing/doc?refNo=23EC27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued </a>a circular on transitional arrangements for a new licensing system for virtual asset trading platforms willing to comply with the guidelines. </strong></h5>

<p>This circular provides a reasonable amount of time for them to apply for permits and to review and modify their systems and controls. Comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Virtual asset trading platforms that do not intend to apply for a license should proceed to close their business in an orderly manner.</p>



<p>Virtual asset trading platforms that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190058-huobi-hong-kong-cryptocurrency-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provide virtual asset services</a> in Hong Kong and have substantive and meaningful business before June 1, 2023, can be used between June 1, 2023 to May 31, 2024.</p>

<p>Please continue to provide virtual assets services in Hong Kong under a no-frills agreement without violating the licensing requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance. To be eligible for the forward agreement, virtual asset trading platforms must provide virtual asset services in Hong Kong by June 1, 2023.</p>



<p>Factors that SFC will consider when assessing whether VATP was operating and conducting genuine business with an actual presence in Hong Kong prior to June 1, 2023, include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Whether it is incorporated in Hong Kong;</li>



<li>Whether it has a physical office in Hong Kong;</li>



<li>Whether their Hong Kong employees exercise centralized management and control over VATP;</li>



<li>Whether the organization&#8217;s key employees (e.g., those responsible for operating the trading system) are based in Hong Kong;</li>



<li>Whether VATP&#8217;s operations are direct with independent customers and accurate trading volume in Hong Kong;</li>



<li>Are there other factors (e.g., the establishment of the trading system, trading arrangements, and organizational structure of the VATP) that could demonstrate that VATP was operating in Hong Kong before June 1. 2023 or not?</li>

<p>The statement comes after the crypto community went viral on Twitter, alleging that the exchange is experiencing insolvency due to an alleged connection between it and the cross-chain router protocol Multichain (MULTI).</p>



<p>The Gate.io team said &#8220;the company&#8217;s operations are going well&#8221; and that it is focusing on setting up an affiliated trading platform in Hong Kong called Gate.HK.</p>



<p>Rumors of Gate.io insolvency broke out after several events related to Multichain. On May 24, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence posted data showing a large MULTI inflow into Gate.io, which the Multichain project team &#8220;is said to have been captured in Shanghai&#8221; along with associated wallets about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in controlled money.</p>

<p>After seeing multiple MULTI and Fantom deposits into Gate.io, some Twitter users suspected that the exchange could be affected by Multichain.</p>



<p>Although the team at Gate.io has denied these rumors, saying that the exchange is processing all withdrawals and operating normally, it can still not prevent users from panicking to withdraw money to avoid risk.</p>

<p>According to Colin Wu, an independent cryptocurrency reporter, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency by trading volume plans to let off 20% of its staff next month. Nonetheless, this news comes after the crypto exchange had said that it would not lay off any of its employees.</p>



<p>CZ has <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1663945939482968075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> to Twitter to address the problem and deny the statements made in Wu Blockchain&#8217;s Twitter thread concerning layoffs at Binance. The reports were described as FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) by CZ, who emphasized the company&#8217;s steadfast commitment to talent and profitability.</p>



<p>According to Wu Blockchain, the overall number of Binance workers is about 8,000, with market rumors indicating that the company may lay off nearly 20% of its workforce next month.</p>



<p>Binance CEO added that the exchange conducts a continual &#8220;bottom-out&#8221; approach, which entails saying goodbye to employees who may not be compatible with the company&#8217;s unique culture or position. He provided a brief example of Work From Home (WFH) and noted that it is not suitable for everyone.</p>



<p>CZ emphasized that the &#8220;bottom-out&#8221; approach is ongoing and that he promotes it on a weekly basis. He said that the corporation must fire no more than % of its employees.</p>

<p>Additionally, Binance CEO reiterated his commitment to cost-cutting efforts such as optimizing server, airline, and food charges, among others. This dedication to efficiency has been critical to Binance&#8217;s success, allowing the firm to remain profitable since its fourth month of existence in October 2017, even amid difficult moments in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Patrick Hillmann, Binance&#8217;s Chief Communications Officer, reinforced CZ&#8217;s views in an earlier answer to Wu Blockchain, putting light on the volatile nature of the crypto business and the necessity for enterprises to stay disciplined and agile. He stressed the significance of reallocating resources internally and maintaining a pipeline of creative candidates to fulfill consumers&#8217; and the regulatory landscape&#8217;s continually changing expectations.</p>



<p>Binance is currently facing tough regulatory issues across regions with strict crypto policies, specifically the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191286-binance-pressured-by-canadian-regulators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian authorities</a>. </p>



<p>The exchange also <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191211-binance-stops-trading-of-privacy-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that it would delist privacy currencies for customers in certain regions beginning June 26. The action comes as the European Union continues to implement its groundbreaking Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191285-mica-is-now-signed-into-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MiCA</a> would specifically prohibit exchanges from offering privacy cryptocurrencies unless currency holders&#8217; identities were confirmed.</p>

<p>Cowen offers investment banking, research, sales, and trading. Its digital asset segment, created in 2022, was a bold step that included 16 digital assets among the assets supplied to its consumers, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.</p>



<p>Cowen Inc. was acquired by TD Bank Group, one of North America&#8217;s major banks, in March 2023, prompting the closure. According to an email shared with Bloomberg, the bank&#8217;s digital assets unit included at least ten workers and one intern.</p>

<p>According to the investigation, over 90 Chinese firms that provide fentanyl precursors accept cryptocurrency payments. After that, in evidence at the hearing, US Treasury Department Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Rosenberg acknowledged the link between illegal trade and digital assets.</p>



<p>Moreover, Rosenberg said that payments in cryptocurrency is &#8220;appealing&#8221; to Chinese pharma producers, citing Elliptic research.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Unfortunately, that is a mode that some of these precursor manufacturers and illicit drug organizations have used – the receipt of bitcoin payments in wallets, cryptocurrency wallets. The reason why they would find this appealing is the same reason that other financial criminals would find it appealing, which is to say there&#8217;s an element of pseudonymity that they seek,” said Rosenberg.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Overdoses using fentanyl have become the main cause of death in the United States for those aged 18 to 45. Chemicals required to make the hazardous drug are often imported from China and travel over numerous countries on their way to U.S. consumers of the synthetic opioid, which the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) claims are 100 times more strong than morphine.</p>

<p>Warren said that the Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act might aid in the abolition of the disease. She then said that the proposal would be reintroduced in Congress.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Crypto is helping fund the fentanyl trade, and we have the power to shut that down,” Warren said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/177571-elizabeth-warren-gets-strong-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, three US conservative groups oppose Republican Senators Roger Marshall, Warren, and Chris Van Hollen&#8217;s efforts on digital asset legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cross-chain project Multichain announced that it still does not know the situation of CEO Zhaojun, who has been rumored to be arrested by Chinese authorities.</em></li>



<li><em>The project will still not be able to work with certain blockchains.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Multichain, one of the most important bridge protocols in the crypto sector, said Wednesday that it was stopping cross-chain routes and that its CEO, Zhaojun, could not be reached.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1759.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1759.png" alt="Multichain Admits Lost Contact With CEO" class="wp-image-191302" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1759.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1759-300x180.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1759-768x461.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1759-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Multichain Admits Lost Contact With CEO 31"></a></figure></div>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;In the past two days, the Multichain protocol has experienced multiple issues due to unforeseeable circumstances. The team has done everything possible to maintain the protocol running, but we are currently unable to contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for maintenance,&#8221; the Multichain team said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Without server access, the surviving team <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1663941611380965376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indicated</a> that it could not maintain Kekchain, PublicMint, Dyno Chain, Red Light Chain, Dexit, Ekta, HPB, ONUS, Omax, Findora, and Planq bridges operational.</p>



<p>Following days of speculation, the revelation of Multichain&#8217;s server access difficulties confirmed that at least one important team member had gone missing.</p>



<p>The protocol&#8217;s issues were connected to its routers, which facilitate connections across chains. Routers 2 and 5, as well as Router 5, are impacted, affecting the connectivity between chains such as Kava, zkSync, and Polygon zkEVM.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The newest vulnerability, revealed today, impacts a number of chains, according to the team, who also highlighted that this problem is beyond the team&#8217;s present rights and capabilities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;In order to protect the interests of our users, we have decided to suspend the corresponding cross-chain service for the affected chain on the UI. Last week, the same issue happened on Router2,&#8221; the team added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191188-multichain-founder-arrested-in-shanghai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, the crypto world is abuzz with claims that Chinese authorities have jailed Multichain&#8217;s executive team and threatened to disrupt operations. Soon after this announcement, a number of wallets sold a big quantity of MULTI, while the Fantom Foundation removed a significant amount of liquidity from the pools due to worries about damaging the system. Multichain subsequently verified that the issue was caused by force majeure but provided no other details.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The EU has finally signed into law its groundbreaking MiCA rule.</em></li>



<li><em>The legislation was signed by Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament, and Peter Kullgren, Minister of Rural Affairs of Sweden.</em></li>



<li><em>MiCA will go into effect a few weeks after it is published in the EU&#8217;s official journal, which is expected in June.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The important Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) proposal seeks to standardize all cryptocurrency legislation throughout the EU&#8217;s 27 member states.

<p>The legislation was signed by European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and Swedish Rural Affairs Minister Peter Kullgren, coupled with a second anti-money laundering bill requiring crypto providers to authenticate their clients&#8217; identities before transferring payments.</p>



<p>The council has already given final approval to the MiCA rule. The ground-breaking law attempts to integrate crypto throughout the EU. It was, however, postponed until February. It has now received final clearance.</p>



<p>The announcement was made on Twitter by the Swedish government, which is presiding over legislative discussions as the EU president. </p>

<p>On April 20, the European Parliament passed the European Union&#8217;s (EU) MiCA encryption rules. This remarkable move brings Europe one step closer to being the first area to enact comprehensive laws for the booming cryptocurrency industry. The enforcement phase will begin in June 2023 after the fulfillment of a few remaining administrative procedures.</p>



<p>Its regulations, which provide crypto exchanges and wallet providers permission to operate within the 27-nation bloc and require stablecoin issuers to keep enough reserves, will go into effect between 12 and 18 months later.</p>

<p>MiCA was initially suggested by the European Commission in 2020, and it sparked debate when legislators were on the verge of including ecologically friendly requirements that may have amounted to a ban on Bitcoin&#8217;s proof-of-work algorithm.</p>



<p>This achievement marks a big step forward in tackling the issues connected with the growing use of digital assets.</p>



<p>Although the rules were widely applauded, the industry&#8217;s focus has now shifted to the next stage of EU crypto legislation, with future regulations possibly addressing themes like staking, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized financing. When it is implemented, MiCA will put crypto-asset services and activities within EU regulatory jurisdiction.</p>



<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191269-eba-raises-vigilance-against-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began</a> a public consultation on proposed changes to its Guidelines on money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk factors. This is also seen as a move to strengthen the comprehensive system for digital assets across the EU in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Despite the fact that Binance has exited the local market, the Ontario Securities Commission is examining it.</em></li>



<li><em>The Canadian Securities Commission is looking into the exchange for suspected securities law violations.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance has subsequently been summoned by the OSC to provide documentation for the probe.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A document published by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) suggests Canada&#8217;s biggest watchdog is examining Binance&#8217;s activities in this nation, weeks after the global crypto behemoth announced its withdrawal from Canada because it did not agree with new restrictions imposed by the country&#8217;s authorities.</strong></h5>

<p>The OSC issued an investigative order to the world&#8217;s biggest digital asset exchange on May 10, according to a filing this month with the Capital Markets Tribunal. Binance announced its withdrawal from the market two days later, citing new regulatory instructions on stablecoins and investment limitations.</p>



<p>According to the petition, the OSC&#8217;s ruling ordered &#8220;an exceptionally wide examination into whether Binance may have taken efforts to evade Ontario securities legislation and compliance procedures in regard to Binance.com or engaged in conduct contrary to Ontario securities law and/or the public interest.&#8221;</p>



<p>The exchange has been subjected to increased regulatory and legal attention in a number of places in recent years, most notably by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which has filed a lawsuit against the company and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Although the order&#8217;s specifics were not immediately accessible, Binance said that the OSC was motivated by the CFTC&#8217;s action.</p>



<p>When questioned why Binance chose to exit the Canadian market, Zhao, a Canadian citizen, said in a Twitter Post on Wednesday that he no longer thought it was feasible to run a profitable company there due to the new rules.</p>

<p>The OSC has subsequently summoned Binance to provide papers for the probe, which the exchange stated earlier this month it could not comply with because the summons was not detailed enough. According to a petition issued on Monday, the Capital Markets Tribunal ordered the exchange to comply with the summons at a hearing on May 26.</p>



<p>Despite its attempts to expand globally, including launches in areas like the UAE and Thailand, Binance has recently faced increased regulatory and legal scrutiny across various jurisdictions. The transaction has been the subject of litigation, investigations, and heightened regulatory supervision. The OSC&#8217;s investigative order adds to the exchange&#8217;s long list of legal difficulties.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s departure highlights the problems created by Canada&#8217;s enhanced cryptocurrency regulations, which were implemented in reaction to the bankruptcy of crypto behemoth FTX last year. Several large exchanges, like OKX and Bybit, have also left the Canadian market, while Coinbase Global Inc. has decided to remain and seek registration under the new legislation.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the European Banking Authority <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191269-eba-raises-vigilance-against-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> draft guidelines advising crypto businesses to keep an eye out for consumers utilizing privacy coins in order to detect suspected money laundering activities. As a result, Binance plans to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191211-binance-stops-trading-of-privacy-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delist privacy coins</a> in France, Italy, Poland, and Spain.</p>
