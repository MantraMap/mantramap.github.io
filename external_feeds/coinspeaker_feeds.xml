<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-holdings-selling-units/">MicroStrategy Increases Its Bitcoin Holdings While Also Selling Off 704 Units</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BTC) bullish Wall Street company in the world, </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microstrategy-incorporated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MicroStrategy Incorporated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NASDAQ: MSTR) has </span><a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-8-k-12-28-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it has increased its Bitcoin holdings by exactly 2,395 units as of Tuesday, December 27. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the regulatory filing published by the firm, the acquisition of the digital currency spanned from November 1 this year through December 21. The purchases were made via the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, MacroStrategy LLC and it is worth a monetary value of $42.8 million in cash, at an average price of approximately $17,871 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its latest acquisitions, the company’s founder and Executive Chairman <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/michael-saylor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Saylor</a> confirmed via Twitter that the firm now holds approximately 132,500 bitcoin acquired for about $4.03 billion at an average price of roughly $30,397 per BTC.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MicroStrategy has increased its <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> Holdings by ~2,500 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a>. As of 12/27/22 <a href="https://twitter.com/MicroStrategy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MicroStrategy</a> holds ~132,500 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03 billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per bitcoin. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MSTR&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MSTR</a><a href="https://t.co/lcMeULcGQk">https://t.co/lcMeULcGQk</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1608086703843180544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By reason of its latest acquisition, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy now comes off as a publicly traded entity that is most heavily invested in Bitcoin. Its acquisition spree started back in August 2020 and the firm has not relented in investing its excess liquidity into BTC despite scrutiny from analysts and observers as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the prices of Bitcoin down by more than 66% in the year-to-date period according to data from Coingecko, many advocates now is the best time to accumulate the digital currency. Riding on the economic term of buy low and sell high, MicroStrategy exemplifies a firm that is known for buying the deep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news of the acquisition might be impacting the current price performance of Bitcoin whose price has pared off most of its losses and is now </span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changing hands at $16,765.33</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, down 0.49% over the past 24 hours. Prior to the announcement, BTC was down by more than 2%.</span></p>
<h2><b>MicroStrategy Inc’s Subtle Bitcoin Selloff</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A close look at the regulatory filing shared by the firm showed that it offloaded a total of 704 Bitcoin units worth approximately $11.8 million. As revealed by Microstrategy, the Bitcoin selloff was necessary in order to garner tax benefits that have an underlying benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On December 22, 2022, MacroStrategy sold approximately 704 bitcoins for cash proceeds of approximately $11.8 million, at an average price of approximately $16,776 per bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. MicroStrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit,” the announcement reads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selloff news and its presentation may not derail the optimism in the hearts of many Bitcoin investors and proponents who believe the coin can end the year with a relatively marginal profit. The company has renewed its commitment to continually stack up the coins with no </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microstrategy-rumors-selling-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">immediate plans to offload its bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p>The Tesla stock has fallen 44% in December and more than 59% during the fourth quarter of this year. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-worst-month-quarter-year/">Tesla (TSLA) Stock Might Record Its Worst Month, Quarter and Year</a></p>
<p>It seems that there&#8217;s no end to the free fall in the price of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock. On Tuesday, December 27, the TSLA stock ended another 11% in red with its year-to-date losses now surging to 72%.</p>
<p>What seems is that Tesla might hit a negative record on three fronts making it the worst month, quarter, and year for the electric carmaker. Among all valuable tech companies, Tesla has now even surpassed Meta for being the worst-performing stock of the year 2022.</p>
<p>The latest negative sentiment around the TSLA stock comes as the company plans for a weeklong production halt at its Shanghai gigafactory as the Chinese workforce faces the onslaught of rising Covid cases. Shanghai has been currently battered by a fresh wave of rising Covid cases.</p>
<p>As per the Reuters report, Tesla&#8217;s Shanghai plant will reopen in January, and that too for just 17 days. Tesla stock has dropped the most among its other competitors in the automobile space. For e.g. the stock price of Ford is down by 46% and that of General Motors is down by 43%. Since its IPO in 2010, the TSLA stock price has fallen and ended in negative only in one year, 2016, before 2022.</p>
<p>Part of Tesla&#8217;s recent fall is also due to Elon Musk&#8217;s selling of the TSLA stock holdings to fund his $4 billion Twitter acquisition. As per the filings mid-December, Elon Musk sold nearly 22 million more shares of Tesla worth around $3.6 billion.</p>
<h2>Elon Musk Won&#8217;t Further Sell His Tesla Holdings</h2>
<p>During his recent Twitter Space on December 22, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> assured that he would be not selling the rest of his Tesla holdings for 18 to 24 months from now. Musk also said that the Fed rate hikes are responsible for the TSLA price drop. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“People will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Musk&#8217;s assurances, however, have played little role in halting any further fall in the TSLA stock. The trading volumes for the TSLA stock have skyrocketed this month. This month, the TSLA stock price plunged by 44% making this its worst month ever. Similarly, during Q4, the TSLA stock is down by more than 59%.</p>
<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s major focus on Twitter recently has irked Tesla investors. Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives wrote that Musk&#8217;s leadership issues are posing deeper problems for the electric carmaker. “At the same time that Tesla is cutting prices and inventory is starting to build globally in face of a likely global recession, Musk is viewed as ‘asleep at the wheel’ from a leadership perspective,” he <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/12/27/tesla-stock-musk-twitter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>. However, Ives still maintains a buy recommendation on the TSLA stock.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-sbf-alameda-robinhood-shares/">Disgraced FTX Founder SBF Took Money from Alameda to Buy Robinhood Shares</a></p>
<p>As the case against disgraced <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> founder Sam Bankman-Fried proceeds, new developments have come to the surface. As per the recent court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njb.1094107/gov.uscourts.njb.1094107.19.7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">documents</a>, FTX chief <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> together with the company&#8217;s co-founder borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from its sister firm Alameda Research in order to purchase shares of a popular trading app Robinhood Markets (HOOD).</p>
<p>As per the affidavit produced in the Caribbean court ahead of the arrest earlier this month, SBF said that he and his co-founder Gary Wang borrowed a total of $546 million from Alameda. Later, they used that money to capitalize Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd. It was a shell corporation that purchased a 7.6% stake in Robinhood in May 2022.</p>
<p>This affidavit opens up new doors in the race to claim the 56 million shares of Robinhood. Along with Sam Bankman-Fried, crypto lender BlockFi and FTX Group are also attempting to claim the shares, which could probably be worth $440 million now.</p>
<p>After the FTX episode, crypto lender BlockFi has been facing major liquidity issues and had to file for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blockfi-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bankruptcy</a>. Additionally, the crypto lender has also slapped a lawsuit on Sam Bankman-Fried for its claim over the Robinhood shares.</p>
<h2>New Judge Takes Up SBF&#8217;s Fraud Case</h2>
<p>Citing a court filing, Reuters reported that the criminal case against FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been assigned to US Judge Lewis Kaplan. Judge Kaplan was also responsible for overseeing the high-profile defamation lawsuits against former US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The development comes as former appointee US District Judge Ronnie Abrams had to withdraw from the FTX case since her husband was a partner at the law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell which had advised FTX in 2021. In a filing last Friday, Abrams <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23531804-order-in-ftx-case-judge-abrams-recuses-herself-after-delayed-transcripts-unsealed-recusal-order-here-whos-next-innercitypresscom-is-on-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My husband has had no involvement in any of these representations. Nonetheless, to avoid any possible conflict, or the appearance of one, the Court hereby recuses itself from this action.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>US DoJ Launches Probe into FTX Hack</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice is now investigating the $400 million hack that happened just a few hours after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month. Bloomberg was the first to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-27/us-probes-how-372-million-vanished-in-hack-after-ftx-bankruptcy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> this news citing an unidentified source.</p>
<p>The collapse of the crypto exchange FTX has been one of the biggest path-breaking incidents in the history of crypto. The US authorities have accused him of committing or conspiring to commit fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud US investors.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/argo-helios-mining-facility-galaxy-digital/">Argo to Sell Helios Mining Facility to Galaxy Digital, Needs Extra Capital to Avoid Bankruptcy</a></p>
<p>Argo Blockchain has <a href="https://argoblockchain.com/news-room/2022-december-helios-sale-to-galaxy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly</a> agreed to sell its Helios mining facility to digital asset and blockchain-centric company Galaxy Digital. Argo will sell the Helios mining plant to Galaxy Digital for $65 million as part of its plans to stave off bankruptcy. The embattled Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) mining company has been seeking extra capital to avoid filing for bankruptcy. According to reports, Argo Blockchain expects to close its Helios acquisition deal with Galaxy today, December 28th.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the deal, Galaxy will provide Argo with a new asset-backed loan in an aggregate principal amount of $35 million (£29 million). The initial term for the said deal is 36 months, with financing entailing a collateral package that includes 23,619 Helios Bitmain mining machines.</p>
<p>Argo could use the cash proceeds from the Helios sale and some of its assets-backed loan to cover all financial obligations. These include repaying all existing indebtedness, prepayment interest, and other fees amounting to several millions owed to numerous creditors.</p>
<h2>Argo Views Helios Sale to Galaxy Digital as Only Recourse to Remain Afloat</h2>
<p>In October, Argo <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/argo-blockchain-stock-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> it might slip into insolvency unless it secured additional capital to remain afloat. This gloomy forecast came after a rescue deal fell through. At the time, Argo explained in a statement to the London Stock Exchange:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As previously disclosed, the Company signed a non-binding LOI with a strategic investor to raise approximately £24 million ($27 million) via a subscription for ordinary shares. The Company no longer believes that this subscription will be consummated under the previously announced terms. Argo is continuing to explore other financing opportunities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, Argo explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>“While Argo is exploring other financing opportunities, there can be no assurance that any definitive agreements will be signed or that any transactions will be consummated. Should Argo be unsuccessful in completing any further financing, Argo would become cash flow negative in the near term.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The company concluded that should it fail to secure financing, it would need to curtail or cease operations.</p>
<p>Surging energy costs and falling BTC prices adversely impacted Argo&#8217;s bottom line and squeezed its margins. Earlier in the month, the London Stock Exchange temporarily suspended the Bitcoin miner after it accidentally reported bankruptcy. In addition, the Nasdaq also suspended trading again on Tuesday in anticipation of the Argo bankruptcy announcement.</p>
<h2>Crypto Credit Crunch</h2>
<p>Argo is just one of a growing number of crypto firms close to being hit or already hit with bankruptcy. The Bitcoin-mining industry has been in a tailspin over the past few months and has seen its profit margins taper.</p>
<p>Other players in the industry that have collapsed due to the prevailing crypto market parameters include <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/core-scientific-bankruptcy-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Core Scientific</a> (NASDAQ: CORZ) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>. Furthermore, three months ago, BTC mining hosting company Compute North also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bankruptcy-filing-compute-north/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed for</a> Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>The price of digital currencies is also trading down significantly compared to the same period last year. For instance, leading crypto Bitcoin is currently changing hands at just over $16K. In November last year, the coin rose to an all-time high of approximately $70K.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japan-ban-foreign-issued-stablecoins/">Japan Considers Lifting Ban on Foreign-Issued Stablecoins</a></p>
<p>The Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan has reportedly announced a draft system and guidelines for the circulation of stablecoins that are pegged on legal currencies like the USD, Pounds, etc. In June, the Japanese parliament passed a bill to limit stablecoin issuance to banks and trust companies, hindering non-financial institutions from accessing them. At the time, the government intended to protect investors and the entire financial system from risks associated with the rising adoption of stablecoins. Japan witnessed a massive adoption of stablecoins as the market climbed to around 20 trillion yen.</p>
<h2>Japan Could Ease Restriction on Stablecoins</h2>
<p>According to the 26th of December announcement <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB2652D0W2A221C2000000/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by the local news agency Nikkei, the new framework will be in effect as early as 2023, in conjunction with the revised Payment Services Act. Upon its implementation, local crypto exchanges in Japan will be permitted to distribute foreign-issued stablecoins. However, these stablecoins will be provided if only they can prove sufficient collateral. The report added, &#8220;if payment using stablecoins spreads, international remittances may become faster and cheaper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stablecoins are designed to stabilize other crypto assets that are typically volatile. Stablecoins are also tied to fiat currencies or commodities like gold. The latest measure in Japan will broaden the service rejected by crypto exchanges to include stablecoins. Currently, no Japanese exchanges provide trading in stablecoins like USDC or USDT. Official data also revealed that not one of the 31 exchanges operating in the country offers stablecoin services as of the 30th of November.</p>
<p>The new move by Japan to allow the distribution of stablecoins means that there would be stricter regulations on Anti-Money Laundering controls. Starting from the 26th, the FSA has started collecting public feedback on the proposal for easing the stablecoin ban in Japan. A separate report explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As early as next year, the Financial Services Agency will lift the ban on the domestic distribution of foreign-issued coins for &#8220;stablecoin,&#8221; which aim to be linked to legal currencies such as the US dollar. In distribution, anti-money laundering (money laundering) measures are also required. However, the effectiveness of recording transaction information is questioned.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Digital Yen</h2>
<p>In other news, the Bank of Japan <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bank-of-japan-digital-yen-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans to experiment</a> with the digital yen in 2023. The central bank is reportedly looking forward to a proof-of-concept trial of the digital currency. To achieve this, it will collaborate with three megabanks and regional banks on a pilot test, including a demo experiment. Although there is no specific time frame for the release of the digital yen, there is security assurance. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda called for preventing risks that may come with adopting and using the digital yen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/daily-crypto-trading-volume-market-cap-800b/">Daily Crypto Trading Volume at Multi-Year Low as Total Market Cap Falls below $800B</a></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency market has significantly shrunk in 2022, with over $2.2 trillion liquidated in the past twelve months. According to aggregate data from the block, the daily crypto spot trading volume on all exchanges has dipped below $10 billion for the first time since December 2020. The Terra Luna and FTX collapse are the largest contributors to the 2022 crypto bear market aside from other macroeconomic factors.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, December 28, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is at approximately $797 billion, according to data provided by Binance-backed Coinmarketcap. Notably, while the total crypto market volume stands at about $29 billion, stablecoins control the largest share with approximately $27 billion. The total volume in the decentralized financial ecosystem (DeFi) is currently around $2.33 billion, 7.81 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.</p>
<h2>Closer Look at the Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market is consequently morphing to accommodate the global economy. Traditional financial institutions and big tech corporations are adopting blockchain technology. Moreover, governments worldwide are working closely with cryptocurrency companies to regulate the industry in preparation for mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>However, the collapse of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges by daily traded volume, FTX, has raised concerns on the general state of the crypto market. Furthermore, about 1 million FTX traders and investors have been left stranded following the FTT collapse.</p>
<p>As a result, cryptocurrency traders have migrated en masse from centralized exchanges (CEX) to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in the past two months. Additionally, non-custodial crypto wallets have recorded tremendous gains in global customers as seen with Binance-backed Trust Wallet and its TWT token.</p>
<p>The non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a>) volume has also slumped significantly since April 2022. The Trump Digital Trading Cards (TRUMP), which recently entered the industry at the top position, is currently ranked 42 with a floor price of $179.27, and a 24-hour sales volume of 51.6 ETH.</p>
<p>One of the most hit crypto projects by the 2022 bear market is the Solana (SOL) project, which has dropped approximately $94 per cent in the past year. Notably, the Solana ecosystem was heavily bolstered by the FTX and Alameda network. Furthermore, most of the Solana tokens were listed and traded on the FTX exchange and leveraged with the FTT tokens.</p>
<h2>Way Forward</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry is expected to be trapped in the ongoing bear market in 2023. Moreover, historical data and current fundamental aspects show more liquidations ahead. As such, market strategists forecast the total trading volume will slump further, thereby leaving more crypto exchanges at risk of bankruptcy.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/kraken-stop-operations-japan/">Kraken to Stop Operations in Japan by January</a></p>

<p>For a second time, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/kraken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kraken</a> has <a href="https://blog.kraken.com/post/16923/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E6%9A%97%E5%8F%B7%E8%B3%87%E7%94%A3%E4%BA%A4%E6%8F%9B%E6%A5%AD%E3%81%AE%E5%BB%83%E6%AD%A2%E3%81%AE%E3%81%8A%E7%9F%A5%E3%82%89%E3%81%9B/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> it will stop its operations in Japan, even as it looks to cut costs amid a weak global crypto market. Kraken announced this via a blog post on its website.</p>
<p>It said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Current market conditions in Japan in combination with a weak crypto market globally mean the resources needed to further grow our business in Japan aren’t justified at this time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the exchange, it will stop servicing its clients in Japan through Payward Asia, effectively ceasing its operations by Jan. 31, 2023. The firm also plans to deregister from the Financial Services Agency.</p>
<h2>Repeating History</h2>
<p>Previously, Kraken pulled out of the Japanese market in April 2018 after an initial four-year stint. At the time, the exchange noted the move would allow it to deploy resources on growing in other geographical locations. Later in 2020, the exchange relaunched through Payward Asia Inc. Headquartered in Tokyo, Kraken began offering spot trading services on five assets to expand.</p>
<p>While assuring all affected clients it is fully funded to cover the withdrawals surge, Kraken noted it will continue to process withdrawals until Jan 31st to allow enough time for affected clients to withdraw their assets. Asides from this, the exchange plans to remove all withdrawal limits by January. Also, Kraken will disable the deposit functions from January 9. Additionally, it will allow users to withdraw their staked Ether.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, affected users can transfer their crypto holdings to an external wallet or convert them to fiat and transfer them to their domestic bank account. The firm assured. It also noted that pulling out of the Japanese market will have no financial bearing on its global business.</p>
<h2>Staying Afloat in a Weak Crypto Market</h2>
<p>Pulling out of the Japanese market is the latest of Kraken’s moves to cut costs and service the weak crypto market.</p>
<p>Recently, the firm announced it was downsizing its global workforce. The exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/employee-layoffs-kraken-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut its workforce</a> by 30%, leading to the loss of 1,100 jobs. While citing lower trading volumes and fewer client sign-ups, Kraken noted cutting down expenses was necessary for the business to survive in the long term.</p>
<p>Kraken is not alone. Many other cryptos and digital asset companies have announced job cuts, including Block, Lemon Cash, Playtika, Valkyrie, and Galaxy Digitals.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/kaspersky-malware-lazarus-group/">Kaspersky Forewarns of New Malware Scheme by Lazarus Group Affiliate BlueNoroff</a></p>
<p>Kaspersky recently reported that a Lazarus affiliate might enhance its sophisticated malware attacks on crypto startups in 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/kaspersky-malware-lazarus-group/">Kaspersky Forewarns of New Malware Scheme by Lazarus Group Affiliate BlueNoroff</a></p>
<p>According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, a North Korean-state-sponsored group of hackers called Lazarus Group has <a href="https://decrypt.co/118031/north-korea-linked-lazarus-group-poses-as-vc-firms-to-spread-malware" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">started</a> a new malware-spreading scheme. Kaspersky recently released a new <a href="https://securelist.com/bluenoroff-methods-bypass-motw/108383/?reseller=usa_regular-sm_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_twi_post_sm-team______&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=us_regular-sm_en0177&amp;utm_content=sm-post&amp;utm_term=us_twitter_organic_vome177wjgciy7v" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> which alleges that Lazarus now poses as venture capitalist firms to spread malware. The security researchers also stated that BlueNoroff, the group linked with Lazarus, can use the malware to circumvent Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) security measures. With its venture capitalist façade, BlueNoroff operates under the pretext of wanting to invest in digital currencies.</p>
<p>In its report, Kaspersky explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[BlueNoroff] created numerous fake domains that look like venture capital and bank domains. Most of the domains imitate Japanese venture capital companies, indicating that the group has an extensive interest in Japanese financial entities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Kaspersky added that the Lazarus-associated threat actors had imitated popular VC platforms to spread malware. These include Beyond Next Ventures, Angel Bridge, Bank of America, and Mizuho Financial Group. According to Kaspersky, it detected BlueNoroff’s global attacks targeting crypto startups in January this year. However, the cybersecurity platform also stated that the hackers’ activities dropped until the fall season.</p>
<p>Kaspersky noted that BlueNoroff uses its malware to attack organizations that run operations using digital and Web3 mediums. These channels include smart contracts, decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>), blockchain, as well as the fintech industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, BlueNoroff tested different file types to refine malware delivery methods. According to Kaspersky, the Lazarus Group affiliate deployed the previously unseen Windows Batch file Visual Basic Script as part of its testing. “As we can see from our latest finding, this notorious actor has introduced slight modifications to deliver their malware,” the researchers concluded.</p>
<h2>Kaspersky Says Lazarus-affiliated Phishing Group not Slowing Down on Malware Practices</h2>
<p>Kaspersky opines that BlueNoroff, which constitutes approximately 1,700 individuals spread around the globe, would not slow down its operations anytime soon. So far, the phishing group has deployed more than 70 domains in its quest to steal from crypto startups.</p>
<p>Foreboding an even bigger and busier 2023 for BlueNoroff and other phishing groups, researcher Seongsu Park <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/12/27/2579898/0/en/Kaspersky-finds-BlueNoroff-APT-actor-disguised-itself-as-VC-firms-to-deliver-new-malware.html">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The coming year will be marked by the cyber epidemics with the biggest impact, the strength of which has been never seen before. […] On the threshold of new malicious campaigns, businesses must be more secure than ever.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The BlueNoroff Lazarus subgroup first came to the fore following its attack on the Bangladeshi central bank in 2016. In an April alert, the subgroup was also among a group of North Korean cyber threats mentioned by a US cyber-attack watchdog. According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation at the time, the North Korean hacker threat called for enhanced security measures by crypto firms.</p>
<p>Also in April, a specialized unit of the US Treasury Department alleged that the Lazarus Group was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/north-korean-lazarus-group-allegedly-behind-ronin-bridge-hack" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">behind the Ronin Bridge hack</a>. The hack took place in March this year and was worth more than $600 million at the time.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/argo-blockchain-suspends-trading-nasdaq/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/argo-blockchain-suspends-trading-nasdaq/">Bitcoin Miner Argo Blockchain Suspends Trading on Nasdaq amid Upcoming Announcement</a></p>
<p>On Tuesday, December 27, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> miner Argo blockchain <a href="https://decrypt.co/118003/bitcoin-miner-argo-blockchain-suspends-trading-nasdaq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> that it has suspended trading on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nasdaq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq</a> platform because of an upcoming announcement expected on Wednesday.</p>
<h2>Argo Blockchain Trading on Nasdaq</h2>
<p>It is a temporary suspension and trading of its American depositary shares (ADS) will resume once again on Wednesday. In its press release, Argo blockchain said that it needs to suspend trading because of an announcement on Wednesday, and also because the London Stock Exchange was closed on December 27.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">At our request, <a href="https://twitter.com/Nasdaq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Nasdaq</a> temporarily suspended trading of Argo’s ADSs and unsecured notes for today &#8211; Tues Dec 27.</p>
<p>We’ll be making an announcement tomorrow (Dec 28) via RNS before the <a href="https://twitter.com/LSEplc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LSEplc</a> opens in the UK…we expect trading on Nasdaq to resume tomorrow.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ARB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ARB</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARBK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ARBK</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Argo (@ArgoBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArgoBlockchain/status/1607740972372197377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As stated, the UK-based bitcoin miner is also listed on the London Stock Exchange. Argo blockchain had temporarily suspended trading earlier this month after they announced being at risk of insufficient funds to support internal operations.</p>
<p>The recent development on Tuesday once again puts investors on the edge of staying concerned about the company&#8217;s operations.</p>
<h2>Is Argo on the Verge of Bankruptcy?</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, Bitcoin miner Argo blockchain accidentally published the draft materials on its website adding that they have inadvertently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. In response, Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange suspended trading of its shares. However, Argo blockchain later clarified that they haven&#8217;t filed for bankruptcy and requested the exchanges to resume trading its shares.</p>
<p>Instead, the Bitcoin miner said that they were in advanced negotiations with a third party to sell certain assets while securing equipment financing. Argo Blockchain <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/argo-blockchain-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The company is hopeful that it will be able to consummate the transaction outside of a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the United States, although there is no assurance that the company can avoid such a filing&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier in October, Argo had also warned that it could become cashflow negative in the case it failed to raise money after its financial deal fell through. In such a case, the company might have to cease operations.</p>
<p>In another update on December 16, Argo said that it has been facing negative attention from Nasdaq since its stock price traded under $1 for 30 consecutive days in a row. If the company fails to get its stock price again above $1 in the next 180 days, it could be at risk of delisting from Nasdaq.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">New RNS: we received notice from <a href="https://twitter.com/Nasdaq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Nasdaq</a> as our ADSs have closed below $1 for 30 trading days</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>2022 has been one of the toughest years for Bitcoin mining companies. Some of the top players like Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital, Core Scientific, Agro Blockchain and Bitfarms have all announced bankruptcies.

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mango-markets-attacker-arrested-puerto-rico/">Mango Markets Hacker Arrested in Puerto Rico to Face Fraud Charges</a></p>
<p>Authorities from the United States have arrested Avraham Eisenberg, the alleged hacker of the Mango Markets Decentralized Exchange (DEX). According to a <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/198172/mango-markets-exploiter-arrested-in-puerto-rico-for-alleged-market-manipulation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> by The Block, Federal prosecutors from the Justice Department arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico and he will be made to face charges in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p>This year was particularly a year with numerous cyberattacks, many of which the perpetrators were never caught. The exploit of Mango Markets by Eisenberg saw him <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/solana-mango-116m-cyber-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drain over $114 million</a> from the protocol in October as Coinspeaker reported at the time. It was believed that Eisenberg was not working alone, however, there have been no words from his team following his arrest.</p>
<p>To carry out the exploit, Eisenberg purchased a large amount of MNGO, the native token of the Solana-based DEX. This purchase move contributed to the inflation of the price of the coin, a situation prosecutors are calling a market manipulation event. When the coin’s price shot up, Eisenberg then borrowed more valuable and stable cryptocurrencies on the platform without the intention of paying back.</p>
<p>When MNGO retraced its growth, Eisenberg’s debts went into a somewhat positive deficit for him but detrimental to the platform as there was no way he could cover the shortfall. In the usual spirit of ethical hacking, Eisenberg identified himself as the attacker and negotiation ensued between him and the protocol.</p>
<p>An agreement was reached for him to take a bounty worth $47 million from the stolen funds and he voluntarily <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mango-markets-exploiter-67m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned the remaining $67 million</a> to the protocol. In the decentralized world, such transactions are often applauded and the hackers are celebrated as though they are contributing to the security advances of the protocol.</p>
<h2>Federal Prosecutors See the Mango Markets Exploit Differently</h2>
<p>Eisenberg was arrested by the DOJ because the regulator believes no act of market manipulation can be justified by law. The authorities chose to let the natural cause of the law to prevail despite the proponents of Decentralized Finance (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>) and its associated innovations already defining their own rules.</p>
<p>Eisenberg is being charged with commodities fraud and commodities manipulation according to the charges filed against him.</p>
<p>Each case in the emerging world of cryptocurrency is often unique and has almost no precedents. This Mango Markets exploit case is one of such as Eisenberg’s defense may focus on the fact that he was acting as a Whitehack and that he has settled with the developers and community of the DEX.</p>
<p>There are several instances of attacks that are even higher in profile than this and one of such is the Poly Network exploits back in 2021. As <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hackers-600-million-poly-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by Coinspeaker at the time, more than $600 million was looted from the protocol but the hacker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/poly-network-hackers-return-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> all the stolen funds in a rare productive negotiation with the protocol’s developers.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-stock-all-time-low-holiday/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
