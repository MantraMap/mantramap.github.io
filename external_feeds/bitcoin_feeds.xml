A total of 69 leaders, including all African heads of state, have already been invited to the August summit where de-dollarization will be among the key topics discussed.</strong></p>
<h2>Russian Official on BRICS Currency</h2>
<p>Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk stated in an interview with Russian news outlet Tass on the sidelines of the second Russia-Africa summit this week that the issue of creating a basket of BRICS currencies may be raised at the economic bloc’s upcoming summit that will take place from Aug. 22-24. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>The Russian official was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The BRICS leaders will hold a meeting soon where they may touch upon the settlement system issue. Perhaps, the idea of creating a basket of currencies based on a certain payment unit will also be discussed.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the leaders will decide to task the relevant expert bodies with looking into the matter,&#8221; Overchuk added, emphasizing: &#8220;Clearly, it’s a very difficult issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the Russian deputy prime minister believes that the topic of a common BRICS currency could be discussed at the summit, South Africa’s diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, Anil Sooklal, has stated: &#8220;There’s never been talk of a BRICS currency, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">it’s not on the agenda</a>.&#8221; South Africa is hosting the BRICS summit this year, and Sooklal is in charge of planning the agenda for the summit.</p>
<p>Moreover, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, recently clarified that the economic bloc has no immediate plan to launch a currency to compete with the U.S. dollar. Noting the distinction between de-dollarization efforts and the creation of a common BRICS currency, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">stressed</a>: “The development of anything alternative is indeed a medium to long-term ambition.” Both Maasdorp and Sooklal have stressed that the BRICS bloc is focusing on de-dollarization and encouraging the use of national currencies for trade settlements.</p>

<p>Furthermore, rumors abound that the BRICS group might unveil a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">gold-backed currency</a> during the summit. Many people believe that a unified BRICS currency could erode the U.S. dollar&#8217;s status as the world&#8217;s dominant currency. Nevertheless, obstacles lie ahead. Russia&#8217;s central bank governor, for instance, has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-central-bank-brics-currency-requires-consent-of-many-parties-faces-implementation-challenges/">cautioned</a> that a BRICS currency will require the consent of numerous parties, and she foresees potential challenges in its implementation.</p>
<p>The BRICS has drawn interest from <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">over 40 countries</a> seeking to join the group. According to Sooklal, 22 nations have already formally applied. Moreover, the diplomat has revealed that South Africa has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-invites-69-leaders-to-august-summit-western-countries-omitted/">invited 69 leaders</a> to the summit, including all of the African heads of state and the leaders of major Global South bodies. However, he affirmed that no Western countries have been invited.</p>

They want someone they control to control your assets,” said Congressman Warren Davidson who introduced the bill.</strong></p>
<h2>Keep Your Coins Act of 2023 Advances</h2>
<p>The U.S. House Committee on Financial Services passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4841/BILLS-118hr4841ih.xml">Keep Your Coins Act of 2023</a> (H.R. 4841) on Thursday. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH), “would ensure that consumers are allowed to maintain custody of their digital assets in self-hosted wallets,” ⁦the committee described.</p>
<p>Congressman Davidson tweeted Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night, U.S. House Committee on Financial Services⁩ passed my bill to protect self-custody. Those attacking self-custody oppose individual freedom. They want someone they control to control your assets. Defend Freedom.</p></blockquote>
<p>Keep Your Coins Act of 2023 prohibits federal agencies &#8220;from restricting the use of convertible virtual currency by a person to purchase goods or services for the person&#8217;s own use, and for other purposes,&#8221; according to the text of the bill.</p>
<p>In addition, federal agencies may not prohibit, restrict, or otherwise impair a person&#8217;s ability to &#8220;self-custody digital assets using a self-hosted wallet or other means to conduct transactions for any lawful purpose,” the bill adds.</p>

<p>Many people took to Twitter to thank Congressman Davidson for protecting self-custody. Rep. Davidson &#8220;is America’s NUMBER ONE protector of self-custody and a person’s fundamental right to individual financial freedom,&#8221; lawyer John E. Deaton wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;The debate on Rep. Warren Davidson’s self-custody bill was important. He speaks powerfully about foundational questions regarding the relationship of the individual &amp; the state &amp; why public policy shouldn’t begin with a presumption of surveillance. We are lucky to have his leadership,&#8221; Coinbase&#8217;s chief policy officer, Faryar Shirzad, opined.</p>
<p>Besides the Keep Your Coins Act of 2023, the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services also passed three other crypto-related bills this week. They are the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmakers-advance-fit-for-the-21st-century-act-to-establish-crypto-framework/">Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act</a>, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-house-financial-services-committee-passes-stablecoin-legislation-after-a-few-fireworks/">Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act</a>.</p>

<h2>Gary Gensler Says Crypto Field Rife With Fraud</h2>
<p>The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, slammed crypto in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday.</p>
<p>“In this field of crypto investing, a lot of investors should be aware it&#8217;s not only a highly speculative asset class, it&#8217;s also one that they currently should not assume that they are getting the protections of the securities law, even though the securities laws apply to many of those tokens without prejudging anyone. But, you as investors are not getting the full, fair, and truthful disclosure,” the SEC chair cautioned.</p>
<p>Gensler added:</p>
<blockquote><p>The platforms, the intermediaries are doing things that we would never in a day allow or think the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq would do.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The platforms often are co-mingling and trading against you and have market makers that are on the other side of your trades. And we don&#8217;t allow that in the rest of our securities markets,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>The chairman of the SEC asserted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now, this is a field rife with fraud, rife with hucksters … there are good-faith actors as well but there are far too many that aren’t.</p></blockquote>

<p>The securities regulator recently requested <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-asks-for-increased-funding-to-tackle-crypto-market-risks-and-wrongdoing/">a budget increase</a> to address the risks posed by the crypto market. Gensler said in March that the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gary-gensler-sec-needs-new-tools-expertise-and-resources-to-regulate-crypto-industry/">needs new tools</a>, expertise, and resources to regulate the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Many people have criticized the SEC chairman for regulating the crypto industry by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lawmaker-calls-sec-enforcement-actions-against-crypto-exchanges-complete-contempt-for-congress/">enforcement</a>. U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH) even introduced legislation to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-introducing-legislation-to-remove-sec-chairman-due-to-long-series-of-abuses/">remove Gensler</a> as the chairman of the SEC &#8220;to correct a long series of abuses.&#8221; The lawmaker <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/republican-congressman-seeks-to-oust-sec-chair-gensler-with-sec-stabilization-act/">said</a>: “U.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical chairman, including the current one.&#8221;</p>

The two nations have different reasons to have reservations about Beijing’s plan to soon increase the organization’s geopolitical influence while they both seem to want to slow down the enlargement, sources have indicated.</strong></p>
<h2>India and Brazil Push Back Against China’s Attempt to Expand BRICS, Officials Say</h2>
<p>Officials familiar with the discussions on the future composition of the BRICS bloc of developing economies have revealed that India and Brazil are pushing back against a Chinese bid to rapidly expand the group, which currently also includes Russia and South Africa.</p>
<p>According to a report by Bloomberg, New Delhi and Brasília have raised their objections in preparatory talks for the organization’s upcoming summit in Johannesburg. During the forum on Aug. 22 &#8211; 24, the five nations will discuss the induction of new members.</p>
<p>China has repeatedly lobbied for expansion during those meetings, said the officials who chose to remain anonymous. Indonesia and Saudi Arabia have been mentioned as candidates while dozens of other nations are either applying or showing interest in joining.</p>

<p>The large <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">number</a> of potential members has fueled concerns in the West that the alliance may become a counterweight to the U.S. and the EU. Brazil hopes to avoid enlargement partly because of such worries while India seeks strict rules for the association of other countries without formally expanding BRICS. Both want to discuss granting observer status to candidates at the summit, the quoted officials added.</p>
<p>The hosting nation, South Africa, supports considering different membership options but doesn’t necessarily oppose expansion, two of the officials noted. “The BRICS leaders meeting last year authorized the expansion of membership, adding more members to BRICS is the political consensus of the five BRICS countries,” China’s foreign ministry pointed out in a statement.</p>
<h2>Decisions in Johannesburg Will Require Consensus Among Members</h2>
<p>Russia does not hold a firm position on expanding BRICS, according to Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy which advises the Kremlin’s administration. Commenting on the matter, he elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s broadly in favor of BRICS expansion, but without any huge enthusiasm. It’s following the others’ lead. We won’t block any decision.</p></blockquote>
<p>And any decision at the August summit will require consensus among the current member states who meet at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing as well as a geopolitical clash with Russia with unprecedented Western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Last week, the office of South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/historic-brics-summit-to-be-held-without-putin-in-person/">announced</a> that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, will not attend the meeting in person as a result of an indictment and an arrest warrant issued for him by the International Criminal Court (ICC) over the Ukraine war.</p>
<p>The report also revealed that following India’s opposition to China’s push for expansion, rules for admission were drafted and these will be discussed at the leaders’ summit next month, according to two Indian officials.</p>
<p>While trying avoid confrontation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRICS</a>, Brazil is working to resist Chinese pressure to make it an antagonistic body that challenges the G7, a Brazilian official said. The country is proposing to establish “observer” and “partner country” categories for candidates that will precede full membership.</p>

<h2>The 13th Year Anniversary of Nakamoto&#x2019;s Iconic Quote</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto was a palpable presence in the nascent world of digital currency, busily shaping Bitcoin&#x2019;s path and engaging in lively dialogues online. Within a span of two weeks &#x2013; from July 2 to July 17, 2010 &#x2013; Nakamoto found the time to articulate <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/satoshi-archive/forum/bitcoin-forum/">73 thoughtful responses</a> on specific discussions hosted on the forum bitcointalk.org. It was in this buzzing hub, on July 29, 2010, that Nakamoto memorably posted his now-famous line, &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t believe me or don&#x2019;t get it, I don&#x2019;t have time to try to convince you, sorry,&#x201D; in a thread aptly titled: &#x201C;Scalability and transaction rate.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Nakamoto&#x2019;s <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6269#msg6269">comment</a> was in response to the statement from another crypto proponent who said: &#x201C;10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good. It needs to be as fast as swiping a credit card is today.&#x201D; Nakamoto replied by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less. If you don&#x2019;t believe me or don&#x2019;t get it, I don&#x2019;t have time to try to convince you, sorry.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Snack Machine Thread</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#x2019;s creator left a link to the &#x201C;<a href="http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423.msg3819#msg3819">snack machine thread</a>,&#x201D; which discusses the problem of how to enable fast transactions for small purchases like from a vending machine using <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The issue is that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transactions take some time to confirm on the blockchain, so someone could double-spend before the transaction is confirmed and get a product from a vending machine without actually paying for it. The participants discussed ideas like debit accounts, escrow services, and prepaid accounts to enable fast transactions without waiting for blockchain confirmations.</p>

<p>The core problem is that the Bitcoin network takes about ten minutes on average to confirm transactions, but vendors need transactions to process instantly to deliver products right away. But if transactions aren&#x2019;t confirmed, people could double-spend <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to cheat the system or vendor. In the bitcointalk.org thread, an escrow service is suggested to enable instant transfers between accounts while still doing blockchain confirmations, but this adds costs through a third party.</p>

<p>Nakamoto suggests a solution where a payment processor listens for double-spend attempts and alerts if it detects any before a transaction propagates across the whole network. This would prevent most double-spend attacks. Nakamoto then provides a simple example of how fast a transaction can spread throughout the network.</p>

<p>In this example, if one transaction has even a small head start, it will spread throughout the network faster than the other one (the double-spend). It illustrates the exponential growth of transaction propagation &#x2013; an early lead can result in an overwhelming advantage due to the geometric (exponential) nature of network propagation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So if a double-spend has to wait even a second, it has a huge disadvantage,&#x201D; Nakamoto wrote at the time. &#x201C;The payment processor has connections with many nodes. When it gets a transaction, it blasts it out, and at the same time monitors the network for double-spends. If it receives a double-spend on any of its many listening nodes, then it alerts that the transaction is bad.&#x201D; Bitcoin&#x2019;s inventor added:</p>
<blockquote><p>A double-spent transaction wouldn&#x2019;t get very far without one of the listeners hearing it. The double-spender would have to wait until the listening phase is over, but by then, the payment processor&#x2019;s broadcast has reached most nodes, or is so far ahead in propagating that the double-spender has no hope of grabbing a significant percentage of the remaining nodes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#x201C;snack machine thread&#x201D; has played a recurring role in a multitude of discussions over time. After Nakamoto&#x2019;s initial response and a subsequent, seemingly rushed reply in a separate post, his comment was notably brief. Perhaps the architect of Bitcoin felt a robust certainty in the solution previously provided in the &#x201C;snack machine thread&#x201D; or, quite possibly, Nakamoto was inundated with other commitments that day, leading to a more clipped response.</p>
<p>The exact motivations remain shrouded in mystery, but the remark about lacking the time to explain has since been conjoined with the broader narrative of Bitcoin. It&#x2019;s celebrated as a poignant aphorism, encapsulating the inherent challenge in truly grasping the intricate mechanics of Bitcoin.</p>

Besides questioning the legitimacy of its data acquisition processes, CNIL is also delving into how this biometric data is stored. Notably, Worldcoin has collected this data for over two million registrants who have participated in its project.</strong></p>
<h2>French Regulator CNIL Questions Worldcoin&#8217;s Biometric Data Storage</h2>
<p>Worldcoin debuted last Monday, and based on available data and footage of individuals enrolling, the venture has been amassing momentum and recognition. In an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/frances-privacy-watchdog-says-worldcoin-legality-seems-questionable-2023-07-28/">email conversation</a> with Reuters, CNIL disclosed to the media outlet that it was scrutinizing Worldcoin&#8217;s data gathering and has initiated inquiries. &#8220;The legality of this collection seems questionable, as do the conditions for storing biometric data,” CNIL informed the news platform.</p>
<p>Ahead of launching its worldcoin (WLD) token, Worldcoin asserted it had already enlisted more than 2 million users. As of now, over <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xdc6ff44d5d932cbd77b52e5612ba0529dc6226f1">300,000 WLD token holders exist</a>, and on July 29, 2023, WLD documented upwards of 1 million transactions. Moreover, the CEO of Openai and co-founder of Worldcoin, Sam Altman, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-adoption-said-to-be-accelerating-sam-altman-states-one-person-getting-verified-every-8-seconds/">presented a video</a> revealing Worldcoin registrants queuing up to undergo iris scans and shared that an individual was being scanned &#8220;every 8 seconds.”</p>
<p>Even prior to Worldcoin&#8217;s introduction, the project encountered backlash, and an <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/">article</a> published by MIT Technology Review detailed accusations of deceit and exploitation. In October 2021, former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iris-scanning-worldcoin-idea-fuels-objections-from-privacy-advocates-snowden-says-dont-catalog-eyeballs/">criticized</a> the iris scanning initiative telling Altman they should abstain from cataloging people&#8217;s eyeballs. In correspondence with Reuters, the French regulator disclosed its commencement of investigations into Worldcoin.</p>

<p>CNIL also highlighted that Bavarian authorities are collaborating with the regulator in examining Worldcoin’s data collection practices. The Worldcoin Foundation responded to Reuters&#8217; request for comment concerning the investigation. The foundation noted that it falls under the jurisdiction of the European Union and Bavarian authorities such as the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision. “[Worldcoin] is designed to protect individual privacy and has built a robust privacy program,” the Worldcoin Foundation stated in its email.</p>
<p>Additionally, the group emphasized that the project adheres to all laws and regulations within every jurisdiction where Worldcoin operates. &#8220;The project will continue to cooperate with governing bodies on requests for more information about its privacy and data protection practices,&#8221; the Worldcoin Foundation added.</p>

Notably, a year-long assessment reflects an even more significant contraction, with over 86,000 WBTC evaporating from circulation since last July.</strong></p>
<h2>A 12-Month Decline of 86,000 WBTC in Circulation</h2>
<p>The Wrapped Bitcoin project has been around for over <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-wrapped-bitcoin-project-has-officially-launched-on-ethereum/">four years</a>, originating as WBTC on the Ethereum blockchain at the dawn of 2019. As of now, WBTC stands as the 16th most valuable asset among a sea of alternative cryptocurrencies, boasting a market value of approximately $4.73 billion. Despite its ranking as the most prominent wrapped bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) derivative token, a notable contraction in circulating coins has been observed since the previous year.</p>
<p>To illustrate, rewind to July 13, 2022, when the circulating supply of WBTC stood at an estimated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220713172745/https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599">247,832 WBTC</a>. Today, that number has tapered off to <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599#balances">161,460 WBTC</a>. This translates into a reduction of over 86,000 WBTC, or a significant 34% pullback in circulating supply over the past year. Additionally, a comparison of WBTC&#x2019;s market valuation reveals substantial growth &#x2013; ascending from a tad above $3 billion on January 2, 2023, to a markedly more impressive figure of $4.73 billion today.</p>

<p>However, this augmentation in value primarily stems from the appreciating price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, which was exchanging hands at $16,662 per unit on January 2. Now, each <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> coin commands a price of $29,328, marking a surge of over 65% since the year&#x2019;s commencement. Given that WBTC&#x2019;s prices are tethered to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on a 1:1 basis, WBTC&#x2019;s market capitalization followed suit, even though its circulating supply <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230102112556/https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-bitcoin">contracted by 22,088 WBTC</a> in the same period. Thus, of the total 34% reduction since last year, 12.03% of the cutback unfolded in 2023.</p>

<p>Specifically within the Ethereum network, WBTC boasts a total of 74,191 holders. However, the lion&#x2019;s share of the supply&#x2014;<a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/richlist/">51.5% to be exact</a>&#x2014;resides under the control of the top ten addresses. These ERC20-based WBTC tokens are spread across a multitude of decentralized finance (defi) platforms such as Aave, Compound, and Arbitrum. In fact, the top 100 Ethereum-based addresses command 75.16% of the total WBTC supply. Beyond Ethereum, WBTC also finds utility on other blockchains including Arbitrum, Cronos, Fantom, Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche.</p>

The move came as X, formerly Twitter, continued its re-brand by showcasing its new logo over the San Francisco skyline. Shiba inu surged by over 5% today.</b></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) rebounded on Saturday, as the token ended a recent three-day losing streak in today’s session.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD hit an intraday peak at $0.07828 earlier in the day, following Friday’s drop to a bottom at $0.07653.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s decline saw the meme coin move near a support point at $0.07600, however bulls rejected a full on collision.</p>

<p>Although DOGE is now up by almost 2% from Friday’s low, price might have hit a wall, due to the current position of the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>The index is hovering below a ceiling at 63.00, which would need to be broken, if DOGE bulls intend to secure further gains this weekend.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, price strength is tracking at 62.53.</p>

<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) continued to trade close to a two-week high in today’s session, after yesterday’s strong surge in price.</p>
<p>Saturday has seen SHIB/USD peak at $0.00000840, which comes after Friday’s low of $0.00000783.</p>
<p>This is marginally below the $0.00000845 level recorded yesterday, which was its highest point since July 14.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the rally comes as the RSI broke past a ceiling at 60.00, and is now tracking at 64.29.</p>
<p>Overall, this is the highest point price strength in SHIB since February 7, when the price reached a high of $0.00001449.</p>
<p>If momentum remains bullish this weekend, $0.00000890 is the realistic target for traders.</p>

At the time of analysis, the global market capitalization has risen modestly by 0.32%, mirroring the effects of Friday&#x2019;s U.S. consumer sentiment report, which fell short of expectations. Contrary to the projected sentiment of 72.6, the actual figure hovered at 71.6. Concurrently, bitcoin witnessed an uptick in its price.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) moved above a key support point of $29,200 on Saturday, as cryptocurrency markets continued to consolidate.</p>
<p>Following a low of $29,186.47 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD jumped to an intraday peak at $29,521.51 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has mostly consolidated this past week, as traders attempted to find a firm floor, after recent selloffs.</p>

<p>Today&#x2019;s consolidation comes as the relative strength index (RSI) appeared to have found its own floor at the 43.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 43.95, and appears to be heading for a ceiling at 48.00.</p>
<p>In the event price strength reaches this point, there is a good chance <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> could be trading above $29,800.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>After a volatile few days, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) made strides towards the $1,900 level to start the weekend.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD peaked at $1,881.46 earlier in the day, which comes following Saturday&#x2019;s bottom at the $1,865.45 mark.</p>
<p>Ethereum has failed to climb above the $1,900 point since last Sunday, and has mostly been in a downtrend since a move over $2,000 earlier in the month.</p>

<p>The RSI is on the cusp of breaking out of a resistance level at 49.00, which could help tempt previous bulls to reenter the market.</p>
<p>Should this occur, the 10-day (red) moving average might also change its current course, and potentially move back over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>

During the interview with the politician, Alegre described new models of IP (intellectual property) that transcend national borders and break down barriers traditional IP models impose.</strong></p>
<h2>Bored Apes: A New Paradigm for IP</h2>
<p>CEO of Yuga Labs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-alegre-a906954">Daniel Alegre</a> recently sat down with deputy director of the Web3.0 Policy Office at Japan&#8217;s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to discuss the future of Web3 and product licensing, describing a new model of &#8220;community-based IP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://webx-asia.com/speaker/waka-itagaki/?">Waka Itagaki</a> about the power of the Bored Ape Yacht Club global community at the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/roger-ver-at-webx-asia-reflections-on-payments-self-custody-and-the-role-of-crypto-lawbreakers/">Webx</a> conference on Tuesday, Alegre described: &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s a Bored Ape brewing company, that the team introduced me to yesterday, or whether it&#8217;s new artists that want to create [gaming content] on their other side platform &#8230; it&#8217;s really creating and connecting culture on the blockchain, but at a global level.&#8221;</p>
<p>The executive, formerly COO of <a href="https://www.activisionblizzard.com/">Activision Blizzard</a>, went on to note that &#8220;Web3 brings creators and consumers and communities together, and they build these brands together,&#8221; emphasizing, &#8220;It&#8217;s a fundamental rethink of IP and IP rights.&#8221; Alegre detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a normal media environment, if you own IP, you license it very exclusively and for a very finite use case &#8230; when you buy a Bored Ape NFT, we are giving you an unlimited license to do with that IP what you want &#8230; If you want to start a restaurant chain, if you want to have a brewing company, if you want to create t-shirts that you want to sell, it enables that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alegre didn&#8217;t directly address one portion of Itagaki&#8217;s prompt when she asked &#8220;How are you planning to align with the government&#8217;s regulation?&#8221; He did, however, suggest a way for regulators to view Web3, noting: &#8220;And this is where I love your point of view from a government perspective — how do you think about enablement so that more people can actually leverage what Web3 can bring to bear.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Animoca Rep and Other Speakers Share Similar Views on New, Decentralized Models of Business and Finance</h2>
<p>Similar to Alegre&#8217;s enthusiasm for fresh ways of viewing intellectual property, later the same day, <a href="https://webx-asia.com/speaker/evan-auyang/?">Evan Auyang of Animoca Brands</a> also described a new way to look at competition in the marketplace, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The whole point about this ecosystem &#8230; is that we&#8217;re trying to see if we can grow the pie bigger rather than dominating it ourselves, which is more Web2 thinking. If the pie grows bigger, then we will benefit &#8230; on the assets that we have at the same time.</p></blockquote>
<p>In another talk at Webx, <a href="https://webx-asia.com/speaker/ken-deeter/">Ken Deeter</a>, partner at crypto-focused VC fund Electric Capital in the United States, explained he was interested in defi as an extension of the Bitcoin ethos, which arose from a mistrust of central banks and traditional monetary policy. Like with the evolution in perspective on IP described by Alegre, Deeter and others at Webx expressed interest in setting up new models.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think? Is Web3 leading a positive evolution away from outdated, coercive models of business, law, and finance, or is more regulation needed? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>
