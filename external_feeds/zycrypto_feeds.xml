<p>In a surprising turn of events, Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon is back in custody after a Montenegrin high court annulled a lower court’s decision to allow Kwon to be released on bail.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-kwon-s-436k-bail-scrapped"><strong>Do Kwon’s $436K Bail Scrapped</strong></h2>



<p>Do Kwon and former chief financial officer Han Chong-joon are back in jail, per a <em>Bloomberg </em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/crypto-mogul-do-kwon-s-bail-is-revoked-in-montenegro#xj4y7vzkg">report</a>.</p>



<p>This comes after the high court of Montenegro in Podgorica nullified a decision from two weeks ago to release Kwon and Han to house arrest on 400,000 euros ($436,000) bail each.</p>



<p>After the Basic Court in Montenegro granted the pair bail, prosecutors in the case swiftly appealed the decision. Court spokeswoman Marija Rakovic told <em>Bloomberg</em> that the matter will now head back to the lower court, which must make a decision taking into consideration what the higher court decided.</p>



<p>Kwon and Han were charged with using a fake passport in Montenegro after attempting to travel to Dubai from Podgorica in March with fake Belgian and Costa Rican passports. The two defendants maintain that the passports were issued legally.</p>



<p>TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin designed by Terraform Labs, imploded last spring along with governance token Terra (LUNA), erasing over $40 billion in investors’ wealth and triggering a snowball crisis in the crypto industry last year. Shortly after the catastrophic Terra ecosystem collapse, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/singapore-high-court-approves-liquidators-probe-into-three-arrows-capital-assets/">Three Arrows Capital</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-offers-to-bail-out-voyagers-customers-but-at-a-price/">Voyager Digital</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-1-month-of-halting-customers-withdrawals-giant-crypto-lender-celsius-goes-bankrupt/">Celsius </a>all declared bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the forgery charges, Do Kwon is also facing criminal fraud charges in the U.S. and also back in his home state South Korea. S. Korea issued an arrest warrant against him last September, alleging that he violated capital market laws. As <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-could-be-thrown-in-jail-for-40-years-in-south-korea/"><em>ZyCrypto </em></a>previously covered, he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-could-be-thrown-in-jail-for-40-years-in-south-korea/">faces up to 40 years in jail</a> in South Korea, the country where he supposedly committed most of his crimes.</p>



<p>U.S. prosecutors in New York have charged Kwon with eight counts, including commodities fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to manipulate the market. </p>



<p>In the meantime, both the U.S. and South Korea have sought to extradite the Terraform Labs boss from Montenegrin authorities.</p>

<p>Amid legal tensions and murky regulations in the United States, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-may-have-just-bitten-off-more-than-it-can-chew-as-ripple-eyes-very-big-win-in-case/">Ripple</a> has seemingly decided to expand overseas. The San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm has reportedly acquired a stake in the European cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-expands-european-foothold"><strong>Ripple Expands European Foothold</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple Labs is continuing to make power moves.</p>



<p>According to Galaxy Digital’s First Quarter 2023 report, Ripple purchased shares of Bitstamp — one of the world&#8217;s oldest and most established crypto exchanges — which were previously held by crypto VC firm Pantera Capital.</p>



<p>Galaxy says it advised Pantera to sell its stake in Bistamp to Ripple in Q1. It’s unclear how much the acquisition cost Ripple. Bitstamp is currently the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in terms of trading volume, with around $163 million worth of cryptocurrencies traded in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>This Ripple purchase deal comes as Galaxy Digital’s Investment banking team posted stellar growth in the past year, fortifying its position as a leading investment bank for digital assets post-FTX.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Does The Acquisition Mean For XRP?</strong></h2>



<p>The purchase grabbed the XRPArmy&#8217;s attention, who uncovered that Pantera had previously invested in both Ripple Labs and Bistamp.</p>



<p>Notably, Bitstamp is presently the second-largest market for XRP after Binance. Additionally, the exchange previously served as a gateway for Ripple, enabling entry into RippleNet. As we speak, XRP now accounts for 30% of the total trading volume on Bitstamp, with the XRP/Euro pair being the most popular.</p>



<p>The community is trying to make sense of why Ripple proceeded with the deal, as neither the payments firm nor Bitstamp has made an official statement on the matter. Some speculate that the acquisition may be connected to Ripple’s objectives for its Liquidity Hub (LH) or On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that Ripple’s popular ODL solution uses XRP to settle transactions, while the LH does not include the token.</p>



<p>While the specific details and importance of the deal will probably be revealed at a later date, it signals Ripple’s move to boost its offerings further, considering its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-acquires-crypto-custody-provider-metaco-for-250m-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-end-game/">recent acquisition</a> of Switzerland-based crypto custody firm <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-expands-into-the-institutional-crypto-custody-market-following-250-million-acquisition-of-metaco/">Metaco for $250 million</a> in tokenization push. Whether the latest Bitstamp deal boosts XRP liquidity remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Billionaire investor, “Shark Tank” personality, and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban shared a proposal on Tuesday about how cryptocurrency tokens should be decentralized in the future to avoid being on the receiving end of SEC enforcement actions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cuban-s-proposal"><strong>Cuban’s Proposal</strong></h2>



<p>It all started when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked Grayscale to pull its application to make its Filecoin Trust product more akin to a public company, warning that its underlying asset, Filecoin (FIL), &#8220;meets the definition of a security.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mark Cuban commented on a tweet regarding Filecoin being labelled a security by the SEC and shared some tips on how future crypto-focused firms could become completely decentralized to avoid facing lawsuits from the U.S. regulator for securities violations.</p>



<p>The American billionaire investor <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1661093100490567680">noted </a>that cryptocurrency-issuing companies should consider releasing all their supply without retaining a portion as a treasury. According to Cuban, the released tokens should be used to provide liquidity using DeFi, and the original entity that issued the tokens should thereafter be dissolved. In his view, rogue regulators like the SEC will not be able to “close the token down” alleging it&#8217;s a security as it has done with cryptocurrencies like FIL, and XRP, as there will be “true decentralization”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP Holders’ Lawyer Agrees</strong></h2>



<p>John E Deaton, a prominent pro-crypto lawyer and legal representative of XRP holders, has concurred with Mark Cuban’s suggestion. Deaton <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1661175392122617856">posited </a>that it is “smart and probably in someone&#8217;s playbook at the moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the CryptoLaw founder emphasized that the crypto community must continue pushing against the false narrative propagated by the SEC that the underlying asset in an investment contract is a security.</p>



<p>The SEC claims that Ripple distributed 14.6 billion units of XRP and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">sued </a>the company and its former and current CEO, Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, respectively, for failure to register XRP as a security, which is a requirement for the public offering and sale of securities. </p>



<p>Ripple has historically maintained a distance from XRP, but any progress in the long-standing lawsuit has had an impact on the token’s prices. Most recently, XRP surged after a federal judge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">ruled </a>that the SEC cannot seal materials tied to former official William Hinman&#8217;s 2018 speech on ether not being a security. Access to these emails would mean Ripple attorneys can discover how Hinman came to that determination, which could influence XRP’s classification as a security.</p>



<p>Deaton recently <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1660301659887616000">noticed </a>that XRP was in fact, discussed between SEC staff just before the Hinman speech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The community should keep a keen eye on June 13, 2023, where we will learn to what extent this will affect the XRP suit, which is when the Hinman documents are set to be <a href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1659606951938998294">unsealed</a>.</p>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, has overtaken Bitcoin (BTC) as the most traded asset on the largest South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, Upbit and Bithumb.</p>



<p>For the second consecutive day, XRP, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has managed to outshine Bitcoin in trading volume signalling the growing popularity of XRP among Korean investors and a potential change in the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>



<p>Currently, XRP maintains its position as the highest-ranked cryptocurrency in terms of daily trading volume. It recorded approximately $208 million daily trading volume on UPBIT and $50 million on Bithumb. In comparison, Bitcoin had a trading volume of $96 million on UPBIT and $27 million on Bithumb during the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>XRP&#8217;s rise to dominance can be attributed to several factors. Ripple&#8217;s strategic partnerships with major Korean financial institutions such as GME, South Korea’s largest remittance service firm and major exchanges have played a crucial role in fostering the adoption of XRP. </p>



<p>Additionally, XRP&#8217;s unique attributes, such as its fast transaction speed and low fees, as well as the ability to facilitate seamless cross-border payments, have made it an appealing choice for Korean traders seeking efficient and cost-effective crypto transactions.</p>



<p>Additionally, the increasing popularity of XRP can be attributed to investors placing their confidence in Ripple&#8217;s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-new-lawsuit-outcomes-set-ripple-on-path-to-gigantic-win-against-the-sec/">potential victory</a> in the ongoing legal battle against the SEC. The two-and-a-half-year legal dispute involves the SEC accusing Ripple and two of the firm&#8217;s top officials of violating US securities laws by selling XRP as an unregistered security. On the other hand, Ripple has continually maintained that XRP should be classified as a digital currency, not a security.</p>



<p>As the legal case approaches its conclusion, investors are growing more optimistic about Ripple&#8217;s chances of winning, with the expectation that the SEC will lose key arguments. Such an outcome could potentially drive XRP&#8217;s price to new heights.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that this surge in XRP&#8217;s popularity is not the first of its kind in South Korea. Last month, XRP witnessed an extraordinary surge in trading volumes, reaching billions of dollars on three prominent Korean exchanges, UpBit, Bithumb, and Korbit. Notably, from January 1st to April 18th, the total value of XRP traded in Korea exceeded a staggering $16 billion. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, XRP’s significant increase in trading volume aligned with a price rally of approximately 2% over the past 24 hours. The token currently trades at $0.46, reflecting an overall gain of just over 8% within the past week. On the other hand, Bitcoin was trading at $26,717, down just over 2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Cardano, the blockchain platform known for its focus on sustainability, security, and scalability, has achieved a significant milestone in its staking ecosystem. Recent reports indicate that the total value of ADA tokens staked on the Cardano network has reached impressive new heights.</p>



<p>The entire value of ADA tokens held in Cardano&#8217;s staking mechanism has surpassed 430 million, according to data from DeFiLlama. This accomplishment demonstrates the rising faith and confidence in Cardano&#8217;s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus process, which enables ADA holders to actively contribute to the network&#8217;s security and profit from doing so.</p>



<p>Holders of ADA can assign their tokens to a pool through Cardano&#8217;s staking mechanism and earn rewards based on their stake. Users that engage in staking help the network become more decentralized and secure while generating passive revenue through ADA awards. Staking has grown in favour among fans of cryptocurrencies as a substitute for traditional mining, which frequently uses a lot of processing power and energy.</p>



<p>There are several reasons why the total amount of ADA staked on Cardano has increased significantly. First, investors interested in the environment looking for more eco-friendly alternatives to energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) networks have been drawn to Cardano because of its commitment to sustainability. Cardano is a PoS blockchain that uses much less energy yet is exceptionally secure.</p>



<p>The tremendous increase in staked ADA coins is a measure of the Cardano ecosystem&#8217;s strength and maturity. By spreading ADA ownership among more stake pools, more staking participation improves network security. In addition, due to its decentralization, Cardano is more resistant to potential attacks and lowers the possibility of a single point of failure.</p>



<p>Additionally, less ADA is left over for trading when more tokens are staked. A supply-demand imbalance brought on by this decreased supply could boost the market value of ADA. Investors that decide to stake their ADA tokens gain from possible price growth in addition to making a network contribution.</p>



<p>Cardano is an energy-efficient proof-of-stake protocol that offers and enhances the security assurances of proof-of-work. To ensure the integrity, longevity, and performance of the protocol and the distributed networks it supports, Ouroboros uses cryptography, combinatorics, and mathematical game theory.</p>



<p>Cardano&#8217;s Ouroboros protocol randomly chooses leaders, or validators, to verify blocks and increase their chances of being selected again. Similar to Bitcoin, after 3-5 approvals, operations are regarded as reliable. The amount of ADA staked impacts the likelihood of becoming a leader, with greater ownership raising the possibility. The algorithm guards against manipulation by taking into account the influences on individual decisions. The validation process involves both validators and verifiers. The protocol is still being improved despite concerns about its viability and use.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, at least at one point the world’s richest man, has issued a grim warning about the original meme cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>



<p>Speaking at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit in London on May 23, the eccentric billionaire <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-05-23-2023/card/don-t-bet-the-farm-on-dogecoin-elon-musk-says-3w5HNJM4zaycGPD5CNKd">cautioned </a>investors not to allocate all their money to DOGE. “I’m not advising anyone to buy crypto or bet the farm on Dogecoin,” Musk posited.</p>



<p>Despite this warning, the Tesla/SpaceX CEO reaffirmed that Dogecoin remains his favourite crypto in the entire digital currencies market because “it has the best humor and has dogs”. Musk also noted that the most ironic outcome for global currencies would be if a meme coin created merely as a joke emerged as the global currency. As you are well aware, DOGE was invented as a joking tribute to the “doge” meme of a Shiba Inu dog. The idea was to poke fun at the largest and oldest crypto asset, Bitcoin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-musk-s-history-of-endorsing-and-pumping-dogecoin"><strong>Musk’s History Of Endorsing And Pumping Dogecoin</strong></h2>



<p>Musk is known for manipulating the price of dogecoin in the past through his intriguing remarks, actions, and Twitter posts. The self-proclaimed “Dogefather” even <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spacex-and-dogecoin-an-uncommon-alliance-to-create-dogestronauts/">planned </a>to bring DOGE to space with a SpaceX satellite launch. Dogecoin developers have also revealed in the past that Chief Twit Musk actually sat in on development calls as they discussed how they would revamp the meme coin. </p>



<p>The entrepreneur still <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1503222294277197829">owns dogecoin</a>, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to his tweets from March last year. Musk even bought some DOGE for his youngest son, X Æ A-Xii, in 2021.</p>



<p>There was speculation that the Tesla boss would soon integrate a permanent Dogecoin payment system on Twitter, the social media giant he overpaid for (<a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-bulls-go-all-in-as-billionaire-dogefather-elon-musk-finally-closes-on-44b-twitter-deal/">$44 billion</a>). However, DOGE’s integration has not yet materialized, leaving fans in a state of great disappointment.</p>



<p>Early last month, Musk <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-soars-over-25-after-elon-musk-replaces-twitters-logo-with-shiba-inu-image/">replaced Twitter’s classic blue bird logo with a sprite of DOGE</a>, triggering a 25% spike in the token’s price — only to remove the Dogecoin logo days later.</p>



<p>Dogecoin dropped sharply today after Musk said not to put life savings in DOGE. The OG meme coin was down 2.8% at the time of writing, trading for $0.071, according to CoinGecko data.</p>



<p>DOGE is currently trading 90.25% lower than its May 2021 all-time high of $0.73.</p>

<ul>
<li>Joe Biden takes a swipe at cryptocurrency traders and “wealthy tax cheats”, insisting they remain undeserving of tax cuts and similar benefits.</li>



<li>The comments have drawn speculations among industry executives on the stance of the White House as budget negotiations resumed on May 22.</li>



<li>Joe Biden reiterated his commitment to ensuring the country does not default on its debt to prevent a looming economic meltdown.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The Biden administration has maintained a tough stance against digital assets over the years. The first blow landed on miners and then traders. How far will the administration stretch this anti-crypto rhetoric?</p>



<p>Joe Biden <a href="https://zycrypto.com/biden-throws-crypto-traders-under-the-bus-in-debt-deal/">criticized</a> digital asset traders and <em>wealthy tax cheats</em> as he wrapped up the G7 summit in Japan. Speaking at a press conference, the President insisted that these crypto traders are not worthy beneficiaries of the tax cuts proposed by Republicans.</p>



<p><em>“Let me be clear, I&#8217;m not going to agree to&#8230; a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistance at risk for nearly 1 million Americans,&#8221; </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“It&#8217;s time for Republicans to accept that there&#8217;s no bipartisan deal to be made solely on their partisan terms,</em>&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Strong indicators have been that some Republicans are pushing to support “<em>tax loopholes” </em>to aid digital asset investors, including miners. In Biden’s $6.9 billion budget plan, the President has stressed the importance of restructuring the rules relating to digital assets to protect Americans.</p>



<p>The comments come in as budget negotiations intensify ahead of the United States deadline to raise the debt ceiling or risk defaulting on her debts for the first time. Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin Macarthy agreed to resume negotiations on Sunday to prevent an “<em>economic catastrophe as few as 11 days away.&#8221;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dame-tax-is-only-the-first-kick">DAME Tax is only the first kick</h2>



<p>This year, the White House <a href="https://zycrypto.com/white-house-makes-case-for-30-crypto-mining-tax-cites-economic-and-energy-factors-as-key-drive-behind-policy/">released</a> a proposed 30% tax on digital asset miners coupled with a report justifying its position. The administration based the decision on the amount of energy consumed in mining digital assets adding that it creates a hardship for American communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others. It encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society,”</em> the report reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposed DAME tax will come into effect in 2024 and will require miners to pay a 10% tax before it grows to 30% in subsequent years. The digital asset community has criticized this move as an attempt to stifle the growth of the sector with many saying the administration has “<em>misplaced priorities.”</em></p>



<p>With the President&#8217;s recent comments, many wonder where the line will be drawn after proposing new regulations, miners&#8217; and trader&#8217;s taxes, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol, Uniswap, has announced its decision to expand its operations onto the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polkadot-tops-rivals-in-developer-activity-following-influx-from-solana/">Polkadot network</a> via the &#8220;Moonbeam&#8221; parachain in a momentous move that promises to revolutionize the decentralized finance (DeFi) scene. This strategic choice could usher in a new era of cross-chain liquidity, improving the DeFi ecosystem&#8217;s effectiveness and scalability.</p>



<p>Uniswap hopes to take advantage of the special features and interoperability provided by Polkadot by utilizing the Moonbeam parachain, thereby providing seamless connectivity with other blockchains within the Polkadot ecosystem. The announcement has sent shockwaves throughout the crypto community, with industry experts applauding Uniswap&#8217;s pioneering decision. This strategic move is expected to bring about a myriad of benefits, including increased liquidity, reduced transaction costs, enhanced scalability, and improved overall user experience within the DeFi space.</p>



<p>With Uniswap&#8217;s connection with Polkadot through Moonbeam, users can transact assets between blockchains without difficulty. The limits now imposed by segregated blockchains are eliminated by this interoperability, enabling users to access a larger pool of assets and trading opportunities.</p>



<p>Decentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts can be created more easily because of the developer-friendly environment offered by the Moonbeam parachain, based on the Polkadot network. When Uniswap uses the Moonbeam parachain, it has access to Polkadot&#8217;s robust infrastructure, security features, and scalability solutions, all of which strengthen and improve the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>The move further emphasizes the rising significance of cross-chain solutions and interoperability within the blockchain sector. Bridging the gap between various blockchains is becoming increasingly crucial for realizing the full promise of decentralized finance as the crypto industry continues to develop and mature. Adding Polkadot to Uniswap establishes a precedent for other DeFi protocols and initiatives, inspiring them to investigate cross-chain partnerships and capitalize on interoperability.</p>



<p>Users can anticipate the exciting potential for smooth asset transfers, effective cross-chain liquidity provision, and cutting-edge financial products thanks to Uniswap&#8217;s participation in the Polkadot network. The adoption of cutting-edge protocols on well-known blockchain networks like Polkadot lays the door for a more integrated and vibrant ecosystem as the DeFi market expands and changes.</p>



<p>Finally, Uniswap&#8217;s plan to expand its company to Polkadot via the Moonbeam parachain is a huge step forward in the evolution of decentralized finance. Uniswap is leading a new wave of innovation in the DeFi industry by embracing interoperability and cross-chain liquidity. The partnership between Uniswap, Polkadot, and Moonbeam has the potential to reshape the future of decentralized finance, unlocking unmatched opportunities for users and catapulting the industry to greater heights as the market eagerly awaits the implementation of this ground-breaking move.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-expands-into-the-institutional-crypto-custody-market-following-250-million-acquisition-of-metaco/">cryptocurrency market</a> has continued to face a period of cautious sentiment as historically low levels of weekly trading volume persist this quarter.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has remained stagnant, trapped within a tight range that started on May 11. This lack of volatility has extended to Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, contributing to overall market weakness. However, despite these prevailing market conditions, Bitcoin enthusiasts have keenly watched various pivotal developments that could potentially shake up the market.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, May 23, renowned onchain analyst Onchain Edge highlighted an intriguing insight for traders from the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). According to the former Ernest &amp; Young (EY) analyst, aSOPR (30DMA) has surged above 1.0 and is retesting the area, signalling a potential bull run.</p>



<p>As ZyCrypto previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-kicks-off-march-in-the-green-as-crypto-markets-see-favorable-capital-inflows/">reported</a>, this indicator has historically proved efficient, with price rallying after the ratio moves above the 1.0 mark and vice versa. According to the pundit, Bitcoin could face a major bull run, akin to the 2020 and 2021 ones, if this ratio stays atop that level.</p>



<p><em>“Want to know when to buy or sell Bitcoin? When aSOPR (30DMA) is above 1.0, it signals a profitable &amp; strong market. Now the aSOPR is at another critical support level at 1.01. This was the level from which BTC started the 2020/21 rally.”</em> Tweeted Onchain Edge.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="630" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-1024x630.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81244" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-1024x630.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-300x185.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-768x473.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-1536x946.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24-356x220.png 356w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-24.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Elsewhere Glassnode, another data analysis firm, likewise shared insight into the ongoing decline of the Bitcoin balance on exchanges. As per the firm, the current epoch has recorded a decline of -680K BTC. This represents a 28% decline from its peak of 3.2M BTC at its peak in 2020 to the current balance of 2.3M BTC. It is important to note that when Bitcoin leaves exchanges, it reduces the likelihood, which, in turn, may contribute to upward price pressure as the scarcity of available Bitcoin increases.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, various industry experts have also begun speculating that Bitcoin may have reached a bottom. Rekt Capital, a well-known figure in the crypto space, highlighted the formation of an &#8220;exaggerated&#8221; bullish divergence on the Daily RSI (Relative Strength Index). According to him, this potentially positive sign hints at the possibility of upside movement.</p>



<p><em>“A potentially positive sign for some upside movement, however important to realize that the key resistance to beat is $27,600,”</em> he tweeted.</p>



<p>Material Indicators, another onchain analyst termed the ongoing sideways movement by BTC a “healthy consolidation”, which he noted strengthens the current zone as a key resistance/support area. He went on to highlight the importance of the 100-Day MA holding as strong support while cautioning that breaking the 200-Week MA could pose difficulties in reclaiming previous levels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81245" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-25-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, as the crypto community eagerly awaits the market&#8217;s next move, all eyes are on Bitcoin&#8217;s price action and its ability to stand its ground against bearish pressures. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,178, up roughly 1.65% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Prominent speechwriter and Forbes contributor Sam Lyman believes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may have underestimated the challenges it would face in its legal battle against Ripple. The pundit made his observations known on Sunday, May 21, after tweeting that <em>“the SEC may have bitten off more than it can chew in its campaign against XRP.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>His statement comes in light of an article he recently published on Forbes discussing how the &#8220;ripple effects&#8221; from the lawsuit could benefit not just the XRP Army but also Coinbase and the industry as a whole.</p>



<p>Led by Chair Gary Gensler, SEC’s attempts to classify digital assets as securities have faced unexpected opposition from its past statements and internal documents, which now have to be made public due to a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">recent court ruling</a>. In his article, Lyman suggested that releasing the Hinman documents, which the SEC wanted to keep hidden, could strengthen Ripple&#8217;s case by revealing that even SEC staff believed XRP should not be considered a security.</p>



<p><em>“The documents are likely to reveal dissenting opinions within the agency’s own ranks as to which cryptocurrencies are securities and why. And by so doing, they are likely to bolster Ripple’s case,” </em>wrote Lyman.</p>



<p>The pundit further noted that if the Hinman documents provide more evidence of internal communications contradicting the SEC&#8217;s current position on digital asset regulation, it could create significant obstacles for the agency&#8217;s case and reputation. Additionally, it would bolster Ripple&#8217;s argument that the absence of regulatory clarity hindered their understanding of legal boundaries in the industry.</p>



<p>Lyman further noted that the implications of the Hinman documents extend beyond the XRP lawsuit and could impact Coinbase&#8217;s position in future litigation against the SEC. According to him, the SEC&#8217;s approval of Coinbase&#8217;s IPO, despite their listing of assets similar to XRP without a broker-dealer license, raises doubts about the agency&#8217;s position. To this end, he noted that the documents in question could provide insight into whether the SEC considered these assets unregistered securities or if investor protection was overlooked.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, outspoken pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton expressed his agreement with Layman&#8217;s views, stating that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-and-sec-request-additional-time-to-disclose-hinman-files-is-a-settlement-looming/">the lawsuit</a> was not solely about enforcing U.S. securities laws but seemed to have other underlying motives.</p>



<p>“<em>The lawsuit was NOT only about enforcing U.S. Securities laws. If it was, the case would have been limited to specific sales made by Ripple and it would’ve settled by now. The lawsuit was used as a weapon with bad motive,”</em> tweeted Deaton.</p>



<p>The lawyer also hailed the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-coinbase-asks-court-for-permission-to-support-ripple/">unexpected support</a> Ripple received from the XRP community, expressing confidence in a win due to their collective efforts. That said, as the XRP lawsuit progresses and the Hinman documents come to light, the crypto industry eagerly awaits the potential outcomes that could shape the future regulatory landscape.</p>

<p>On May 17th, Ripple, the company behind XRP, announced the acquisition of Metaco, a Swiss provider of digital asset custody and tokenization technology. The move is one step forward in the company’s intention to enter the cryptocurrency custody market.</p>



<p>According to Ripple&#8217;s <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-takes-on-the-crypto-custody-market-with-metaco/">statement</a>, this acquisition will allow them to expand their business offering by providing customers with the ability to custody, issue, and settle tokenized assets.</p>



<p>Both companies have a strong and recognized track record in the cryptocurrency industry, so their union will facilitate the growing institutional demand, creating secure high-level business solutions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-wants-to-enter-the-institutional-cryptocurrency-custody-market"><strong>Ripple wants to enter the institutional cryptocurrency custody market</strong></h2>



<p>Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, said that the acquisition of Metaco, a leading company in institutional digital asset custody, is a milestone in achieving their global expansion goals.</p>



<p><em>“Through our strong financial position, Ripple will continue to leverage our advantage in critical areas of crypto infrastructure. The addition of Metaco is a significant step for our expanding product suite and global footprint.”</em></p>



<p>Sagar Shah, Head of Custody at Ripple, stated that the company considers Metaco as the perfect partner due to their technology, market fit, customer base, and exceptional team. He further added that Ripple is excited to support Metaco in delivering &#8220;high-quality products and services&#8221; while enabling faster and more efficient business growth.</p>



<p><em>“Metaco&#8217;s technology, product-market fit, customer base, and exceptional team make them the perfect partner for Ripple as we aim to provide essential crypto infrastructure to enterprises.”</em></p>



<p>Adrien Treccani, founder and CEO of Metaco, affirmed that the alliance with Ripple would allow Metaco to thrive in the digital asset economy by providing greater value to their customers, and leveraging Ripple&#8217;s market scale and strength.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Metaco offers tools for tokenization and custody infrastructure</strong></h2>



<p>Metaco is a company known for its secure and versatile custody infrastructure, with its “Harmonize” solution being the preferred choice of institutional clients for digital asset custody.</p>



<p>Metaco&#8217;s technological solutions are available in various jurisdictions worldwide, including Switzerland, Germany, Turkey, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, among others.</p>



<p>Therefore, the acquisition of Metaco could help Ripple achieve faster global commercial growth, offering new services to its customers while maintaining its leadership in enterprise cryptocurrency solutions.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-new-lawsuit-outcomes-set-ripple-on-path-to-gigantic-win-against-the-sec/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, Ripple recently achieved a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">victory</a> as a court denied the SEC&#8217;s request to prevent them from being compelled to disclose documents in which their former executive explained why he believed Ethereum was not a security. This could strengthen their argument that XRP meets the same criteria as ETH, providing a strong basis for their victory. XRP experienced a percentage increase following the publication of this news.</p>

<p>FTX&#8217;s new management, led by CEO John J. Ray III, is considering a rebirth of Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defunct crypto exchange, according to the latest legal billings.</p>



<p>The new CEO reportedly spent several hours last month examining and working on what seems to be FTX 2.0 materials.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ftx-2-0-latest-court-filings-hint-there-is-work-underway-to-reboot-collapsed-crypto-giant"><strong>FTX 2.0: Latest Court Filings Hint There Is Work Underway To Reboot Collapsed Crypto Giant</strong></h2>



<p>The FTX crypto enterprise<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-top-exec-makes-surprising-offer-to-ftx-employees-as-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/"> filed for bankruptcy</a> last November, shocking the global crypto markets, with its founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sam-bankman-fried-blames-crypto-winter-for-ftx-collapse-in-attempt-to-dodge-most-fraud-charges/">facing </a>fraud charges in the United States.</p>



<p>Now, the struggling crypto exchange is considering reopening at some point in the future.</p>



<p>The monthly staffing report and compensation details for the new CEO of FTX, John J. Ray III, shows that during this time, he engaged in a series of activities that might enable the reboot of the cryptocurrency trading platform.</p>



<p>Ray first <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-ftx-chief-says-crypto-exchange-could-restart-11674143168">floated </a>the idea of restarting FTX in January this year. “Everything is on the table. If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it,” Ray posited. At the time, there were reports that the failed exchange had uncovered and retrieved $5.5 billion in liquid assets and that Ray was working with creditors on a potential revival plan. Then last month, another report said FTX had recovered $7.3 billion in assets and was thus considering reviving its crypto exchange operations sometime in the second quarter of next year.</p>



<p>The new court documents indicate that a reboot plan is indeed in the works. In the “Summary of Time and Fees by Professional&#8221;, Ray charged $1,040 for less than an hour of work to &#8220;Review and finalize 2.0 reboot of exchange material for distribution” to investors. These included seeking help from cybersecurity firm Sygnia to improve the security of the crypto exchange, as well as analyzing a term sheet for restructuring the company as part of the plan.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fresh Capital Injection Needed</strong></h2>



<p>In April, FTX&#8217;s lead attorney Andy Dietderich also advocated for an FTX reboot. According to Dietderich, restarting the exchange would require substantial capital, regardless of whether it would offer services to only U.S.-based customers or operate internationally.</p>



<p>The latest court filings suggest FTX will likely be entering a bidding process.</p>



<p>San Francisco-based VC firm Tribe Capital, which was an investor in the exchange before it went under, is allegedly considering leading a fund-raising campaign to jump-start revival efforts. Per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-18/ftx-crypto-exchange-restart-plan-draws-interest-from-tribe-capital-vc"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the rebooted exchange would keep the FTX name.</p>



<p>Members of the crypto community have touted the relaunch plan as an opportunity for over a million FTX creditors to be made whole. For one creditor <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan/status/1660809999466250242">DegenSpartan</a>, FTX 2.0 “is the most likely path to maximum recovery”.</p>



<p>FTX’s native token, FTT, surged 12.8% on Monday following the news of a potential reboot of the collapsed crypto empire of SBF. At press time, FTT is trading at $1.13, according to CoinGecko. The bankrupt exchange’s token was down 98.68% from its $84.18 all-time high set back in September 2021.</p>

<p>In light of the recent Ledger controversy, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano, has shared his perspective on the matter, emphasizing the importance of open-source software, simplicity in design, and honouring security promises.</p>



<p>Ledger is a France-based security firm that specializes in manufacturing crypto storage devices. For most of this week, the firm has come under fire from the crypto community after it deleted a May 17 tweet stating that it was “possible” for Ledger to write firmware that could extract users’ private keys.</p>



<p>The controversy surrounding the matter began on May 16 when the company introduced its latest service, &#8220;Ledger Recover.&#8221; The following day, the firm&#8217;s customer support tweeted, acknowledging that it was “possible” for Ledger to develop firmware capable of extracting users&#8217; private keys. However, the tweet was subsequently <a href="https://twitter.com/Ledger_Support/status/1659218986314366976">deleted,</a> amplifying the ongoing debate surrounding the topic, particularly because it directly addressed the introduction of the new feature.</p>



<p>The firm team, however, attempted to clarify the situation with Ledger chief technology officer Charles Guillemet emphasizing in a May 18 tweet that Ledger&#8217;s operating system (OS) mandates user consent whenever the OS interacts with a private key. This means that the OS cannot copy the device&#8217;s private key without the explicit consent of the user.</p>



<p>That said, despite the assurances, most people still seem unconvinced, with other observers now offering what they perceive will be a lasting solution to Ledger’s woes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hoskinson-s-advice-to-ledger"><strong>Hoskinson&#8217;s Advice to Ledger</strong></h2>



<p>Late Friday, May 19, Hoskinson weighed in on the situation, highlighting key considerations for individuals seeking secure cryptocurrency storage solutions.</p>



<p>Firstly, Hoskinson encouraged the adoption of open-source software that has undergone regular audits by multiple sources. According to him, by choosing such software, users can benefit from enhanced transparency and the collective efforts of the developer community to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>He also emphasized the principle that security often stems from simplicity, asking developers of hardware wallets to “Design the smallest possible footprint” in a bid to minimize attack vectors and potential points of weakness.</p>



<p>Addressing the issue of firmware updates, Hoskinson emphasized the significance of non-updateable firmware in cases where a company explicitly promises a specific security model. While he acknowledges the difficulty of replicating this concept in cryptocurrencies, he suggested that decentralizing the update process could significantly bolster security measures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, Hoskinson emphasized the importance of not breaking social contracts within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This serves as a reminder for developers and service providers to uphold their promises to users, fostering trust and accountability within the community.</p>



<p>That said, as the Ledger controversy unfolds, the ultimate redemption of the firm&#8217;s reputation hangs in the balance. Nevertheless, on Friday, Éric Larchevêque, Ledger co-founder and CEO, apologized, terming the events as “a total PR failure.” He further requested users to be patient, stating <em>that the meltdown was “absolutely not a technical one.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Some amount of trust must be placed into Ledger to use their product. If you don&#8217;t trust Ledger, meaning you treat your HW manufacturer as an adversary, that can&#8217;t work at all,”</em> he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/13ldgcl/my_personal_view_on_the_pr_disaster_from_a_ledger/">wrote</a> on Reddit.</p>

<p>Popular among Bitcoin (BTC) users as Ordinals, Dogecoin (DOGE) users have copied the architecture to create Doginals, which has the community all excited with few dissenting voices.</p>



<p>The introduction of Ordinals to Dogecoin and Litecoin has led to surging daily volumes for the third consecutive week. On May 18, transaction volumes on Dogecoin hit a new daily record of 1.2 million, according to <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-ltc-doge-dogecoin.html#3m">data</a> from BitinfoCharts.</p>



<p>Litecoin, on the other hand, has also recorded a volume pump to 584,000 transactions across a 24-hour time frame. Ordinals debuted on Litecoin after Twitter user Indigo Nakamoto promised 5 LTC to anyone who ports the Ordinals to the Litecoin network.</p>



<p>On Feb 19, developer Anthony Guerrero successfully created the Litecoin protocol; similarly, Dogecoin followed suit. Increased network activity began after both networks introduced LRC 20 and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/drc-20-is-it-time-for-dogecoin-to-shine-again-amidst-the-latest-meme-coin-wave/">DRC-20 standard tokens</a>, respectively, enabling users to create meme coins and other “<em>assets” </em>on both networks.</p>



<p>DOGE derived inspiration from Ordinals to create what they term Doginals, driving up network activity just as it did on Bitcoin. Due to surging network activity, gas fees on Bitcoin hit highs not recorded in years, leading to congestion of the mempool.</p>



<p>Before now, daily DOGE transactions averaged between 20,000-25,000 before spiking to 700,000 and now setting a new record above 1 million transactions.</p>

<p>The meme coin started the year recovering from losses recorded in 2022 and is still shy from its all-time high of 2021. Currently exchanging hands at $0.0736, the coin has gained 6.69% this year and is down by 13% from its price in May last year. Despite this slow growth, the community has moved around Doginals with bulls looking to ignite a run hinged on the Ordinal copycat.</p>



<p>Though the majority of users seem united in favor of Doginals, a core developer remains sceptical. Dogecoin developer Patrick Lodder shared his views on Doginals becoming short-lived.</p>



<p>“<em>Something like this cannot become a real ‘feature’ because it has not had enough thought given to it. The sustained and growing pressure on Dogecoin will cause this to die off quickly,” </em>he noted. He further added that the main issue is engineering, and he is yet to “<em>haven’t discovered a good way to program these tokens and give it actual function in a trustless way like you can on an ERC-20 token.”</em></p>
