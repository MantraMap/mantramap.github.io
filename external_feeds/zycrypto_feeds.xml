<p>XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger blockchain network, has notable market divergence metrics pointing to a strong bullish case, according to an analysis by Santiment.</p>



<p>Some of these metrics are pointed out by &#8216;Sanr_King,&#8217; a pseudonymous on-chain analyst on the market analytics platform. The analysis includes whale addresses continuing to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-whales-are-moving-millions-from-binance-as-looming-litigation-causes-record-outflows/">accumulate XRP</a> rapidly and traders continuing to short. It adds that a significant long/short ratio is also on the verge of being crossed.</p>



<p>Sanr explains that over the past six months, the group of XRP holders who own between 1 million and 10 million tokens has been accumulating. This cohort has increased their holding by 25%, bringing their total to 4.09 billion XRP. The trend is significant as it is often seen at market bottoms. The analyst adds that the whales also strongly influence the price of XRP.</p>



<p>The analysis further notes that the funding rate of XRP on Binance is currently slightly negative at -0.026%. While this suggests a bearish sentiment among traders, it is spearheaded by retail traders on Binance, who may not accurately predict short-term price movements.</p>



<p>The metric to look out for is the 30-day MVRV for XRP—a metric that measures the profit or loss of short-term traders. The metric is currently experiencing average losses of -7%. At these levels, short-term traders are likely hesitant to sell their coins at a loss. This could lead to an XRP price surge, the analysis notes.</p>



<p>Similarly, the MVRV Long/Short difference metric indicates growing confidence among long-term investors. The metric measures the average profit or loss of long-term holders versus short-term holders. It&#8217;s trending upwards, although currently at -11.45%, while the price of XRP has remained relatively sideways. The analysis notes that this could also potentially lead to an XRP upswing.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-could-the-bullish-indicators-land-the-xrp-price"><strong>Where could the bullish indicators land the XRP price?</strong></h2>



<p>Amid the bullish metrics, the price of XRP has mostly fluctuated between $0.28 and $0.54 for the past six months. The token trades at around $0.35, up 1.17% in the last 24 hours. </p>



<p>However, the bullish on-chain metrics and anticipation of ecosystem announcements could see XRP break out of this range. Popular XRP community member &#8216;WrathofKahneman&#8217; recently noted that XRP has seen much more utility than it did in the early days and will also roll out more use cases in 2023.</p>



<p>Added to this, market participants expect a conclusion to the SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple to arrive this quarter. A favourable ruling in the case could potentially cause the price of XRP to explode as the token gets <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-boss-bullish-about-2023-being-the-year-regulatory-issues-in-us-gain-breakthrough-clarity/">regulatory clarity</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-brad-garlinghouse-tells-where-crypto-market-is-headed-as-xrp-lawsuit-heads-for-conclusion/">Brad Garlinghouse</a>, the CEO of Ripple Labs, has expressed his cautious optimism about regulatory clarity for the crypto industry potentially coming to the United States in 2023.</p>



<h2 id="h-2023-will-usher-in-regulatory-clarity"><strong>2023 Will Usher In Regulatory Clarity</strong></h2>



<p>To commemorate the first day of the 118th Congress, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse voiced his optimism about 2023 being the year the United States achieved regulatory clarity for crypto. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1610352765129338880">Twitter thread</a> on Jan 3, Garlinghouse said support for crypto regulation is “bipartisan and bicameral”.</p>



<p>He then noted that the U.S. would not be starting with a blank slate for regulation, citing bills such as the Securities Clarity Act, the Cryptocurrency Facilitation for Investors and Digital Assets Act (RFIA), and the Clarification for Digital Tokens Act. While no bill has so far been able to satisfy everyone’s expectations, the Ripple chief explained that these would offer a starting point for debate in the new Congress as “the stakes couldn’t be higher”.</p>



<p>For years industry leaders, investors, and builders in the cryptosphere have whined about the uncertain regulatory climate. The hopeful narrative supports that more regulation will usher in more institutional money and buoy prices.</p>



<p>In 2022 there was some progress on the regulatory front for U.S. crypto-based companies — among other things, President Joe Biden <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-the-whole-bushel-of-bidens-groundbreaking-executive-order-for-cryptocurrencies/">signed </a>an executive order on crypto — but the year did not bring as much clarity as many expected.</p>



<p>In fact, the big picture only grew more complicated as the Terra network collapsed and wiped out $60 billion in customer funds, followed by the spectacular implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse remarked that the U.S. lags behind Singapore, Brazil, the EU, and Japan regarding crypto regulation and legislation. The lack of a coordinated effort both in the United States and internationally is forcing businesses to move to countries with fewer barriers, sometimes resulting in catastrophic consequences.</p>



<p>Now, it is paramount that the U.S. provides clear, specific directions on what is and what is not permissible. After years of hemming and hawing, lawmakers must specify whether crypto is a security, a utility, a commodity, or a currency.</p>



<p>That being said, they must act to ensure that the U.S. is a leader in this new area of financial technology. Additionally, they must also protect the investing public from <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-calls-sam-bankman-fried-a-fraudster-reveals-the-real-reason-behind-ftx-crash/">fraudsters like Bankman-Fried</a>.</p>



<p>Whether 2023 turns out to be the defining year for cryptocurrency regulation in the Land of Liberty remains to be seen.</p>

<ul>
<li>Foreigners investing in digital currencies in the U.K. are now exempt from paying taxes.</li>



<li>The new rule is only applicable if foreigners buy virtual currencies using local brokers in the U.K.</li>



<li>The country has hinted that it is keen on transforming itself into a crypto paradise after a torrid relationship with the asset class.</li>
</ul>



<p>Jan 1 heralded a new tax regime for digital assets in the U.K. targeted at foreign investors in digital assets with a focus on transforming the local digital economy.</p>



<p>Foreigners looking to invest in digital assets in the U.K. have been given a tax break starting on Jan 1 in line with the announcement back in December. In order to take advantage of the tax exemption, foreigners will have to purchase their virtual currencies through local brokers in the country.</p>



<p>The move has been hailed as one that could put the U.K. as one of the world’s leading destinations for virtual currency investors. In December, the government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-statutory-instrument-secondary-legislation-the-investment-manager-investment-transactions-cryptoassets-regulations-2022">included</a> crypto assets under Investment Manager Exemptions and according to His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rule will be extended to all transactions in the new year.</p>



<p><em>“This exemption is an important factor in attracting global investors, meaning foreign investors won’t be brought into U.K. tax simply by appointing U.K.-based investment managers,”</em> said HMRC.</p>



<p>The U.K. has been on the hunt for international investors as part of plans to improve the digital economy of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“One of the reasons for the U.K. attracting non-resident investors (including hedge funds) is their ability to appoint UK-based investment managers without creating a risk of U.K taxation for themselves,” </em>a government directory pointed out.</p>



<p>Residents in the U.K. have the tax burden of paying capital gains and income tax on virtual currency transactions. The tax requirement arises from buying or selling the asset class, mining, airdrops, and inheritance of virtual currencies.</p>



<h2 id="h-crypto-paradise-is-a-long-winding-road-for-the-u-k">Crypto paradise is a long, winding road for the U.K.</h2>



<p>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s government has unveiled a number of changes for virtual currencies in the U.K. as part of plans to transform the local ecosystem. The U.K. parliament is deliberating the use of stablecoins as a payment mechanism, while MP Andrew Griffith stated that it is time to “tentatively seize” virtual currency opportunities.</p>



<p>However, the actions of the<a href="https://zycrypto.com/uk-advertising-watchdog-censures-coinbase-etoro-papa-johns-over-misleading-crypto-ads/"> Advertising Standards Authority</a> (ASA) have dimmed the hopes of a crypto paradise following the multiple flagging down of ads by industry operators. The ASA has been on a red-hot streak over the last 12 months, with Floki Inu, Arsenal, Papa John’s Pizza, and Crypto.com receiving warnings from the advertising watchdog.</p>

<p>Gemini&#8217;s co-founder Cameron Winklevoss wrote an <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1609913051427524608">open letter</a> Tuesday accusing Barry Silbert, CEO of DCG, the parent company of Genesis trading, of causing the latter&#8217;s collapse. Genesis Global Trading temporarily suspended withdrawals in November due to liquidity issues resulting from the demise of FTX.</p>



<p>Winklevoss is blaming his DCG counterpart for failing to repay Genesis – its fully owned subsidiary &#8211; $1.675 billion. According to the letter, Genesis owes Gemini&#8217;s Earn users and other creditors $900 million. Winklevoss further accused the group of putting the funds in poorly calculated investments.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>You took this money…to fuel greedy share buybacks, illiquid venture investments, and kamikaze Grayscale NAV trades that ballooned the fee-generating AUM of your Trust, all at the expense of creditors and all for your gain,</em>&#8221; the open letter read.</p>



<p>According to Winklevoss, Silbert needs to cooperate with Gemini to find a solution for the repayment of the amount in question, adding that the DCG boss was acting in bad faith. The exchange&#8217;s president is also faulting his counterpart for refusing to have any meaningful engagement for an amicable solution. He further accused Silbert of trying to portray DCG and Genesis as separate entities, which they were not.</p>



<h2 id="h-silbert-denies-the-claims-says-dcg-was-not-indebted-to-genesis"><strong>Silbert Denies The Claims; Says DCG Was Not Indebted to Genesis</strong></h2>



<p>Responding to the open letter, Silbert denied DCG ever borrowing $1.675 billion from Genesis. He added that his company had not defaulted on any interest payment obligation to Genesis, noting that the next loan maturity was due in May 2023. Silbert said that DCG sent a written proposal to Gemini on Dec. 29 and was still waiting for a response.</p>



<p>Gemini, founded in 2015 by Cameroon and Tyler Winklevoss, had collaborated with Genesis for its high-yield Earn service, which offered a return of up to 8% for deposits. After the collapse of FTX in November, the lending platform suspended redemption, citing many requests. Gemini was also forced to follow suit.</p>



<p>The exposure to its parent company, among others, pushed Genesis Trading into a liquidity crunch. The firm was reported to have lost &#8220;<em>a few hundred million dollars</em>&#8221; following the collapse of Three Arrows Capital and Babel Finance. On June 17, Genesis&#8217; CEO Michael Moro said that the company &#8220;<em>mitigated (its) losses with a large counterparty who failed to meet a margin call. We sold collateral, hedged our downside, and moved on.</em>&#8220;</p>

<p>Luke Dashrj, one of the longest contributing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-recorded-338-more-transactions-despite-bitcoins-lead-in-search-interest-in-2022/">Bitcoin</a> Core developers, claims to have lost well over 200 BTC (roughly $3.34 million) this past weekend after his wallet keys were compromised. The developer disclosed the incident in a tweet on Monday, January 1st, saying;</p>



<p><em>“My PGP key is compromised, and at least many of my bitcoins stolen. I have no idea how. Help, please.”</em></p>



<p>PGP, or “Pretty Good Privacy”, is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and safety. It can encrypt data stored in a server to protect such data from unauthorized access.</p>



<p>Dashrj had reportedly used PGP to verify whether Bitcoin Knots or Bitcoin Core downloads were infected with malware before losing control of his keys in the process. Whereas Bitcoin Core is the most popular software used to connect to the Bitcoin network and run a node, Bitcoin Knots is a software with more advanced features than Bitcoin Core, but they are not as well-tested, making it more vulnerable to attacks.</p>



<p>Although the developer managed to track the stolen Bitcoins to an address, he was yet to receive help at the time of publication. Earlier, he had criticized the FBI and local law enforcement agencies for not responding to his calls for help. Hours later, he wrote- “Never mind. It&#8217;s basically all gone”.</p>



<p>The latest hack comes after the developer faced a similar incident in December and November 2022, where an unknown person accessed his server after bypassing his software-side security measures by rebooting the server of an unknown storage device. At the time, the developer confirmed the presence of new malware on the system. Further investigations suggested it was not a standard trojan but something created specifically to compromise his server.</p>



<p>Following the hack, crypto Twitter has been consoling the veteran developer. Earlier Yesterday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao promised to help by monitoring and freezing the coins if they were deposited to the exchange.</p>



<p><em>“If there is anything else we can help with, please let us know. We deal with these often, and have Law Enforcement (LE) relationships worldwide.”</em> Tweeted CZ.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, some crypto adherents have expressed worries over how the hackers managed to also access the developer&#8217;s cold wallet keys, with Dashrj maintaining that he also has no idea. The developer, however, warned against downloading Bitcoin Knots until the issue was resolved. He also advised those who had downloaded the software in the last few months to “consider shutting that system down for now.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethereum transactions outpaced BTC over fourfold in 2022 with over 400 million trades.&nbsp;</li>



<li>BTC topped the search charts as expected, with Ethereum finishing the year in a distant fourth place behind Shiba Inu and DOGE.</li>



<li>A cross-section of crypto users believes that ETH has all the metrics to outpace BTC in terms of growth in 2023.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite a bad run for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-fundamentals-better-than-ever-but-investors-remain-wary-about-price-falls/">Ethereum</a> (ETH) and most digital assets last year, ETH’s community has some positives to kickstart the new year. </p>



<p>According to data from Ycharts and Nasdaq on Jan 2, the Ethereum blockchain trumped Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of transaction volumes last year by a huge margin. Ethereum recorded  338% more transactions than Bitcoin as its figure climbed to 405 million over BTC’s 93.1 million.</p>



<p>On average, ETH recorded 1.1 million daily transactions, while BTC had 255,000. ETH was way ahead as these figures do not include layer 2 transactions which would have increased Ethereum’s numbers. According to reports, the ETH layer 2 transactions were above their Layer 1 figures in October.</p>



<p>This metric is not quite shocking to many as Ethereum plays host to top decentralized applications (DApps) increasing its transaction volume, but several users suggest that a “flippening” may soon occur with BTC getting more volume, although this is unlikely in the near future.</p>



<p>Ethereum has continued its fine form this year, tapping 924,614 transactions on Jan 2, 300% over Bitcoin’s 229,191 transactions in the same period. While BTC trails ETH in transaction volume, it attracted more search interest in 2022.</p>



<p>BTC hit 28.4 million Google searches in 2022, attracting more people than other digital assets. Ethereum was far behind in fourth place behind Shiba Inu and Dogecoin with 3.8 million global monthly Google searches.</p>



<h2 id="h-time-for-a-fresh-start"><strong>Time for a fresh start</strong></h2>



<p>The year has kicked off with Bitcoin and Ethereum making modest gains after the first day of trading as they pushed to recover from a turbulent 2022. BTC started the year with a little increase of 1%, trading above $16,730, while ETH also moved slightly upwards by 1.7% and traded at $1,217. Solana has also started the year with positives, as it is back in double figures after its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-why-solanas-future-is-still-bright-despite-sol-price-nuking-97-below-ath-vitalik-buterin/">slump</a> in the last days of 2022. </p>



<p>BTC and ETH were still shy of their status this time last year. In Jan 2022, BTC exchanged hands at $47,300, 64% higher than its current price, while ETH traded at around $3,730. On the bright side, the year starts with great enthusiasm, with several asset bulls looking to make the first run of the year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin enthusiasts are bracing themselves for new lows amid a bland opening to the year.</li>



<li>Underneath the charts, Bitcoin miners are seeing one of the most brutal capitulations since 2016 ahead of the network’s difficulty adjustment.</li>



<li>The assets supply has also taken a hit in recent weeks as the impetus to sell is at an all-time low for holders.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) entered 2023 showing little signs of activity, but analysts are construing the data as the calm before the storm.</p>



<p>Bitcoin started the year with prices bouncing sideways without its inherent volatility. The doldrum in prices has left enthusiasts with little hope of a rally after a torrid 2022 that saw a staggering 64% loss. </p>



<p>BTC currently trades at $16,718, with the one-week chart indicating a decline of 0.75%. Transaction volumes over 24 hours are at an all-time low at $11.9 billion as popular on-chain analyst Pentoshi eyes $12,000 as a tentative support zone for the asset.</p>



<p>With the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report a week away, it is widely believed that traders are waiting on the sidelines to gauge the macroeconomic trends that could shape BTC’s future. BTC holders are also keeping a keen eye on the Federal Reserve on whether or not it would reverse its trend of rate hikes.</p>



<p>Away from macroeconomics, Bitcoin is set to undergo a difficulty adjustment which analysts say will eliminate the gain made by the network. Bitcoin’s network difficulty climbed 3.27% before Christmas, but with miners under <a href="https://zycrypto.com/are-fears-of-bitcoin-miners-selling-pressure-overblown-this-expert-thinks-so/">pressure</a> from the asset’s price performance, difficulty levels are expected to drop by as much as 3.5%.</p>



<p>Hashrate levels hit their lowest in 2022, and there is little sign of a trend reversal since the start of the new year. Charles Edwards Of Capriole Investments termed it “the most brutal Bitcoin miner capitulation since 2016 and possibly ever.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-volatility-no-supply"><strong>No volatility, no supply</strong></h2>



<p>As prices continue to swing sideways, Bitcoin is experiencing its highest levels of stationary assets in wallets. Glassnode reports that holders have little incentive to trade their BTC while speculators continue to watch from the sidelines as short-term BTC trading declines.</p>



<p>With supply drying up, investors remain unsure of the market&#8217;s general direction. Bitcoin’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-sentiment-wavers-as-crypto-fear-and-greed-index-in-extreme-fear-territory/">Fear and Greed</a> Index hovers at “fear” levels but could slip into extreme fear given the grim metrics around the network.</p>



<p>For now, investors can only watch with bated breaths to see how BTC holds up in the coming days.</p>

<p>2023 is the year that Ripple wins its hard-fought $1.3 billion suit with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). More interestingly, it will also be the same year that Gensler steps down as SEC chairman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the prediction of Ben Armstrong, known as BitBoy Crypto on YouTube.</p>



<h2 id="h-prediction-1-ripple-wins-sec-lawsuit-in-2023"><strong>Prediction 1: Ripple Wins SEC Lawsuit In 2023</strong></h2>



<p>It is over two years since Ripple, the company which develops the crypto-based cross-border payments protocol, has been fighting the high-profile lawsuit filed by the SEC.</p>



<p>The case pitting Ripple against the American top financial cop is now nearing conclusion, and many crypto onlookers believe the blockchain firm stands a good chance of winning the lawsuit. YouTuber Ben Armstrong, whose videos produced under the moniker BitBoy Crypto have 1.45 million subscribers, has suggested that 2023 will be the year the XRP lawsuit concludes “and the Ripple curse is broken”.</p>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">charged </a>Ripple in December 2020 with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering when the company sold the XRP cryptocurrency to raise capital for its business. The crux of the case is whether the token passes the Howey Test, established in 1946, which determines when assets meet the criteria for being considered investment contracts under U.S. Federal law. A judge could soon give the answer to the question of whether XRP is an unlicensed security. Billions of dollars are riding on the ultimate answer.</p>



<p>As for BitBoy Crypto, Ripple is set to win the closely watched courtroom battle.</p>



<h2><strong>Prediction 2: Gary Gensler Steps Down</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC has long been criticized for consistently lacking clarity regarding its approach and unwillingness to provide useful insight. The securities watchdog has also raised eyebrows in the cryptosphere over its dealings with Ethereum, the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>In 2018, a senior official at the agency gave a historic speech saying the sale of ETH tokens did not constitute a securities breach because the project was “sufficiently decentralized.”</p>



<p>Gary Gensler, the agency’s chairman, has posited several times his view that most crypto assets are securities, with the exception of bitcoin, which is a commodity.</p>



<p>Like many Ripple faithfuls, Brian Armstrong wants Gensler to bow out. In fact, he broadly predicted that the SEC boss would be forced to resign this year, possibly after Ripple wins the case.</p>

<ul>
<li>Charles Hoskinson says he will test IOHK’s new Lace Wallet with $1,000,000 worth of ADA.</li>



<li>He points to the recent LastPass hack as the key reason why several tests are required before wallets are open to users.&nbsp;</li>



<li>In another development, Hoskinson refutes claims of disappointment over Gemini’s rejection of listing ADA.</li>
</ul>



<p>Cardano (ADA) has experienced an all-around growth this year from network security to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and now its latest wallet has been rolled out for early adoption.</p>



<p>Cardano’s co-founder Charles Hoskinson says he is willing to place $1,000,000 worth of ADA in Input Output’s (IOHK) new digital asset wallet as security tests are still in progress. He expressed confidence in the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption of paper wallets and challenged users to hack it.</p>



<p>“<em>When Lace wallet starts supporting PGP encryption of paper wallets, I’m going to take some ADA, probably a million dollars worth of it, put it into a paper wallet encrypted with PGP, and publicly post it on my Twitter so you guys can try to break it. I’m very confident in those standards. Master passwords, even if they’re quite long, it’s just a dead standard, and it shouldn’t be done anymore,” </em>says Hoskinson.</p>



<p>Lace, a lightweight wallet developed by IOHK, aims to seamlessly connect data in web2 and web3 in a single interface. The network prioritizes security by integrating Nano X into the wallet. </p>



<p>In a new YouTube release, Hoskinson spoke about the recent LastPass hack calling it <em>“a screw up and a pretty dirty hack.” </em>LastPass is a password management firm that got compromised as hackers gained access to a third party’s cloud-based storage used by the company to store data.</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-s-team-pledges-more-development"><strong>Cardano’s team pledges more development</strong></h2>



<p>The Cardano project has taken giant strides this year in several areas, including key partnerships with payment tools, web3 projects, as well as engaging users in vital security upgrades.</p>



<p>In October, Cardano announced its partnership with Obsidian Systems to drive development based on its Hydra Payment tools. Hydra is Cardano’s layer 2 scaling solution <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-finally-gaining-massive-traction-as-upcoming-hydra-upgrade-proves-to-be-a-game-changer-for-ada/">created</a> to make the network more efficient with increasing traffic.</p>



<p>Cardano’s NFTs are surging, growing over 300% in volume in Q4 2022 alone. Still leading Cardano’s NFT marketplaces are CNFT and JPG Store, both experiencing growth with top projects and creators leveraging on the network’s improving web3 efforts. </p>

<ul>
<li>Solana loses its top two NFT projects to rival networks as yOOTs and DeGods plan exodus.</li>



<li>The two NFT projects have had an increase in sales following the announcement signalling a bad trend for Solana. </li>



<li>Polygon and Ethereum pick up late wins before the end of the year following the news that yOOts and DeGods will be moving to their respective networks in Q1 2023.</li>
</ul>



<p>More troubles pile on for the community dubbed “Eth killer” <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-why-solanas-future-is-still-bright-despite-sol-price-nuking-97-below-ath-vitalik-buterin/">Solana</a> with its Non-Fungible Token (NFT) division which has been its highest winner this year, losing two top projects.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, yOOts and DEGods announced that they would both leave the Solana network confirming rumours that have been circulating for months. yOOTs will be moving to Polygon, while sister project DeGods will be on Ethereum in Q1 2022.</p>



<p>So far, the news has sparked divergent opinions from the community and the teams. For a section of the Solana community, it is disappointing to see the projects leave; however some feel it is the fault of the network with recurring hacks and downtimes, among other issues.</p>



<p>The project’s leader Rohan Vora said the move was for the project&#8217;s growth in 2023.</p>



<p><em>“There’s an argument to be made that [DeGods] has capped out on Solana. It’s hard to accept, but it’s been tough to grow at the rate we want to grow. If Ethereum is where we have to go to keep growing, it’s what we have to do.”</em></p>



<p>yOOts’s exodus to Polygon was a paid move influenced by a grant from Polygon’s partnership fund to the project. The grant is said to last a year or two, with further details withheld from the public.</p>



<h2 id="h-solana-s-loss-rivals-win"><strong>Solana’s loss, rivals win</strong></h2>



<p>This year, Solana’s NFT projects went head-to-head with Ethereum and had more trade <a href="https://zycrypto.com/despite-network-outages-solana-trumps-ethereum-as-nft-sales-hit-947-million/">volumes</a> in some months despite general network issues. Losing yOOts and DeGods will come at a huge price for Solana. The network is about to experience a huge setback, with both yOOts and DeGods accounting for 70% of the network&#8217;s NFT sales.</p>



<p>DeGods price, which stands at 515 SOL, the highest in the network, surged by 12% following the news that it will be on Ethereum next year. yOOts also has a little uptick by 5% as it expected to commence its partnerships with Polygon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Layer 2 blockchain, Polygon, has had a brilliant partnership in 2022, attracting huge deals with Instagram, Reddit, Nike, and Starbucks, as it looks to start 2023 on a high with yOOts. Ethereum, on the other hand, remains the king of NFTs and will cement its place following closest rival Solana&#8217;s loss of two of its top projects.</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-new-dates-in-the-sec-vs-ripple-case-point-towards-a-final-court-verdict-in-q1-2023/">SEC vs Ripple</a> case extends into the new year, XRP supporters are on the lookout for any edge Ripple could have over the SEC in hopes that it might strengthen Ripple’s chances of winning the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-ripple-another-step-ahead-of-the-sec-in-the-ongoing-case"><strong>Is Ripple another step ahead of the SEC in the ongoing case?</strong></h2>



<p>Luckily, XRP supporters can look at the recent statements made by the U.S. Department of Justice, which classifies two cryptocurrency tokens as “commodities.” The statements have spurred optimism among community members, who consider the statement a valid point of reference for Ripple&#8217;s lawyers in the ongoing case.</p>



<p>The classification of two cryptocurrencies, namely CRV and MNGO, as commodities by the U.S. DOJ, can be seen in a recent court filing against Avraham Eisenberg.</p>



<p>Avraham Eisenberg, who was allegedly involved in hacking the decentralized exchange platform Mango Markets, was recently charged with market manipulation after being arrested on the 28th of December in Puerto Rico.</p>



<p>The documents filed against Eisenberg, who allegedly made away with over $50 million from the hack, were filed in the same court where the SEC vs Ripple case is currently taking place.</p>



<p>In the filing, the DoJ refers to CRV and MNGO as commodities in different paragraphs. This has triggered positive sentiments among Ripple supporters who speculate that if the DoJ can classify these other crypto assets as commodities, Ripple&#8217;s XRP might also be categorized as a commodity, not a security.</p>



<p>However, some notable figures in the cryptocurrency industry have debunked these claims, highlighting the difference in the DOJ&#8217;s situation.</p>



<p>One such figure was General Counsel at Delphi Labs Gabriel Shapiro. Shapiro explained that the label on both cryptos isn&#8217;t bullish for XRP or cryptocurrencies in general.</p>



<p><em>“The fact that the case doesn&#8217;t characterize the relevant tokens as securities is not in any way bullish/positive and merely arises from litigation strategy&#8211;the fewer predicate issues the govt has to litigate in its case, the better. Moreover, swaps are just as big if not a bigger regulatory quagmire than securities.” He wrote in a tweet.</em></p>



<p>Similarly, popular attorney John E Deaton has pushed back on these takes, saying that prosecutors&#8217; choice of language does not hold any weight as a defence tool for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-to-develop-national-stablecoin-for-island-country-palau-xrp-up-6/">Ripple</a>.</p>



<p>Per his tweet below ;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“NOT TRUE. Prosecutors are simply calling the tokens commodities for their own prosecutorial reasons. Whether the underlying asset is a commodity or a security isn’t important &#8211; the fraud is. Calling it a security creates an unnecessary burden of proof.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The heightened volatility in the digital asset class has caused investors to flee, says JPMorgan’s strategist. </li>



<li>2022 has been a tough year for cryptos because of macroeconomic factors.</li>
</ul>



<p>JPMorgan&#8217;s senior investment strategist said that large individual and institutional investors are not interested in cryptos due to the volatility seen in 2022. Jared Gross told Bloomberg in a podcast that the class of investors was happy that they did not put money in crypto this year and may not do so soon.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>As an asset class, crypto is effectively non-existent for most large institutional investors. The volatility is too high, and the lack of an intrinsic return that you can point to makes it very challenging. Most institutional investors probably are breathing a sigh of relief that they didn&#8217;t jump into that market and are probably not going to be doing so anytime soon.</em>&#8221; Gross said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2020, cryptocurrencies boomed. The following year, many digital assets surged to their all-time high, including Bitcoin, which topped $68,000. That was not the case in 2022. A high inflation rate, costly borrowing rates, and the collapse of large crypto companies saw the flagship cryptocurrency touch $15,000 in November, a drop of about 77% from the ATH.</p>



<h2 id="h-bitcoin-has-never-been-a-hedge-against-inflation-says-gross"><strong>Bitcoin Has Never Been A Hedge Against Inflation – Says Gross </strong></h2>



<p>Such heightened volatility cannot qualify Bitcoin as digital gold or as a hedge against inflation &#8211; which has never been &#8211; according to Gross. He added that the interest in digital assets could have disappeared or was not there initially.</p>



<p>It is not the first time JPM has expressed scepticism against crypto, especially in the current bear cycle. The investment bank&#8217;s CEO Jamie Dimon has remarked in the past that he was not a supporter of bitcoin, adding that he &#8220;<em>personally (thought) that bitcoin (was) worthless</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>On the contrary, the largest US bank by assets opened access to its wealth management clients for six crypto funds in 2021. The multinational is also involved in, among other funds, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust. Regarding the matter, Dimon said that the decision is investor-driven.</p>

<p>On December 13, 2022, John Ray III, the new CEO of FTX Group overseeing its bankruptcy, testified before congress on the collapse of FTX. Ray’s testimony highlighted a number of corporate failures at the now defunct FTX and the efforts underway by his new management team to identify and recover the company’s assets of the company, and to minimise further customer loss.</p>



<p>According to Ray, some of the failures at FTX included the lack of basic bookkeeping, lack of trusted financial records, compromised systems integrity, lack of a clear record of the company’s employees, concentration of controls in the hands of a small group of inexperienced individuals, the commingling of deposits and insider lending with Alameda Research (his crypto trading firm), use of an unsecured group email that had access to critical and sensitive data, and the lack of an accurate list of the company’s bank accounts.</p>



<p>Some of the past and significant corporate failures occurred during the accounting scandals witnessed during the 1990s and early 2000’s. The management failures found at FTX are not new to the corporate world. The failures at FTX have also occurred across various sectors ranging from energy, telecommunications, banking, and insurance to name a few.</p>



<p>The energy trading company Enron rocked the world when its executives employed dubious accounting practices that gave an illusion of higher current profits to boost the stock price to sell their shares and to claim huge bonuses. WorldCom, a telecommunications firm, also inflated earnings on its financial reports.</p>



<p>However, these accounting scandals resulted in a wave of new regulations and legislation. In particular, congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) that imposed harsh penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating financial records. The Act also aimed to protect investors by increasing the accuracy of financial reporting for publicly traded companies.</p>



<p>The collapse of FTX has undoubtedly rocked the crypto world. One may argue that many of the failures at FTX are traditional management failures and are not specific to crypto. The same failures could happen in any industry. However, many of the other industries have been around longer than crypto and have hence benefited from existing and new regulation.</p>



<p>The crypto industry is relatively nascent. In a number of jurisdictions, there is little or even no crypto. Where crypto regulation exists, it is also largely fragmented in nature. The events at FTX will prompt authorities to speed up the passing of crypto regulation.</p>



<p>The former CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is facing several counts that include civil securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders, wire fraud on lenders, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>



<p>SBF was remanded in custody after being denied bail by a judge in the Bahamas. He advised the court in the Bahamas that he would not waive his right to fight extradition to the United States.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethereum is currently the largest proof-of-stake blockchain after its Merge and has over 491,000 validators securing the network. </li>



<li>The blockchain leads the way by a huge margin in NFTs, with over $23.7 billion worth of tokens minted in the network this year</li>



<li>In a related development, Bloomberg’s senior macro strategist Mike McGlone says that ETH will outperform BTC in the next bull run.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Ethereum (ETH) has struggled for the most part of the year, but its fundamentals look better than its current market value. </p>



<p>The network’s much-anticipated Merge went live this year as it transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The effects on the blockchain were huge as its energy usage was cut by 98%, with validators replacing miners.</p>



<p>Over 100 days since the Merge, ETH still struggles below $1,500, trading at $1,217. The network currently has over 490,000 validators with the number expected to grow in 2022. According to Beaconcha.in, an open-source Ethereum blockchain explorer, there are currently 15.7 million ETH staked on the network since September, worth around $19.2 billion. </p>



<p>ETH began the year with prospects of hitting new highs after ETH2, which will make the platform more efficient and faster, but the price has struggled in recent months. The asset has lost over 55% in value this year, although market experts are usually impressed by its fundamentals.</p>



<p>Bloomberg’s senior macro strategist, Mike McGlone, has tipped ETH to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-is-positioned-to-outperform-bitcoin-bloombergs-top-strategist-asserts/">outperform</a> its rival, Bitcoin (BTC), in the next bull run. His views on ETH are shaped by the smart contracts active on the network and wider mainstream adoption. </p>



<p><em>“Migration into the mainstream is our key takeaway and once the dust settles from some reversion in risk assets amid inflation pressures, Ethereum is more likely to resume doing what it has been—outperforming”</em></p>



<h2 id="h-nfts-are-still-at-home"><strong>NFTs are still at home</strong></h2>



<p>The Ethereum Network is the largest smart contract-enabled network, attracting huge decentralization applications (DApps) over the years. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are more prominent on Ethereum, with the blockchain playing host to top NFT projects, including CryptoPunks, Axie Infinity, Decentraland, etc.</p>



<p>This year, NFTs worth over $23.7 billion were minted on Ethereum as it remains ahead of closest rivals Solana and Cardano. This year, Solana’s NFT <a href="https://zycrypto.com/despite-nagging-issues-nft-mints-on-solana-sets-a-new-all-time-high-record/">mints</a> got to an all-time high with several speculations that it may unseat Ethereum as the home of NFTs, but so far, Ethereum remains king.</p>
