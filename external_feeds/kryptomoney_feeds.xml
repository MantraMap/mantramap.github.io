										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2023/34-96751.pdf">rejected</a> an application from Ark Investment Management and 21Shares to list a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the Cboe BZX Exchange, a decision that comes as little surprise to those familiar with the regulatory landscape surrounding the nascent crypto industry.<br /><br />The idea has now been rejected by the dreaded regulator twice; the first time was in April, when a similar effort was also thwarted. Undaunted, the pair submitted a new application in May of last year, but the organization once again cited fraud and manipulation concerns as the main factors in making its decision. The SEC emphasized that <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/defi-platform-bzx-loses-8-million-in-third-hack-in-2020/">BZX</a> had not shown that their plan complied with the rules governing the avoidance of dishonest practices.<br /><br />The agency&#8217;s choice is supported by its conviction that the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-market-sees-heavy-collapse-as-price-corrects-below-48000/"> Bitcoin market</a> is still vulnerable to fraud and manipulation and that, to identify and discourage such behavior, a thorough surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of scale is required. <br /><br />According to the SEC, BZX neglected to address risk considerations unique to Bitcoin. It is unknown if Ark and 21Shares will attempt to list a spot bitcoin ETF again, but given the regulatory environment at the moment, it appears unlikely that the SEC would change its position very soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/amazon-partners-with-avalanche-avax-price-up-17-in-barely-an-hour/">Amazon</a> is advancing its efforts to establish a presence in the cryptocurrency market. A non-fungible token (NFT) proposal would reportedly be introduced by the firm sometime in the spring of 2023.<br /><br />Six people with knowledge of the situation are cited in the report. It states that to assist its NFT strategy, Amazon has collaborated with more than ten cryptocurrency initiatives. Following a fall in the NFT market from its peak in 2021, the initiative might reinforce and resuscitate the industry.<br /><br />The e-commerce giant would reportedly concentrate on several sectors and dabble in NFT gaming. Players who use the platform will receive special NFT rewards.<br /><br />Amazon already provides access to a videogame platform to customers of its Prime service. Members of this service have access to the platform&#8217;s library and are given prizes each month that can be used to buy AAA games. By providing additional incentives and drawing in new customers, the new NFT project could strengthen the service.<br /><br />According to news reports, the NFT platform is currently under development and may operate directly on Amazon rather than through Amazon Web Services (AWS). There is no formal announcement from Amazon or its management, although the firm may disclose further details in April 2023.<br /><br />To reach a<em> “much bigger audience” </em>the e-commerce site aims to reach a <em> “truly worldwide platform.” </em>Amazon might be working toward such goals.<br /><br />The business garnered interest in the cryptocurrency sector two weeks ago when it disclosed cooperation with Ava Labs, the organization in charge of the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/avalanche-raises-42m-from-token-sale-in-4-5-hours/">Avalanche blockchain</a>. To grant access to this network to thousands of businesses, the cryptocurrency company teamed up with AWS.</p>

The St. Maarten government on the island of the Eastern Caribbean may soon formally adopt Tron. The head of the United People&#8217;s Party and second vice chairman of St. Maarten&#8217;s parliament, Member of Parliament (MP) Rolando Brison, has long been vocal about the advantages of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies for his country&#8217;s citizens and economy. The Tron protocol has now been proposed as the nation&#8217;s blockchain infrastructure, and TRX, a cryptocurrency built on the Tron platform, has been declared legal tender for everyday use. Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, tweeted about the milestone: &#8220;Another milestone for TRON! St. Maarten to adopt TRON as legal tender marks another achievement for our push on worldwide blockchain adoption.&#8221; The Commonwealth of Dominica declared seven cryptocurrencies based on Tron to be legal tender and designated Tron as its national blockchain in an official announcement made in October 2022.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.850, $0.750, $0.650<br />Support Levels: $0.600, $0.550, $0.500</p>

<p>TRX dipped slightly on Thursday but stayed within the previous two days&#8217; range. The technical indicators continue to suggest some market caution, with the RSI flattening in buying territory. If sellers push the TRX below the consolidation floor at $0.600, another negative barrier at $0.55 may appear.<br /><br />Alternatively, if buyers find support off the MA 200 at $0.610, significant resistance may form around the horizontal barrier at $0.650. Overcoming this, the price may reach $0.720 before reaching the $0.750 high. If the rally continues, the bulls could test the $0.800 level before attempting to retrace.</p>

<p>Above $0.600, TRX is firmly entrenched within a consolidation zone around the 4-hour MA 50. The immediate hurdle at $0.650 might limit the upside. A downward leg might encounter the $0.600 support zone before dragging the bears farther below the $0.55 level in the event of a decline.<br /><br />Alternatively, a significant barrier at $0.65 might limit the upside, with a break here and a nearby $0.70 barrier required to provide a stronger bullish signal for a possible continuation of the recovery. Above these levels, the $1.00 level may come into focus. In summary, the prediction is neutral to positive as prices continue to move around the moving averages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The CEO of the world&#8217;s largest credit card firm told shareholders that <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/stablecoins-might-soon-be-officially-categorized-as-securities/">stablecoins</a> and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will play a<em> &#8220;meaningful role&#8221;</em> in the payments market in the future.<br /><br />In addition, the firm released its 2022 annual report, in which it discussed its complementary and competitive relationship with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Visa already has <em>&#8220;multiple initiatives&#8221;</em> in the blockchain field, according to CEO Alfred Kelly on a <a href="https://annualreport.visa.com/annual-meeting/default.aspx">conference call</a>, and has invested in various crypto funds and companies.<br /><br /><em>“It’s very early days, but we continue to believe that stablecoins and central bank digital currencies have the potential to play a meaningful role in the payments space,”</em> said Kelly.<br /><br />Stablecoins combine the peer-to-peer nature of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin with the relative price stability of another currency or asset—frequently the U.S. dollar. This solves the price instability problem that critics, including central banks, claim prevents Bitcoin from being a legitimate currency. <br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tethers-usdt-topples-xrp-market-cap/">Tether (USDT)</a>, which is the largest stablecoin by market cap, has a higher daily transaction volume than any other crypto.<br /><br />CBDCs, on the other hand, are government-issued digital currencies built on blockchain rails. Lael Brainard, vice chair of the Federal Reserve, has expressed support for the establishment of a CBDC in the United States by offering a<em> “safe central bank liability in the digital financial ecosystem.” </em>Visa partnered with ConsenSys last year to connect CBDCs to current payment networks.<br /><br /><em>“Technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, blockchain technology and digital currencies,”</em> the company stated, adding that crypto payment platforms <em>“can be both a partner and a competitor to Visa.”</em></p>

<p>The official Twitter account of the commission-free trading software Robinhood has been <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1618292308902051843">compromised</a> to promote a fraudulent coin called $RBH on the BNB Chain.<br /><br />Earlier on Wednesday, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/robinhood-suspends-purchase-of-gamestop-stock-amid-unusual-rally/">Robinhood</a>&#8216;s Twitter account was hacked and used to advertise the phony cryptocurrency project. The hackers announced the release of the new coin named $RBH, which they said could be purchased for $0.0005 on the Binance Smart Chain.<br /><br />According to the hacker&#8217;s update, the cryptocurrency was offered for $0.0005 per unit. Of course, the BNB chain-based token is a honeypot fraud, which means that RBH token owners cannot sell or transfer them after purchasing them.<br /><br />Before the link was removed, about 25 people bought the hoax token, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1618295142234091520">Blockchain Explorer</a> data. All in all, less than $8,000 was spent on the purchases.<br /><br />Some Twitter users discovered that transactions had been routed to the fake account via Binance Hot Wallets after the attack was discovered.<em>&#8220;our security team also noticed that and have locked the account pending further investigations,&#8221; </em>said Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, the CEO of Binance, in reaction to the attack.<br /><br />According to a<a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-Crypto-Crime-Report.html"> chainanalysis</a> assessment, crypto attacks increased quickly in 2022, totaling $3 billion in total assets loss for the year.</p>

<ul>
<li>A new generation of digital creators can now be added to the SWOOSH platform</li>
<li>Nike&#8217;s premier Web3 project, SWOOSH, launches on January 25</li>
<li>At the time of writing, Polygon (MATIC) is down 5.09% in the last 24 hours at $0.953</li>
</ul>
<p>After numerous testing months, a new generation of digital creators can now be added to the <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoSavingExpert/nikes-web3-platform-swoosh-set-to-launch-on-january-25-15c77b6f1005">SWOOSH platform.</a> Its inaugural collection is inspired by Nike&#8217;s legendary Air Force 1 sneaker collection. Nike&#8217;s premier Web3 project, SWOOSH, launches on January 25, based on a remark made by Nike&#8217;s senior product manager, Jasmine Gao. This Wednesday, January 25, 2023, SWOOSH, a community-driven platform for Web3 digital art, launches. Since the middle of November 2022, the platform has been in development and beta testing. Its supporters agreed that the first works of digital art to be made available would be sneakers with AF1 design elements. Polygon Cofounder, Sandeep Nailwal tweeted about the launch: <em>&#8220;This is gonna explode and bring millions of users to Web3.&#8221;</em> Polygon announced partnerships with leading luxury brands Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Bulgari in Q1 2022. At the time of writing, Polygon (MATIC) is down 5.09% in the last 24 hours and trading at $0.953.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $1.300, $1.150, $1.000<br />Support Levels: $0.900, $0.800, $0.700</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-64112 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-matic-surpasses-key-barrier-on-positive-mastercard-news-polygon-sets-new-record-in-staking/">MATIC/USD</a> moved higher from the session low of $0.932 reaching a high of $0.972 as the pair seeks to break out from the $1.00 psychological zone. The $0.950 support level might hold back the sellers in the event the price returns lower. While the price seeks entry into the bullish zone, the RSI is moving south in the positive range.<br /><br />The next horizontal level at $0.90 is the closest support that might arrest even deeper drops if the upward momentum is broken and prices shift lower. If it is broken, the focus may shift to the downside, and prices may decline toward the direction of the rising trendline support near the $0.800 level.</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-64113 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>MATIC/USD fell to $0.932 before returning past the $0.950 level. This week&#8217;s initial bias is still neutral. A breach of $0.900 support, on the other hand, would shift intraday bias downward and cause a retest of the $0.750 low region. In contrast, a break above $1.00 may aim for the resistance level between the $1.150 to $1.300 levels.<br /><br />Consolidation around the $1.00, on the other hand, might restart the upward movement from a lower zone of $0.900 level. If the pair encounters more sellers beneath the moving average (MA 50) on the 4-hour chart, MATIC&#8217;s price might continue to decline under the $0.850 level.</p>

<p>El Salvador&#8217;s President, Nayib Bukele, <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1617700039534731264">announced</a> Monday that his country has repaid $800 million on an external bond, despite fears that the government would default owing to its <em>&#8220;bitcoin bet&#8221;</em> last year.<br /><br />Investors in the Eurobond have been paid out after the country finished its transfer of funds to international creditors, providing a form of retort to the president&#8217;s regime&#8217;s critics.<br /><br /><em>“In the past year, almost every legacy international news outlet said that because of our ‘bitcoin bet,’ El Salvador was going to default on its debt by January 2023,”</em> Bukele <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1617700039534731264">tweeted</a> Monday. <em>“Well, we just paid in full, $800 million dollars plus interest.”</em><br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/el-salvador-president-announces-bitcoin-a-day-buying-despite-54-million-losses/">El Salvador</a> promised to buy back some of its debt as part of a repurchase plan last year in response to worries that the country might fail. <br /><br />Eurobonds, which are often issued in another currency, help organizations and countries raise funds for infrastructure projects, among other things. In September, Bukele&#8217;s government established a<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-republic-of-el-salvador-announces-an-invitation-for-offers-to-tender-for-cash-its-2023-notes-and-2025-notes-301622290.html?tc=eml_cleartime"> purchase price</a> of $910 for its January 2023 notes and $540 for bonds expiring in 2025, totaling $800 million.<br /><br />El Salvador became the world&#8217;s first country to accept bitcoin as legal cash alongside the USD in September 2021, drawing plaudits from participants and investors in the digital asset market.<br /><br />The project witnessed the purchase of bitcoin with public funding, as well as the launch of the <em>&#8220;Chivo&#8221;</em> national digital wallet. The wallet first saw a significant increase due to an offer for people to receive $30 in Bitcoin for signing up.<br /><br />Despite its initial popularity, major rating agencies and the International Monetary Fund warned against bitcoin&#8217;s volatility throughout last year, as concerns about the country&#8217;s exposure to the asset class grew following a dramatic market fall in the second quarter.<br /><br />By May, Bitcoin had dropped more than 50% as a result of Terra&#8217;s ecosystem implosion, sending markets into a tailspin and triggering calls from the IMF to overturn El Salvador&#8217;s decision. Despite industry headwinds, Bukele&#8217;s government has continued to purchase the asset, including a further 80 BTC at $19,000 each in July, just after the market crashed.<br /><br />Bukele said in November that he would begin purchasing one Bitcoin every day, a dollar-cost averaging method that, if used from the start, would have saved the country millions of dollars.<br /><br />El Salvador possesses approximately 2,516 BTC worth $57.9 million, down about $51.5 million for $109.5 million, according to <a href="https://nayibtracker.com/">NayibTracker</a>, which analyzes the country&#8217;s overall holdings as well as the timing of its acquisitions based on Bukele&#8217;s tweets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/annual-meeting-davos-2023/?DAG=3">World Economic Forum</a> (WEF) was attended by USD Coin (USDC) founder <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/at-davos-circle-put-mission-front-and-center">Circle</a> to discuss <em>&#8220;why USDC is a dollar with super powers.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Between January 16 and January 20, 2023, almost 1,500 business and governmental leaders from all across the world attended the WEF in Davos.<br /><br />According to Circle&#8217;s<a href="https://www.circle.com/hubfs/PDFs/2301StateofUSDCEconomy_Web.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4baaa56e-c84f-4e02-990b-3ba7994812ec%7C01d5168e-a22d-4138-91db-50cf8d657299"> report</a>, the occasion was crucial for the firm. Circle claimed to have made use of the WEF platform to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…reset the crypto narrative with an emphasis on inclusive growth, sustainability and use cases rooted in the utility value of USDC and blockchain technology.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In more than a dozen meetings with WEF attendees, Circle provided a summary of the development of money and the legal frameworks for cryptocurrencies that encourage responsible innovation.</p>
<p>Circle also stressed its belief that the <em>&#8220;future of money should include everyone.&#8221;</em><br /><br />The amount of USDC in circulation increased from $0 to $45 billion in four years, according to Circle&#8217;s <em>&#8220;State of the USDC Economy&#8221;</em> report, which was released on January 17. It is supported by wallets from 190 different countries, is the native currency of eight blockchains, and has more than 200 integrated protocols.<br /><br />In February 2022, almost a year ago, USDC began to increase its stablecoin market share, posing a threat to Tether&#8217;s (USDT) dominance. Despite the bear market, USDC&#8217;s market share among stablecoins grew. <br /><br />According to <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/usdc-stablecoin-provider-in-its-strongest-financial-position-ever-says-circle-ceo/">recent data</a>, USDC presently has a higher transfer volume, while USDT continues to be the market&#8217;s largest stablecoin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Fantom&#8217;s FTM token is up 25% on the weekly basis</li>
<li>FTM is up nearly 100% since the start of 2023</li>
<li>The Fantom blockchain has received positive news</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftm-price-analysis-ftm-price-gains-5-fantom-based-defi-project-integrates-multiple-chainlink-services/">Fantom&#8217;s FTM token</a> is up 25% weekly and is trading at $0.404 at the time of this writing, per <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/fantom">CoinGecko</a> data. The token is up 7% in the last 24 hours. Andre Cronje, the co-founder of Fantom (FTM), is updating the community on the smart contract platform&#8217;s progress since the new year. FTM is up nearly 100% since the start of 2023. Cronje tells his Twitter followers that no one should expect any announcements or reveals as they advance the Fantom ecosystem. <em>&#8220;Expectation management is important, and I want to stress, there will be no announcements or reveals. No, this isn’t reverse psychology, I’m serious. We aren’t focused on announcements anymore, we simply discuss progress,&#8221;</em> Cronje stated. The Fantom blockchain has received positive news as the Squid SDK, which allows developers to index, transform, and use blockchain data for free, has finally arrived on Fantom.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.6500, $0.5500, $0.4300<br />Support Levels: $0.3500, $0.2900, $0.2500</p>
<h4>FTM/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-64100 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-Daily-Jan-24.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-Daily-Jan-24.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-Daily-Jan-24-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-Daily-Jan-24-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-Daily-Jan-24-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-Daily-Jan-24-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-Daily-Jan-24-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">FTM/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>As bulls try to convert the resistance zone at $0.4300 into support in expectation of a move higher, FTM reached a daily high of $0.4275 at the time of writing before backtracking to $0.4080 on Tuesday. If the horizontal resistance at $0.4300 is breached, market participants may be motivated to move the pair in a more defined direction. Currently, the daily period RSI indicator is near 80, signaling a buy signal.<br /><br />As can be seen, several shorts were forced to cover their positions after FTM closed above $0.4000 the day before. In the near term, a little drop shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise if the market verifies overbought circumstances. However, this can present a buy-the-dip opportunity. In the event of a retreat, the move toward the important $0.3000 could give the FTM price instant support. Otherwise, the bulls may go for the $0.5500 level as they run higher.</p>
<h4>FTM/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bullish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-64101 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-4-Hour-Jan-24.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-4-Hour-Jan-24.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-4-Hour-Jan-24-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-4-Hour-Jan-24-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-4-Hour-Jan-24-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-4-Hour-Jan-24-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FTMUSD-4-Hour-Jan-24-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">FTM/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftm-price-analysis-fantom-spikes-on-speculation-of-andre-conjes-comeback-here-are-levels-to-watch/">FTM/USD</a> pair has a positive signal. The resolution of a bullish pennant is resulting in more price growth for FTM. If the $0.4300 high is broken, a move that is still in progress should go for the $0.5500 level. Otherwise, we can see another push to the upside, supporting the current rise, if the price retraces toward the $0.4000 psychological level.<br /><br />The $0.3500 levels might serve as support in the event of prolonged falls. The only event that could give bears further momentum to attack the $0.3000 level is a breach below the MA 50 at $0.3450. Overall, Fantom is still trending upward, helped by solid fundamentals. Upon a retreat, a consolidation pattern could form before the continuation of an upside move.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto mixers or tumblers have recently become popular to increase privacy and security when using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Users may utilize crypto anonymously via crypto mixing services. But is it safe to use a crypto mixer for Bitcoin transactions? We&#8217;ll analyze crypto mixers&#8217; pros and cons in this article.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also see how to choose a reliable crypto mixer and what additional security measures are necessary when using one.</p>
<h2>Why Are Many People Interested in Crypto Mixers?</h2>
<p>Crypto mixers have become increasingly popular due to their privacy and security benefits. Crypto mixer services allow users to obscure the origin of their <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/investing-in-cryptocurrency-9-key-takeaways-for-efficient-investment/">cryptocurrency</a> funds by shuffling them through various other coins. This makes it virtually impossible to trace transactions back to their source.</p>
<p>Many see crypto mixers as a great way for individuals or businesses to remain anonymous when making transactions. Additionally, crypto mixers typically have legitimate business purposes.</p>
<p>Among these use cases, we can mention preventing large transactions from driving down the price of a coin. Splitting down a large transaction is harder to notice and may help protect the asset&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>Crypto mixer services can also provide a level of security that is unavailable through normal cryptocurrency exchanges. Most exchanges need users to register and verify their identity, which puts their personal data in danger.</p>
<p>Crypto mixers help protect users with a safe way to exchange funds without revealing personal data. Their appeal also comes from the fact that they are often cheaper and faster than traditional exchanges.</p>
<h2>How Do Crypto Mixers Work?</h2>
<p>A crypto mixer is a third-party service breaking the link between the sender and receiver of cryptocurrency funds. It takes incoming coins from users and mixes them with other coins in its pool.</p>
<p>At this point, the mixer sends them to the designated wallet address, making it difficult to trace the coins’ origin. Users can also select their fee (usually a small percentage of the total coins sent).</p>
<p>Delaying the transaction further helps protect the anonymity of the sender&#8217;s identity and adds another layer of security. Most crypto mixers also offer a variety of other features, such as multi-signature wallets and escrow services.</p>
<h2>What Are the Benefits of Using a Crypto Mixer?</h2>
<p>We have identified several legit advantages associated with using a crypto mixer. The most obvious benefit is the ability to break the sender-receiver connection, helping to protect your identity and anonymity.</p>
<p>Other benefits include providing enhanced security against tracking and analytics tools hackers use to identify addresses and wallets. The trick makes it harder for anyone to track cryptocurrency transactions on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Finally, mixing allows you to maximize the use of your funds without having to invest in additional hardware or software. This way, users can avoid paying large transaction fees associated with withdrawing from exchanges or splitting large transactions.</p>
<h2>Are There Any Potential Risks Associated With Crypto Mixers?</h2>
<p>There are several potential risks associated with using crypto mixers. These include money losses due to technological issues, personal identification, and crypto mixer scams.</p>
<p>Specifically, users should know that some mixers may not mix the coins and could send them to a single address. Moreover, there is always the risk of technical issues, such as delays in transaction times or malfunctions of the mixer.</p>
<p>Do your homework and choose reliable crypto-mixing services with a great track record and customer assistance to reduce these dangers. You may also spread your funds across multiple mixers, reducing the risk of scams and identification.</p>
<p>Finally, check the terms and conditions of each mixer, especially before using it for any large transactions.</p>
<h2>Is It Legal to Use Crypto Mixers?</h2>
<p>While crypto mixers are not illegal worldwide, their usage may find strong regulation in certain countries.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mixing is a grey area in jurisdictions like the U.S. and Canada, with a laissez-faire approach alternated with sanctions. However, it is officially illegal in countries such as <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/trading-cryptocurrency-not-allowed-bangladesh-3120246">Bangladesh</a>.</p>
<p>In other regions, including the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220324IPR26164/crypto-assets-new-rules-to-stop-illicit-flows-in-the-eu">European Union</a>, AML regulations require crypto transaction traceability, making using mixers legally complex.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that crypto mixers aim to anonymize transactions, which means criminals may misuse them for illicit activities. Therefore, many governments have regulated the use of crypto mixers to protect against money laundering and other illicit activities.</p>
<p>In general, people need only to use crypto mixers in jurisdictions where they are legal. These regulations are rapidly evolving, so it&#8217;s important to stay up-to-date on the latest developments.</p>
<h2>How Can You Choose a Reliable and Trustworthy Crypto Mixer?</h2>
<p>Choosing a reliable and trustworthy crypto mixer is crucial for anyone looking to protect their digital privacy. Before selecting a platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do your due diligence and research the services offered.</li>
<li>Read reviews from past customers.</li>
<li>Check the company&#8217;s website for contact information.</li>
</ul>
<p>With objectivity, we&#8217;ve looked into three popular Bitcoin mixers that you may choose to consider when studying the topic. These are Yo!Mix, Coinomize, and Blindmixer.</p>
<p>Yo!Mix is a Bitcoin mixer featuring TOR and NoJs options, allowing users to remain anonymous when transacting. Yo!Mix offers services such as support for all addresses (SegWit, Taproot, Legacy, and Bech32) and instant mixing where applicable. You may use it to transfer at most 0.001 BTC with a minimum commission of 0.7%.</p>
<p>Coinomize is a mixer cutting the link between a BTC wallet address and any transactions made with the same coins. It uses <a href="https://coinomize.biz/">advanced technology</a> to ensure the anonymity of users&#8217; transactions.</p>
<p>When transacting, Coinomize hides the user&#8217;s identity by mixing their coins with other users&#8217; coins, concealing the funds’ origin. Additionally, it monitors all its transactions to remove any traces back to the original wallet address if necessary.</p>
<p>Blindmixer is a popular Bitcoin mixer known for its strong focus on privacy and security. The platform uses an advanced system to mix coins before sending them back to their original wallet addresses.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers low fees (from 100 SAT) with instantaneous transactions. The platform can also work in collaboration with existing e-commerce platforms.</p>
<h2>Can You Track Transactions that Used a Crypto Mixing Strategy?</h2>
<p>In many cases, it is possible to track transactions that have employed a crypto-mixing strategy. However, these strategies&#8217; complexity and technology can make this process difficult.</p>
<p>In order to identify mixed transactions, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2022/02/22/exclusive-austrian-programmer-and-ex-crypto-ceo-likely-stole-11-billion-of-ether/?sh=452be57a7f58">investigators</a> need to use sophisticated analysis techniques such as blockchain forensics and network clustering. These techniques analyze numerous data points such as transaction histories, wallet addresses, and IP addresses.</p>
<p>Investigators may also need to collaborate with other entities in the cryptocurrency space. Think, for instance, of an investigator working with exchanges and service providers to gain access to additional data sets.</p>
<p>If someone used a mixing service for a transaction, investigators might be able to identify the transaction through their records.</p>
<p>However, the general idea is that this process is possible but extremely time-consuming. Time consumption equals more money spent and forces investigators to consider the balance between costs and effort.</p>
<h2>What Additional Security Measures Should You Take When Using a Crypto Mixer?</h2>
<p>There are additional security measures to take when using a crypto mixer to maximize the security of your funds.</p>
<p>First, creating a new wallet address for each transaction is important. This will help prevent someone from tracing your transactions. Additionally, you should consider using a VPN when accessing the mixer to keep your IP address hidden.</p>
<p>You should also take into account the reputation of the mixer service. It is important to research and choose a crypto mixer tested by other users with reliable expertise.</p>
<p>Finally, it is essential to use strong passwords when setting up your account with the mixer. Even better, you may privilege a zero-logging provider of crypto mixers so that your info is never stored anywhere.</p>
<p>No matter what measures you take, there is always a risk when using cryptocurrencies. However, by taking these extra security measures when using a crypto mixer, you can reduce all the risks mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Conclusions: Is Using a Crypto Mixer for Bitcoin Transactions Safe?</h3>
<p>Using a crypto mixer for Bitcoin transactions may be complex in some countries, given the lack of uniform regulations. Therefore, it is important to understand the legal implications and risks of using a crypto mixer before opting for one.</p>
<p>Moreover, taking additional security measures can help ensure your funds remain secure when using a crypto mixer. This includes researching, using a VPN and strong passwords, and creating a new wallet address for each transaction.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to you to decide if the benefits of mixing Bitcoin outweigh the risks. In any case, ensure you understand all the regulations surrounding crypto mixers in your country before making a decision.</p>
<p>Taking these precautions can help ensure that your funds remain secure when using a crypto mixer for Bitcoin transactions.</p>
