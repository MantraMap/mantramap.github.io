<h2>Ark Invest Report Highlights Strong Bitcoin Holders and &#x2018;Improved Institutional Sentiment&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Ark Invest, the investment firm that focuses on disruptive technologies, has published a <a href="https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Bitcoin-Monthly-June-2023.pdf">report</a> discussing <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin&#x2019;s (BTC)</a> recent momentum. The leading cryptocurrency has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-leaves-major-assets-in-the-dust-surges-80-in-the-first-half-of-2023-soars-to-12th-largest-global-asset/">outpaced</a> nearly every traditional asset during the first half of 2023, climbing more than 80% against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>In the report, Ark Invest highlights the recent increase in institutional interest following the Blackrock spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filing</a>. Ark&#x2019;s researchers further explain that &#x201C;the balance of bitcoin on [over-the-counter (OTC)] desks, a proxy for institutional activity, hit a one-year high.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-596548 size-full" title="Ark Invest Report Reveals 70% of Circulating Bitcoin Supply Remains Unmoved for a Year" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gs.jpg" alt="Ark Invest Report Reveals 70% of Circulating Bitcoin Supply Remains Unmoved for a Year" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gs-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gs-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gs-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gs-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gs-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gs-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gs.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The report suggests that Grayscale&#x2019;s GBTC rise in value indicates a potential shift in sentiment. Ark notes that the &#x201C;increased balances on OTC desks suggest that institutions and other large capital allocators are focused increasingly on bitcoin.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-596547 size-full" title="Ark Invest Report Reveals 70% of Circulating Bitcoin Supply Remains Unmoved for a Year" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lts.jpg" alt="Ark Invest Report Reveals 70% of Circulating Bitcoin Supply Remains Unmoved for a Year" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lts-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lts-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lts-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lts-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lts-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lts-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lts.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>While institutional interest appears strong, Ark&#x2019;s report also discusses how strong bitcoin holders have fortified the holder base. &#x201C;Of the 19.4 million bitcoin in circulation, nearly 70% has not moved in at least one year or more, confirming a strengthening holder base,&#x201D; Ark&#x2019;s researchers explain.</p>

<p>The bullish signs for bitcoin are occurring amidst a tightening cycle that is &#x201C;unprecedented in magnitude,&#x201D; according to Ark&#x2019;s report, which also touches on macroeconomic events. In the United States, Ark Invest&#x2019;s researchers believe that fiscal and monetary policies are conflicting, and there are warning signals indicating a potential recession.</p>
<p>For example, Ark&#x2019;s report says a contraction in new manufacturing orders suggests an impending recession. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainty, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has performed strongly, finding &#x201C;strong technical support at its 200-week moving average, closing the month 14% above it,&#x201D; as highlighted in Ark&#x2019;s report.</p>

While many crypto assets have seen an increase in worth over the past month, APE has endured a considerable 35% decrease against the U.S. dollar, as evidenced by 30-day market data.</strong></p>
<h2>Apecoin Value Takes a Dive as Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs Lose Ground</h2>
<p>Precisely 476 days ago, on March 17, 2022, the crypto asset APE was disseminated through an airdrop to Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and Bored Ape Kennel Club members. Throughout its existence, apecoin (APE) has exceeded a year; however, following its significant surge during its initial launch, APE&#x2019;s value has tumbled to significant lows.</p>

<p>APE hit it&#x2019;s all-time low 17 days ago when it reached <a href="https://archive.ph/aY7Fj">$1.96 per coin</a>, and since then, apecoin has declined more than 92% compared to its all-time high recorded on April 28, 2022. Over the last month, APE has forfeited 35.6% of its worth against the U.S. dollar. In the past year, the distribution of APE has become somewhat concentrated with the top ten wallets holding <a href="https://archive.ph/v8bG4#selection-8689.0-8689.6">22.61%</a> of the supply.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a substantial portion of that supply in the top ten &#x2013; or 163,074,506 APE &#x2013; is staking and represents the most significant asset on the rich list. Statistics from the APE rich list further reveal that the top 100 APE wallets possess 65.42% of the entire supply. Currently, there is a circulating supply of 368,593,750 APE and 125,228 unique addresses holding APE.</p>

<p>The decline in APE&#x2019;s price corresponds with the reduced floor value of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs, which has fallen from 61 ether to 30 ether since April 3, 2023. As of today, July 6, 2023, the BAYC floor value stands at approximately 30.27 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, according to nftpricefloor.com <a href="https://nftpricefloor.com/">data</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, MAYC NFTs have declined from 13 ether on April 3 to a current value of 6.24 ether. At the end of March 2023, 7,000 players engaged in Yuga Labs&#x2019; Otherside metaverse event &#x2018;Second Trip,&#x2019; linked to BAYC NFTs. The company also introduced the first season of HV-MTL Forge, a Web3 crafting game, last week.</p>

The company detailed that it has swiftly deployed 2,600 bitcoin miners at the location.</strong></p>
<h2>Mawson Secures Pennsylvania Site, Deploys 2,600 Bitcoin Miners for Self-Mining Operations</h2>
<p>Bitcoin mining companies are experiencing ongoing expansion in 2023. This week, Mawson Infrastructure Group (NASDAQ: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MIGI/">MIGI</a>) disclosed the acquisition of a new mining site in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Mawson has already initiated mining operations in Pennsylvania, having <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mawson-infrastructure-group-launches-bitcoin-mining-operation-in-pennsylvania-exits-australia/">announced</a> the commencement of construction at a new site in Sharon in February. On Thursday, Mawson revealed the signing of a new long-term lease agreement for the recent undertaking in Bellefonte.</p>
<p>At present, the Bellefonte facility is powered by 8 megawatts (MW) of electricity, with 2,600 miners already operational. The newly launched location will function as a fully self-mining facility, with a potential capacity of up to 24 MW. Mawson revealed that upon the completion of the expansion, the new data center will be able to accommodate 7,200 bitcoin mining machines.</p>
<p>“This facility is an ideal opportunity for Mawson to continue to efficiently ramp our self-mining operations to increase bitcoin production,” Mawson’s CEO and president Rahul Mewawalla stated on Thursday. “This new site furthers Mawson’s focus on growth in markets where the energy mix, secure grid, favorable climate, robust communities, and local talent continue to be key drivers of our continued expansion.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MIGI/">Shares of MIGI</a> rose 1.96% on Thursday; however, they have declined by 20% over the past month. The six-month price statistics indicate a decrease of more than 7%, while the stock has experienced a significant decline of 69% over the past 12 months. In 2023, Bitcoin&#8217;s hashrate reached new heights, thanks to the introduction of more efficient mining rigs, the launch of numerous next-generation miners by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-bolsters-hashrate-with-40-5m-purchase-of-12500-bitcoin-miners/">various firms</a>, and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terawulf-energizes-50-mw-at-nuclear-powered-bitcoin-mining-facility-nautilus/">expansion</a> of companies into new territories. In May, Mawson <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mawson-infrastructure-group-expands-to-new-bitcoin-mining-site-in-ohio-plans-to-boost-hashpower-by-1-eh-s/">announced</a> its expansion to Corning, Ohio, which added an additional 1 exahash per second (EH/s) to its mining fleet.</p>

The move came during a volatile market session, which saw crypto&#x2019;s global market cap remain largely unchanged. Solana was a notable exception however, racing to a one-month peak.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>)</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>) rallied back above $300.00 on Thursday, prior to the global crypto market moving to consolidate.</p>
<p>Following a low of $250.23 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>/USD jumped to an intraday peak at $300.85 earlier in the day&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of the rally, price moved to its strongest point since the start of the week, and closer to a recent 15-month high.</p>

<p>Earlier gains have now been erased, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> falling to a current reading at $279.71 as of writing.</p>
<p>One of the catalysts for this is the fact that the relative strength index (RSI) moved closer to a ceiling at 73.00, after bouncing from a floor at 70.00.</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at 71.69, and will likely consolidate around this area for the remainder of the day.</p>

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) moved past the $20.00 level earlier in the day, hitting a one-month high in the process.</p>
<p>SOL/USD surged to an intraday high at $20.32, which comes after falling to a bottom at $18.50 the day prior.</p>
<p>This rally has resulted in the world&#x2019;s ninth largest cryptocurrency hitting its highest level since June 6.</p>

<p>Since this earlier high, SOL has since slipped, with bulls unable to sustain a breakout of the $20.00 price point.</p>
<p>This was in part due to the RSI failing to breach its own resistance zone, which was around 61.00.</p>
<p>SOL&#x2019;s price strength is now sitting at 57.72, and appears to be heading for a lower floor near the 52.00 area.</p>

These licenses are a part of Twitter&#8217;s endeavor to secure money transmitter licenses in all 50 U.S. states. With these recent approvals, Twitter can now function as a payment provider within the three aforementioned states.</strong></p>
<h2>Twitter Secures Money Transmitter Licenses in Key States Amidst Meta’s Threads Launch Gathering 10 Million Users</h2>
<p>The social media platform owned by Tesla&#8217;s Elon Musk has received three state money transmitter licenses, as stated in an <a href="https://twitter.com/TitterDaily/status/1676680872878292995?s=20">announcement</a> on Wednesday. Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/TitterDaily/status/1676682276292411394?s=20">shared</a> that Twitter aims to launch a payments system by the end of the year, following approvals from both the United States and international markets. These approvals were granted by Michigan, New Hampshire, and Missouri, enabling Twitter to operate as a payment provider in those specific regions.</p>
<p>In essence, a state-approved money transmitter license grants official authorization to an entity or individual to legally participate in the money transmission or payment instrument business. Twitter has the potential to explore various concepts such as issuing prepaid cards and providing remittance services involving foreign currencies. This strategic move is in line with Musk&#8217;s vision for &#8220;X&#8221; or the &#8220;Everything App,&#8221; as he previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-hints-everything-app-x-is-coming-says-buying-twitter-accelerates-creation-of-x/">stated</a> in October that “Twitter is an accelerant to fulfilling the original X.com vision.”</p>
<p>The concept of the Everything App aims to become a comprehensive destination encompassing various functionalities such as social media, payments, news, messaging, and more, similar to China&#8217;s Wechat application. The state approvals for the money transmitter licenses arrive concurrently with Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-sparks-controversy-with-twitter-rate-limits-censorship-expert-says-musk-has-stepped-on-a-rattlesnake/">implementation of rate limits</a> on the platform. The recently imposed and controversial limits allow verified users to read up to 6,000 tweets per day, while unverified users are restricted to 600. Furthermore, new unverified users have a daily limit of 300 posts, and individuals who are not signed into Twitter are unable to access any tweets.</p>

<p>In addition, Meta&#8217;s Instagram has introduced a rival to Twitter known as Threads, and Mark Zuckerberg, Meta&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66112648">asserts</a> that 10 million users have already registered for the service. &#8220;It&#8217;ll take some time, but I think there should be a public conversations app with 1 billion+ people on it,” stated Zuckerberg this week. &#8220;Twitter has had the opportunity to do this but hasn&#8217;t nailed it. Hopefully, we will.&#8221; Meta has already secured Money Services Business (MSB) licenses in multiple U.S. states, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/facebook-obtains-money-transmitter-licenses-in-15-states/">commencing the process</a> back in 2012.</p>

The report on last month&#x2019;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that &#x201C;almost all participants&#x201D; are in favor of further hikes this year. Ethereum also rebounded following the minutes.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) climbed higher on Thursday, as traders continued to react to the latest FOMC minutes report.</p>
<p>The minutes revealed that &#x201C;Almost all participants noted that in their economic projections that they judged that additional increases in the target federal funds rate during 2023 would be appropriate.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to an intraday peak at $31,460.05, which comes following a low at $30,225.61 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>

<p>As a result of this high, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> rose to its strongest point since last June, when the price was trading above $32,000.</p>
<p>Bulls appear to be once again targeting this point, however will first need to break out of a ceiling at $31,500.</p>
<p>So far they have been unable to do this, pushing the price to a current level at $30,750.56.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) briefly rose in today&#x2019;s session, however has since slipped, as market momentum began to shift.</p>
<p>Following an earlier high at $1,956.01, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD has dropped to a bottom at $1,909.66 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The downturn came as traders once again failed to breach a key resistance level at the $1,960 mark.</p>

<p>This came as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to break a ceiling at the 61.00 level, earlier in the week.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 55.43, and seems to be heading for a floor at the 53.00 mark.</p>
<p>Should it reach this point, there is a good chance that the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will be trading below $1,890.</p>

Grewal&#x2019;s reasoning comes from the Supreme Court of the United States&#x2019; (SCOTUS) decision thwarting President Biden&#x2019;s student loan forgiveness program using the so-called &#x201C;major questions doctrine.&#x201D;</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Coinbase CLO Blasts SEC&#x2019;s &#x2018;Investment Contract&#x2019; Interpretation</h2>&#13;
<p>Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, has railed against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x2019;s (SEC) position regarding classifying some cryptocurrency assets as securities. According to Grewal, the SEC&#x2019;s assessment of what constitutes an investment contract is wrong and transgresses current regulations.</p>&#13;
<p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1676128236680495106?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The SEC&#x2019;s interpretation of &#x2018;investment contract&#x2019; violates the law.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Furthermore, Grewal affirms that the SEC&#x2019;s actions go beyond violating thew law, given that it claims it has the authority to enforce rules for all cryptocurrency assets classified as securities. He explained:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The &#x2018;economic and political significance&#x2019; of falsely claiming authority over all digital assets other than <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is not just &#x2018;staggering,&#x2019; but untethered to the fundamental requirement that there be enforceable rights between enterprise and purchaser.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Grewal&#x2019;s reasoning comes from his examination of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) ruling in the Biden v. Nebraska <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case</a>, where the court struck down the Biden administration&#x2019;s $430 billion student loan forgiveness program.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>The Major Questions Doctrine</h2>&#13;
<p>Grewal believes the reasoning for applying the major questions doctrine in the Biden v. Nebraska case can be used in Coinbase&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case</a>, where the exchange is battling the SEC, being accused of unregistered brokerage and securities violations.</p>&#13;
<p>According to Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman, the major questions doctrine <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/30/supreme-court-student-loan-ruling-shows-new-judicial-activism/935a32e6-1765-11ee-9de3-ba1fa29e9bec_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">idea</a> is that &#x201C;if the executive branch does something the court considers really big and really new, then the court will look to see if Congress really authorized it. Absent clear congressional authority, the court will strike it down.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>Coinbase <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-alleges-sec-lacks-any-powers-to-regulate-digital-asset-exchanges-in-recent-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the major questions doctrine in its recent filing against the SEC&#x2019;s complaint, arguing that the SEC&#x2019;s new interpretation of the securities law would have to be rejected because Congress would have to regulate the issue first to establish standards regarding digital assets.</p>&#13;
<p>Grewal added to this idea, <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1676129462008655877?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explaining</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>Congress isn&#x2019;t just capable of fixing standards by theoretically passing legislation in the future, it&#x2019;s actively working to do that right now. This isn&#x2019;t even a close call.</p>&#13;

It is one of the first debt Security Tokens aimed at retail investors who wish to invest alongside institutional investors in the most sought-after real estate developments in the United States. The Tokens will have a 5-year life, earn an annualized cash yield of 10%, and a 5-year IRR of 150%. RMCG has aligned with diversified developers like </span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Donahue_Peebles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donahue Peebles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the largest minority real estate developer in the United States, and </span><a href="https://www.rpcholdings.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Royal Palm Companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of Florida&#8217;s premier real estate development firms, to invest the net proceeds of the FraXion Security Token Offering (STO).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demetrius Ford, RMCG’s Managing Director of Digital Assets, stated that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a very exciting time for RMCG and FraXion, but an even more exciting time for retail real estate investors who have traditionally been locked out of institutional-grade real estate investment opportunities due to high minimum investments and other barriers to entry. FraXion is all about access. By pooling the investment capital of many, we can invest substantial sums as one, which grants our investors entry into the institutional world.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FraXion has already sold 250,000 tokens within the first weeks of the STO, and the company has also secured a funding round of $250,000 from Park Place Consultants to assist with the marketing and promotion of the FraXion Token. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are excited for the launch of the Fraxion Token and the opportunity it brings to the marketplace; a new way of Real Estate Investing. We are humbled and honored to be part of such an extraordinary team at Randolph &amp; Main, and these are the types of projects we look to support.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Rashidah &#8220;Roz&#8221; Billups, Principal at Park Place Consultants.</span></p>
<p><b>Tokenization of Real Estate</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FraXion Token is a game changer in the Fintech space. Tokenization of high-quality real estate, coupled with the cutting-edge technology of the blockchain, is attractive to investors that usually shy away from the crypto market. FraXion is a cutting-edge platform for investors to build generational wealth in Real Estate using Blockchain. FraXion creates “Digital Asset Partners” and allows token holders to invest in prime income-producing properties as well as land suitable for immediate commercial development through strategic alliances and partnerships with some of the most successful real estate developers in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FraXion Ecosystem provides fractionalization, liquidity and access to global investors. The FraXion Token is an application blockchain asset that is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Ownership of a blockchain asset is established by recording on the blockchain ledger the owner’s unique identifier address and the amount of the asset held by such an address.</span></p>
<p><b>More About FraXion</b></p>

According to the Namibian Finance Minister, safeguarding the interests of consumers and combating market abuse are some of the reasons why parliament has taken this step.</strong></p>
<h2>Mitigating Money Laundering Risks</h2>
<p>The Namibian parliament is reported to have passed a bill aiming to legalize cryptocurrencies and establish a framework for regulating these types of assets. According to the country’s Finance Minister, Iipumbu Shiimi, the law is expected to help authorities safeguard the interests of consumers and to combat market abuse.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://namibian.com.na/parliament-approves-law-to-regulate-cryptocurrency/">remarks</a> published by The Namibian, Shiimi also suggested that the law will enable authorities to deal with money laundering risks associated with digital assets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim of the legislation was to create a regulatory framework to protect consumers, and the risk of money laundering is mitigated,&#8221; the Minister reportedly said.</p>
<p>The legislative body’s move to regulate digital assets seemingly contradicts the Bank of Namibia (BON)’s which declared in the second half of 2022 that cryptocurrencies had no legal tender status in the country. The Namibian central bank however <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/namibian-central-bank-virtual-assets-remain-without-legal-tender-status-but-merchants-can-still-accept-them-as-payment/">said</a> it would not stand in the way of merchants and traders who accepted crypto assets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Namibian parliament’s passage of the bill has been lauded as a step in the right direction. However, some Namibian experts like Jesaya Hano-Oshike warned the enactment of the law should not result in unnecessary obstacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legislation should not stifle innovation in the space, but rather encourage and foster innovation when it is done in the scope of the legislation,&#8221; Hano-Oshike.</p>
<p>Financial analyst Arney Tjaronda welcomed the passage of the bill but said authorities must not ignore digital assets’ likely impact on the country’s financial system.</p>

Crypto exchanges that fail to abide by the requirement will either be fined or closed down, Unathi Kamlana, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority commissioner, said. </strong></p>
<h2>The Importance of Regulation</h2>
<p>The South African financial services regulator, Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), has said cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country must secure operating licenses before the end of the year. According to Unathi Kamlana, the FSCA commissioner, entities that fail to abide by this requirement will either be fined or closed down.</p>
<p>The latest crypto-related comments by Kamlana just a few months after a fintech analyst with the South African Reserve Bank <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-regulations-governing-tokenized-deposits-and-crypto-assets-in-south-africa-set-to-effect-in-january-2025/">revealed</a> that regulations governing tokenized deposits and crypto assets will become effective on Jan. 1, 2025. However, the analyst warned that regulators will still need to learn and understand the risks that come with the technology which underpins digital assets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his remarks during an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-04/south-africa-to-require-crypto-exchanges-licensing-by-year-end">interview</a>, Kamlana explained why the regulator has finally taken this step. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is potentially serious harm to financial customers when using crypto products, and therefore it makes sense for us to introduce the regulatory framework.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FSCA commissioner, however, acknowledged that the effectiveness of this and related measures will only be determined after a certain period of time. According to the Bloomberg report, the FSCA has already received 20 applications and more will be received before the Nov. 30 deadline.</p>
<p>In addition to seeking to regulate the crypto industry, Kamlana also revealed his organization’s involvement in efforts aimed at raising the public’s awareness of crypto products. He also offered his thoughts on why the public needs crypto education.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an area where you can lose quite a bit of money, so you must think twice before exposing yourself to it,&#8221; Kamlana reportedly said.</p>
