Decentralized Exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap (CAKE), has announced the launch of PancakeSwap v3 on zkSync Era, a Layer 2 scaling solution that promises to deliver improved scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness to its users. According to the announcement, with the popularity of ZK rollups increasing and users and builders increasingly looking to L2 solutions, PancakeSwap is thrilled to offer users and developers even more reasons to build and trade on its DEX. The Benefits Of PancakeSwap v3&#8217;s Swap Feature On zkSync Era PancakeSwap v3 on zkSync Era comes with several exciting features, including Swap, Liquidity Provision (LP), Farms, and Initial Farm Offering (IFO).  The Swap feature allows users to enjoy quick and cost-effective token swaps through a user-friendly interface.

Moreover, the Liquidity Provision feature lets users become part of PancakeSwap&#8217;s thriving decentralized exchange ecosystem by providing liquidity. Liquidity providers earn passive income through trading fees when people use their liquidity pool to complete swaps.  Per the announcement, with the scalability of zkSync Era, users can maximize their returns, achieving an impressive capital multiplier of up to 4000x. Users can engage in Swap, LP, and social media tasks to earn loyalty points and unlock exclusive NFTs. The Galxe campaign provides an opportunity to explore and experience the power of PancakeSwap on this ecosystem, unlocking the full potential of the platform. Ultimately, the integration with zkSync Era allows PancakeSwap to increase its transaction capacity and reduce congestion on the Ethereum network. As the popularity of DeFi continues to grow, the Ethereum network has become congested, leading to high gas fees and slower transaction times.  By leveraging Layer 2 scaling solutions like zkSync, PancakeSwap can significantly increase its transaction capacity, reduce congestion, and offer users a more reliable and cost-effective trading experience. What’s more, the integration with zkSync Era is expected to pave the way for the mass adoption of DeFi. By offering users faster and cheaper transactions, PancakeSwap can attract more users to the platform, increasing the adoption of DeFi as a whole.  PancakeSwap&#8217;s Revenue Hit By Market Conditions PancakeSwap has experienced some fluctuations in its market performance recently.
