<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Filecoin Foundation has refuted the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) assertion that its FIL token is a security.</em></li>



<li><em>The company has described them as &#8220;a decentralized, peer-to-peer network for storing files&#8221; and unequivocally states that FIL is not secure.</em></li>



<li><em>Earlier, Filecoin Trust registrar, Grayscale also disagreed with the decision of the SEC staff.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/filecoin-foundation-rejects-secs-classification-of-fil-as-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoSlate</a>, the Filecoin Foundation has refuted the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) assertion that its FIL tokens are securities in a statement.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-914.png"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-914.png" alt="Filecoin Foundation Objects To SEC Classifying FIL As A Security" class="wp-image-188525" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-914.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-914-300x180.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-914-768x461.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-914-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Filecoin Foundation Objects To SEC Classifying FIL As A Security 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The Filecoin Foundation describes its blockchain network as a &#8220;decentralized peer-to-peer network for storing files&#8221; and emphasizes that FIL is not a security.</p>



<p>&#8220;Over the last decade, thousands of people worldwide have contributed to this open-source project to create a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity&#8217;s most important information. That includes hundreds of organizations and teams building on the network, thousands of storage providers, and 13,000 Github contributors, building a foundational layer for the next generation of the web.&#8221; The Foundation said.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Grayscale revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked it to withdraw its application to launch a Filecoin trust product (FIL). Grayscale said in a statement that it received comments from the SEC stating that the FIL &#8220;meets the definition of a security.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the organization <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188212-us-sec-deems-filecoin-a-security-grayscale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disagrees</a> with the opinion of the SEC staff and does not believe that the FIL is a security under federal securities laws. Grayscale intends to respond promptly to SEC staff to explain the legal basis of the company&#8217;s position.</p>

<p>Grayscale cannot predict whether or not SEC staff will be convinced that their position is correct, and if not. Suppose the SEC employee disagrees with Grayscale&#8217;s position. In that case, Grayscale may need to seek alternative arrangements allowing the Trust to register under the Investment Companies Act of 1940 or consider dissolution.</p>



<p>Since receiving the negative news, the FIL token has continuously recorded a bearish sign. Currently, FIL is trading at $4.43, down 5% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Meta executives have announced that a new round of mass layoffs will begin next week.</em></li>



<li><em>In March of this year, Zuckerberg said that the company planned to cut 10,000 jobs by the end of May, and the company cut 4,000 jobs last month.</em></li>



<li><em>The layoffs due to massive hiring during the boom period are still happening to cut costs even though the loss-making Metaverse division is still focused on growth.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The layoffs will affect Meta&#8217;s business units, potentially affecting thousands of employees. Although the company&#8217;s executives did not confirm the specific size of the layoffs, Zuckerberg said in March of this year that the company planned to cut 10,000 jobs by the end of May and it had cut 4,000 jobs last month.</p>



<p>The afternoon before layoffs occur, the head of human resources at Meta will post a note to employees with details on when the layoff process begins and which teams will be affected. Affected employees will then be notified, followed by unaffected employees. The company will require all employees &#8220;whose work allows&#8221; to work from home.</p>



<p>Downsizing is one of the clearest examples of how big tech companies are due to over-hiring during the pandemic combined with massive changes in the tech industry at large. It is tightening its belts after nearly two decades of relentless growth.</p>



<p>Metaverse, a technology once famous when CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisioned a future where billions of people would live, work and play in the digital world, has almost &#8220;died&#8221; after being abandoned by the business world.</p>

<p>In October 2021, Facebook changed its name to Meta and turned to building virtual universes. After a well-known debut, the metaverse immediately became a craze for Wall Street investors. However, the hype couldn&#8217;t save the lack of a consistent vision for the final product that led to the demise of the virtual world universe.</p>



<p>In the context that the technology world is moving to a new and more potential trend like AI, the fate of the metaverse is already predetermined.</p>



<p>Recent comments by Mark Zuckerberg and company&#8217;s management show that the company focuses on AI (artificial intelligence) and no longer prioritizes the metaverse. Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Andrew Bosworth said the company focuses most of its time on AI. Facebook&#8217;s parent company plans to launch an AI ad-generating tool later this year.</p>



<p>However, on April 26, Mark Zuckerberg denied &#8220;abandoning&#8221; the metaverse to focus on developing AI. He said Meta has been developing both areas for many years now and will continue to focus on both.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s virtual reality projects division reported an operating <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184215-meta-loss-3-9b-after-pumping-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loss of $3.9 billion</a> for the first quarter of 2023. This is slightly lower than its $4.3 billion loss in the previous quarter.</p>

<li><em>Lightning Ventures, Hivemind Ventures, Ride Wave Ventures, Aleka Capital, Visary Capital, Gaingels, David Van Der Weele, and Sunil Rajaraman participated in the round, which was chaired by Jack Dorsey.</em></li>

<p>Lightning Ventures, Hivemind Ventures, Ride Wave Ventures, Aleka Capital, Visary Capital, Gaingels, David Van Der Weele, and Sunil Rajaraman also invested in the round.</p>

<p>The initial money will assist Azteco in its objective to create a solution that promotes financial inclusion and long-term stability to billions of individuals who confront untrustworthy or fluctuating economic situations. The funds will be used to develop new products and grow into the European and South American markets.</p>



<p>Consumers in cash-centric communities may access the asset by buying vouchers, and the firm is paid a fee for each transaction. Additionally, many users are unfamiliar with the complexity of crypto exchanges and Web3 wallets. For them, vouchers are significantly more accessible, familiar, and easy.</p>



<p>Azteco co-founder Paul Ferguson stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;This funding will fuel our market activation and product refinement efforts, enabling us to reach consumers more effectively, to develop deeply intuitive products and empower individuals worldwide to participate in global commerce regardless of their financial or technical experience level.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Azteco, founded in 2014 by Paul Ferguson, is a supplier of a voucher system that enables customers to store, spend, and distribute small amounts of Bitcoin via a worldwide network based on trust and local relationships.</p>



<p>The solution was developed in response to the discovery that over 2 billion individuals globally own smartphones but lack access to conventional banking services. For these individuals, bitcoin offers a low-cost, safe, and flexible alternative to conventional banking that eliminates payer fraud and enables the unbanked population to hold money, make transactions, and obtain credit without the need for a typical bank account.</p>



<p>Azteco Vouchers, which are equivalent to the traditional paper coupons provided by mobile phone networks, may be purchased by users. These are redeemable directly on users&#8217; mobile phones, similar to how top-up coupons function to add call time to Pay-as-You-Go mobile phones.</p>



<p>Azteco intends to expand beyond the vouchers. In the next months, the business intends to streamline the process of purchasing Bitcoin online by eliminating the need for customers to register accounts or go through a lengthy Verification procedure. The present deal values the firm at $84 million pre-money. For a firm that is just a year old, this demonstrates that investors are confident in Azteco&#8217;s growth potential.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Nevin Shetty, a former CFO for a Seattle company, was charged with wire fraud in the United States District Court in Seattle.</em></li>



<li><em>Shetty is accused of diverting nearly $35 million from the startup&#8217;s coffers to a cryptocurrency network under his own control, according to the indictment.</em></li>



<li><em>Shetty faces a potential sentence of 20 years in jail if convicted of wire fraud.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a federal indictment <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/former-company-chief-financial-officer-indicted-using-35-million-company-cash-invest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handed</a> by a grand jury on Wednesday, the former chief financial officer of a Seattle-based firm stole $35 million of his employer&#8217;s money without authorization and lost it by trading in bitcoin before the crypto market fell last year.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-905.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="720" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-905.png" alt="Former CFO Of Seattle Uses $35 Million To Invest In Crypto Leading To Losses" class="wp-image-188493" title="Former CFO Of Seattle Uses $35 Million To Invest In Crypto Leading To Losses 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>Nevin Shetty, 39, was appointed as CFO of fabric, a company that creates software systems for retail commerce, in March 2021.</p>



<p>Once the employer told him that he was being let go due to work performance issues, he discreetly stole the money and moved it to HighTower Treasury, a crypto platform he operated as a side business, according to the indictment.</p>



<p>Shetty reportedly moved a considerable sum of $35,000,100 from his employers to an account related to HighTower without the knowledge of any other employees inside the organization between April 1 and April 12, 2022.</p>



<p>The purported goal of this transaction was for HighTower to deploy the cash to investments in the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.</p>



<p>His plan was to pay the firm 6% interest while keeping any earnings beyond that, but the $35 million investment quickly became nearly worthless, according to a press release by the US Attorney&#8217;s Office in Seattle.</p>



<p>When the startup discovered the embezzlement, it immediately reported it to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which launched an inquiry into the case. Shetty faces a potential sentence of 20 years in jail if convicted of wire fraud. He is scheduled to appear in court on May 25, 2023.</p>



<p>Prosecutors said that as the firm obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in startup investment, it developed a cautious approach to handling that money – a strategy that Shetty assisted in developing.</p>

<p>The developers behind the wallet have been working tirelessly to deliver a more user-friendly and efficient experience for Bitcoin users, and this release is a major milestone in their journey.</p>



<p>One of the most notable features of the new release is the integration with MoonPay, which allows users to purchase BTC directly from the wallet. This feature is particularly useful for those who are new to the world of Bitcoin and may not have a lot of experience with buying and selling cryptocurrencies. With the integration of MoonPay, users can now buy BTC with just a few clicks, making it easier than ever before to get started with Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Another important change in this version of the wallet is the disabling of RBF (Replace-by-Fee), which will prevent accidental wrong spending. RBF is a feature that allows users to replace an unconfirmed transaction with a new one that has a higher fee. However, this feature can sometimes lead to confusion, especially for users who are new to Bitcoin. By disabling RBF, the UniSat team has made it easier for users to avoid making accidental mistakes with their transactions.</p>

<p>The updated wallet also now displays the output value of the inscription by default, which makes it easier to keep track of your transactions. This feature is particularly useful for users who want to monitor their spending and keep accurate records of their transactions. Additionally, users can now view their transaction history via mempool.space, which provides valuable insights into their spending patterns.</p>



<p>Overall, the Bitcoin Inscription <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186702-unisat-removed-the-access-points/">UniSat Wallet</a> v1.1.20 release is a major milestone for the UniSat team. With these new features and improvements, the wallet is now more user-friendly than ever before, making it an ideal choice for anyone looking to get started with Bitcoin or to streamline their transactions. Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned crypto investor or just starting out, the UniSat wallet is worth checking out.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Republicans and Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee disagree on how to regulate stablecoins.</em></li>



<li><em>Both factions are proposing opposing drafts of a new law to regulate stablecoins.</em></li>



<li><em>Democrats opposed giving governments a strong role in monitoring stablecoin issuers and instead advocated for greater digital wallet security.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Despite tones of promise from both sides at a Thursday <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=408790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hearing</a> of the House Financial Services Committee&#8217;s digital assets subcommittee, US lawmakers are unable to bridge the divide between Republicans and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187070-house-democrats-stablecoin-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Democrats</a> with very different ideas for supervising stablecoins.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-903.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-903-1024x682.png" alt="Stablecoins Still Controversial Between Republicans and Democrats" class="wp-image-188486" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-903-1024x682.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-903-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-903-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-903-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-903-1140x760.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-903.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Stablecoins Still Controversial Between Republicans and Democrats 25"></a></figure></div>


<p>One of the key differences is a bigger role for state regulators in a version of proposed legislation championed by Rep. French Hill, the subcommittee&#8217;s chairman, and a lead role for the Federal Reserve in the Democratic plan championed by <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151496-waters-disappointed-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rep. Maxine Waters</a>, the committee&#8217;s senior Democrat.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, Hill began the meeting by referring to Waters&#8217; prior comment that the legislators were beginning from scratch this year after coming near to a compromise version last year.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Although this is only the second stablecoin hearing for this Subcommittee, Member-level conversations have been going on since 2021, and the Committee has worked significantly with our members on both sides of the aisle and with the President’s Working Group report on stablecoins,&#8221; he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Waters retorted that the Republican wording lacks numerous crucial positions, as did Rep. Stephen Lynch, the ranking Democrat on the crypto-focused subcommittee.</p>



<p>Rep. French Hill also <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thinks</a> that using the proper legislative framework would help stablecoins become a payment system:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“To echo the Under Secretary and the title of today’s hearing, we want for payment stablecoins to be used as a payment mechanism, which they’re really not today. And the only way we can do that is by passing the appropriate regulatory framework legislation.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Both Republicans and Democrats in the House agree on shared goals, including addressing consumer concerns and maintaining the US dollar&#8217;s position in global trade, which might be supported by dollar-denominated stablecoins regulated in the US.</p>



<p>Assume there is a silver lining for a crypto company anxious about U.S. regulations. In that scenario, this and other committees are demonstrating that the stablecoin issue is substantial enough to merit many congressional hearings in recent weeks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-902-1024x768.png" alt="image 902" class="wp-image-188485" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-902-1024x768.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-902-300x225.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-902-768x576.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-902-750x563.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-902.png 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Stablecoins Still Controversial Between Republicans and Democrats 26"><figcaption>Stablecoins Still Controversial Between Republicans and Democrats 27</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stablecoins, such as Tether&#8217;s USDT and Circle&#8217;s USDC, are pegged to the value of stable assets such as the US dollar and have proven to be an important component of crypto marketplaces.</p>



<p>Most House and Senate members seem to favor action, and if they can reach an agreement on a stablecoin solution, it will be a significant first step toward U.S. control of the business.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Without action from Congress, however, offshore and opaque projects will continue to thrive and stablecoin issuers will not feel confident to seek opportunities in the United States, and to echo the hearing title, stablecoins will not be stable,&#8221; Hill said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nevertheless, neither the Senate Banking Committee nor its chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown, has shown an interest in pursuing a stablecoin bill.</p>

<p>Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, is launching Coinbase One, a subscription service, in 35 countries/regions to retain users and increase recurring revenue streams while the crypto sector struggles through the bear market. Coinbase One debuted in beta in the fall of 2021 and is now available for purchase in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Ireland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next months, the business plans to expand the service to 31 other European countries. There are no transaction fees, increased staking incentives, 24/7 customer assistance, and pre-filed tax returns among the numerous perks of the subscription service.</p>



<p>Historically, trading fees accounted for a large portion of Coinbase&#8217;s revenue, particularly during the bull market, but as the crypto winter continues, the company is looking to new methods to generate development and diversify its revenue sources.</p>

<p>According to Coinbase&#8217;s senior director of product management, the company wants to create a longer, deeper relationship with its clients and make it a win-win situation. There was a lot of growth during the bull market 18 months to two years ago, and they wanted clients to stay.</p>



<p>That method appears to be working for the time being. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188452-coinbase-cloud-chainlink-node-operator/">Coinbase</a>&#8216;s subscription and services revenue increased 138% year on year to $361.7 million in the first quarter of 2023, from $152 million the previous year. According to the company&#8217;s Q4 2022 shareholder letter, subscription and services revenues increased more than 17 times to $793 million in 2022 from less than $50 million in 2020.</p>

<p>The fundraising was spearheaded by investment company 1kx and includes investments from Maven11, Lattice Fund, CMT Digital, and Daedalus Angels.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thrilled to have you guys on the cap table and on this journey with us! <a href="https://t.co/vmi0LiCUXh" target="_blank">https://t.co/vmi0LiCUXh</a></p>&mdash; LAGRANGE <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b55.png" alt="⭕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@lagrangedev) <a href="https://twitter.com/lagrangedev/status/1659214389608689664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 18, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The company intends to address the long-standing problem of blockchain interoperability by allowing developers to create decentralized apps (dApps) that may access several blockchains at the same time. Transferring information across many chains necessitates the use of an intermediate protocol, which might be vulnerable to hackers and flaws.</p>



<p>Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh, the founder of Lagrange, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;These intermediaries also tend to be limited in the information they can pass on. Modern DeFi applications require more sophisticated relationships between data on different blockchains, and we’re excited to see how our technology can unlock new multi-chain DeFi primitives.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zero-knowledge-proof technology is gradually being acknowledged as a successful method for addressing the Ethereum ecosystem&#8217;s scalability concerns.</p>



<p>Lagrange Labs, on the other hand, is using this technology to solve the serious issue of interoperability.</p>



<p>Cross-chain communication formerly needed a bridge or middleman to transfer information, potentially exposing blockchains to security risks; now, Lagrange enables blockchains to avoid the necessity for intermediaries. This will give real-time and historical data to dApps across many Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks.</p>



<p>Lagrange Labs will use the funds to accelerate research into their zero-knowledge proof method, which might have applications ranging from DeFi to decentralized identification, cross-chain GameFi, and cross-chain governance.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Borderless Capital is the manager of a new $50 million fund that will help projects create cross-chain modifications.</em></li>



<li><em>To create the fund, over twenty blockchain teams and venture funders have collaborated.</em></li>



<li><em>Companies that have invested in fundraising will be able to interact easily and will use Wormhole as their cross-chain solution.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a press release, crypto-giant venture firm Borderless Capital is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230518005218/en/Leading-Crypto-Teams-and-Institutional-Investors-Team-Up-to-Launch-a-50M-Cross-Chain-Ecosystem-Fund-Powered-by-Wormhole" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching</a> a new $50 million fund to help companies develop cross-chain modifications.</strong></h5>

<p>Aptos Labs, Algorand Foundation, Solana Foundation, Sei Foundation, CLabs (the firm behind the Celo Blockchain), the Moonbeam Foundation, and Optimism are among the leading layer 1 blockchain businesses sponsoring the fund.</p>



<p>Jump Crypto, Arrington Capital, GSR, Floating Point Group, Chainlayer, Chainode Tech, 01Node, Staking Fund, Moonlet.io, Forbole Ventures, Syncnode, Inotel, Triton One, and Strangelove are among the web3 venture funds interested.</p>



<p>A $50 million cross-chain ecosystem fund has been launched by a group of twenty web3 firms and venture funds. The fund will be used to help companies that utilize the Wormhole cross-chain bridging mechanism.</p>



<p>Borderless Capital&#8217;s CEO and Managing Partner, David Garcia, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230518005218/en/Leading-Crypto-Teams-and-Institutional-Investors-Team-Up-to-Launch-a-50M-Cross-Chain-Ecosystem-Fund-Powered-by-Wormhole" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Our goal is to empower builders to transcend the limitations of individual ecosystems, paving the way for blockchain applications and protocols to realize their full potential.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The profusion of layer-1 blockchains, layer-2 scaling solutions, and customized appchains with particular objectives and characteristics make navigating the Web3 ecosystem more difficult. This complexity causes problems for consumers and alienates developers who are unable to access a single ecosystem, stifling their development.</p>



<p>The Cross-Chain Ecosystem Fund aims to unleash the full potential of a cross-chain future by reinventing user experiences and establishing Wormhole as the cross-chain standard for builders seeking to transcend the restrictions of specific ecosystems. Aggregation, security, scalability, compatibility, and composability are the top priorities for this invention.</p>



<p>The fund&#8217;s major goal, according to Garcia, is to offer builders an environment that assists them in overcoming the inadequacies of creating individual ecosystems.</p>
