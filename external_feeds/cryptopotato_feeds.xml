			            <description><![CDATA[Midas Investments suspended services on its platform following the Celsius and FTX crashes.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency platform Midas Investments disabled deposits and swaps due to severe financial losses caused by Celsius&#8217; bankruptcy and FTX&#8217;s fiasco.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CEO Iakov Levin said the organization will aim to focus on a new project next year that will be &#8220;fully transparent&#8221; and will offer an &#8220;improved investment experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another Victim</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent <a href="https://blog.midas.investments/midas-closure-reasons-and-pivot-to-cedefi/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Midas Investments&#8217; Founder and CEO said the company shut down services on its platform yesterday (December 27). It disabled customer withdrawals for a few hours to conduct necessary calculations and later allowed users to withdraw their remaining funds with adjusted deductions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Levin revealed that the entity&#8217;s initial goal was to deduct 48% from clients&#8217; balances but later changed the figure to 55%:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We will adjust user balances by balancing remaining liabilities in BTC, ETH, and stablecoins with remaining assets, deducting 55% and rewards earned.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Balances in other digital currencies, including BNB, AVAX, and FTM, will not be impacted. The company will also distribute MIDAS tokens as compensation to affected customers based on their deducted amount.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Levin believes retail and institutional clients will significantly increase their interest in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in the next five years. As such, Midas Investments intends to roll out &#8220;scalable, on-chain, verifiable, tokenized CeDeFi strategies&#8221; for both CeFi and DeFi users. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company also aims to introduce a new project &#8220;built on principles of full transparency&#8221; that will have its own native token. The firm will eventually stop providing liquidity for the MIDAS token and swap it for the new asset.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The CEO apologized to all customers harmed by the platform&#8217;s closure. He raised hopes that the planned amendments will be the best solution to the current problems:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;This is not the end, but rather the beginning of something new. I understand the difficult decision to close Midas and apologize to anyone who lost money. I will do my best to make sure you can recoup your losses in the new project.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What Caused the Issue?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Levin said the company lost around $50 million (20% of $250 million AUM) this spring, and users withdrew a large chunk of their holdings after the collapse of the former crypto giants </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/cel-dumped-50-after-celsius-filed-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Celsius</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. Midas Investments sought fundraising and other options to cope with the crisis but none of those managed to cease the downturn:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Despite these efforts, the extensive withdrawals due to the insolvency of Celcius and FTX, coupled with reduced yield opportunities on the market, made it impossible for us to cover daily payouts to users due to the assets deficit.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Manchester United launched an NFT collection in Tezos that sold out faster than expected. But the style is much like that of another major Tezos NFT artist.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On December 28, NFT artist Lucréce reported via Twitter that he is in talks with Arthur Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, to get an explanation from Manchester United soccer about why its new NFT collection uses designs and styles similar to his own.</p>
<p>Lucréce&#8217;s collection is much older than United&#8217;s and has higher prices, reaching approximately 21 ETH ($24,919) per NFT. In contrast, each of the Red Devils&#8217; 7,777 NFTs sold for about $40, running out of stock immediately after release.</p>
<figure id="attachment_230759" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230759" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-44.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-large wp-image-230759" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-44-1024x591.png" alt="Lucréce's NFT collection, Source: OpenSea" width="1024" height="591" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-44-1024x591.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-44-300x173.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-44-768x443.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-44-50x29.png 50w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-44.png 1321w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230759" class="wp-caption-text">Lucréce&#8217;s NFT collection, Source: OpenSea</figcaption></figure>
<p>Lucréce hopes to strike a deal with the Red Devils. that will benefit both parties, as the resemblance of their artwork is so uncanny that some community users wondered if the artist worked on creating the Manchester United project.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’m not saying <a href="https://twitter.com/ManUtd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@ManUtd</a> was inspired by my work, but I’m not saying Manchester United wasn’t inspired by my work. <a href="https://t.co/q09Y6uouxF" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/q09Y6uouxF</a></p>
<p>— Lucréce (@DesLucrece) <a href="https://twitter.com/DesLucrece/status/1606262513275875328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">December 23, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Although the artist was careful not to directly accuse Manchester United of plagiarizing his works, he showed an image on Twitter comparing the two artworks so readers could draw their own conclusions.</p>
<h2>Is Manchester United Copying Lucréce&#8217;s NFT Artwork?</h2>
<p>User <a href="https://twitter.com/ClownVamp/status/1607885042696740864" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">ClownVamp</a>, posted a series of Tweets comparing both NFTs, noting that Lucréce&#8217;s was &#8220;one of Tezos&#8217; most popular and oldest collections.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_230760" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230760" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-45.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-large wp-image-230760" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-45-1024x415.png" alt="The Manchester United NFT Collection" width="1024" height="415" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-45-1024x415.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-45-300x122.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-45-768x311.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-45-50x20.png 50w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-45.png 1537w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230760" class="wp-caption-text">The Manchester United NFT Collection</figcaption></figure>
<p>The terms and conditions of the United collection state that the NFTs were created by TRILITECH PLATFORM OÜ, &#8220;the for-profit arm of the Tezos foundation.&#8221; They are therefore authorized by the Tezos Foundation to mint and sell the digital collection of the English football team.</p>
<p>The Devils collection <a href="https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/man-utd-launches-second-digital-collectible-drop-the-devils" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">launched</a> by Manchester United is the team&#8217;s second digital collectible drop. Each token has a unique set of features and gives its owner rights to exclusive airdrops, special AMAs, private competitions, and other &#8220;surprises.&#8221; This would be the next step in a broader <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/manchester-united-unveils-a-training-kit-sponsorship-with-tezos/" data-wpel-link="internal">partnership</a> between the team and Tezos.</p>
<h2>Lucréce Gets Answers from Manchester United</h2>
<p>Later today, Lucréce reported through his networks that thanks to the support of the community and Tezos, he got a response from Manchester United with a view to reaching an agreement, stating that the club had not contacted him due to the holidays.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Update: correspondence between me and ManU has started. Had a productive call with them just now. Probably the last update on this for a while since everyone is still on holiday.</p>
<p>In times of adversity, you’ll know who your friends are. Thank you, tezos community. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f91d.png" alt="🤝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>— Lucréce (@DesLucrece) <a href="https://twitter.com/DesLucrece/status/1608222668234395648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">December 28, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Many of his followers expressed their joy for the club&#8217;s response, applauding how the artist politely handled the case — which is not the usual way people deal with controversies on Twitter.</p>
<p>As part of his demands, Lucréce asked for dinner with Cristiano Ronaldo. This was a joke, of course, but the artist later wrote that the topic &#8220;was not brought up. Almost as if it was avoided.&#8221; How will the matter turn out? Will he receive monetary compensation, or will he have his dream dinner with the world-famous CR7?</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Binance plans to reduce LUNC trading fees from 100% to 50%. LUNC reacted negatively, shredding 12% on the day. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance has <span class="s1">announced</span> that it is changing the burning mechanism for <span class="s1">Terra Classic (LUNC) trading fees</span>.</p>
<p class="p2">According to the exchange, the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-to-make-changes-to-the-burning-of-terra-classic-lunc-trading-fees-4769eab576c4479eaa14adc1eb587226" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">changes</a> are in response to two controversial proposals &#8211; Proposal 10983 and 11111 &#8211; where <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/lunc-spikes-36-following-binances-burning-announcement/" data-wpel-link="internal">LUNC burn</a> is being re-minted as a development fund.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Binance Makes Changes to LUNC Burn Mechanism</b></h2>
<p class="p2">As part of the changes, Binance said it would reduce its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/terra-2-0-is-live-here-are-the-exchanges-to-support-the-luna-airdrop/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">LUNC</span></a> spot and margin trading fees from 100% to 50% starting December 28, 2022.</p>
<p class="p2">The exchange added that it would delay sending LUNC trading fee burn contributions to burn addresses until March 1, 2023. This will ensure that the trading fees are not re-minted until the LUNC community meets certain requests from Binance.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>What are Binance Requests?</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The crypto exchange said it had been in discussions with the leadership team from the Terra Grants Foundation concerning the requests.</p>
<p class="p2">Binance has asked the foundation to create a new burn wallet, saying it would send LUNC spot and margin trading fees to the new one, which does not allow re-minting of the burn amount.</p>
<p class="p2">The trading platform also asked the foundation to whitelist its wallets &#8220;so that the transaction tax is not applied when transferring between these wallets.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p2">Binance said if the community fails to meet these requests, it will end the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-signals-support-for-new-0-2-lunc-tax-burn/" data-wpel-link="internal">LUNC Burn mechanism</a> on its platform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2">&#8220;Binance will continue to work with the community to support the implementation of this new plan, and if for any reason this can&#8217;t be done, Binance will consider withdrawing the burn contribution going forward,&#8221; the exchange added.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>LUNC Drops 12%</h2>
<p class="p2">Following the announcement, the price of LUNC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/altcoins-bleeding-out-solana-and-lunc-crash-by-double-digits-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">dropped</a> sharply by more than 12% on the day, despite being one of the best performers over the past few days. At the time of writing, the coin was trading at $0.0001599.</p>
<p class="p2">It is worth noting that the overall crypto market is bleeding out, with many altcoins down double digits after bitcoin failed to reclaim $17,000.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[New evidence shows that SBF borrowed over half a billion dollars from Alameda to purchase 56 million Robinhood shares. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">FXT founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) borrowed over $546 million from his trading house, Alameda Research, to purchase a 7.6% stake in Robinhood earlier this year.</p>
<p class="p2">According to an affidavit<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njb.1094107/gov.uscourts.njb.1094107.19.7.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span class="s1"> filed </span></a>in the High Court of Justice Antigua and Barbuda on December 12 before the arrest of SBF, the former billionaire teamed up with FTX co-founder <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-alameda-crisis-caroline-ellison-gary-wang-plead-guilty-to-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal">Zixiao (Gary) Wang</a> to borrow the funds. They were used to support Emergent Fidelity Technologies, another FTX affiliate, to purchase the 56 million <i>HOODs</i> in May.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>SBF Legally Owns 90% of the Robinhood Shares </b></h2>
<p class="p2">The loan was evidenced in four promissory notes, which revealed that SBF and Wang each borrowed approximately $317 million and $176 million from Alameda on April 30, 2022, and May 15, 2022, respectively.</p>
<p class="p2">Bankman-Fried received an additional $19 million from the firm on the same day Wang took the loan, representing a total of $554 million.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2">&#8220;In order to capitalize Emergent Fidelity Technologies so it could make the investments into Robinhood, Gary and I agreed to borrow funds from Alameda Research LTD,&#8221; reads the court document.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p2">The funds were then given to Alameda to aid its purchase of the shares. However, the trading firm spent around $650 million to purchase the stakes, and SBF claimed that the additional funding came from Wang.</p>
<p class="p2">According to the former FTX CEO, Emergent does not own any other assets besides the Robinhood shares at the time of purchase.</p>
<p class="p2">The court document also revealed that Bankman-Fried owned 90% of the shares, while Wang had only 10% of the assets due to the varied contributions.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>SBF, BlockFi, and Shimon Contest for Ownership</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The shares were later used by SBF and Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, as a pledge to obtain a loan from the crypto lending company BlockFi.</p>
<p class="p2">Interestingly, three parties are now fighting for ownership of the shares after FTX and BlockFi filed for bankruptcy last month.</p>
<p class="p2">SBF, BlockFi, and Yonathan Ben Shimon, one of FTX&#8217;s creditors, have filed separate legal actions in various jurisdictions to claim the Robinhood stake.</p>
<p class="p2">Earlier this month, Bankman-Fried, currently under house <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-released-on-a-250m-bail-can-stay-at-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">arrest</a>, <span class="s1">filed </span>a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-battles-for-control-of-450m-robinhood-shares-in-us-bankruptcy-court/" data-wpel-link="internal">motion</a> at a United States bankruptcy court seeking assistance to procure the assets now held by the brokerage company ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets (EDFM).</p>
<p class="p2">BlockFi, on the other hand, claims that the assets belonged to it, noting that the stake was pledged to the company as collateral on November 9. On that note, the crypto lender <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blockfi-sues-sbf-over-robinhood-shares-after-filing-for-bankruptcy-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">sued </span></a>Bankman-Fried, requesting that he honor the deal.</p>
<p class="p2">The last claimant, Yonathan Ben Shimon, an FTX creditor, alleged that the common stakes were purchased using customers&#8217; assets, which were part of the bitcoins he deposited on the exchange years before the company&#8217;s unfortunate end.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[SBF and FTX "had a heavy hand in Solana thriving the way it did" throughout last year's market-wide bull run, according to Santiment.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wading through the wreckage of FTX and Alameda, it is clear that some communities were hit a lot harder than others. Several DeFi protocols sporting close ties with the two entities have suffered. Solana, for one, has been hit the hardest since the collapse.</p>
<p>The once top 10 market cap asset, SOL has slid to the 17th position, and the struggle may continue in 2023 as well.</p>
<h2>Solana FUD</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) had an impressive run-up last year and was one of the best-performing tokens of the 2021 bull market. But since the unraveling of Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto empire, it has lost over 70% of its value.</p>
<p>The disgraced founder of FTX hyped Solana and its ecosystem frequently for years. The bankrupt exchange held $982 million in SOL, according to its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-13/ftx-s-balance-sheet-hack-paint-dim-picture-for-user-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">balance sheet.</a> Additionally, SOL is the second largest holding of its sister trading firm Alameda Research.</p>
<p>Zooming out, Solana lost over 95% of its value since its all-time high last November. A crash of this magnitude has shaken even the most resilient investors to the core.</p>
<p>The Solana ecosystem was expected to mount a serious challenge to Ethereum. Once heralded as an &#8220;Ethereum Killer,&#8221; the development activity on the network has taken a toll as well.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1607998705130692611" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a> from the crypto analytic platform Santiment, Solana&#8217;s development activity has been on a massive decline. Developers are no longer seeing any advantages to using the network and are currently in a near-death state.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Furthermore, Token Terminal&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/maik2hello/status/1605800868699246592" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a> suggest that the number of active blockchain developers has dropped from 3.7k recorded at the beginning of the year to about 1.6k in December. The developer count stood somewhere around 2,553, but the network is now left with only 76.</p>
<p>Top Solana projects such as DeGods and y00ts also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nft-projects-degods-y00ts-to-leave-solana-for-ethereum-and-polygon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> their departure from the network to Ethereum and Polygon, which has further added to the layer 1 blockchain&#8217;s woes.</p>
<h2>Gloomy Picture</h2>
<p>SOL-denominated total value locked (TVL) also tells a similar story, having <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana?currency=SOL" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">fallen</a> 28% from 27.2 million to 18.93 million since November 6. This could potentially imply that the fall of USD-denominated TVL may not be entirely the result of declining prices but rather from users pulling their assets out of DeFi.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the supply of stablecoins on the Solana has <a href="https://www.gokustats.xyz/dashboard/solana" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">taken</a> a hit significantly over the past several weeks. Its stablecoin market cap has decreased by around 50% since November 6th from a whopping $3.9 billion to $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>But Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal view the setbacks as temporary. The two execs recently <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/12/06/ripping-the-bandaid-solana-cofounders-talk-sbf-ftx-and-what-comes-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">told</a> Fortune that the events will be crucial for the network in moving forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think in the long term, it’s really good. We’ve always heard really negative criticism about FTX’s involvement in the ecosystem and that concentration of ownership stake. So it feels like ripping the Band-Aid.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Avraham Eisenberg has become the first U.S. resident to face charges for manipulating and draining $110 million from a DeFi protocol. 
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Cryptocurrency investor Avraham Eisenberg has been arrested in Puerto Rico on charges of commodities fraud and manipulation for allegedly stealing more than $100 million from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Mango Markets.</p>
<p class="p2">This marks the first time a U.S. resident has faced charges for manipulating a DeFi platform.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Eisenberg Drains $110M from Mango Markets</b></h2>
<p class="p2">Recall that Eisenberg admitted that his team used a &#8220;highly profitable trading strategy&#8221; to drain Mango Markets of digital assets worth $110 million by <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/defi-exploit-season-templedao-and-mangomarkets-lose-millions-in-attacks/" data-wpel-link="internal">manipulating</a> the price of the platform&#8217;s native token, MNGO, and withdrawing almost all of the crypto deposits from the protocol.</p>
<p class="p2">Due to his actions, investors lost almost all of their deposits on the DeFi platform, although Eisenberg later returned about $67 million to Mango Markets.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Fraud and Manipulation Charges</b></h2>
<p class="p2">Despite the refunds, the DeFi protocol eventually became insolvent, and Eisenberg now <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.591629/gov.uscourts.nysd.591629.1.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">faces</a> charges of commodities fraud and manipulation, which could result in fines or prison time.</p>
<p class="p2">Eisenberg was arrested on Monday, December 26. According to a criminal complaint unsealed on Tuesday, the defendant allegedly increased the price of the swaps by 1,300% before using the inflated swaps to borrow and withdraw the assets within 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="p2">The complaint alleges that the defendant &#8220;willfully and knowingly&#8221; manipulated the sale of a commodity – specifically, futures contracts on the DeFi protocol.</p>
<p class="p2">A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz states that Eisenberg &#8220;engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets, and other manipulative and deceptive devices and contrivances.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Racz: Eisenberg May Have Known His Actions Were Illegal</b></h2>
<p class="p2">Shortly after his attack on Mango Markets, Eisenberg said in an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mango-markets-exploiter-says-profitable-traders-like-him-attract-jealousy-and-hate/" data-wpel-link="internal">interview</a> that his team&#8217;s actions were legal, and affected projects could not press charges since the exploit could not be categorized as a hack.</p>
<p class="p2">However, Racz noted that Eisenberg may have been aware that his actions were illegal as he left the U.S. for Israel within 24 hours after he exploited the exchange. According to the FBI agent, the Mango Markets exploiter quickly left the U.S. to avoid apprehension.</p>
<p class="p2">Interestingly, Mango Markets is not the only DeFi protocol Eisenberg and his team <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mango-markets-exploiter-launches-shitcoin-to-abuse-bots-warns-twitter-community/" data-wpel-link="internal">have tried</a> to exploit. In November, the trader went after a sophisticated loophole on the DeFi platform Aave using a series of short attacks. However, the attempt failed, leading to a significant loss for the exploiter.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been oscillating in a very tight range heading into the new year&#8217;s holidays, offering little clue on the direction of the next significant move. Nevertheless, the market remains in a very decisive area, and its fate could be revealed in the next few days.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: Edris</p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>On the daily chart, the price has been grappling with the 50-day moving average around the $16,700 mark for a while now but is yet to break it in any direction. In case of a bullish breakout, a rally towards the $18K level and even the higher boundary of the large falling wedge pattern could be expected.</p>
<p>The mentioned wedge is considered a bullish reversal pattern in the current market condition and could initiate a mid-term bullish phase if broken to the upside. On the other hand, if the 50-day moving average holds and rejects the price lower, a drop toward the $15K area and the lower trendline of the falling wedge would be imminent.</p>
<figure id="attachment_230671" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230671" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-DAILY-Dec-28-2022-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-230671 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-DAILY-Dec-28-2022-scaled.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_281201" width="2560" height="1465" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-DAILY-Dec-28-2022-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-DAILY-Dec-28-2022-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-DAILY-Dec-28-2022-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-DAILY-Dec-28-2022-768x440.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-DAILY-Dec-28-2022-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-DAILY-Dec-28-2022-2048x1172.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-DAILY-Dec-28-2022-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230671" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price has finally dropped from the $16,900 level after testing it multiple times over the last week.</p>
<p>However, the recent candles demonstrate the price&#8217;s reluctance to drop rapidly, pointing to another possible retest of the mentioned resistance level.</p>
<p>All things considered, as far as the price resides below the $17K mark, a decline toward the $15K range would be the most likely outcome. The RSI indicator also shows values below 50, which signals that the momentum is in favor of the bears, further adding to the probability of a plunge in the short term.</p>
<figure id="attachment_230670" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230670" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-4H-Dec-28-2022-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-230670 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-4H-Dec-28-2022-scaled.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_281202" width="2560" height="1465" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-4H-Dec-28-2022-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-4H-Dec-28-2022-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-4H-Dec-28-2022-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-4H-Dec-28-2022-768x440.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-4H-Dec-28-2022-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-4H-Dec-28-2022-2048x1172.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-4H-Dec-28-2022-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230670" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p>By: Edris</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Long-term Holder SOPR</h3>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders are an essential cohort, as their behavior offers valuable insights into future market trends. The long-term holders&#8217; SOPR is a powerful metric that measures the ratio of profits and losses realized by these market participants and is one of the go-to metrics for on-chain analysis. Values above 1 indicate realized profits, and values below 1 indicate losses.</p>
<p>This chart demonstrates the 100-day standard moving average of the LTH SOPR. The metric has been declining for over a year now, pointing to the fact that the long-term holders&#8217; profit margin was constantly decreasing and has dropped below 1 in the last few months, as these investors have been realizing losses for a while now.</p>
<p>However, the metric has recently reached an exciting level, which marked the previous cycle&#8217;s bear market bottoms. Therefore, from a macro and multi-cyclical standpoint, the bear market bottom range does not seem far and may even be forming at the moment.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things are not looking good for XRP as its price has failed to reclaim a significant resistance level and seems likely to drop lower. The market is currently struggling to remain in a range, and it could initiate the next bearish leg down.</p>
<h2><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<h3><strong>The Daily Chart:</strong></h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has failed to reach the $0.43 area again, as the bullish rebound is seemingly coming to an end.</p>
<p>The 50-day moving average is currently acting as a critical resistance level around the $0.37 mark, preventing the price from rising further.</p>
<p>The mentioned moving average has also recently crossed the 200-day one to the downside, often interpreted as a bearish signal. The market structure is hinting at a drop to the $0.3 level in the short term, which could be the bulls&#8217; last resort to stop the cryptocurrency from dropping to a new lower low.</p>
<figure id="attachment_230654" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230654" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XRPUSDT-Daily-Dec-28-2022-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-230654 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XRPUSDT-Daily-Dec-28-2022-scaled.jpg" alt="xrp_price_chart_281201" width="2560" height="1465" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XRPUSDT-Daily-Dec-28-2022-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XRPUSDT-Daily-Dec-28-2022-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XRPUSDT-Daily-Dec-28-2022-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XRPUSDT-Daily-Dec-28-2022-768x440.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XRPUSDT-Daily-Dec-28-2022-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XRPUSDT-Daily-Dec-28-2022-2048x1172.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/XRPUSDT-Daily-Dec-28-2022-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-230654" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>The 4-Hour Chart:</strong></h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, a classic break and retest are forming, as the price has broken the $0.37 level to the downside and has retested it.</p>
<p>The mentioned level is rejecting the price to the downside convincingly. The RSI indicator, which suggested a likely rejection with an overbought and bearish divergence signal while the price was testing $0.37, is currently trending around the 50 mark.</p>
<p>A break below it would likely signal the beginning of another decline which could lead to a drop toward the $0.3 support level in the short term.</p>
