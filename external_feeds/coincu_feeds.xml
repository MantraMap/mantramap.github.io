<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new yield farming application called Origin Ether has been making waves in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. </strong></h5>



<p>According to data from blockchain analytics platform DefiLlama, the app has amassed over $12 million in total value locked (TVL) just 14 days after its launch on May 16. TVL is a metric that measures the dollar value of assets inside an app’s smart contracts.</p>

<p>Before the official launch, team members and early partners had already locked in $793,000 inside Origin Ether&#8217;s smart contracts. However, the public launch on May 16 led to a rapid accumulation of deposits, which resulted in a staggering TVL of over $13 million by May 30. This represents a gain of approximately $12.6 million in just two weeks.</p>



<p>Origin Ether&#8217;s official documentation reveals that the app generates yield from Ether by depositing it into multiple liquid staking and DeFi protocols. The app utilizes an algorithmic market operations strategy on Curve and Convex to maximize returns. Before being deposited into these protocols, some of the ETH is converted into liquid staking derivatives, such as Lido Staked Ether (stETH), Rocket Pool Ether (rETH), and Frax Staked Ether (sfrxETH). This allows users to gain additional farming rewards from these providers.</p>

<p>Liquid staking protocols have become increasingly popular as Ethereum moves towards proof-of-stake consensus and enables withdrawals. On May 1, DefiLlama reported that liquid staking protocols had surpassed decentralized exchanges to become the top DeFi category in terms of TVL. Cross-chain bridging protocol LayerZero also recently partnered with the Tenet network to increase the use of liquid staking in the Cosmos ecosystem.</p>



<p>Origin Ether&#8217;s impressive TVL in just 14 days clearly demonstrates the growing popularity and potential of yield farming applications and DeFi protocols in general. With more and more users looking to generate yields from their crypto holdings, it&#8217;s likely that we&#8217;ll see more innovative applications emerge in the near future.</p>

I plan to hit the ground running and build on the innovative technology created by the Paxful team.&#8221; Roshan previously served as a senior executive at TrustToken, which is well-known for being the creator of TrueUSD (TUSD), the fifth-largest stablecoin in terms of market capitalization.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the onboarding of the new CEO was not without controversy. The former CEO &#8211; Ray Youssef, took to Twitter to criticize the company&#8217;s decision to appoint Roshan. Youssef tweeted, &#8220;PF has a new defi CEO…expect a token soon.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth noting that Ray Youssef has no involvement in Paxful&#8217;s business decisions, and he advised users to approach Roshan directly with any concerns.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Paxful has a new defi ceo. Expect a token soon.

</div></figure>



<p>Paxful has had some issues in the recent past. Youssef had a disagreement with co-founder Artur Schaback over the use of exchange funds in early 2023. This led to blocked salaries and resignations from certain teams and contractors. Yousseff allegedly shut down Paxful on his own accord when it halted services on April 4th. He subsequently resigned from his role and committed his funds to a public trust that would be used to repay users.</p>

<p>It was on May 31 that the co-founder of the RPG series Illuvium, Kieran Warwick, released a statement in the Discord community that he had raised an additional $10 million in funding from Framework Ventures.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="645" height="331" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png" alt="Massive Blockchain Game Illuvium Raises Another $10M From Framework Ventures" class="wp-image-191102" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689.png 645w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1689-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" title="Massive Blockchain Game Illuvium Raises Another $10M From Framework Ventures 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The money raised will accelerate the development of this game. This transaction is completed through a token, which will be locked for two years and will not be included in the commit, so it will not participate in the distribution of benefits.</p>



<p>Reportedly, Illuvium is an entirely decentralized collectible and role-playing game built on the Immutable X L2 network. Illuvium is about to launch a public beta with three interactive AAA games: Zero (city builder), Overworld (monster world), and Arena (arena).</p>



<p>Founded last year by Kieran and Aaron Warwick, this RPG has created a game that rewards players with the chance to discover and capture NFT creatures, known as Illuvials, in combat. The game incentivizes players to have a stake in the project, as the Illuvium network allows in-game fees to be paid out to staked token holders as ongoing rewards.</p>

<p>In March 2021, Illuvium successfully raised $5 million in a seed round led by one of the oldest venture capital funds in the decentralized finance, Framework Ventures. The project has also received financial support from IOSG Ventures, LD Capital, Delphi Digital, YBB Foundation Ltd, Stake Capital, Moonwhale Ventures, Lotus Capital, Blocksync Ventures, Bitscale Capital, Quantstamp, Yield Guild Games, Bitcoin.com, …</p>



<p>In mid-April 2022, Framework Ventures, a backer of Illuvium and Stardust, said it would invest $200 million in blockchain game projects following the launch of a $400 million fund.</p>

<p>The exchange initially sent a series of test transactions involving all these assets to Alameda on May 23, with the transactions being worth $10 each. These transactions were intended to return FTX and Alameda&#8217;s frozen funds on the OKX platform. In March, OKX seized $157 million in cryptocurrency assets after FTX collapsed in November 2022. The latest transfers continue OKX&#8217;s efforts to return these funds to their rightful owners.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Alameda Research is transferring its leftover funds to Coinbase. In the past week, the bankrupt firm has transferred $10 million worth of USDT from its cold wallets to Coinbase Prime and deposited $31.2 million to the U.S.-based exchange. According to Arkham Intelligence, Alameda has transferred more than $250 million to Coinbase over the past month.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>A Coinbase user&#8217;s statement about a privacy violation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not receive much support from the judge.</em></li>



<li><em>The ruling strengthens the IRS&#8217;s authority over financial data collection, potentially setting a precedent for future privacy challenges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US District Court Judge Joseph N. Laplante dismissed Coinbase user James Harper&#8217;s request to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to obtain personal data from <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191053-former-coinbase-settles-charges-with-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> in a ruling.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="575" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682-1024x575.png" alt="Coinbase User Failed To Protest IRS Access To His Data" class="wp-image-191078" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682-1024x575.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682-750x421.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1682.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase User Failed To Protest IRS Access To His Data 22"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The IRS obtaining his data through subpoenas does not violate Harper&#8217;s right to a fair hearing or protection from unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>



<p>However, in his most recent judgment, Laplante sided with the IRS, and he stated that Harper had no standing to claim an interest in the records under the Fourth or Fifth Amendments. Harper&#8217;s claim of a privacy violation was further weakened by the judge&#8217;s assertion that Coinbase was the rightful custodian of Harper&#8217;s account documents.</p>



<p>Judge Laplante noted that Harper voluntarily disclosed his information to Coinbase. Additionally, the company&#8217;s privacy policy warns against possible government expropriation, and this significantly undermines Harper&#8217;s view that disclosure to Coinbase is voluntary.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="885" height="497" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683.png" alt="Coinbase User Failed To Protest IRS Access To His Data" class="wp-image-191079" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683.png 885w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683-300x168.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683-768x431.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1683-750x421.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" title="Coinbase User Failed To Protest IRS Access To His Data 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This reaffirms the broad authority that the IRS has, allowing it to issue subpoenas in a variety of circumstances. The ruling strengthens the IRS&#8217;s right to collect financial data, potentially setting a precedent for future privacy challenges.</p>



<p>In addition, the judge dismissed Harper&#8217;s claim of a breach of due process and stated that Harper did not have any property rights to the record. Even if he had such rights, the summons would be significantly restricted, requiring court approval.</p>



<p>Reportedly, the plaintiff, James Harper, opened accounts on exchanges like Coinbase in 2013 and received Bitcoin as income for his consulting work. In 2016, the IRS issued a subpoena to this exchange seeking anonymous taxpayer information, which Coinbase initially denied, leading to a second legal pursuit by the IRS to ensure compliance.</p>

<p>Former FTX SBF CEO has challenged his criminal charges after being extradited from the Bahamas. The US Department of Justice is <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/148/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeking a specialty waiver</a> from the Bahamas to allow certain cases to proceed.</p>



<p>Since the SBF was extradited last December, prosecutors have filed a number of alternative indictments against him on new charges.</p>



<p>SBF, which<a href="https://news.coincu.com/186038-sbf-asks-us-judge-drop-criminal-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has pleaded not guilty</a> to criminal charges, including bank fraud, is awaiting trial in October. The crypto prodigy was formally arrested in the Bahamas and later extradited to the United States, where he is currently located under house arrest at his parents&#8217; home in California.</p>



<p>The FTX founder recently countered a number of criminal charges against him, arguing that the government had &#8220;inappropriately added&#8221; &#8220;several new, unrelated allegations without concurrence.&#8221; that was the clear intention of the Bahamian government.&#8221; He has offered to dismiss 10 of the 13 criminal charges against him.</p>

<p>US prosecutors say they will not pursue certain charges against the founder of FTX if the island nation says they violated the terms of his extradition. They acknowledged in court documents filed Monday that some charges could be dropped if the Bahamas objected.</p>



<p>Although prosecutors argued that Bankman-Fried could not challenge the charges based on his extradition, they noted that the Bahamian government could prevent parts of the case from continuing. The judge is expected to hear arguments on the matter on June 15.</p>



<p>Prosecutors said the Bahamas was the only party involved in the Bankman-Fried trial that could raise valid objections to the newer charges on grounds related to the extradition agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC announced that former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi and his brother had agreed to settle allegations of insider trading.</em></li>



<li><em>Wahi received a two-year jail term earlier this month after pleading guilty to similar criminal counts.</em></li>



<li><em>In Wahi&#8217;s insider trading case, Coinbase has not been accused of any misconduct.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> on May 30 that former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi and his brother Nikhil Wahi had agreed to resolve accusations of insider trading filed against them. The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a motion for final judgment in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.</strong></h5>

<p>The brothers were detained last year on suspicion of wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud in connection with an insider trading scam. The SEC filed insider trading accusations on the same day. According to the SEC&#8217;s release on Tuesday, the two agreed to disgorge their earnings and pay interest.</p>



<p>They pled guilty to the allegations brought by the Department of Justice, and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186281-former-coinbase-manager-2-years-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ishan Wahi</a> now faces a 2-year term, while Nikhil Wahi is serving a 10-month sentence. The SEC said that the brothers&#8217; criminal fines satisfied the civil case settlements and that it would not pursue any further penalties.</p>



<p>Wahi&#8217;s SEC cooperation agreement covers his own case as well as any relevant judicial or administrative process or inquiry started by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party, implying that he may participate in the separate probe.</p>

<p>SEC Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal said in a statement that the suspected conduct is not new.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We allege that Ishan and Nikhil Wahi, respectively, tipped and traded securities based on material nonpublic information, and that’s insider trading, pure and simple. The federal securities laws do not exempt crypto asset securities from the prohibition against insider trading, nor does the SEC. I am grateful to the SEC staff for successfully working to resolve this matter,&#8221; he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The SEC alleged in its initial complaint against Wahi last year that the tokens at the center of the insider trading allegations were unregistered securities, which means the SEC could try to hold Coinbase liable for facilitating the sale of unregistered security investments for the tokens that the company eventually listed.</p>



<p>The settlement ended the court action that was supposed to determine whether nine of the cryptocurrencies at the core of the dispute were, in fact, securities, as the SEC alleged. Ishan Wahi contended in his first answer to the SEC complaint that the tokens were not securities.</p>



<p>Coinbase postponed any SEC action last month by suing the agency for a response to a petition for crypto-specific regulations. The case is being fought by the SEC.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, Bybit has been expanding its services. Earlier on May 2, it announced it would start offering crypto lending services to users. In March, the company partnered with Mastercard to offer a new debit card for crypto payments.</p>



<p>Bybit also proceeded to grow its activities after acquiring regulatory permits in Kazakhstan. On May 29, the exchange announced that it had received pre-approval from Kazakhstan&#8217;s Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA) to serve as a digital asset trading facility and asset holding service provider at the Center.

<p>The CFTC&#8217;s Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR) issued the advisory on Tuesday, stating that it would place a special emphasis on emerging risks in cryptocurrency in response to an increase in the number of its supervised entities clearing such trades. These hazards include possible conflicts of interest, cyber-threat prevention, and how corporations manage the physical delivery of digital assets in transactions requiring delivery.</p>



<p>According to the agency:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;DCR expects DCOs and applicants to actively identify new, evolving, or unique risks and implement risk mitigation measures tailored to the risks that these products or clearing-structure changes may present.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The derivatives regulator oversees crypto futures directly and has enforcement authority over fraud and manipulation of spot markets for trading non-security crypto assets.</p>



<p>It is anticipated to play a larger role as an industry watchdog in the future, but legislation to increase its jurisdiction has yet to pass through Congress. When such a regulator gives a public warning about particular behaviors, it is often followed by punishment in that field.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184605-cftc-issues-largest-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFTC</a> has already taken major enforcement actions against cryptocurrency companies, most recently against Binance&#8217;s global operations.</p>

<p>CFTC earlier authorized the Eurex FTSE bitcoin index futures, with trading for US-based investors commencing yesterday.</p>



<p>The trade started early on 17 April outside of the US. The contract was created in partnership with FTSE Russell and Digital Asset Research (DAR).</p>



<p>US players may now take advantage of expanded trading and hedging options. This includes increased access to more participants and liquidity pools during European, North American, and Asian business hours.</p>



<p>With this approval, Eurex becomes the first exchange in Europe to offer bitcoin index futures. The new futures contracts are traded in both euros and US dollars, have a contract multiplier equal to one Bitcoin (BTC), and settle in cash with no position limitations on expiration.</p>
