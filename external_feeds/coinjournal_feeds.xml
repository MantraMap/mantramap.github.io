<li>DOJ&rsquo;s national security division is investigating Binance.</li>
<li>Binance is accused of enabling Russians to circumvent US sanctions.</li>
<li>The inquiry is focusing on both Binance and its officials.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a>, the largest cryptocurrency by trading volume, is under investigation by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) for potential violations of Russian sanctions. </p>
<p>The DOJ&rsquo;s national security division is investigating whether Binance was used to enable Russians to evade US sanctions and transfer money through the exchange.</p>
<h2>Growing regulatory crypto scrutiny</h2>
<p>The DOJ is specifically investigating whether the crypto exchange or its officials violated or assisted in violating the sanctions against Russia.</p>
<p>DOJ&rsquo;s investigation highlights the increasing regulatory scrutiny of crypto exchanges across the world and mostly in the US as authorities kick in to prevent illegal activities.</p>
<h2>Binance troubles in the US</h2>
<p>It is not the first time Binance is getting investigated by US securities. On March 27, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a 74-page complaint labelling <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, Binance USD (BUSD), <a href="https://coinjournal.net/litecoin/what-is-litecoin/">Litecoin (LTC)</a>, Tether (USDT), and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin/">&nbsp;Bitcoin (BTC)</a> as commodities and also accused Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of market manipulation and lack of compliance. Changpeng &lsquo;CZ&rsquo; Zhao however came out and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binances-cz-refutes-cftcs-claims-of-improper-compliance-procedures-and-trading/">rejected the CFTC&rsquo;s allegations</a> against Binance and himself.</p>
<p>Although Binance was yet to comment on the reported DOJ investigation at press time, it has previously stated that it is committed to complying with all laws and regulations in all the jurisdictions in which it operates in. The exchange has also invested heavily in complying with Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering measures to prevent illegal activities.</p>

<li>Ethereum (ETH) is trading higher today as the crypto market cap bounces to $1.27 trillion.</li>
<li>ETH price rose to $2,008 while Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed to $29,800 looks to end the week stronger.</li>
<li>Gains for cryptocurrencies came as US equities ended the week higher, with regional bank stocks pummeled earlier in the week rebounding.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">On Friday, the price of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> rose over 6% within hours to break above $2,000, a key technical level that bulls seek to turn into support. On Saturday, Ethereum was trading around $1,966 and up 4% in the past 24 hours after rising to intraday highs of $2,008.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum isn&rsquo;t the only crypto asset to see a price bump in the past day. <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, the benchmark cryptocurrency and digital gold, rose to near $29,800 as a 3% price increase took bulls to within the now highly coveted $30k level.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both Ethereum and Bitcoin are looking to benefit from an uptick in investor sentiment, particularly with risk appetite back following recent dips.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why did Ethereum price go up?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.5% to above $1.27 trillion as memecoin mania returned with Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) prices surging after listing on Binance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A look across the broader market shows <a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/">crypto prices</a> rebounded as the US <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/stock-markets/">stock market</a> ended the week higher, with the major indices all turning green after a four-day losing streak.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The S&amp;P 500 closed 1.85% up, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 546 points, or 1.65% and the Nasdaq closed 2.25% higher.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The positive returns for the market came as equities rebounded, led by shares of Apple (AAPL) that jumped to a nine-month high on the iPhone maker&rsquo;s better-than-expected quarterly report. The market also saw regional bank stocks show some recovery after massive sell-off in the week, with PacWest shares among those to rebound after falling over 60% on Thursday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While crypto and other risky assets are likely to benefit from overall investor sentiment, the coming week will be key as the markets assess April&rsquo;s CPI report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted this week that the central bank could pause its interest rates hike. However, with this week&rsquo;s strong jobs data, all eyes will be on the CPI data as investors evaluate the inflation indicator.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Sandbox price failed to recover from a year-long slump during the bullish price action of early 2023. 3D games in the metaverse have been a source of great excitement among blockchain investors, but a new kind of play-to-earn (P2E) platform may be the next big thing in the GameFi sector.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=68" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a>&rsquo;s hugely successful token presale is a testament to an exciting roadmap that has appealed to Web3 users. While The Sandbox price continues to struggle, Metacade&rsquo;s continues to gain momentum.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade is a very interesting niche investment opportunity</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While the majority of cryptocurrencies in Web3 enjoyed significant gains at the beginning of 2023, The Sandbox price underperformed. 3D games in the metaverse posted impressive returns during the 2021 bull market, yet a prolonged slump for The Sandbox price has concerned some long-term investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Sandbox price remains more than 90% down from its all-time high. Meanwhile, <strong>Metacade rose more than 2x in the space of a week</strong> as it continues to generate excitement among the blockchain gaming community. The token is fresh from two primary exchange listings and looks ready to continue its rapid development.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=68" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> raised $16.4 million during the MCADE token presale, with most fundraising stages sold out. Since then, the MCADE token has launched on Uniswap and BitMart and skyrocketed to a $0.03 price level towards the end of April.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While 3D games based in the metaverse are still in their infancy, Metacade&rsquo;s comprehensive <a href="https://sensoriumxr.com/articles/what-is-play-to-earn-gaming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>play to earn</u></a> environment intends to include 3D games as it grows. It awaits to be seen whether The Sandbox price will reclaim its previous highs over time.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is The Sandbox</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Sandbox is a blockchain-based virtual gaming world where players can create, share, and monetize their gaming experiences. Utilizing the Ethereum blockchain, The Sandbox aims to revolutionize the gaming industry by providing a decentralized platform for gamers and game developers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With its unique combination of user-generated content and P2E mechanics, The Sandbox offers a new frontier for gamers to explore and connect. Players can also purchase LAND, virtual real estate that can be used to build and monetize custom gaming experiences.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Could SAND reach $5 in 2025?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Sandbox remains one of the top 3D games in Web3. Despite its reduced price of $0.60, which is 92% down from the all-time high of $8.50, The Sandbox price could target higher price levels above $1 and $2.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Price analysts have highlighted a key resistance area for The Sandbox price at the $3.50 level. As the broader crypto market enters long-awaited bull market conditions over the coming years, a leading 3D game such as The Sandbox certainly has the potential to reach its previous resistance levels.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Metacade?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=68" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> will be the first community-driven blockchain arcade and the most extensive platform found in Web3. It plans to offer many different play-to-earn arcade games in a single location, which gives players an extensive opportunity to earn cryptocurrency rewards while enjoying some addictive gameplay experiences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project also aims to become a central hub for the blockchain community by introducing several unique earning mechanisms. Metacade will serve investors, entrepreneurs, and gamers through a range of on-chain services. The platform is genuinely planning on taking P2E mechanics to the next level.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How does MCADE work?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The MCADE token is used to pay rewards in the metaverse arcade. Players can play solo, earn MCADE tokens while trying to beat their highest score, or join paid entry tournaments to win major crypto prizes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is also developing a suite of DeFi services for its community. MCADE token holders can use on-platform staking to earn a passive yield and use their tokens to vote in governance proposals released by the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Metacade community hub is introducing a novel variation of the play-to-earn mechanism called Create2Earn. <strong>This will reward content creators with MCADE tokens for their contributions to the community</strong>. Contributions can include posting game reviews, sharing alpha, and interacting with other users&rsquo; posts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As well as all this, Metacade will advertise paid job opportunities at leading companies in <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/web3/"><u>Web3</u></a>. Crypto enthusiasts can apply for full-time and part-time roles directly through the Metacade jobs board, which will also include a Work2Earn feature that connects users to unique beta testing opportunities for brand-new P2E titles.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Could MCADE reach $2 in 2025?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The MCADE token has enjoyed a fruitful start to 2023. The presale was successfully closed with $16.4 million raised as funding for the metaverse arcade, which displays the widespread popularity of the project and its projected future demand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE has extensive utility on the Metacade platform and deflationary tokenomics. Price analysts are forecasting significant returns from the current price of $0.027 as long-term investors continue to buy the token ahead of a future crypto bull market.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade vs. The Sandbox price predictions: Which token is worth buying?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The blockchain can support 3D games with integrated earning potential for players. This is a crucial reason why metaverse projects such as The Sandbox and Metacade have high price forecasts for the future. Metacade and The Sandbox prices are expected to rise significantly from the current levels.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade, as a brand new platform in the GameFi sector, could be preparing for massive action over the coming years. Further information about this exciting project is available on Metacade&rsquo;s <a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=68" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Crypto prices have rebounded strongly this year, but the space remains barren compared to the pandemic hysteria</li>
<li dir="ltr">Institutional money has fled at an alarming pace, and there is no guarantee it will return</li>
<li dir="ltr">Scandals of 2022 were on such a large scale that capital is reluctant to return</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Mention &ldquo;2022&rdquo; to anyone remotely involved in the cryptocurrency industry and you&rsquo;ll likely send a shudder down their spine. The year was fraught with scandals, embarrassments and, more than anything else, thundering price collapses.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> is a good gauge for the action of the industry. The world&rsquo;s biggest crypto peaked at close to $69,000 in November 2021. One year later, it was $15,500.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13653672">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Since the nadir in November, prices have bounced strongly. Bitcoin is currently trading around $29,000, as softer inflation data and optimism around the future path of interest rates picked up since the winter.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, things are different. And despite these rising prices, there has to be a fear that the cryptocurrency industry has suffered an indelible blow to its reputation. For institutions, have the events of last year put a sour taste in the mouth?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Justin Chapman, Northern Trust&rsquo;s head of digital assets and financial markets, summed up these concerns in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/04/crypto-has-lost-its-shine-for-institutional-investors-says-northern-trust-executive.html"><u>interview</u></a> with CNBC this week, saying that &ldquo;client interest has definitely gone off (a) cliff in terms of institutional interest in cryptocurrencies&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely quiet now, since 2022, from the institutional side,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Before that, we were seeing traditional fund managers looking to launch crypto funds, ETPs in Europe, which is the equivalent of ETFs in the U.S. &mdash; that&rsquo;s really gone quiet. Even the hedge funds, who are pretty active in the markets, have certainly reduced their exposure within that particular space.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The evidence for this goes beyond anecdotes. I&rsquo;ve put together a few reports on the immense capital flight out of crypto markets recently. One of my favourite charts to demonstrate the extent of this is by looking at the balance of stablecoins on exchanges. Since FTX collapsed in November, over half the total stablecoin balance has evaporated from exchanges. That translates to an <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/22-billion-of-stablecoins-has-fled-exchanges-in-5-months-a-report-into-cryptos-capital-flight/"><u>outflow of $22 billion</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13612192">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Market depth on exchanges is similar: capital has just <em>fled</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Crypto messed up when the cameras were on</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto&rsquo;s surge during the pandemic undoubtedly put it on the main stage, with money flowing into the sector like never had before. Such were the scale of the scandals, most notably the FTX and LUNA collapses, there is concern that institutional money will never return at the same pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">When Tesla purchased Bitcoin and put it on its balance sheet, it felt like the start of a movement for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Everybody was talking about crypto, and funds from previously non-crypto domiciles like Wall Street were flowing like a tidal wave into the space.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But then came the crashes. Not only that, but the total lack of regulation in the space, and the absence of any sort of risk management, sent the whole industry into a very public and ignominious tailspin, with bankruptcy after bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, regulators are moving in harshly and the environment in the US is becoming increasingly hostile. February saw the Binance-branded BUSD stablecoin shut down. Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is awaiting trial. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has been charged by the CFTC for operating an &ldquo;intentionally opaque common enterprise&rdquo;, including accusations it &ldquo;failed to implement basic compliance procedures designed to prevent and detect terrorist financing and money laundering&rdquo;. Coinbase has been issued with a Wells notice by the SEC, warned of impending charges around securities violations.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">How many blows can one industry take?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is somewhat separate, and its unique place as the first cryptocurrency, and aims of becoming a store-of-value, at least mean it has a goal. But for the rest of crypto, the point of everything is not as clear, nor are the future prospects.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto was given the perfect set-up: an explosive bull run stemming all the way back to 2009, fuelled by historically low (sometimes negative) interest rates and, to top it all off, a pandemic where everybody was stuck at home with stimulus cheques arriving while DIY investing took off.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Public companies moved in, countries declared it legal tender (El Salvador, Central African Republic), clients called fund managers asking how they could buy these mystical virtual coins.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A couple of years on, the reputation of the space is in tatters. Retail money may come and go, but the big institutional cash may be tougher to goad back in, and the lofty dreams of decentralised altcoins revolutionising how the world lives are certainly more quixotic. Most fund managers want nothing to do with crypto right now, nor should they.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even after the price rises this year, most coins are still trading far below their peaks. Even Bitcoin is still down 58% from its high. Not only that, but the liquidity for most coins is still low, volatility extremely elevated, legal trouble for crypto companies mounting, and the regulatory picture murkier than ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto prices may be rising. But the space is still barren compared to the hysteria of the bull market. And there is not much evidence suggesting institutional funds will pour back in anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrency prices were mixed, with key coins like Bitcoin moving sideways.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Meme coins like Pepe and Floki Inu surged after their Binance listing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies were relatively mixed this week as Bitcoin remained stubbornly below $30,000 and Ethereum below $2,000. Meme coins like Pepe and Floki Inu soared after being listed in Binance while Sui jumped and then dumped. This crypto price prediction will look at Tron, Optimism, and Stacks.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Tron price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/tron/"><u>Tron</u></a> price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few days. It jumped to a high of $0.070, the highest point since February. On the four-hour chart, the coin has jumped above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages. It also moved above the important resistance point on $0.069, the highest point in March.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, it seems like the coin will continue rising in the coming days as buyers target the next key resistance point at $0.073, the highest level on February 20. This price is about 3.50% above the current level. A drop below the key support at $0.7070 will invalidate the bullish view.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Optimism price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Optimism is one of the biggest layer-2 networks in the blockchain industry. It competes with other well-known blockchains like Arbitrum and Polygon. OP price has been in a steep sell-off this week as it dropped below the key support at $2.07, which was the lower side of the descending triangle pattern. It has also formed a head and shoulders pattern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Optimism also remains below the 25-day and 50-day exponential moving averages and the support at $2, the lowest point on March 27. Therefore, it seems like bears have the momentum, which could see it crash to the next support at $1.80. The stop-loss of this trade is at $2.20.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/05/1683297407447-1a3ea903-4d4d-4562-b1e5-d648759c1284.png" style="width: 673px;height: 327.527px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="673" height="327.527"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Stacks price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/stacks/"><u>Stacks</u></a> is a leading blockchain project that seeks to create a Bitcoin layer for smart contracts. It solves an important challenge in that Bitcoin does not have smart contract capabilities. As such, developers can build applications that take advantage of Bitcoin to handle transactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stacks surged earlier this year after the launch of Bitcoin Ordinals. It jumped to a high of $1.314 and has now erased most of those gains to trade at $0.72. The coin remains below the 50-day moving average and the key support point at $0.78.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The coin is slightly above the key support point at $0.6720. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for STX price is downwards, with the next key level to watch being at $0.60.</p>

<li>Coinbase reports market-beating results for its fiscal Q1.</li>
<li>Analysts are still keeping bearish on the Coinbase stock.</li>
<li>Coinbase shares are now up roughly 70% year-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase Global Inc</a> are up nearly 15% on Friday after reporting its financial results for the first quarter that handily topped Street estimates.</p>
<h2>Coinbase stock up on narrowed loss</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lost $78.9 million versus the year-ago $429.7 million</li>
<li>Per-share loss also narrowed sharply from $1.98 to 34 cents</li>
<li>Revenue tanked 34% year-on-year to $772.5 million</li>
<li>Consensus was $1.45 a share loss on $655 million in revenue</li>
<li>Total operating expenses were down 24% versus last year</li>
</ul>
<p>The crypto company attributed strength in its quarterly performance partially to the surge this year in the price of bitcoin. Still, Wells Fargo analyst Jeff Cantwell remains bearish on the Coinbase stock due to the <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/sec-reluctant-define-digital-assets-crypto-regulatory-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory uncertainty</a>.</p>
<p>His $43 price objective suggests more than a 20% downside from here.</p>
<h2>BofA is also dovish on Coinbase shares</h2>
<p>Remember that Coinbase Global Inc had received a &ldquo;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/22/coinbase-stock-drops-after-sec-wells-notice-a-possible-prelude-to-enforcement-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wells notice</a>&rdquo; from the U.S. SEC in late March. It is also noteworthy that trading volume in the recently concluded quarter came in at $145 billion and missed the consensus estimate by $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>To that end, Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg also reiterated his &ldquo;underperform&rdquo; rating on the Coinbase stock today and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We maintain our cautious view on Coinbase shares as we continue to think retail crypto volumes will remain weak and regulatory overhang will linger for some time.</p></blockquote>
<p>In its current quarter, Coinbase Global Inc expects its subscription and services revenue to sequentially decline to around $300 million, as per its <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Shareholder-Letter-Q1-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter to shareholders.</a></p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Floki Inu price rally by more than 50% today</h2>
<p dir="ltr">FLOKI, the native token of the Floki Inu ecosystem, has been the best performer amongst the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/floki/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Floki Inu</u></a> stands at $0.00005282, up by 56% over the past few hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rally comes thanks to two massive listings of the Floki Inu token. Earlier today, Bitfinex, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, listed FLOKI on its trading platform.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Binance lists FLOKI in its innovation zone</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Following the announcement by Bitfinex, Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, also announced earlier today that it would be listing Floki Inu and PEPE coins in the Binance Innovation Zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p dir="ltr">These latest developments were behind FLOKI rallying by more than 50% over the last 24 hours. The positive performance comes despite the broader crypto market currently stagnating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is down by less than 1% in the last 24 hours and continues to trade above the $29k level. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is up by less than 1% so far today and is trading just above $1,900.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, the total cryptocurrency market cap stands at $1.2 trillion.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Kenya&rsquo;s Treasury Secretary outlined the tax proposals in a document sent to parliament on 4 May, 2023.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The 3% crypto tax will target cryptocurrencies and NFT transfers on exchanges and by individuals.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Kenya is one of the countries with the fastest growing adoption of cryptocurrencies in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Kenya is seeking a 3% tax on the transfer of digital assets, budget proposals from the Treasury ministry outline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The tax proposals were part of the Finance Bill 2023 that Njuguna Ndung&rsquo;u, Cabinet Secretary for National Treasury and Economic Planning, sent to the National Assembly on Thursday, 4 May 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Treasury CS is expected to present the budget statement to Parliament on 8 June, and could see the East African nation have the new taxation measures in place for the 2023/2024 budget year, the <a href="http://www.parliament.go.ke/sites/default/files/2023-05/THE%20FINANCE%20BILL%20%2C%202023_compressed.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>details</u></a> of the proposal showed.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Authorities eye tax for crypto and NFTs</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Apart from <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a>, the tax proposals also target non-fungible token (NFT) transfers. These will relate to transactions made by exchanges as well as individuals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Digital assets are classified as property in Kenya, and any gains from the sale, exchange, or disposal of such assets would be subject to capital gains tax. Other than crypto, Kenya also targets monetized online content, with the sector set to be subject to a 15% tax.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Around 8.5% of Kenya&rsquo;s adult population own or hold cryptocurrencies. While countries in Africa such as Nigeria and South Africa have more people owning crypto, Kenya places higher in terms of percentage of the population.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recent statistics on global crypto ownership and usage by the UN <a href="https://unctad.org/news/unctad-spells-out-actions-curb-cryptocurrencies-developing-countries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ranked</u></a> Kenya fifth worldwide and fourth among emerging economies &ndash; behind Ukraine, Russia and Venezuela.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the latest <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ownership figures</u></a> from Singapore-based crypto research company Triple A, over 2.7 million Kenyans own digital assets. Globally, cryptocurrency ownership has risen to an average of 4.2%, with numbers jumping from 320 million in early 2022 to over 420 million in May 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kenya&rsquo;s plans for <a href="https://coinjournal.net/crypto-tax/">crypto taxation</a> rules come as the trend around the world sees increased regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrencies. The UK, EU and other jurisdictions are looking to offer clear regulatory guidelines for the industry, particularly around overall protection of investors amid likely risks from unregulated crypto exchanges.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/metacade/"><u>Metacade</u></a> (MCADE) price has done well since going public in April this year. In all, data compiled by&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/uniswap/"><u>Uniswap</u></a> shows that the token has jumped by more than 275% from its all-time low, making it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the world. Here are three reasons why Metacade price will likely continue soaring in the near term.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Macro events favor cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The first main reason to invest in Metacade is that macro events seem to favor cryptocurrencies and other assets. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve decided to hike interest rates by 0.25%, bringing them to about 5.25%. Analysts believe that the Fed has now ended its hiking cycle since there are signs that the American economy is slowing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, GDP data published last week showed that the economy slowed down in A1. Further data showed that the manufacturing sector continued contracting in April this year. Retail sales have slowed as inflation remains stubbornly high.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most importantly, the banking sector is at its biggest risk in years. On Monday, the FDIC seized First Republic Bank and sold it to JP Morgan, as we wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/mcade-tops-0-027-as-analysts-turn-bullish-on-first-republic-sage/"><u>here</u></a>. Other banks are at a significant risk. For example, PacWest shares tumbled by over 50% on Thursday while Comerica and Western Alliance fell by double-digits.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, it is hard to fathom the Fed continuing hiking rates in a period when banks are collapsing. As such, there is a likelihood that Metacade will and other altcoins will do well because of Bitcoin&rsquo;s role as a safe haven. &nbsp;In fact, Bitcoin and other major tokens have outperformed stocks this year.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade important news</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The other main reason to invest in&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en"><u>Metacade</u></a> is that there are some important news that could push the token higher. First, the number of MCADE holders has continued rising in the past few weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Data compiled by Etherscan shows that the&nbsp;<a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xed328e9c1179a30ddc1e7595e036aed8760c22af"><u>number</u></a> has jumped to 9,239, which is much higher than where it was last month. This is a sign that the token is gaining traction and that the number will get to 10k soon. The number of MCADE transfers has jumped to over 27,289.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, according to the Metacade&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/whitepaper/whitepaper.pdf"><u>white paper</u></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>the developers are working to get the token listed in more centralized exchanges. Already, the token has been listed in platforms like MEXC and BitMart. Other potential exchanges where the developers plan to list it are Binance and OKX. In most cases, cryptocurrencies tend to do well after a major exchange listing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further, the developers are working on the Metacade game, which is expected to be launched in the next few months. We expect that the game will do well, which will help the token gain traction in the next few months. Historically, crypto tokens tend to do well ahead of a major event.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade technicals are supportive</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/05/1683261734716-36a2d1f5-1cdc-4137-bd90-62456824eded.png" style="width: 691px;height: 336.287px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="691" height="336.287"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The other main reason to invest in MCADE is that technicals are supportive. On the four-hour chart, we see that the Metacade price has been in a bullish trend in the past few weeks. As it rose, the token moved above the important resistance point at $0.034, the highest point on April 20th. It has now retested that price in what is known as a break and retest pattern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is being supported by the 50-period moving average. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the token will bounce back as buyers target the all-time high of $0.045. A break above that level will see it jump to the next psychological level at $0.05.</p>
