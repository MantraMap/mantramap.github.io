Coinbase International will offer leveraged trading, but they're starting small with a maximum 5X leverage option.</p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>A Warning Shot...</b></span></p><p>Coinbase's move into the international market may also serve as a warning to the US government, particularly the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to provide more clarity and answers to unresolved questions regarding crypto regulations.&nbsp;</p><p>If they continue to fail in their duties, they risk pushing companies like Coinbase out of the US market, which could have a significant economic impact, leading investors to seek out unregulated areas of the market.</p><p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was asked if Coinbase would relocate entirely if regulators continued to fail to provide clarity, he <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/18/coinbase-could-move-away-from-us-if-no-regulatory-clarity-ceo-brian-armstrong/">said</a>&nbsp;"anything is on the table".</p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">More info soon...</span></b></p><p>Unfortunately, Coinbase has not revealed which countries will have access to the new exchange, but you can sign up on their platform to see if you're eligible.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">-------<br /></span></span><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: red; font-weight: bolder;">Author:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #333333;">Mark Pippen<br /></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;"><span style="color: #0b5394;">London News Desk&nbsp;<br /></span></span></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;"><a href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/"><span style="color: #444444;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></span></span></i></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
