			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, USDT, has recently frozen an account with over $4.1 million, as shown by on-chain explorers. This once again raises the question of whether centralization, with its concentration of power, is the ideal path forward or if decentralized projects like Tradecurve are essential for the survival of the DeFi ecosystem.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
No explanation for $4.1 million freeze of USDT
<p>On June 19th, Tether froze $4.11 million of USDT without providing any further comment on the action. The analytics platform Etherscan marks the USDT wallet as frozen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Reddit user traced the frozen account back to a Huobi user, and on-chain data indicates that the USDT was funneled into the wallet in March 2023. There is ongoing speculation that the owner of the account may be involved in illegal activities, which appears to have prompted Tether to actively freeze the holdings in the address.</p>
<p>Tether Holdings Limited acts as a centralized entity and manages over $83.1 billion worth of USDT in circulating supply. Each USDT token on any blockchain is issued and backed 1:1 with cash or cash equivalents.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tether and USDT play an essential role in the cryptocurrency market but face concerns regarding centralization, which are further highlighted by the issuer's ability to freeze assets. This stands in contrast to the core principles of blockchain technology, which is inherently borderless and decentralized.</p>
<p>Critics on social media are raising their voices, pointing out that Tether Holdings Limited behaves like a bank by freezing the address. A Reddit user highlighted the fact that Tether has integrated a "kill switch" in the token's code that can potentially be triggered at any point to block an address. This carries a certain risk for the overall market and the financial system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the cryptocurrency industry continues to expand and evolve, it remains to be seen to what extent USDT can achieve decentralization in its final state.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tradecurve aims to revolutionize the trading industry by offering a decentralized hybrid exchange.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve.io: Decentralized trading
<p>Tradecurve represents the next step in decentralized trading. By combining the worlds of decentralized and centralized exchanges, it provides access to thousands of financial instruments across multiple international markets. Users can leverage their cryptocurrency to trade commodities, stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, and more.</p>
<p>Tradecurve users enjoy complete anonymity without the need for KYC procedures, making trading accessible to everyone and facilitating easy onboarding to a wide range of markets and instruments. Tradecurve offers various advantages, such as AI-driven algorithmic trading, 500:1 leverage, a VIP account service for whales, copy trading, and a Metaverse Trading Academy, which provides all the necessary materials for self-education.</p>
<p>The TCRV token is currently priced at $0.018 in the 4th stage of the official presale, and analysts predict a 100x return when the presale ends.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>&lsquo;The Future is Now Film&rsquo; has been enlightening its audience over the past 5 years showcasing the amazing feats that blockchain technology has endured and overcome. Even in such a short time, it&rsquo;s now clear just how revolutionary cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have come out to be. Starting in the 1990&rsquo;s with the internet of information, slowly moving into the Internet of Things throughout the early 2010&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re now witnessing the era of the Internet of Value.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a concept that is not only unique, with everyone having access to a growing digital market, but also one that offers a fair chance to create and store money in ways never before seen. In many countries that didn&rsquo;t have access to a central banking system, let alone broadband due to corruption and other factors, we are now seeing communities prosper thanks to the introduction of crypto banking systems and blockchain technology integrated within their infrastructure.</p>
Africa and the Future of Crypto
<p>Probably one of the most prevalent examples of blockchain being successfully integrated into a region&rsquo;s infrastructure would relate to Sandi Bitenc &ndash;&nbsp;an individual at the forefront of change within Africa. Sandi is the founder of 3air, a telecom and blockchain company&nbsp; whose mission is to give access to the internet even to the most underserved communities. In Sierra Leone, 3air has already built two base stations capable of serving around 90% of the city, finally enabling access to broadband for thousands of people. 3air also provides the use of its cryptocurrency token as a means to pay and get paid for redistributing its unique broadband connectivity within its ecosystem, allowing people in Sierra Leone to embark further in crypto mass adoption.</p>
<p>Africa is the largest adopter of cryptocurrency, largely thanks to the underlying need for such a technology. Many banks throughout Africa simply didn&rsquo;t have the structure or resources to hold dollar reserves, the typical international currency for trade, meaning it was a useless tender when trading as most citizens just didn&rsquo;t have access to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearly all countries hold their reserves in foreign banks which are subject to laws out of their control. We have seen Africa torn apart for centuries with natural resources being drained, purposely being deprived of basic educational and technological needs which could have easily been shared, drastically improving the quality of life. Let's take a look at some of the innovators who are already injecting this technology into Africa and beyond.</p>
TheFutureIsNowFIlm &ndash; Queen Diambi
<p>Queen Diambi of the Bakwa Luntu tribe of Central Kasa&iuml; in the historic Kingdom of Luba (Congo) is making headlines with Africa and their adoption of cryptocurrency. She is travelling the world and spreading the word in the pursuit of making Africa great again. Queen Diambi is driven by the goal of bringing African technology and sciences to the level that they once were in the distant past, where the African nation was much more advanced than traditional history books would deem to say.</p>
<p></p>
TheFutureIsNowFilm &ndash;&nbsp;Revoland Game
<p>Already making waves in both the educational and financial sectors, Jimmy Zhao first introduced Revoland to Africa as a growing market. ChainXGame was responsible for teaching users in Ethiopia about gaming but under a Play-2-Earn model. This meant that individuals were able to earn crypto while playing and learning the fundamentals about GameFi as a future means for their economic well being, let&rsquo;s remember the Axie Infinity and the Philippines use case. Cultivating this kind of access for Africans is fundamental in moving into a fairer financial community where everyone can create value, together.</p>
<p>TheFutureIsNowFilm &ndash; Ikigai Ventures</p>
<p>Ikigai Ventures are all about supporting companies who can benefit all of us &ndash; companies who are striving for positive social change and a good ESG strategy. As Eman Pulis puts it, if you love what you do and it rewards you well, while being great for society, you have found your ikigai, a Japanese word that cannot be translated to English. Through AIBC Summit which also belongs to Eman, the man who once named himself &ldquo;Just an events guy&rdquo; to now a full fledged Web3 start up fund, has now created access to incredible deal flow in the industry.&nbsp;</p>
TheFutureIsNowFilm &ndash; Oz Living
<p>Devoted to financial freedom, Oz Living is providing services for individuals and their families to gain full control over their assets while also helping them reduce taxes. Their mission being a world where people live life on their own terms. The Oz eco-zone is currently being pioneered with the permission of the Philippines Government that is allowing Jin Gonzalez, the founder, to create a portable and tax-free zone for its citizens who wish to relocate, gain citizenship and experience living in the world of Oz.</p>
TheFutureIsNowFilm &ndash; Acta Finance
<p>Acta Finance ecosystem is looking to combine new and already existing centralised passive-earning principles and bring them on-chain. Christof Waton considers this really a great example of out with the old and in with the new as the company rewards their growing ecosystem creating a cross-platform and friendly community for all to experience the power of DeFi.&nbsp;</p>
Web3 Shareholders
<p>Web3 revolutionises the way we interact with the internet. Web2, the current incarnation of our internet, and its websites are typically controlled via a central entity meaning, the company that owns that site decides where one&rsquo;s data is stored, what they can actively do with your data while also taking responsibility for preventing data breaches and hacks. In Web3, every user is a shareholder building communities, not businesses. The Internet of Value works towards educating and rewarding those who wish to build the foundations for the new digital world.</p>
<p>People are tired of a broken system that shows failure every other decade as seen with the most recent USD inflation rates. Africa is by far the largest adopter of crypto and is a leading example of how to start implementing the use of blockchain technology into a countries ecosystem while Dubai is the world leader in education on the blockchain as well as a host to many prestigious events in the field focusing on the MENA region&rsquo;s development and beyond.</p>
AIBC Summit Eurasia
<p>The private screening and film premiere was held at AIBC Summit Eurasia in Dubai March 2023 at the Awards Gala Dinner organised by Eman Pulis and SiGMA Group. The film starred Queen Diambi of Congo, Nick Spanos from "Banking on Bitcoin'', Ivan on Tech, Eman Pulis from SiGMA &amp; Ikigai Ventures, Sandi Bitenc of 3air, Jin Gonzalez of Oz Living, Christof Waton of ACTA Finance, Jimmy Zhao of Revoland and even a cameo of Akon, the world renowned celebrity singer and artist who is also creating Web3 ripples in Africa with his Akoin Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gala Dinner and Awards show has become an industry staple since the inception of AIBC back in Malta 2018, then known as the Malta Blockchain Summit, bringing together professionals from all continents. The AIBC Gala in its 5 year history has awarded prominent decentralised futurists like Roger Ver, Brock Pierce &amp; Bobby Lee to name a few. Having #TheFutureisNowFilm premiere at this event in its 2023 reiteration marked The Future is Now DAO's full move and relocation to Dubai as well as a chance for the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me community of Web3 to get acquainted with this film series which has been covering Bitcoin's disruption across the world. As a matter of fact the 5th episode of TFINFILM, which is the film&rsquo;s Twitter handle, was the first AIBC Summit in 2018 established by Eman Pulis &amp; SiGMA Group, which back then was branded as the Malta Blockchain Summit and held in Portomaso, Malta. That episode features the late John McAfee, the founder of McAfee anti-virus and the scandalous yet powerful figure in the world of decentralisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Miguel Francis-Santiago, the film's creator &amp; host, also the Founder of TFIN DAO, confirmed that its time for the platform to go global and has secured a partnership with a 30 year VP of Distribution veteran from Hollywood who has led distribution in giants like Vivendi Universal, Paramount &amp; Hulu. Francis-Santiago believes this partnership is key to having 'The Future is Now Film' finally take on platforms like Netflix &amp; Amazon Prime.</p>
Final Thoughts
<p>It&rsquo;s time to get excited about Web3 and the blockchain. Users finally have the opportunity not just to build their own future but contribute to the future being built around them. This trend is becoming even more apparent as we begin to observe the social shift away from centralization and more into the world of a decentralised and equally balanced networks of value creation and knowledge.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Reaches 12-Month Peak:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 24 June 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) retained positive upward momentum early in the Asian session as the pair worked to consolidate gains above the psychologically-important 30000 figure after escalating to the 31443.67 area, its strongest print since June 2022.&nbsp; The rapid appreciation to its strongest level in twelve months represented a test of the 31488.23 area, an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Stops were also recently elected above the 30127.80 area during the ongoing appreciation, an upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent IMF post was extremely favourable towards countries in Latin America and the Caribbean using central bank digital currencies, while denigrating El Salvador&rsquo;s adoption of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The post by the International Monetary Fund suggested that Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries were making &ldquo;significant strides in the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
<p>It cited the four Latin American countries of Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Ecuador, as ranking among the top 20 countries in 2022 for adoption of crypto assets.</p>
<p>However, the IMF post chose to go along with the perceived disadvantages of these potential adoptions citing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;crypto asset adoption also presents numerous challenges and risks, particularly for vulnerable LAC countries with a history of macroeconomic instability, low institutional credibility, substantial capital flows, corruption, and extensive informal sectors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the subject of adoption, the IMF authors pointed out how the Dominican Republic and Argentina had prohibited the use of crypto assets, citing the concerns of &ldquo;financial stability, currency and asset substitution, tax evasion, corruption and money laundering&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was not mentioned that the IMF itself had obliged the Argentinian central bank to insert an anti-crypto clause in its agreement over a recent IMF bailout.</p>
<p>The IMF said that it had carried out a survey of government officials in the LAC region and half of them had replied that they were considering retail and wholesale CBDC options.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most survey participants viewed CBDCs as a means to enhance their payment systems and broaden their access. They deemed financial inclusion and monetary sovereignty as crucial factors in favor of retail CBDC issuance by facilitating the integration of unbanked individuals and curbing currency substitution towards stablecoins or crypto assets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the IMF admitted that CBDC takeup was &ldquo;slow&rdquo; for the ECCU and the Bahamas, and stated that it was for this reason that these countries must promote CBDC adoption and raise public awareness of them.</p>
Opinion
<p>The IMF has a profound belief in fiat currencies, and the dollar in particular. It has spent the last several decades of its existence providing loans to primarily third world countries, thereby enslaving them in yet more debt.</p>
<p>For such an organisation crypto assets are anathema, to be prohibited and repressed at any cost, despite acknowledging the obvious advantages that the crypto industry has brought to finance.</p>
<p>That El Salvador might be having success with its bitcoin adoption strategy must be making officials at the IMF wring their hands with worry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should the IMF be successful in urging some of these countries in the LAC region to adopt CBDCs then it can be expected that their citizens will be utterly controlled and enslaved.</p>
<p>Hopefully citizens will have the education to reject a CBDC, just as is the case in Nigeria, where only 0.5% of the population are using the eNaira as a transaction option, even in the face of cash shortages.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>MicroStrategy has turned a profit on its significant Bitcoin investment as the premier cryptocurrency soars the charts.&nbsp;</p>
MicroStrategy Turns A Profit
<p>With Bitcoin finally overcoming the $30,000 price tag hurdle, leading business intelligence firm and largest institutional BTC-holder, MicroStrategy, is finally turning a profit on its reserves. The company had gone all in on its audacious investment strategy, religiously allocating a portion of its capital to buy the dip and stock up its Bitcoin reserves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strategy seems to have paid off, with the cryptocurrency breaking through the $30,000 ceiling and staying consistently above it for the last several hours, at the time of writing. The price surge has helped MicroStrategy&rsquo;s funds and turned profitable.&nbsp;</p>
TradFi Renews BTC Interest
<p>The company has invested millions of dollars into its Bitcoin strategy across several installments made in a time when the market was exceptionally volatile and the crypto was barely breaking the $20k threshold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, recently there has been an increasing institutional interest in the crypto owing to the number of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from several major TradFi players like BlackRock Investments, WisdomTree, and Invesco. As a direct result, Bitcoin has seen a significant price increase as investors are hoping to have more investment options, should these BTC ETF applications be approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
The Big Spot BTC ETF Push
<p>Following a successful first quarter, Bitcoin briefly maintained its positive momentum in the second quarter. In mid-April, the leading cryptocurrency surpassed the $31,000 mark. However, it soon entered a correction phase, experiencing weeks of underwhelming performance amidst legal controversies. Bitcoin's rally reignited after BlackRock submitted its Bitcoin ETF application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just recently, crypto expert, Ki Young Ju pointed out that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, which amount to 140,000 BTC, were close to reaching the break-even point at $30,045. Today, when Bitcoin's price reached that level, the portfolio completely recovered from all its previous losses. Currently, with Bitcoin priced at $30,057, the company&rsquo;s holdings have continued their profitable run.&nbsp;</p>
Saylor&rsquo;s Conviction Wins Out
<p>The company's investment has placed it among the few publicly traded companies to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and has been instrumental in shaping the company's cryptocurrency investment strategy. He has repeatedly emphasized Bitcoin's potential as a long-term store of value and hedge against inflation and most recently claimed that the regulatory crackdown on altcoins, could result in Bitcoin&rsquo;s market dominance to reach 80% in the long term.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Was bitcoin&rsquo;s latest surge just a last fling before sinking lower, or does it have the legs to continue on upwards?</p>
Just a narrative pump?
<p>Some analysts and commentators would have us believe that there just isn&rsquo;t the market order flow for any sustained moves, and it must be said that volume is quite low, having been so since late March.</p>
<p>A short term relief rally to the upside?</p>
<p>Is everyone just FOMOing in because of all the new ETF filings which began with Blackrock&rsquo;s Spot Bitcoin ETF application of just a week ago and then the subsequent Fidelity, Wisdom Tree, Invesco, and Valkyrie filings, and then the Wall Street-backed EDX Markets?</p>
<p>This is likely the case. Bitcoin and crypto haven&rsquo;t had much to shout about for quite a while so the perceived positive news here does look to be responsible for the price action, and perhaps it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before the ETF narrative starts to die down.</p>
<p>Also, could it be that the traditional institutions are coordinating with the SEC with a view to taking down the crypto businesses before providing their own solutions taken from the crypto innovations?</p>
Bullish in the short term
<p>Be this as it may, at least in the short term, bitcoin is still looking strong. After briefly touching $30,800 bitcoin looks as though it is forming a bull flag, although another touch of the flag bottom is probably needed. The 4-hour Stochastic RSI has reset to the bottom and we should see a cross up soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum is behaving in a similar way, and looks to be breaking out of its own bull flag already. In relation to BTC, ETH has been rather a laggard though, and has been steadily forming lower highs and lows from all the way back to September of 2022.</p>
<p>A bottom could now have been found given that ETH is currently sitting at the 0.618 Fibonacci level against its BTC pair. Also, with the ongoing ETH staking narrative helping to drastically reduce the market supply, perhaps this is the time for Ethereum to start to shine.</p>
Many altcoins will die
<p>As for the rest of the crypto market it does rather look as though the altcoins as a whole are not going to do their usual thing and rise en masse. Instead, a small group of alts, with strong use cases and narratives might be the only ones to make the big moves.</p>
<p>Things are changing in crypto, and previous cycles where just about anything might rocket skywards on a given day is likely not to happen any more. In the coming times the wheat is going to be sorted from the chaff.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to trading firm QCP Capital, BlackRock&rsquo;s Bitcoin spot ETF is unlikely in the near term, thanks to SEC Chair Gary Gensler&rsquo;s attitude towards cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has taken an increasingly hostile stance against the crypto ecosystem under Gensler.&nbsp;</p>
BlackRock Spot ETF&rsquo;s SEC Headache&nbsp;
<p>There have been several applications for spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in recent times. However, all have been rejected by the regulator that is responsible for approving Exchange Traded Funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BlackRock, the world&rsquo;s largest asset manager, is the latest to apply for a Bitcoin spot ETF. While there is optimism that BlackRock&rsquo;s spot Bitcoin ETF application could be the first to get approval, an analysis by trading firm QCP Capital has dampened that optimism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to QCP Capital&rsquo;s assessment, a spot Bitcoin ETF, whether BlackRock&rsquo;s or any other, is not likely in the near future primarily due to Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and his harsh attitude toward cryptocurrencies. QCP added that while institutional involvement and interest in Bitcoin was bound to increase, the SEC&rsquo;s current makeup means that it is unlikely that spot ETFs would get the green light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BlackRock had filed its spot ETF earlier during the month, with a filing by the Nasdaq stock exchange revealing that Coinbase Custody Trust Company would be the custodian of the fund&rsquo;s Bitcoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon would be the custodian of the fund&rsquo;s fiat currency.&nbsp;</p>
A Hurdle Called Gensler&nbsp;
<p>The picture is further complicated by current Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has taken a hostile stance against cryptocurrencies in general. Under his leadership, the SEC has initiated several lawsuits against major cryptocurrency exchanges. These include Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Coinbase. QCP Capital, in its assessment, wrote,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, with Gensler as head of the SEC, we are not confident of the actual ETF approval happening in the near term. Nevertheless, as we&rsquo;ve continually maintained, there is a huge place for institutional BTC and ETH in the asset management world, and over the next months and years, we will see further steps in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>QCP Capital&rsquo;s observation is interesting, especially as it was highlighted that BlackRock had received just one rejection out of a total of 576 prior applications.&nbsp;</p>
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Rebounds&nbsp;
<p>As a result of the knock-on effects of the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF has reflected in Bitcoin&rsquo;s (BTC) price performance and beyond. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), having seen a considerable rebound after trading nearly 50% below BTC/USD, has continued to see an upswing as it makes up lost ground. According to data sourced from CoinGlass, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust&rsquo;s discount to BTC spot (discount to net asset value) reached its smallest level of 2023 at 33.45%. According to QCP, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has seen its sharpest recovery since late 2020.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance.US, Binance Holdings Limited, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao have accused the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of misleading the public through statements during its ongoing lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The allegation was made during a motion filed by lawyers representing Binance.US at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on the 21st of June.&nbsp;</p>
SEC Deliberately Misleading The Public&nbsp;
<p>According to the arguments filed by lawyers representing Binance.US, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s assertions made during a press release on the 17th of June were misleading, and appealed to the financial regulator to adhere to the &ldquo;applicable rules of conduct.&rdquo; In its press release, the SEC accused Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao of commingling customer assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given that Changpeng Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms&rsquo; customers&rsquo; assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please, as we have alleged, these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The motion filed alleges that the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s press release included statements that were unsupported by evidence and lacked substantiation. The lawsuit also stressed that the Securities and Exchange Commission presented no evidence to support its claims that Binance had commingled customer funds or diverted them as per its discretion. Binance representative stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The SEC has no evidence that BAM [Binance.US] customer assets have been dissipated, commingled or misused in any way.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also alleged that the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s press release was designed to introduce further unwarranted confusion into the crypto markets, having a detrimental impact on BAM customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SEC&rsquo;s press release seemed designed to introduce unwarranted confusion into the marketplace, which could have the effect of harming BAM customers rather than protecting them. It also risks tainting the jury pool with misleading descriptions of the evidence concerning the Defendants.&rdquo;</p>

Implications Of The Motion&nbsp;
<p>The motion filed against the SEC also stated that its press release risked prejudicing the jury pool by misleading descriptions of events related to the defendants in the case. Binance had also accused the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler of having a conflict of interest, alleging that Gensler had sought an informal advisory role with Binance before he was appointed as the SEC chair. According to Binance&rsquo;s lawyers, Gensler&rsquo;s previous connection with the exchange could influence his actions and decisions as the head of the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the federal judge approves, the motion could have significant consequences for the SEC. For starters, it could limit the regulatory body&rsquo;s ability to make public comments about the Binance lawsuit throughout the duration of the case, in particular, any comments that may impact court proceedings. To support their argument, Binance&rsquo;s legal team also included some excerpts from a hearing held on the 13th of June. During this hearing, the SEC counsel admitted that there was no proof yet that Binance.US assets were being channeled overseas. The motion filed by the defense lawyers is part of its defense strategy in response to a lawsuit filed against Binance by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the 5th of June.&nbsp;</p>
The Lawsuit Against Binance&nbsp;
<p>The lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Binance, Binance.US, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao accuses them of failing to register as an exchange or a broker-dealer clearing agency and offering customers unregistered securities. SEC Chair Gary Gensler also accused Binance of misleading its investors regarding their risk controls. Furthermore, the SEC also moved the court to freeze all assets belonging to Binance.US before reaching a compromise where only employees of the exchange could access client funds for the duration of the lawsuit.</p>

To support their argument, Binance&rsquo;s legal team also included some excerpts from a hearing held on the 13th of June. During this hearing, the SEC counsel admitted that there was no proof yet that Binance.US assets were being channeled overseas. The motion filed by the defense lawyers is part of its defense strategy in response to a lawsuit filed against Binance by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the 5th of June.&nbsp;</p>
The Lawsuit Against Binance&nbsp;
<p>The lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Binance, Binance.US, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao accuses them of failing to register as an exchange or a broker-dealer clearing agency and offering customers unregistered securities. SEC Chair Gary Gensler also accused Binance of misleading its investors regarding their risk controls. Furthermore, the SEC also moved the court to freeze all assets belonging to Binance.US before reaching a compromise where only employees of the exchange could access client funds for the duration of the lawsuit.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Regulations and lawsuits have become the bane of the crypto market&rsquo;s existence in the past few months. However, in a somewhat unexpected turn of events, this morning, we saw both Bitcoin (BTC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) surge in price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as both tokens&rsquo; prices continue to go up, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) join Tradecurve (TCRV) as the top three best cryptocurrencies to buy now. But TCRV leads the way with its never-before-seen utility and game-changing potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Bitcoin (BTC)&rsquo;s Unexpected Surge
<p>Before settling at its current price, Bitcoin (BTC) temporarily shot up to $138,000 Binance earlier today. However, this doesn&rsquo;t depict the real Bitcoin (BTC) price, as it was probably caused by a glitch and was gone in a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless, Bitcoin (BTC) holders were pleasantly surprised to see Bitcoin (BTC) surge this morning, increasing by almost $2,000 per Bitcoin (BTC) token compared to two days ago.</p>
<p>Now, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $28,972.09, an 8.16% increase in the past 24 hours. The Bitcoin (BTC) market cap and trading volume are also up by 8.19% and 80.65%, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is Recovering
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has become one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy again, as it managed to finally break out of its downward streak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This surge in price can be attributed to Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales, who recently moved 21 billion SHIB over to Binance. However, even though Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently on the come-up, you should keep in mind that maybe those billions of Shiba Inu (SHIB) have been moved to be sold later on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.000007367, a 2.41% increase since yesterday. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) market cap is also up by 2.51%, and the Shiba Inu (SHIB) trading volume is up by 41.53%.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) &ndash; The Most Promising and Profitable Project in 2023
<p>The best out of the three cryptocurrencies mentioned here is Tradecurve (TCRV). Why? Because Tradecurve brings a breath of fresh air into the market, giving access to something that has never been done before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve is a hybrid exchange platform that allows people to trade all kinds of assets and financial instruments from one account. Also, it has a borderless nature, meaning that it&rsquo;s accessible worldwide. In addition, it requires no KYC, allowing you to trade stocks, bonds, options, cryptocurrency, commodities, ETFs, and more anonymously.</p>
<p>All you&rsquo;d need to get started on Tradecurve is an email address and a crypto wallet. And once you use them to create an account, you&rsquo;ll be able to trade whenever you want, whatever you want, from wherever you are.</p>
<p>Tradecurve also brings some exciting benefits, including access to AI algorithmic trading, copy trading, 500:1 trading leverage, ultra-fast order execution, discounts on trading fees, a Metaverse trading academy, and much more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, TCRV, Tradecurve&rsquo;s token, is in Stage 4 of its public presale, trading at $0.018. Its price has already jumped, realizing returns for early holders even during the presale. And before the presale ends, experts believe that the token will bring in 50x returns, with an additional 100x on the horizon once it hits exchanges.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Energy Web will leverage Polkadot&rsquo;s interoperable multichain technology to bring decarbonization to Web3.</p>
<p>Energy Web, the world&rsquo;s largest ecosystem of companies using open source, decentralized technologies to accelerate the energy transition, is coming to Polkadot, the next-generation blockchain network powering the movement for a better web.</p>
<p>The move will allow Energy Web to create the framework for a new technology, dubbed &lsquo;Energy Web X&rsquo;, which will help its partners, including major players such as Shell, Vodafone, Volkswagen, and RMI - accelerate their decarbonization strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having developed digital solutions with dozens of major energy companies and non-profit organizations from over 25 countries, Energy Web is focused on two key areas:</p>
<p>Firstly, Energy Web wants to help electric utilities digitize and integrate distributed energy resources into the grid.</p>
<p>Secondly, Energy Web aims to bring deep transparency and verifiability to emerging green product supply chains &ndash; including 24/7 matched renewable electricity, sustainable aviation fuel, and sustainably produced Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web, commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Energy Web and our global enterprise partners are collectively on a mission to make clean energy an integral and widely-accessible part of the global electricity system. To achieve this important goal, we decided to search for a blockchain platform that offers real enterprise-grade security and seamless upgradeability to ensure a safe and future-proof environment.</p>
<p>Polkadot excels on both of these fronts with its shared security model and best-in-class core technology. We couldn&rsquo;t be more excited to build out the energy transition vertical on Polkadot.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Energy Web X will be based on worker node networks. Each of these is a decentralized group of computers jointly executing sensitive business processes that involve or impact multiple companies. Enterprises will be able to deploy thousands of independent worker nodes, coordinate them in cohesive networks, and allow the public to verify the results of their work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bj&ouml;rn Wagner, CEO of Parity Technologies, a leading contributor to the Polkadot network, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The energy transition vertical is a perfect use case to take advantage of the benefits of blockchain technology, and it&rsquo;s a space where Polkadot is well positioned to be a market leader. We&rsquo;re especially pleased to see Polkadot bring competitive advantages to initiatives and enterprises making a positive environmental and social impact.</p>
<p>In choosing to build a custom Polkadot parachain, Energy Web will get the performance and security its industry partners require and faster time to market and access to Polkadot&rsquo;s best-in-class interoperability. I&rsquo;m excited to partner with the Energy Web team to accelerate the transition to clean energy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Energy Web will launch a bid for a parachain slot on Polkadot to build a thriving ecosystem focused on the global energy transition. Further details about Energy Web X&rsquo;s plans will be revealed at Polkadot Decoded, the network&rsquo;s flagship summit, in Copenhagen, June 28-29.</p>
<p>Ana Trbovich, vice chair of the Energy Web Foundation, will also appear on a regulatory panel at the event.</p>
<p>The announcement comes soon after other big names from the music, gaming and accounting industries joined the Polkadot blockchain. The Energy Web X parachain will join the many other projects built on the Polkadot Relay Chain. By the end of Q1, 42 parachains had joined Polkadot, representing sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi), privacy, social media, sustainability, NFTs, gaming, and the metaverse. Many of these parachains are platforms in themselves, collectively hosting hundreds of Web3 applications.</p>
<p>Parachains help projects expand at scale by leveraging each other&rsquo;s strengths to unlock new use cases and enjoy the shared security advantages provided by Polkadot.</p>
About Energy Web
<p>Energy Web is a global non-profit on a mission to accelerate the transition to cleaner, more renewable energy sources by developing and deploying open-source Web3 technologies that help companies unlock business value from clean and distributed energy resources. It has partnerships with Shell, Engie, Elia Group, Singapore Power Group, and AEMO.</p>
About Polkadot
<p>Polkadot is a network that provides the technical advances necessary to make blockchain technology practical, accessible, scalable, interoperable and future-proof. It removes limitations and barriers to entry and fuels innovation, growing the decentralized technology space and bringing the Web3 vision to life.</p>
About Parity Technologies
<p>Parity Technologies has offices in Berlin, London and Lisbon, staffed by some of the world&rsquo;s leading blockchain innovators, core engineers, Rust developers, and solutions architects. It launched Polkadot in tandem with Web3 Foundation in May 2020 and continues to support and develop the network.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Peaks at 30800:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 23 June 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to moderate early in the Asian session as the pair gave back some recent strong gains following an appreciation to the 30800 level, its strongest print since mid-April. &nbsp;&nbsp;Stops were elected above the 30127.80 area during the ongoing appreciation, an upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31488, 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.Following recent upside price activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 29372, 29488, 27775, 27061, 26177, and 26044 areas.&nbsp; Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 28857.71 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29096.37.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The CUDOS Blockchain is excited to introduce CUDOS Markets, a tokenized RWA (real-world assets) marketplace for Hashrate NFTs, adding another major tool to the CUDOS ecosystem. The public sale of the first collection of limited-edition NFTs is taking place on June 22 on this unique platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CUDOS Markets builds upon the success of CUDO Compute and CUDO Miner, leveraging the company&rsquo;s expertise to create a marketplace for tokenized real-world assets, starting with sustainable Bitcoin (BTC) rewards. As outlined in CUDOS&rsquo; roadmap, collectible holders will gain access to Bitcoin rewards, future games that will allow them to win additional hashrate and future drops, including tokenized renewable energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>Unlike conventional Bitcoin acquisition, which raises concerns about sustainability and environmental impact, CUDOS Markets ensures that all BTC rewards are sourced exclusively from sustainable and 100% renewable energy sources. This pioneering approach ushers in a new era of responsible cryptocurrency acquisition, empowering individuals to make environmentally conscious choices while benefiting from digital assets.</p>
<p>Renowned artist Delux3, formerly a senior designer at Nike, crafted the Genesis collection artwork. Delux3&rsquo;s signature style of &ldquo;refined street art&rdquo; incorporates deep tonal layers and unexpected color combinations. As an established artist in the Solana art world, Delux3&rsquo;s visionary and abstract contributions to the new Hashrate Collection for CUDOS Markets promise to captivate collectors.</p>
<p>The Genesis Collection Public Sale will be offering the opportunity to purchase at a fixed price of $330. Buyers are in with a chance of winning one of the five tiers of hashrate NFTs, with the top tier consistently returning up to 170TH/s throughout a period of four years. Additionally, participants will have a chance to mint one of the three unique one-of-one collectibles concealed within the Genesis collection.</p>
<p>The Genesis Collectibles will be backed by Bitcoin hashrate derived solely from preapproved sustainable mining farms, starting with the first Genesis collection from Blockmole.</p>
<p>CEO and founder Matt Hawkins shared his thoughts on the latest Cudo Ventures product launch:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our new product, CUDOS Markets, is not just another NFT marketplace. It&rsquo;s a platform where people can make a positive impact on the world by buying and selling sustainable NFT collectibles that are real-world assets backed by our ecofriendly Bitcoin miners. With CUDOS Markets, we&rsquo;re excited to offer a unique opportunity to combine the power of blockchain with our commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. We believe this new offering will be a game-changer for the NFT industry and beyond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Genesis collection of revolutionary hashrate collectibles are now available for the public to buy on CUDOS Markets &mdash; visit the marketplace now to take part in the public sale.To learn more about CUDOS Markets in general and its future plans, visit the website.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a significant development in the blockchain ecosystem, Radius, a pioneering blockchain technology company, has successfully raised $1.7 million in a pre-seed funding round. The funding initiative was spearheaded by Hashed VC and also saw participation from a host of other investors, including Superscrypt, Lambdaclass, and Crypto.com.The groundbreaking work of Radius, focuses on Practical Verifiable Delay Encryption (PVDE) and Miner Extractable Value (MEV)-resistant ZK-Rollups, a Layer 2 solution. With these innovations, Radius aims to separate the tasks of sequencing and execution, thereby addressing the damaging effects of centralized sequencing where a single entity exercises control over the ordering of transactions in a block. Or in simple words, Radius is making the blockchain more efficient and secure, by preventing the unfair manipulation of transaction orders.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We&rsquo;re incredibly thrilled to announce our $1.7M pre-seed round led by @hashed_official, joined by @superscrypt, @class_lambda, and @Cryptocom_Cap.Radius brings a new paradigm for trustless shared sequencing, revolutionizing the way modular blockchains are built and operated. pic.twitter.com/3QIFHCZLER</p>
&mdash; R&aacute;dius | Trustless Shared Sequencer (@radius_xyz) June 22, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Essentially Radius's PVDE technology helps to protect the privacy of transactions by encrypting them. This makes it harder for anyone to manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage, a practice known as maximum extractable value (MEV).</p>

<p>"We are committed to setting the standard for a trustless shared sequencing layer that not only maximizes revenue for Rollups but also safeguards users from the harmful effects of MEV." said the founder of Radius, AJ Ji Hoon Park.</p>

<p>In addition to PVDE, Radius is also developing an MEV-resistant decentralized exchange named 360, aiming to shield users from front-running bots and sandwich attacks. While the launch date for 360 remains unconfirmed, Radius plans to release an early version of its sequencing layer solution early next year, marking another significant milestone in its journey to reshape blockchain technology.Radius has also announced a partnership with Saga, a Rollup-as-a-Service, and joined the Celestia Ecosystem. This collaboration aims to further advance rollup technology and enhance blockchain ecosystem security.</p>
<p>Radius plans to launch an alpha version of its sequencing layer in the first quarter of 2024, marking its commitment to the further development of blockchain technology.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Road Town, British Virgin Islands, June 22nd, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Labs, a renowned venture fund specializing in blockchain and cryptocurrency investments, is thrilled to announce its recent investment in Furion, a groundbreaking non-custodial and permissionless NFT utility platform. </p><p>Furion addresses a significant challenge in the NFT ecosystem, where non-fungible tokens often suffer from low utilization and limited liquidity. Furion enables the fractionalization of NFTs into corresponding ERC20 tokens. These tokens can be freely traded and farmed on the Furion platform, opening up a world of financial possibilities such as borrowing, lending, and long and short positions.</p><p>Other technical strengths of Furion's platform include the transformation of NFTs into fungible tokens through smart contracts. This enables collateralized lending between NFTs and mainstream ERC-20 tokens, leveraging peer-to-pool (P2P) operations and calculation logic. By adopting this approach, Furion significantly increases the capital utilization rate of collateral while reducing the risk exposure for lenders through the spread of collateral volatility.</p><p>Additionally, Furion's integration of an automated market maker (AMM) trading pool enhances liquidation efficiency, ensuring smooth and efficient trading experiences for users. Moreover, the platform enables short selling of NFTs, allowing users to borrow NFT assets by staking stablecoins, selling them at the current market price, and repurchasing them at a lower price to close their positions and make a profit if the NFT asset price falls.</p><p>The investment of crypto exchange LBank&rsquo;s venture fund in Furion comes at a time when the NFT market is undergoing rapid growth, with various NFT projects emerging. Recognizing the long-term potential and swift adoption of NFTs, LBank Labs is committed to supporting innovative solutions that contribute to the growth and maturation of the NFT market economy and infrastructure.</p><p>With $100 million in assets under management, LBank Labs brings financial resources and a global network to Furion. In return, Furion will provide value to Labs, leveraging their expertise and strategic insights for mutual growth. &ldquo;The dynamic and passionate team of Furion brings a wealth of experience and research in the NFT finance domain. Through our interactions with the Furion project team, we gained a deep understanding of the homogenized fragment NFT Pool solution, and how it sparks new possibilities in the NFT market&rdquo;, said Wilson, Investment Asian Lead at LBank Labs.</p><p>Furion aligns seamlessly with Labs' distinct investing thesis, the "Platform, Standard, Ecosystem" proposition. This novel strategy breaks away from the conventional divisions in the blockchain industry, transcending the traditional views of technology-centric paradigms or sector-based categorizations. Furion's NFT platform, characterized by its point-to-pool mortgage lending model and token fragmentation, perfectly embodies the platform aspect of Labs' thesis. Additionally, Furion has the potential to become an industry standard, fulfilling the fundamental component of Labs' investment proposition. Finally, Furion's robust ecosystem of companies, developers, and engaged user communities exemplifies the ecosystem element that Labs seeks in its investments. On the ecosystem level, Furion has already established a healthy ecosystem, including associated companies, developers, and user communities. Furion actively engages with the global NFT community and promptly adjusts its products based on valuable feedback from the community. With its unique positioning in the NFT financialization space, Furion emerges as an ideal investment for Labs, aligning with their visionary investment approach and defying traditional categorizations within the blockchain industry.</p><p>The venture fund also aims to strengthen its commitment by building a comprehensive network of Fund of Funds to enhance portfolio performance and diversification. LBank Labs operates in seven global regions, fostering collaboration and innovation across borders.</p><p>About LBank</p><p>LBank is one of the top crypto exchanges, established in 2015. It offers specialized financial derivatives, expert asset management services, and safe crypto trading to its users. The platform holds over 9 million users from more than 210 regions across the world.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A leading Web3 creative studio has created the first animated film funded by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) featuring non-fungible tokens (NFT).&nbsp;</p>
First Animated Film Funded By DAO
<p>In a groundbreaking move highlighting the growing influence of decentralized finance and blockchain technology, Atrium, a leading Web3 creative studio, has released the pilot episode of its highly anticipated animated series, "Nouns: A Movie."&nbsp;</p>
<p>What sets this project apart is that it was entirely funded by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), marking a significant milestone in the integration of blockchain and the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>In March, the NounsDAO community approved a proposal to provide funding for the film. The approval was followed soon by a team of talented Atrium creatives, including William Yu, HKJay, Zen Doubt, 3DPrint Guy, and Meta Ent, coming together to write, produce, and animate the film.</p>
<p>Notably, the entire movie production is being handled by a fully remote team, resulting in accelerated processes that would typically span several months and a much lower budget than required by traditional methods.&nbsp;</p>
First Episode Dropped
<p>The pilot episode of "Nouns" was made possible through a partnership between Atrium and Nouns DAO, a pioneering decentralized organization focused on promoting and supporting digital art initiatives. The collaboration aimed to explore new avenues for creativity and funding, leveraging the power of blockchain and the vibrant NFT ecosystem.</p>
<p>The episode features characters from the Nouns NFT collection and introduces viewers to a captivating world where our young protagonist, Noun, along with his motley crew, embarks on an adventure to thwart malevolent forces.&nbsp;</p>
NounsDAO Partnered With Atrium
<p>Atrium, renowned for its expertise in the Web3 space, provided the technical infrastructure and creative vision necessary to bring the "Nouns" pilot episode to life. The studio's commitment to pushing the boundaries of digital art and storytelling has resonated strongly with the blockchain community.</p>
<p>According to Supriyo Roy, the founder and CEO of Atrium, the open-source nature of the Nouns project provided the film's creators with complete freedom to develop a comprehensive world and storyline for the 8-bit characters without any constraints.</p>

<p>"There is no canon. Nouns are an infinite brand machine. There is no official top-down directive of how things should be done."</p>

A New Funding Model In Entertainment
<p>The funding model behind the "Nouns" movie pilot episode demonstrates the disruptive potential of DAOs in the entertainment industry. The project has a total budget of $2.75 million, given in installments provided the team meets its goals. Through a combination of community voting and decentralized decision-making, the Nouns DAO allocates resources and determines the direction of the movie's production.</p>
<p>As the Web3 ecosystem continues to evolve, it is clear that blockchain technology is reshaping the entertainment landscape. Through projects like "Nouns," the potential of decentralized finance and blockchain in revolutionizing traditional industries becomes increasingly apparent, promising a future where creativity and innovation are more accessible and collaborative than ever before.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s huge surge over the last two days has come to a halt at resistance. Is this just the calm before the real storm?</p>
Bitcoin has work still to be done
<p>The tsunami called Bitcoin is building momentum and there is a real possibility that a breakthrough of the $30,000 resistance is on the cards. Many traders will have their short stops just above this level and therefore a short squeeze could be likely.</p>
<p>Bitcoin really motored both Tuesday and Wednesday putting on as much as 14.6% in the process. Not a bad couple of day&rsquo;s work. However, the main task is still to be accomplished, and this is facing the king of the cryptocurrencies like Everest, for a trepidatious climber.</p>
The reality of the situation
<p>So much bad press has hit the crypto market over the last few months that for the market to be going up is pretty miraculous. That is until you think of the fundamentals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the one hand you have a pristine asset that is ridiculously scarce, more secure than any other asset, unreachable by government intervention, and able to be held, bought, and sent to anyone on the planet.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is fiat currency, being printed to oblivion, in an unfair system, and being weaponised against the people. On top of this government agencies are doing their level best to stop citizens buying cryptocurrencies by bringing enforcement actions against all and sundry in the crypto sector.</p>
Banking is obsolete
<p>The banks that help to control the currency provide almost no interest to depositors, probably minus value when inflation is taken into account, and they control their customers by enforcing who they can send their currency to.</p>
<p>Banking is utterly obsolete and it has taken the wildly innovative crypto sector to bust this banking facade wide open. These monoliths of antiquity are no longer fit for purpose. People can now hold their own value and wealth so there is no need for a middleman. Therefore the banks&rsquo; days are numbered.</p>
Bitcoin is for the people
<p>Bitcoin is likely to keep rising given its pure fundamentals, providing a store of value in the face of the rapidly diminishing purchasing power of fiat currencies like the dollar. The regulatory agencies might stop the majority of the institutions from getting onboard, but it needs to be remembered that Bitcoin is for the people. There is still time.</p>
