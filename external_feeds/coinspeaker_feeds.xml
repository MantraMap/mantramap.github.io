<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-suspension-journalists-banned/">Twitter Suspension: Journalists Join Growing List of Banned Names</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> accounts of many prominent journalists have now been placed on suspension without any specific explanation from the social networking service company. This came after the ban of an open-source social media alternative Mastodon. Before the suspension, the account linked to the Mastodon page (@ElonJet) had posted a link to the jet tracking account on its own service. The account belongs to Florida student Jack Sweeny and tracks the private jet that belongs to Twitter CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a>. Sweeny’s personal account was also suspended from Twitter, including many bots.</p>
<p>Not long after the post, many links to the open-source social media were no longer active, with Twitter tagging them as “potentially harmful.”</p>
<p>Mastodon has gained significant momentum since Musk took over Twitter, and a lot of Twitter users added the profile link to their bios. The social media service provider has disabled all links to blocked Mastodon servers and tagged them with, “Warning: this link may be unsafe.”</p>
<h2>Twitter Places Popular Journalists on Suspension</h2>
<p>Some of the journalists on suspension from Twitter had shared observations or screenshots about the social media’s action against Mastodon. The victims include The New York Times’ Ryan Mac, Mashable’s Matt Binder, MSNBC host Keith Olbermann, Washington Post’s Drew Harwell, Journalist Aaron Rupar, and CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan. Many impacted journalists who joined the growing list of prominent people on suspension from Twitter had covered stories on Musk taking over the bluebird app. Rupar <a href="https://aaronrupar.substack.com/p/aaron-rupar-twitter-suspension-atrupar?r=83wda&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took to Substack</a> to release a public notice on his permanently suspended Twitter account. He posted a screenshot of the message he got from Twitter regarding the suspension:</p>
<blockquote><p>“After careful review, we determined your account broke the Twitter Rules. Your account is permanently in read-only mode, which means you can’t Twitter, Retweet, or Like content. You won’t be able to create new accounts. If you think we got this wrong, you can submit an appeal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The independent journalist confirmed that he had posted a tweet about ElonJet the previous day. He said he wrote about Twitter suspending ElonJet’s account and provided a link to his Facebook page, where he is still active. Rupar stated that his posts on ElonJet could be the reason for the suspension, but he is still unaware of “what policy that could’ve possibly violated.”</p>
<p>Other journalists, including The New York Times’ Ryan Mac, spoke about the Twitter suspension, noting that there was no warning from the company. Mac said through an alternative account that there was no communication from the company on the matter. He also added that he reports on Twitter, Musk, and his companies and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Musk, who earlier said the journalists suspension from Twitter is permanent, has tweeted a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603600001057185792" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">poll</a> that invites followers to decide the fate of the accounts. The poll options include whether to unsuspend the accounts “now,” “tomorrow,” “7 days from now,” and “longer.”</p>

<p>Binance recently explained to delisted project Mithril that a clause in their contract entitles it to Mithril’s initial insurance deposit.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-mithril-bnb-insurance/">Binance Replies Delisted Mithril Request for BNB Insurance Sum Refund, Claims Entitlement to Partial or Whole Sum</a></p>
<p>Recently delisted <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> social network project Mithril (MITH) has asked the exchange to refund its initial insurance deposit. Mithril said it deposited 200,000 Binance Coins (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/binance-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BNB</a>) as insurance for listing on Binance and now wants them back. However, the exchange’s outspoken CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a> recently came out to address those claims and provide more clarity regarding the listing terms.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1603649325300453376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1603649563058876417%7Ctwgr%5E53dd7fee1971296697aff1ece4b1ccbd314b8fd0%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbnb-insurance-binance-listing-cz-addresses-delisted-project-s-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing a screenshot</a> of Binance’s contract with Mithril on Twitter, Zhao explained that the exchange has the right to deduct the insurance fund. According to the Binance CEO, the deductible amount could be a partial sum or 100% of the insurance fund as an additional fee. Zhao further explained that the clause is exercisable if MITH’s listed token price falls below a certain threshold. Zhao’s Twitter message, which accompanied his screenshot post, read:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I reviewed this after seeing your post. Here is the contract clause for your (and community) reference. We usually observe confidentiality, until you broke it. The Insurance Deposit is there to encourage builders to continue to build.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, the Binance CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1603649563058876417" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">continued</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your token price is way below the trigger levels. Reading the comments. Your website is offline. You haven’t tweeted or updated your community for almost 2 years. I believe our team has made the right decision and acted fully within our right to do so. Regards.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Zhao’s response tweets came today.</p>
<h2>Crypto Community Weighs in on Binance Twitter Exchange with Delisted Mithril</h2>
<p>Zhao’s Twitter exchange with Mithril did not go unnoticed by the larger Twitter community. Some observers pointed out that the delisted crypto project was essentially non-existent while on Binance. These observers also viewed the listing insurance fee of 200K BNB ($2 million) as a small price for Mithril to pay for its inactivity. The ‘listing sum’ at the time of the deposit favorably compares to the crypto project’s current market value of $53 million.</p>
<p>However, the other spectrum of the crypto community questioned Binance’s commercially-driven approach regarding the initial listing. These observers did not think it was fair for the prominent exchange to demand security insurance in BNB from projects looking to list on the exchange. Furthermore, one Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Mangyek0/status/1603671516901965824?s=20&amp;t=yhU9fQeE36X15GUC9O7JVQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user</a> questioned Binance’s focus on price for delisting. According to this observer, such a focus might compel projects to artificially inflate the price every time it dips below the “trigger price.”</p>
<p>The user further stated that market conditions sometimes push token value lower. However, the issue of artificially pumping the price when this happens suggests a manipulated and disingenuous environment.</p>
<p>As of press time, Binance was yet to address any of these observer concerns regarding the delisted Mithril.</p>
<h2>Binance Proof-of-Reserve Audit Stokes Concerns</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Binance’s proof-of-reserve audit has been the subject of numerous discussions in the financial space. Several financial experts recently voiced <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-s-proof-of-reserves-raises-red-flags-report" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">concerns over the company’s released audit.</a> However, crypto analytic firm CryptoQuant recently attempted to demystify the skepticism by stating that Binance’s reserve on-chain data does not resemble <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier, FTX made a number of targeted acquisitions that established it as a market leader in the digital currency ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-sell-4-subsidiaries/">FTX Files Request to Sell 4 of Its Solvent Subsidiaries</a></p>
<p>Bankrupt digital currency trading and derivatives platform, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> has filed a request with the Bankruptcy Court of Delaware to permit the bidding process for four of its solvent and independently operating subsidiaries. According to the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.233.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court filing</a>, the beleaguered company hopes to offload Embed Technologies, LedgerX LLC, FTX Japan, and FTX Europe over the next two months.</p>
<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy in early November after facing an excruciating liquidity crunch that pushed it to halt withdrawals. The filing for bankruptcy impacted all of its 100 subsidiaries including FTX US and Alameda Research. One of the first claims made by John Ray III after he was named the new Chief Executive Officer of the firm post-bankruptcy was that it was not all of the exchange’s subsidiaries that were distressed.</p>
<p>Up until now, FTX said it has been receiving a number of unsolicited bids from interested firms that will like to buy up the named entities. The company revealed in the filing that if permission was not given by the court to sell off these entities, their valuations may be impacted dramatically following the suspension of operations.</p>
<p>“The licenses held by FTX Europe have been suspended, and FTX Japan is subjected to suspension,” read the motion. “The longer operations are suspended, the greater the risk to the value of assets and the risk of permanent revocation of licenses.”</p>
<p>The funds realized from these sales will be deployed toward compensating its creditors which FTX claims it is owing billions of dollars.</p>
<h2>Independent Operations Stirred Healthy Balance Sheets</h2>
<p>While at its peak, FTX Derivatives Exchange made a number of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-us-acquisition-ledgerx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted acquisitions</a> that established it as a market leader in the digital currency ecosystem. Some of these acquisitions come with an agreement of independent operations, a clause that has helped all of these subsidiaries to be shielded from the liquidity challenges of the parent company.</p>
<p>Embed Technologies operates a clearing and custody service for financial services providers as well as broker-dealers. Embed Technologies is regulated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a FINRA-registered broker-dealer.</p>
<p>One of the subsidiaries, LedgerX is regulated by the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) and it offers a derivatives exchange platform for clients in the US. FTX Japan Holdings also operates independently and in itself, it has two other functional subsidiaries including FTX Japan and FTX Singapore.</p>
<p>According to the filing, the company is interested in selling either FTX Japan Holdings as a whole or 100% of the constituent subsidiaries.</p>
<p>“FTX is soliciting bids for a sale of 100% interest in FTX Japan Holdings or separate sales of 100% interest in FTX Japan and FTX Singapore,” it said.</p>
<p>The filing revealed different proposed bidding dates for each of these companies including January 18 for Embed Technologies, Jan 25 for LedgerX, and February 1 for FTX Europe, the exchange’s equity derivatives platform with its base in Switzerland.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/origin-yield-earnings-ousd/">Origin Launches Yield Earnings for OUSD Stablecoin Holders</a></p>
<p>Origin Protocol, a Web 3.0 infrastructure and innovative products developer, has <a href="https://newsdirect.com/news/origin-dollar-ousd-v2-launch-to-attract-users-burnt-by-ftx-blockfi-and-voyager-with-safer-alternative-947469110" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> the launch of Origin Dollar (OUSD) V2 as it looks to build on its one-of-a-kind yield-bearing stablecoin products for all. The OUSD V2 protocol introduces a number of new enhancements for the OUSD offering in that it lets all holders of the stablecoin earn competitive yields on their tokens right from inside their wallets.</p>
<p>With the onslaught faced by the broader crypto ecosystem this year as was compounded by the collapse of centralized digital currency service providers, the trust in the industry has undoubtedly been broken. The launch of the OUSD V2 engine is Origin Protocol’s attempt to help salvage the situation by giving users yields on their stablecoins without having to stake or commit them for a period of time as is required on yield-bearing platforms.</p>
<p>The OUSD interest allocation was further made possible with the implementation of new Convex and Morpho strategies for OUSD V2. At this time, Origin Protocol, through the OUSD V2 now offers the highest yields in the DeFi ecosystem when the earnings are adjusted on their susceptibility to risks.</p>
<p>“Origin has been building OUSD with a security-first philosophy for years. For a long time, the yield on OUSD was in line with what’s found on USDC and DAI, and it’s incredibly exciting to see the improvements made to the protocol this month. Over the last 30 days, OUSD has earned holders over 6% APY. That’s over twice the rate of the prior month with no additional risk, thanks to OUSD V2,” said Josh Fraser, co-founder at Origin Protocol.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the OUSD V2 offering is that the tokens are not locked up and the earnings are not subjected to any form of fees.</p>
<h2>Origin Protocol Rebuilding Trust Through OUSD V2</h2>
<p>There is no doubt in the fact that many market makers are weary of doing business in the industry as there is no idea which protocol to trust with funds or not. While the misappropriation of funds is possible with centralized outfits whether, in the crypto space or traditional finance, exploits through hacks are also very common.</p>
<p>In order to wade off this threat, the OUSD V2 protocol has been audited by OpenZeppelin, the security outfit that is responsible for the audit of some of the most prominent crypto projects including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN), Ethereum Foundation, and Aave. All necessary audits have been passed and the reports are published for unbiased verification.</p>
<p>Per the model of the OUSD V2 in that it does not require any active management, it comes off as the best avenue for new users to get involved in the DeFi and broader crypto world.</p>
<p>&#8220;OUSD empowers individuals to own their crypto, which has been brought into the limelight in 2022. And for new users, OUSD is the perfect way to dip one’s feet into DeFi. There’s no need for active management, and yield is passively earned and deposited to one’s web3 wallet daily,” said Andra Nicolau Head of BD, OUSD.</p>
<p>The rewards being dished out by OUSD V2 are based on the implementation of two new strategies for yield generation using the Convex protocol.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-miner-core-scientific-stock-surge/">Crypto Miner Core Scientific Sees Stock Surge 200% on Creditor Offer to Fund Insolvency</a></p>
<p>Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) recently experienced a 200% stock surge over the past four days. The digital asset minting facilitator and blockchain infrastructure provider has endured difficult times throughout 2022. As the current crypto winter prevails, Core Scientific has seen positive reception from a current creditor regarding a recent financing proposal. Should this deal sail through successfully, the miner might avoid bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Core Scientific stock jumped from 13 cents on December 12th before the surge, to nearly 40 cents upon market close on December 16th. This remarkable climb in such a short time represents a gain of 198%.</p>
<p>Financial media firm Marketbeat reported that traders acquired 6,572 call options yesterday, which represents 136% more than the 2,780 average volume. In addition, the development indicates an overwhelming bullishness on CORZ and a belief that the stock will keep rising.</p>
<p>As evidenced on <a href="https://twitter.com/CashRocket/status/1603138966789971968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1603138966789971968%7Ctwgr%5E751da882a955da76eb162f29426804e9b8e03e3e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fstock-price-for-troubled-bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-surges-200" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>, some members of the Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) community also acquired shares in anticipation of a massive return. However, whether or not the Core Scientific rally marks the beginning of a turnaround or a further price plummet is currently unknown. Despite recent gains, Core Scientific stock is at a 95% drawdown year-to-date.</p>
<h2>B.Riley Offers Rescue Plan to Core Scientific</h2>
<p>Financial services platform B. Riley (NASDAQ: RILY) recently issued a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/b-riley-financial-issues-open-letter-to-core-scientific-investors-301703337.html?enowpopup&amp;enowparentmodules=opsconsole-csm,usage-tracking-csm%2Cdata-api-proxy-csm#financial-modal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a> outlining a $72 million financing plan to Core Scientific&#8217;s shareholders and lenders. According to the plan, which B.Riley opines is sufficient enough to save Core Scientific from bankruptcy, stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;B. Riley has proposed to Core Scientific&#8217;s Board of Directors that it would provide $72 million in new, non-cash pay financing on favorable terms, providing more than two years of runway for the Company to achieve profitability. This is a far superior approach for all constituents, one that would avoid bankruptcy while preserving meaningful value for all of Core Scientific&#8217;s stakeholders.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Further detailing the cornerstones of the rescue plan in the letter, B.Riley also explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our proposal is simple. It provides sufficient liquidity to avoid bankruptcy. B. Riley&#8217;s proposal does not purport to haircut amounts owed to the Company&#8217;s equipment lenders. B. Riley is prepared to fund the first $40 million of financing immediately, with zero contingencies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>B.Riley analyst Lucas Pipes, who has been following Core Scientific since February this year, provided findings and forecasts. According to Pipes, the embattled Bitcoin miner could generate annual earnings topping $165 million at a BTC price of $18K. In addition, the B.Riley analyst also said that Core Scientific could further pull in an extra $20 million on every $1,000 price increase.</p>
<p>B.Riley concluded its letter by imploring Core Scientific&#8217;s board of directors to accept its offer to help promptly. According to the capital market company, this gesture would achieve a resolution that benefits all Core Scientific stakeholders involved.</p>
<h2>Core Scientific Stock Surge Comes after Company Threatened to Default on Loans</h2>
<p>Before the B.Riley development and subsequent stock surge, Core Scientific had threatened to default on some of its debts due to several factors. In addition to a contracting crypto marketplace, other factors were high energy rates and a likely loan default from Celsius. The crypto lender <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/celsius-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy back in July.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ceo-silvergate-class-action-lawsuit/">CEO of Silvergate Bank Faces Class Action Lawsuit Over Dealing with FTX and Alameda</a></p>
<p>The contagion of FTX collapse has spread all across the crypto market with several other firms getting impacted in the process. Alan Lane, the CEO of Silvergate Bank, is now facing a class-action lawsuit at the California Southern District Court amid the bank&#8217;s business dealing with embattled crypto firms <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> and Alameda Research.</p>
<h2>Silvergate Bank CEO and New Class Action Lawsuit</h2>
<p>The lawsuit holds Silvergate Bank responsible for placing FTX user deposits into the bank accounts of Alameda Research. This transfer of customer funds at FTX was one of the major reasons behind the collapse of the crypto exchange. Eventually, both Alameda and FTX had to declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Plaintiff Joewy Gonzalez has filed the lawsuit on behalf of himself and others who were in the same situation. In the lawsuit, the plaintiff notes that he had invested in cryptocurrencies via the FTX exchange since the platform promised investors that they were able to &#8220;store assets securely as they gained in value, cash them out or trade them for other assets&#8221;.</p>
<p>The lawsuit blames Silvergate Bank for aiding FTX&#8217;s fraudulent activities via improper transfers, lending user funds and comingling funds. It also accuses Silvergate Bank of breaching its fiduciary duty. The lawsuit notes that Silvergate is liable for its role in “furthering FTX’s investment fraud”. It also notes that Silvergate has the obligation to return what they owe to the plaintiff and other investors. Girard Sharp and Hartley LLP shall be representing the plaintiffs in the case.</p>
<h2>US Senators Question Silvergate Bank</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, US senators also wrote a letter to Silvergate Bank demanding answers for their role in the loss of billions of dollars with the FTX collapse. Senator John Kennedy, Elizabeth Warren, and Roger Marshall had asked Alex Lane to provide details of Silvergate Bank&#8217;s business dealing with FTX. The letter from the senators wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your bank’s involvement in the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda reveals what appears to be an egregious failure of your bank’s responsibility to monitor for and report suspicious financial activity carried out by its clients”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Senator Warren further <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/elizabeth-warren-ftx-silvergate-bank-crypto-rcna60147" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a> that “Silvergate appears to be at the center of the improper transfer of billions in FTX customer funds. Americans need answers. Those guilty of wrongdoing must be held accountable”.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blocknative-15m-series-a-1-funding/">Blocknative Completes $15 Million Series A-1 Funding for Block Building on Ethereum</a></p>
<p>Web2 infrastructure company Blocknative <a href="https://www.blocknative.com/blog/blocknative-raises-15m-for-block-building" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">has secured</a> $15 million in a Series A-1 round for the block-building market in the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in 2018, the company focuses on transaction processing on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> blockchain. And it plans to use the latest funding to grow its product teams and pursue block-building opportunities. Back in June 2021, Blocknative had a part of its Series A investments, featuring Foundry Group, Robot Ventures, and more. At the time, the company generated $12 million, signaling investors&#8217; confidence in its mempool surveillance tools.</p>
<h2>Blocknative Secures $15M Series A-1 Financing Round</h2>
<p>There were different contributors to the Blocknative Series A-1 funding round, which was led by Foundry Group, and Blockchain Capital. Others are Fenbushi Capital, Industry Ventures, Rho, Robot Ventures, IOSG Ventures, HackVC, and more. Since its inception about four years ago, Blocknative has managed to become one of the biggest block builders on Ethereum. These block builders are third-party providers that determine the transactions that go on the blocks. The third-party providers are also in charge of determining the order in which these transactions are included in blocks. Since <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/merge-ethereum-proof-of-stake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Merge</a>, when Ethereum transited from the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake, Blocknative’s relay and block builders have onboarded over 17,000 blocks to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>CEO Matt Cutler stated that the company offers several capabilities and APIs that allow traders and builders to take control of their Web3 transaction lifecycle. He added that the capabilities are highly relevant to the new domain of block building. Speaking on the new Series A-1 financing round, Cutler said Blocknative can now pursue the block-building opportunity. He added that the fund will also help the company “drive equitable value recirculation throughout the entire Web3 transaction supply chain.” He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As the world increasingly moves on-chain, Blocknative remains committed to contributing meaningfully to the Web3 ecosystem through real-time access to pre-chain data, increased transaction transparency, and webscale infrastructure availability at each and every block.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides the relay and block building, Blocknative provides other solutions such as Mempool Explorer, Gas Estimation, Transaction Preview, Web3 Onboard, and Transaction Distribution. Network. Recently, the Web3 infrastructure company started to accept transaction bundles from MEV searchers. The CEO said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As the world increasingly moves on-chain Blocknative remains committed to contributing meaningfully to the web3 ecosystem through real-time access to pre-chain data, increased transaction transparency, and web-scale infrastructure availability at each and every block.”</p></blockquote>
<p>When Blocknative completed the other part of the Series A investment in 2021, the CEO revealed plans to expand the team. He said the goal is to grow the 20-person staff to 40 by year-end. According to the chief executive, the new employees would be in marketing, customer support, and sales, as well as development sections.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/web3-talent-web2/">Web3 Is Attracting Some Major Talent from Web2</a></p>
<p>Just as technology companies need to keep evolving or die, the same holds true for many of the industry’s employees.</p>
<p>While the world’s biggest technology giants have grown accustomed to raking in billions of dollars in advertising dollars and subscription fees, that business is no longer the exciting growth opportunity that it once was. These days, emerging technologies focused on blockchain and Web3 are displaying much higher growth potential, and some of the most experienced individuals in the tech industry have taken notice.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_daily_active_addresses" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">latest figures</a> from YCharts show that the number of daily active addresses on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> blockchain has risen from 200,000 in January 2020 to more than 559,000 today. That represents an increase of around 65%, which is impressive growth by the standards of any emerging industry. It’s a strong data point that suggests a growing number of people are participating in the emerging Web3 economy, which represents the idea of a newer, decentralized internet that enables users to take back control of their identities and data.</p>
<p>We should note that Web3 is a pretty vague term that has not been adequately defined, but it’s one that represents the much broader blockchain industry. Essentially, it can be thought of as a term that conceptualizes crypto development across multiple blockchains, in areas such as <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>, the metaverse and Web3 gaming.</p>
<h2>Web3 Taps In Top Talent</h2>
<p>However you define Web3, there can be no doubt that it is proving to be an extremely attractive space for a whole host of exciting talent in the technology industry.</p>
<p>It’s a trend that may well have begun with the so-called “creator economy”, which encouraged more entrepreneurially-minded people to seek opportunities to express themselves. The creator economy has encouraged numerous social media influencers and freelancers to go it alone, and the decentralized nature of the Web3 economy ensures that it has a similar appeal.</p>
<p>As a result, there has been an influx of top tech talent into the Web3 space. Earlier this year, Electric Capital <a href="https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d">reported</a> seeing a 100% increase in developers collaborating on GitHub repositories associated with crypto and blockchain projects.</p>
<p>But it’s not only developers, as executives are ditching the world of legacy tech to embrace the potential of Web3. Over the last couple of years, a number of high-profile execs from companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have quit their jobs at those companies to take on the challenge of leading ambitious projects in the Web3 industry.</p>
<p>Blockchain-based projects like Circle and Polygon are just some of the startups that have pulled off impressive hiring coups, snapping up executives from the world of big tech. Earlier this year, for example, ex-Google executive Ryan Wyatt left his cushy job as Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Gaming at YouTube to take over the CEO&#8217;s chair at Polygon, a platform for scaling and building decentralized blockchain apps on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Similarly, Sherice Torres recently jumped ship from Facebook, where she held the role of chief marketing officer for its crypto and payments unit, Novi. That experience made her ideal for a leadership role <a href="https://www.circle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Circle</a>, a global internet finance firm that’s building crypto payments infrastructure for businesses of all sizes.</p>
<p>Another big name to make the move into the crypto space is former Amazon cloud executive Pravjit Tiwana, who left in January 2022 to become the chief product officer of the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.gemini.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Gemini</a>.</p>
<p>Some crypto startups can even say that nearly their entire leadership team is made up of talents that boast significant expertise in the industries they’re looking to disrupt. Nowhere is this more evident than in gaming.</p>
<p>Web3 gaming developer <a href="https://www.n3twork.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">N3twork Studios</a>, founded in the wake of its predecessor N3twork Inc.’s <a href="https://venturebeat.com/mobile/forte-acquires-n3tworks-platform-to-grow-blockchain-games/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">acquisition</a> by Forte, is an example. Its President, Matt Ricchetti, previously served at PerBlue Entertainment, Kabam and Zynga, and others before taking on his current role. Julius Hong, N3twork Studio’s executive producer, lists EA, Glu Mobile and KIXEYE on his resume. Meanwhile, the Founder of N3twork, and now CEO of Games Industry at Forte, Neil Young, boasts more than 25 years of experience in the gaming development industry.</p>
<p>Another promising Web3 startup led by industry veterans is <a href="http://info@taki.app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Taki</a>, which bills itself as an “engage-to-earn” social media platform that rewards users for their participation. Taki was co-founded by Sakina Arsiwala, who previously held product and growth leadership roles at Nextdoor and YouTube. Arsiwala is actually credited as being one of the main persons responsible for taking YouTube international, launching it in 22 countries including India. In addition, she has also served as a product lead for Google Search. Taki’s other co-founder, Kevin Chou, was one of the co-founders of Forte. Chou also co-founded and exited the gaming company Kabam.</p>
<p>It’s becoming clear that the buzz around Web3 is attracting some of the brightest minds in the Web2 industry. While these individuals have differing motivations, it&#8217;s likely that most, if not all, are all attracted by the promise of Web3 to revolutionize the internet in a wholly positive way. It’s one of the most exciting and innovative areas of development in the technology space, in the same way that companies like Google and Facebook were once at the forefront of innovation. So it’s no real surprise that some of tech’s most creative minds are scoping it out.</p>
<h2>A Lucrative Move</h2>
<p>That said, it’s not just the revolutionary potential of Web3 that’s proving to be attractive. Equally, it’s a space that’s becoming flush with cash, meaning it has the money to bring its ideas to fruition and reward the ones who lead it there. According to data from Blind, which is a social network for technology professionals, the blockchain and Web3 industry currently offers some of the <a href="https://www.teamblind.com/blog/index.php/2022/01/26/crypto-salary-bitcoin-coinbase-startup-pay/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">most lucrative salaries</a> around. Coinbase, for example, was offering up to $900,000 a year in compensation for some software engineering positions.</p>
<p>At a time when many traditional technology firms are announcing wave after wave of layoffs, venture capitalists continue to throw big money bets at the Web3 industry. Last year, blockchain startups <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/crypto-start-ups-raised-huge-venture-funding-rounds-in-january.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">received over $25 billion</a> in venture capital funding, according to data from CB Insights.</p>
<p>Web3 firms are not only offering big salaries though but also a chance to own a piece of their destiny in the shape of their native tokens. Whereas traditional tech firms provide stock options, crypto-native startups can tempt new hires with newly-minted cryptocurrency tokens whose value could go sky-high during the next crypto bull run.</p>
<p>It all translates to some very lucrative rewards for even the most experienced technology industry talents.</p>
<h2>The Future Looks Bright</h2>
<p>There are lots of reasons to believe in the future of a decentralized internet. The promise of taking back control of your data holds a lot of allure for people all over the world. Web3 could also prove to be a richly rewarding experience for users, too. Platforms like Taki provide daily cryptocurrency rewards for users who perform certain tasks and actions in its app each day. It’s a complete reversal of the traditional, ad-revenue-based business model that only sees users as a source of revenue.</p>
<p>Web3 isn’t without its critics. Some of the biggest names from Web2 have questioned its future. Its critics include Twitter founder <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jack-dorsey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Dorsey</a>, who once claimed that although it pretends to be decentralized, it’s actually <a href="https://coinfomania.com/jack-dorsey-says-web3-is-centralized/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">just as centralized</a> as the original internet, controlled by a handful of venture capital firms. In addition, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has accused Web3 of being more of a buzzword than anything else.</p>
<p>That said, it’s also true that many of the hottest new ideas in the tech industry have their skeptics. When cloud computing first emerged as a thing, it was widely derided by the database giant Oracle, which insisted that the trend was inconsequential and would never catch on. Today, of course, the cloud computing industry is one of the biggest and fastest-growing in tech, generating <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more than $368.97 billion in revenue</a> in 2021 alone, according to research from Grand View Research. Moreover, Oracle itself has long since embraced the cloud, investing billions of dollars to build up its own infrastructure in the space.</p>
<p>The Web3 movement is still in its infancy, but many of the tech industry’s brightest minds are happily embracing the challenge of leading its most promising startups. As that trend continues to gather pace, we can expect to see better experiences and more blockbuster games and social apps emerge, and with that much of the criticism around Web3 will subside.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roblox Corp</a> (NYSE: RBLX) saw its shares fall by more than 15% on Thursday’s close, following a disappointing <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2022/Roblox-Reports-November-2022-Key-Metrics/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">November update</a>. The company’s November business update, which showed slowing growth, suffered a negative impact from the strong effects of the US dollar. According to reports, Roblox’s booking growth, or revenue, declined 4-5% year-over-year (YoY), with bookings per daily active user also falling 9% from last year.</p>
<h2>Roblox Shares Down 73% Year-to-Date amid November Update</h2>
<p>The Roblox shares November update comes amid a broader slump within the video game space. In addition, shares of the online game platform are currently down a massive 73% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Roblox reported its estimated bookings for November as between $222 million and $225 million. Although this figure represents an increase of 5% to 7% YoY, the rate still pales compared to last year’s 22% to 24% increase. According to the online game platform, the strength of the US dollar against the British pound and euro impacted its business.</p>
<p>Roblox’s average bookings per daily active user came in at between $3.92 and $3.97, which is down 7% to 9% from last year. Furthermore, even though daily active users grew 15% from November 2021 to 56.7 million presently, the game creation system reported 35% growth previously.</p>
<h2>Video Game Industry in The Lurch</h2>
<p>The video game industry continues to suffer broader weakness characterized by declining sales and buyer apathy. In addition, macroeconomic constraints like higher interest rates and a tepid tech space also weigh heavily on the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Last month, prominent video game holding company Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/07/take-two-interactive-ttwo-q2-2023-earnings.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">slashed</a> its outlook for the current quarter and fiscal 2023. According to the ‘Grand Theft Auto’ enabler, the current macroeconomic conditions were to blame for its projected contraction in operations.</p>
<p>In a statement issued in early November, Take-Two chief executive officer Strauss Zelnick explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our reduced forecast reflects shifts in our pipeline, fluctuations in FX rates, and a more cautious view of the current macroeconomic backdrop, particularly in mobile.”</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time, shares of the Rockstar Games and 2K owner tumbled more than 15% on the underwhelming guidance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> (NASDAQ: AAPL) also previously warned of a decline in digital advertising and gaming in its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-stock-q4-2022-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q4 earnings report.</a> At the time, the tech giant’s chief financial officer Luca Maestri explained during the earnings call:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Specifically on Services, we expect to grow, but to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment, increasingly affecting foreign exchange, digital advertising, and gaming.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple beat expectations for its latest quarterly result.</p>
<h2>Roblox</h2>
<p>Created by Erik Cassel and David Baszucki in 2004 and released in 2006, Roblox is free-to-play. However, the gaming platform also supports additional microtransactions, with in-game purchases available through its Robux virtual currency.</p>
<p>Roblox started out as a relatively small platform but began to expand rapidly in the latter half of the 2010s. This growth trajectory peaked during the Covid pandemic, with tens of millions of people across the globe connecting with friends. By August 2020, Roblux had more than 164 million monthly active users.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/qcp-capital-97m-frozen-ftx/">QCP Capital Has at Least $97M Frozen at Defunct Exchange FTX</a></p>
<p>Crypto trading platform QCP Capital <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/194878/qcp-capital-ftx-exposure" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly</a> has at least $97 million trapped with collapsed crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>. Inside sources also claim that QCP has been trying to sell its claim to distressed asset buyers. This move is part of an attempt by the Singapore-based company to redeem some funds.</p>
<h2>QCP to Continue Operations Unperturbed</h2>
<p>QCP Capital first <a href="https://twitter.com/QCPCapital/status/1590955395195207680" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">intimated</a> its FTX exposure on Twitter last month but did not disclose the amount. The company also added that although it had active trading positions on FTX, it was able to remove a substantial amount of assets from the ill-fated exchange. Furthermore, QCP said efforts are underway to recover the remaining assets frozen with FTX. According to the company, the frozen funds at FTX do not impact its operability. According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/QCPCapital/status/1590955398118666242" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a>, &#8220;the situation has not impacted our ability to serve clients or counterparties. Business carries on as usual, and our trading desk continues to operate normally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doubling down on its ability to withstand potential asset loss on its balance sheet, QCP <a href="https://twitter.com/QCPCapital/status/1590955401352450048" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are well placed to weather the impact of any potential loss of assets. We also do not engage in any lending or borrowing and there is no exposure for the company in this aspect.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Singaporean crypto trading platform also <a href="https://twitter.com/QCPCapital/status/1590955404435288064" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">pledged</a> to remain a responsible and trusted player in the institutional crypto ecosystem. Furthermore, QCP expressed a desire to collaborate with all the stakeholders of the digital currency space to forge a more robust industry.</p>
<p>QCP operates a crypto derivatives-focused 24/7 trading desk and handles proprietary trading and market-making services. According to the company, it has dealt with trades worth $38 billion so far this year. QCP is currently awaiting licensing from the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a leading payments institution offering crypto services.</p>
<h2>FTX Contagion Impacting QCP Capital, Others</h2>
<p>QCP is one of the countless crypto companies drastically affected by the sudden implosion of FTX. Other companies like Galois Capital, Genesis Block HK, and Multicoin Capital reportedly also have funds frozen at the defunct Bahamian exchange. Genesis Block HK, in particular, suffered such a significant impact that it shut down its over-the-counter (OTC) trading business last week after 10 years.</p>
<p>Since FTX filed for bankruptcy, several other smaller crypto exchanges and lending platforms have also filed after encountering liquidity crises. For example, in late November, crypto loan platform <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blockfi-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</a> due to its close financial ties with FTX.</p>
<p>FTX crashed after a string of events that saw several of its customers rush to withdraw their funds, akin to a bank run. This unsavory development led to the exchange freezing withdrawals, but at that point, it was too little too late. FTX currently owes billions of dollars to its creditors, with the top 50 creditors owed a staggering $3.1 billion.</p>
<p>The disgraced former CEO of the exchange, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, was <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bankman-fried-arrested-bahamas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested</a> in the Bahamas earlier in the week and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-bankman-fried-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces</a> US extradition.</p>
