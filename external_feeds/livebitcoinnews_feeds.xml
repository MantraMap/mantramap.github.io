<li>Bitcoin price is attempting a fresh increase from the $25,500 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading near $27,000 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $26,900 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $27,350 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin price is rising from $25,500 against the US Dollar. BTC might eye another increase if the bulls remain active above the $26,550 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price remained well-bid above the $25,500 level. A base was formed and the price was able to settle above the $26,000 resistance zone. The bulls remained active above $26,000 and initiated a decent increase.</p>
<p>There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $28,431 swing high to the $25,351 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $26,900 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price is now trading near $27,000 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-another-increase-to-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $27,350 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance might be near the $27,700 zone or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $28,431 swing high to the $25,351 low. A clear move above the $27,350 and $27,700 resistance levels might send the price toward <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-key-resistance-near-28-5k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$28,500</a>.</p>
<p>Any more gains might push the price toward the $29,500 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might start a fresh decline below the $26,800 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>The first major support is near $26,550. The next key support is near the $26,000 level, below which the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline toward the $25,500 level in the coming sessions.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a>, Bitcoin’s price is trading near $27,000 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). Overall, the price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $27,350 resistance zone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Piers Ridyard is the CEO of Radix, one of the <a href="https://techbullion.com/pierce-ridyard-ceo-of-radix-layer-1-blockchain-we-can-compare-radix-to-when-the-iphone-was-launched-in-2007/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">world’s oldest digital currency</a> companies. The project is on the verge of turning ten, and he believes many new opportunities and challenges are coming not only for his enterprise, but for the crypto industry in general.</p>
<h2>Piers Ridyard Discusses His Crypto Journey</h2>
<p>Discussing his early crypto days, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I started in crypto when I started mining on the genesis block of Ethereum in early 2015, investing in ‘the DAO’ and going deep on everything from game theory to prediction markets. This eventually led me to build and exit Surematics, a Y combinator company that built decentralized deal room software for insurance companies in 2017… I became CEO of RDX Works… joining the founder, Dan Hughes, and building the team to over 75 people around the world. My background includes finance, law, electronics, and mathematics. I also have two degrees, one in Chinese and business and a second in law, as well as having achieved level 1 chartered financial analyst designation.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was also quick to comment that Radix has brought a lot of unique <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> solutions to the market. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like Ethereum, Radix is a layer 1 smart contract platform, although Radix is as different to Ethereum as a jumbo jet is to a biplane. In a nutshell, Radix is the base layer upon which any developer can build dApps (decentralized applications) on top of. End users can use those dApps for services such as payments, borrowing, trading, or lending for any form of a digital asset such as tokens or NFTs. You can also use Radix for password-less login to any app or website that supports it without relying on any centralized service to hold your data. The Radix project is one of the origins of the crypto industry. It’ll be ten years next month. The reason it’s taken this long is that we had an end goal in mind and worked backwards from that objective. That objective is to build a decentralized ledger capable of supporting mainstream-ready experiences for users, developers, and capital at the scale of the global financial system.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Connecting Everyone to the Blockchain</h2>
<p>Discussing how his company connects both products and developers to the blockchain industry, Ridyard mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Radix is just software that anyone can run on their computer. When a computer runs that software and connects to others running that software, it forms a network, and we call those computers nodes. Those nodes, in turn, then agree with one another on the state of the Radix Ledger, which is an immutable record of transactions. The Radix Ledger can hold any kind of data, whether it’s who won a sports game for a decentralized prediction application, a record of who owns a token, or the smart contract logic that forms the basis of a dApp.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Me We – an up-and-coming social media platform – has adopted the Frequency blockchain as a means of connecting more <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/frequency-blockchain-deliver-decentralized-social-160000803.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">users and bringing about</a> new internet revolutions.</p>
<h2>Me We and Blockchain&#8230; A Perfect Match?</h2>
<p>The goal of integrating blockchain into its system is to give users unique social identities that are fully owned by the individuals they’re issued to. The move is a big step away from how social media platforms are usually handled. Often, a platform is centralized, and a small group of individuals at the top of the executive ladder have control over a users’ information and whatever they divulge or post.</p>
<p>However, following problems surrounding things like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/facebook-coin-is-garnering-mixed-reactions/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cambridge Analytica and Facebook</a> from five years ago, Me We wants to do things differently and give all its users a little more control over what they do and what happens to their data. The social identities they’re given will also allow them access to a wide array of new Web3-based protocols and services the company plans on introducing.</p>
<p>Braxton Woodham – president of Amplica Labs, the team that helped bring the Frequency blockchain to fruition – stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Frequency breaks the price barrier so blockchain technology can be used to decentralize social at massive scale. This breakthrough enables a bridge for Web 2.0 apps to connect their existing user bases to Web3 value and opens blockchain for use cases that go far beyond DeFi.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jeffrey Edell – CEO and chairman of Me We – also threw his two cents into the mix, claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since our founding, Me We has surpassed industry norms to protect individuals&#8217; digital rights. We are furthering this commitment by literally handing control of data over to our users. By pioneering the migration to the social web, we seek to be a leader in bringing into existence a world in which people, not corporations, control the way digital spaces work.</p></blockquote>
<p>The goals of the social organization flow directly with those of blockchain, which was initially designed to give users more independence and autonomy. The idea is that through blockchain, middlemen, third parties, and prying eyes would be completely cut out of the picture for transactors.</p>
<h2>Keeping Things Safe for Users</h2>
<p>Frank McCourt – founder and executive chairman of Project Liberty and McCourt Global – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today&#8217;s prevailing tech architecture, one that profits from exploiting and dividing people, has caused widespread harm and led to a breakdown in our social fabric, and with the emergence of AI, the damage being done will only accelerate. With this significant milestone, we are witnessing firsthand the creation of a new and exciting model for technology. By utilizing DSNP to catalyze systemic change and by empowering people to take control of their digital lives, we can replace today&#8217;s broken tech model with a better version, enabling a much brighter future for us all.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin rose eight percent in late April after First Republic Bank fell <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/bitcoin-jumps-as-first-republic-pulls-banking-sector-concerns-back-into-focus.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">under a negative light</a>, and many analysts believed it would be next to collapse.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Spikes Following More Issues with Banks</h2>
<p>Bitcoin had fallen into <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-falls-to-28k-analysts-are-wondering-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">the high $20,000 range</a> prior, a near $3,000 dip from the $30K, ten-month high it had previously hit. However, now it looks like bank fears are once again on the horizon, and when banks aren’t doing well, that’s usually a cue for bitcoin to step in and save the day once again. At the time of this writing, BTC is back to trading for around $29,800.</p>
<p>Matt Hougan – chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management – said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto rallies during banking crises, and it looks like the banking crisis may not be over.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shares in First Republic fell nearly 50 percent over the course of a single day. The company has endured a major slip in deposits ever <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/did-crypto-cause-banks-to-fall-experts-weigh-in/" data-wpel-link="internal">since Silicon Valley Bank</a> went under. During that initial collapse, the price of bitcoin shot up by more than 20 percent. James Lavish, managing partner at Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin continues to straddle between being the ultimate lifeboat from the current banking system and the leading risk-on asset. As First Republic is now on the verge of collapse, bitcoin represents a ‘safe haven’ versus uncertain bank deposits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, while the news is positive for BTC, many analysts say traders shouldn’t be breaking open the champagne just yet. The Federal Reserve, for example, has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/federal-reserve-hikes-rates-again-what-will-happen-to-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">hinted that it plans</a> to continue hiking rates in 2023, and that so long as inflation remains a problem, the organization will do all it can to curb its effects. Yuya Hasegawa – crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange Bit Bank – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The crypto market learned last month that [the] banking crisis works favorably for bitcoin’s price, but we need to approach it from multiple angles. The Fed Funds futures market is pricing in the beginning of rate cuts later this year, and it could be a source of disappointment if the Fed continues to refrain from commenting on or even denies the possibility of rate cuts this year.</p></blockquote>
<h2>We Need to Remain Careful</h2>
<p>Mike McGlone – a senior macro strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence – <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/26/crypto-winter-finally-over-bank-crisis-a-catalyst-for-huge-2-trillion-bitcoin-prediction-as-ethereum-price-suddenly-storms-back/?sh=2cff2c0646e3" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">also threw his two cents</a> into the mix, claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>The up-and-coming 24/7 traded leading indicators, revolutionary technologies and assets – bitcoin and Ethereum – may be running into a wall of resistance at the key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000. Our bias is bullish in the long term for the top cryptos, but an overwhelming force of the stock market going down with the Fed tightening into a recession has the potential to lower the tide for all risk assets, and bitcoin and Ethereum are among the riskiest.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Cardano price saw a rejection pattern near the $0.382 zone against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair declined below the $0.380 and $0.368 support levels.</p>
<p>There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $0.364 on the 4-hour chart. The price even declined below the $0.355 support and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-recovery-could-gain-pace-above-0-385/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.

On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.3552 zone or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3819 swing high to the $0.3470 low.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $0.364 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3819 swing high to the $0.3470 low.</p>
<p>A clear upside break above the $0.364 level might send the price toward the $0.380 resistance. Any more gains could start a steady increase toward the $0.388 level or even $0.400. On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.347 level.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $0.332 level, below which the price may perhaps decline toward the $0.320 support level. Any more losses might call for a test of the $0.30 level.</p>

<li>Ethereum price is gaining bearish momentum below the $1,850 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>ETH price is now trading below $1,840 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,860 on the 4-hour chart (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it stays below $1,840 and $1,850.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is declining below $1,840 against the US Dollar. ETH/USD remains at a risk of more downsides below the $1,780 support zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ethereum started a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-eyes-upside-break-above-1920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">fresh decline</a> below $1,880 against the US Dollar. ETH price moved into a bearish zone below the $1,850 level.</p>
<p>There was a sharp move below the $1,840 level. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,860 on the 4-hour chart. A low was formed near $1,777 before the price started an upside correction.</p>
<p>There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,914 swing high to the $1,777 low. However, the price is still trading below $1,840 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-aims-fresh-increase-above-1850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is now facing resistance near the $1,840 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,850 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,914 swing high to the $1,777 low, above which it could rise toward the $1,880 resistance zone.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $1,880 and $1,900 resistance levels might call for a fresh move to $2,000. Any more gains could even send the price toward the $2,120 resistance zone or even $2,200 in the near term.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support is near the $1,780 level. The next major support is now near the $1,750 level. A break below the $1,750 support could push the price to $1,700. If the bulls fail to protect the $1,700 support, the price might decline toward $1,650.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea and Saudi Arabia are teaming up in <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ae/news/world/saudi-arabia-teams-up-with-south-korea-s-wemade-to-power-gaming-and-blockchain-sectors/ar-AA1aiEdQ" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the name of blockchain</a>. The southern region of the latter country has joined hands with Wemade – a video game developer in Korea – to help boost both blockchain and gaming in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<h2>Saudi Arabia Wants to Lead Blockchain Gaming Initiatives</h2>
<p>In a recent statement, a representative from the Ministry of Investment in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/saudi-arabia/" data-wpel-link="internal">Saudi Arabia</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are very excited for Wemade’s progress in expanding its activities in Saudi Arabia and are looking forward to continuing supporting Wemade’s footprint through connecting it to strategic partners in the sector. This progress would be yet another step further into realizing the national objective of becoming a hub for gaming and e-sports in line with the national gaming and e-sports strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The goal is to ensure Saudi Arabia remains a global hub for both expansion initiatives and investments. One way to do this is to garner business opportunities through foreign nations. South Korea has long been a leader in both the crypto and blockchain arenas, and representatives are confident individuals working with Wemade will bring the knowledge and expertise the nation&#8217;s leaders are looking for to the table.</p>
<p>Wemade has been at the center of several partnerships over the past few months. Back in February, for example, the company teamed up with Savvy Games’ Nine66, which was supported through a public investment fund. The goal is to ensure training and educational content are available to future generations of blockchain gamers and that regional events get the sponsorship opportunities and funds they seemingly deserve.</p>
<p>Charles Huh – global investment officer at Wemade – explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the demand for games and blockchain technologies continues to grow in Saudi Arabia, we are committed to showcasing our capabilities and delivering innovative solutions that meet their needs. We believe that our partnership with [the Saudi ministry] will not only benefit both parties, but also create new opportunities in the global game industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wemade was founded in the year 2000 and has brought many prominent gaming titles to market including the “Legend of Mir” series, which is presently enjoyed by more than 1,000 individual gamers across the globe. Another prominent product established by the firm is Wemix.</p>
<h2>Expansion Over the Next Seven Years</h2>
<p>The gaming world in Saudi Arabia is expanding like nobody’s business. The region is the leader of the Arabian economy, and it’s estimated that the gaming sector of the nation will grow by as much as 250 percent through the year 2030. These results stem from a recent YouGov poll, which also believes that e-sports will lead to this expansion.</p>
<p>Said growth would also mean that the GDP of Saudi Arabia will likely surge by at least 50 times over the next seven years, and by that year, gaming consumption could be just under $7 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain was always designed to make the world a better, stronger place, and there are many entrepreneurs and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/25/greenpilled-meet-5-entrepreneurs-engineering-social-good-on-the-blockchain/?sh=2a8aecb6468f" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">companies out there working</a> towards that goal.</p>
<h2>How Blockchain Is Keeping the Planet Well</h2>
<p>One of those people is Holke Brammer, who has a PhD in political economy from Stanford. In a recent interview, he commented on the work that ultimately got him involved (and interested) in both blockchain and blockchain applications:</p>
<blockquote><p>I studied how we get good long-term policies in democracies, which is obviously non-trivial… I worked on large scale innovation processes in Germany between civil society and the German state, organizing the largest hackathon around COVID. It was the largest hackathon so far with 28,000 people. We basically took the challenges from COVID, from track and tracing COVID, to how do small businesses apply for state subsidies, to how do we deal with domestic violence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brammer is all about open innovation, in which ideas are placed together as a means of establishing things like decentralization for both individuals and institutions. He is now working with Protocol Labs, a prominent blockchain startup, and is leading a newly launched vehicle called Hypercerts Foundation.</p>
<p>The goal of the organization is to provide special rewards and incentives to those who are trying to utilize blockchain’s prowess to better the planet and make it safe for future generations. In a recent blog post for the company, Brammer wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine a world where positive impact was one of the most highly valued creations in our society.</p></blockquote>
<p>In terms of blockchain being used for social good, it appears the concept is really building steam as of late according to people like Simona Pop. As the co-founder of Ethereum bounties, Pop was quick to mention that there are now major players in the mix such as UNICEF, who recently tried to introduce a new digital token in 2019.</p>
<p>As a Romanian who escaped her country’s revolution, Pop studies DAOs and governance, and seeks to find new ways to bring people together so that they can share ideas and missions for protecting Mother Earth. She explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the core of it, it is about redesigning the whole model. Re-engineering the whole flow of resources, but as I always say, it is tough building a new boat when you are firmly standing in the current one with its focus on extraction.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Ensuring Traceability for Products</h2>
<p>One of the big things that blockchain is being used for now – aside from verifying digital currency transactions – is ensuring the trustworthiness of specific items or goods. For example, a company called The Fision is now using <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-fision-uses-blockchain-to-ensure-the-trustfulness-of-its-clothing-line/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain to measure</a> the journeys its cotton T-shirts take from creation to winding up in the hands of buyers.</p>
<p>Blockchain ensures all the materials are sustainable and traceable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prosecutors in South Korea have <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/south-korea-indicts-co-founder-of-failed-terrausd-cryptocurrency/ar-AA1ak8qz" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filed charges against</a> Daniel Shin, the co-founder of Terraform Labs (the firm behind Terra USD) alongside Do Kwon, who was recently arrested <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-executive-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro/" data-wpel-link="internal">while traveling through</a> Europe.</p>
<h2>Daniel Shin Is Facing Charges in South Korea</h2>
<p>Shin is the man – aside from Kwon – who reportedly brought Terra USD to life. The currency and the respective company behind it came crashing down in the summer of last year in what was believed to be the first major casualty (at that time) of the crypto winter that oversaw most of 2022, but there is evidence to suggest something more sinister occurred.</p>
<p>Terra USD was considered an algorithmic stable coin, meaning it didn’t have any collateral (i.e., gold, fiat currencies, etc.) supporting it. The only thing ensuring its “stable” condition was the fact that traders seemed to believe in it.</p>
<p>Either this belief vanished very fast or something shady happened because in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-luna-token-has-experienced-a-dramatic-drop/" data-wpel-link="internal">the summer of 2022</a>, the currency broke down like an old car and roughly $40 billion in investor funds vanished without a trace. Everyone lost their wealth in a matter of seconds, and the currency was no more.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed like the crypto winter was getting worse, but then news came about that Kwon and many of the executives working on Terra USD <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-sec-case-against-crypto-exec-do-kwon-just-got-a-lot-hairier/" data-wpel-link="internal">transferred much of their funds</a> into BTC just weeks before the crash was recorded.</p>
<p>Many authorities felt that the company men knew the enterprise was about to come crashing down or that this was a rug pull of some sort. In any case, they took it like investors were going to get slapped in the face while those in charge would not experience any repercussions.</p>
<p>Kwon instantly became a fugitive when authorities decided to issue a warrant for his arrest, though according to his social pages, this never occurred, and his fugitive status was something concocted by the mainstream media. He said he <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-exec-do-kwon-says-hes-willing-to-cooperate-following-arrest-warrant/" data-wpel-link="internal">was busy coding in</a> his living room and that he was more than willing to cooperate with the police.</p>
<p>He was arrested just a few months ago while trying to board a plan in Montenegro, a small European country. He was caught with various phony IDs, which makes one wonder if perhaps the fugitive status is, indeed, real.</p>
<h2>Wasn&#8217;t Involved?</h2>
<p>Now, it looks like Shin is next. Heck, they both shared offices together. Perhaps now they can share an eight-by-nine cell. As many as ten separate individuals have been charged for their alleged roles in the collapse of the Terra USD platform. They – along with Shin – are facing fraud charges and have been accused of violating capital-markets laws and regulations surrounding electronic transactions and fundraising.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Shin say he left Terra in 2020, and thus wasn’t part of the crash.</p>
