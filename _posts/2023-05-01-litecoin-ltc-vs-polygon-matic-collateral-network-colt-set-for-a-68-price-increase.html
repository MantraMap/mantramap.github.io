<p>The cryptocurrency market has seen tremendous growth and volatility over the past year. Litecoin (LTC) and Polygon (MATIC) have been gaining traction due to their performance and unique use cases.</p>
<p>A new token with a unique real-world use case, Collateral Network (COLT) has emerged with a presale that has caught the attention of the market experts and crypto community. With predictions of 3000% plus growth predictions it is one that is not to be missed.</p>

<p class="s8">Does Litecoin have a good future?</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has been around since 2011, and it is one of the most well-established cryptocurrencies in the market.</p>
<p>A former Google engineer Charlie Lee designed Litecoin to be a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin (BTC). For that reason, many consider Litecoin a &lsquo;silver to Bitcoin's gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Litecoin uses a different mining algorithm than Bitcoin, allowing faster block processing times and lower transaction fees.</p>
<p>However, Litecoin still has some of the disadvantages of Bitcoin. Notably, Litecoin still uses a proof of work consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>Despite these disadvantages, the token&rsquo;s recent performance was good, especially after investors moved away from centralized tokens. Thanks to its strong reputation for decentralization, Litecoin has shown impressive growth in recent months. Litecoin, at the time of writing, is priced at $86.87.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s8">What is Polygon (MATIC) used for?</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to solve the network's scalability issues.</p>
<p>The token saw significant growth in 2021 and 2022, likely thanks to the rise in popularity of DeFi and NFTs. Polygon is a key tool to enable DeFi and other complex use cases on Ethereum.</p>
<p>For one, Polygon offers significantly lower transaction fees than the Ethereum network. This is due to its layer 2 architecture, which offloads a lot of the computational burden to a sidechain, resulting in lower gas fees.</p>
<p>At the same time, Polygon is compatible with Ethereum, which helps it attract the biggest blockchain developer community out there. This interoperability makes it easier for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on Polygon.</p>
<p>Therefore, cryptocurrencies like Polygon are crucial because of their role in the Ethereum ecosystem. Polygon enables complex Web3 applications on the network. Hence, as long as Ethereum keeps growing, Polygon will grow too.</p>

<p class="s8">Collateral Network (COLT) the crypto newcomer with huge potential</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) aims to disrupt the lending industry with its decentralized lending protocol for real-world assets. Collateral Network will enable users to borrow cryptocurrencies against physical assets. These assets include fine art, gold, watches, diamonds, and collectibles.</p>
<p>What is especially unique about Collateral Network is that it is the first project to mint NFTs against physical assets. Collateral Network fractionalizes them, allowing numerous members of the community to fund the loans.</p>
<p>This means that borrowers can quickly unlock cash from their assets, sometimes in as little as 24 hours. As loans are not based on future income borrowers are able to maintain their privacy as no credit checks are required.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Collateral Network provides investors with a low-risk alternative to holding stablecoins and provides them with the potential to earn passive income. All loans on Collateral Network are 100% backed by real assets, giving added security to investors.</p>
<p>Collateral Network&rsquo;s (COLT) presale is set for a further price increase from its current value of $0.014, and analysts predict a 3,500% (35X) price increase over the next few months. It is likely the price could 100X when it lists on major exchanges like Uniswap.</p>
