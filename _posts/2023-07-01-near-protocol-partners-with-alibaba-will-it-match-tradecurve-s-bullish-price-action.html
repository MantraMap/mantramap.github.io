<p>The latest partnership between Near Protocol (NEAR) and Alibaba caused the Near Protocol (NEAR) price to spike, leading experts to wonder whether the token can hold its upward momentum. Meanwhile, Tradecurve (TCRV), currently in Stage 4 of its presale, has exceeded everyone&rsquo;s expectations, surging over 80% in price and raising $2.8 million in a very short amount of time.</p>

Near Protocol (NEAR) Spikes 12% After Alibaba Partnership
<p>The Near Foundation, the non-profit organization behind the Near Protocol (NEAR), recently partnered with Alibaba Cloud intending to accelerate Web3 growth in the Middle East and Asia. Namely, this Near Protocol (NEAR) partnership will provide remote procedure calls (RPC) as a service to Near Protocol (NEAR) users and developers, among other benefits.</p>
<p>As a result, Near Protocol (NEAR) surged 12% as soon as the announcement was made, driving its price to the $1.56 level. However, Near Protocol (NEAR) did not manage to sustain its upward movement, with the Near Protocol (NEAR) token currently trading at $1.36.</p>
