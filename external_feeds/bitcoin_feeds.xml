Besides questioning the legitimacy of its data acquisition processes, CNIL is also delving into how this biometric data is stored. Notably, Worldcoin has collected this data for over two million registrants who have participated in its project.</strong></p>
<h2>French Regulator CNIL Questions Worldcoin&#8217;s Biometric Data Storage</h2>
<p>Worldcoin debuted last Monday, and based on available data and footage of individuals enrolling, the venture has been amassing momentum and recognition. In an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/frances-privacy-watchdog-says-worldcoin-legality-seems-questionable-2023-07-28/">email conversation</a> with Reuters, CNIL disclosed to the media outlet that it was scrutinizing Worldcoin&#8217;s data gathering and has initiated inquiries. &#8220;The legality of this collection seems questionable, as do the conditions for storing biometric data,” CNIL informed the news platform.</p>
<p>Ahead of launching its worldcoin (WLD) token, Worldcoin asserted it had already enlisted more than 2 million users. As of now, over <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xdc6ff44d5d932cbd77b52e5612ba0529dc6226f1">300,000 WLD token holders exist</a>, and on July 29, 2023, WLD documented upwards of 1 million transactions. Moreover, the CEO of Openai and co-founder of Worldcoin, Sam Altman, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-adoption-said-to-be-accelerating-sam-altman-states-one-person-getting-verified-every-8-seconds/">presented a video</a> revealing Worldcoin registrants queuing up to undergo iris scans and shared that an individual was being scanned &#8220;every 8 seconds.”</p>
<p>Even prior to Worldcoin&#8217;s introduction, the project encountered backlash, and an <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/">article</a> published by MIT Technology Review detailed accusations of deceit and exploitation. In October 2021, former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iris-scanning-worldcoin-idea-fuels-objections-from-privacy-advocates-snowden-says-dont-catalog-eyeballs/">criticized</a> the iris scanning initiative telling Altman they should abstain from cataloging people&#8217;s eyeballs. In correspondence with Reuters, the French regulator disclosed its commencement of investigations into Worldcoin.</p>

<p>CNIL also highlighted that Bavarian authorities are collaborating with the regulator in examining Worldcoin’s data collection practices. The Worldcoin Foundation responded to Reuters&#8217; request for comment concerning the investigation. The foundation noted that it falls under the jurisdiction of the European Union and Bavarian authorities such as the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision. “[Worldcoin] is designed to protect individual privacy and has built a robust privacy program,” the Worldcoin Foundation stated in its email.</p>
<p>Additionally, the group emphasized that the project adheres to all laws and regulations within every jurisdiction where Worldcoin operates. &#8220;The project will continue to cooperate with governing bodies on requests for more information about its privacy and data protection practices,&#8221; the Worldcoin Foundation added.</p>

Notably, a year-long assessment reflects an even more significant contraction, with over 86,000 WBTC evaporating from circulation since last July.</strong></p>
<h2>A 12-Month Decline of 86,000 WBTC in Circulation</h2>
<p>The Wrapped Bitcoin project has been around for over <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-wrapped-bitcoin-project-has-officially-launched-on-ethereum/">four years</a>, originating as WBTC on the Ethereum blockchain at the dawn of 2019. As of now, WBTC stands as the 16th most valuable asset among a sea of alternative cryptocurrencies, boasting a market value of approximately $4.73 billion. Despite its ranking as the most prominent wrapped bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) derivative token, a notable contraction in circulating coins has been observed since the previous year.</p>
<p>To illustrate, rewind to July 13, 2022, when the circulating supply of WBTC stood at an estimated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220713172745/https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599">247,832 WBTC</a>. Today, that number has tapered off to <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599#balances">161,460 WBTC</a>. This translates into a reduction of over 86,000 WBTC, or a significant 34% pullback in circulating supply over the past year. Additionally, a comparison of WBTC&#x2019;s market valuation reveals substantial growth &#x2013; ascending from a tad above $3 billion on January 2, 2023, to a markedly more impressive figure of $4.73 billion today.</p>

<p>However, this augmentation in value primarily stems from the appreciating price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, which was exchanging hands at $16,662 per unit on January 2. Now, each <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> coin commands a price of $29,328, marking a surge of over 65% since the year&#x2019;s commencement. Given that WBTC&#x2019;s prices are tethered to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on a 1:1 basis, WBTC&#x2019;s market capitalization followed suit, even though its circulating supply <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230102112556/https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-bitcoin">contracted by 22,088 WBTC</a> in the same period. Thus, of the total 34% reduction since last year, 12.03% of the cutback unfolded in 2023.</p>

<p>Specifically within the Ethereum network, WBTC boasts a total of 74,191 holders. However, the lion&#x2019;s share of the supply&#x2014;<a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/richlist/">51.5% to be exact</a>&#x2014;resides under the control of the top ten addresses. These ERC20-based WBTC tokens are spread across a multitude of decentralized finance (defi) platforms such as Aave, Compound, and Arbitrum. In fact, the top 100 Ethereum-based addresses command 75.16% of the total WBTC supply. Beyond Ethereum, WBTC also finds utility on other blockchains including Arbitrum, Cronos, Fantom, Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche.</p>

The move came as X, formerly Twitter, continued its re-brand by showcasing its new logo over the San Francisco skyline. Shiba inu surged by over 5% today.</b></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) rebounded on Saturday, as the token ended a recent three-day losing streak in today’s session.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD hit an intraday peak at $0.07828 earlier in the day, following Friday’s drop to a bottom at $0.07653.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s decline saw the meme coin move near a support point at $0.07600, however bulls rejected a full on collision.</p>

<p>Although DOGE is now up by almost 2% from Friday’s low, price might have hit a wall, due to the current position of the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>The index is hovering below a ceiling at 63.00, which would need to be broken, if DOGE bulls intend to secure further gains this weekend.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, price strength is tracking at 62.53.</p>

<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) continued to trade close to a two-week high in today’s session, after yesterday’s strong surge in price.</p>
<p>Saturday has seen SHIB/USD peak at $0.00000840, which comes after Friday’s low of $0.00000783.</p>
<p>This is marginally below the $0.00000845 level recorded yesterday, which was its highest point since July 14.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the rally comes as the RSI broke past a ceiling at 60.00, and is now tracking at 64.29.</p>
<p>Overall, this is the highest point price strength in SHIB since February 7, when the price reached a high of $0.00001449.</p>
<p>If momentum remains bullish this weekend, $0.00000890 is the realistic target for traders.</p>

Contrary to the projected sentiment of 72.6, the actual figure hovered at 71.6. Concurrently, bitcoin witnessed an uptick in its price.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) moved above a key support point of $29,200 on Saturday, as cryptocurrency markets continued to consolidate.</p>
<p>Following a low of $29,186.47 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD jumped to an intraday peak at $29,521.51 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has mostly consolidated this past week, as traders attempted to find a firm floor, after recent selloffs.</p>

<p>Today&#x2019;s consolidation comes as the relative strength index (RSI) appeared to have found its own floor at the 43.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 43.95, and appears to be heading for a ceiling at 48.00.</p>
<p>In the event price strength reaches this point, there is a good chance <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> could be trading above $29,800.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>After a volatile few days, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) made strides towards the $1,900 level to start the weekend.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD peaked at $1,881.46 earlier in the day, which comes following Saturday&#x2019;s bottom at the $1,865.45 mark.</p>
<p>Ethereum has failed to climb above the $1,900 point since last Sunday, and has mostly been in a downtrend since a move over $2,000 earlier in the month.</p>

<p>The RSI is on the cusp of breaking out of a resistance level at 49.00, which could help tempt previous bulls to reenter the market.</p>
<p>Should this occur, the 10-day (red) moving average might also change its current course, and potentially move back over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>

During the interview with the politician, Alegre described new models of IP (intellectual property) that transcend national borders and break down barriers traditional IP models impose.</strong></p>
<h2>Bored Apes: A New Paradigm for IP</h2>
<p>CEO of Yuga Labs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-alegre-a906954">Daniel Alegre</a> recently sat down with deputy director of the Web3.0 Policy Office at Japan&#8217;s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to discuss the future of Web3 and product licensing, describing a new model of &#8220;community-based IP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://webx-asia.com/speaker/waka-itagaki/?">Waka Itagaki</a> about the power of the Bored Ape Yacht Club global community at the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/roger-ver-at-webx-asia-reflections-on-payments-self-custody-and-the-role-of-crypto-lawbreakers/">Webx</a> conference on Tuesday, Alegre described: &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s a Bored Ape brewing company, that the team introduced me to yesterday, or whether it&#8217;s new artists that want to create [gaming content] on their other side platform &#8230; it&#8217;s really creating and connecting culture on the blockchain, but at a global level.&#8221;</p>
<p>The executive, formerly COO of <a href="https://www.activisionblizzard.com/">Activision Blizzard</a>, went on to note that &#8220;Web3 brings creators and consumers and communities together, and they build these brands together,&#8221; emphasizing, &#8220;It&#8217;s a fundamental rethink of IP and IP rights.&#8221; Alegre detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a normal media environment, if you own IP, you license it very exclusively and for a very finite use case &#8230; when you buy a Bored Ape NFT, we are giving you an unlimited license to do with that IP what you want &#8230; If you want to start a restaurant chain, if you want to have a brewing company, if you want to create t-shirts that you want to sell, it enables that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alegre didn&#8217;t directly address one portion of Itagaki&#8217;s prompt when she asked &#8220;How are you planning to align with the government&#8217;s regulation?&#8221; He did, however, suggest a way for regulators to view Web3, noting: &#8220;And this is where I love your point of view from a government perspective — how do you think about enablement so that more people can actually leverage what Web3 can bring to bear.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<h2>Animoca Rep and Other Speakers Share Similar Views on New, Decentralized Models of Business and Finance</h2>
<p>Similar to Alegre&#8217;s enthusiasm for fresh ways of viewing intellectual property, later the same day, <a href="https://webx-asia.com/speaker/evan-auyang/?">Evan Auyang of Animoca Brands</a> also described a new way to look at competition in the marketplace, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The whole point about this ecosystem &#8230; is that we&#8217;re trying to see if we can grow the pie bigger rather than dominating it ourselves, which is more Web2 thinking. If the pie grows bigger, then we will benefit &#8230; on the assets that we have at the same time.</p></blockquote>
<p>In another talk at Webx, <a href="https://webx-asia.com/speaker/ken-deeter/">Ken Deeter</a>, partner at crypto-focused VC fund Electric Capital in the United States, explained he was interested in defi as an extension of the Bitcoin ethos, which arose from a mistrust of central banks and traditional monetary policy. Like with the evolution in perspective on IP described by Alegre, Deeter and others at Webx expressed interest in setting up new models.</p>

SBF faces some serious accusations like misusing customer funds, market manipulation, insider trading, witness tampering, and money laundering. Some folks think he&#8217;s getting special treatment due to his connections and wealth.</strong></p>
<p><em>The following opinion editorial was written by Bitcoin.com’s Business Development Manager <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://twitter.com/bfriedman40">Ben Friedman</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Double Standards</h2>
<p>One of the main issues raised is the double standard between powerful folks like SBF and regular Americans like you and me. If any average Joe faced the same charges, they might not have the same cushy treatment during legal proceedings. It raises questions about the impact of connections and money when it comes to justice.</p>
<p>Another point of contention is the alleged conflicts of interest between government organizations and authorities, which could potentially hinder a thorough investigation. SBF&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/conflicting-reports-emerge-about-sec-helping-bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-with-legal-loopholes/">close ties</a> to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), coupled with substantial <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-prosecutors-probe-democrats-over-donations-from-sam-bankman-fried/">political donations</a> to prominent figures like President Joe Biden and Senator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elizabeth-warren-explains-her-anti-crypto-army-stance-waves-of-democrats-oppose-her-bitcoin-criticism/">Elizabeth Warren</a>, have led to speculations about the impact of these connections on the decision-making process. Additionally, concerns have been raised about political contributions made by SBF&#8217;s parents and their potential influence on regulatory scrutiny of FTX.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to notice the different enforcement priorities when it comes to cryptocurrency exchanges. While exchanges like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sec-identifies-12-crypto-tokens-as-securities-in-binance-lawsuit/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a> faced regulatory action, FTX seems to have dodged similar consequences despite the serious allegations against its founder. This inconsistency makes us wonder if all crypto exchanges are held to the same standards.</p>
<p>SBF&#8217;s high-powered legal team has been accused of using legal maneuvers to obstruct and delay investigations. This strategy has raised concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the legal process when faced with powerful adversaries who can afford top-tier representation.</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/prosecutors-want-sam-bankman-fried-jailed-ahead-of-trial/">request for SBF&#8217;s incarceration</a> by the prosecution may signal a shift in the handling of his case, which some say is too little too late given the gravity of the charges.</p>
<p>The issue at hand is not merely about one individual or exchange; it goes to the heart of financial regulation and accountability in the United States. If influential figures like SBF can navigate the legal system with relative ease, it erodes public trust in the fairness and impartiality of the financial regulatory framework.</p>
<p>In comparison to cases involving individuals without powerful connections, such as the controversial examples of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/hunter-biden-expected-plead-guilty-criminal-tax-case-rcna96232">Hunter Biden</a> and Jeffrey Epstein, it&#8217;s clear that there&#8217;s a stark contrast in how justice is served. While some argue that powerful figures like SBF have received preferential treatment during legal proceedings, others feel that regular people would end up in jail for similar actions. The unequal treatment calls for a more fair and consistent approach to enforcing financial regulations and pursuing justice.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the legal saga surrounding SBF raises significant concerns about how powerful connections and financial influence can impact the handling of financial misconduct cases. To rebuild trust in the cryptocurrency industry and the broader financial system, regulatory authorities must demonstrate an unwavering commitment to investigating and prosecuting wrongdoing, regardless of an individual&#8217;s status or connections.</p>
<p>Upholding fairness and impartiality is not only crucial for maintaining the integrity of our financial system but also for safeguarding the interests of all investors and consumers. By striving for a more equitable and consistent approach to enforcement, we can pave the way for a stronger, more transparent, and accountable financial landscape that benefits every ordinary American.</p>

According to Sam Altman, co-founder of the project, one person is currently verified by the iris scanning devices — the &#8220;Orb&#8221; — every 8 seconds. However, some data could call these claims into question. </strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin Operations Allegedly Ramping Up, One Person Getting Verified Every 8 Seconds</h2>
<p>Worldcoin, a project that aims to become a digital decentralized ID that will serve to deploy a Universal Basic Income (UBI) system with Sybil protections, is seeing more interest from potential users, according to statements from its team.</p>
<p>The project launched officially on July 24 after more than three years of development, and it is currently ramping up its presence in different parts of the world. Photos of the iris scanning devices, called &#8220;Orbs,&#8221; have been shown on Worldcoin&#8217;s social media accounts, confirming their presence in cities like <a href="https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1683847162357252098?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisbon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1683570443209392130?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1684258452691128321?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles</a>, even as the World App is not available in the U.S. due to lack of regulatory clarity.</p>
<p>Sam Altman, CEO of Openai and co-founder of Worldcoin, <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1684297687708098565?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a video on social media showing users waiting in line to be signed up using an Orb to verify their identities. Altman stated there were &#8220;crazy lines around the world,&#8221; declaring that one person was getting verified every 8 seconds.</p>

<h2>Altman&#8217;s Objectives</h2>
<p>Due to the supposed high level of demand, Worldcoin is now allowing users to reserve their genesis airdrop of 25 WLD, the native token of the protocol, and be verified later to obtain it. However, reports indicate this demand might not be as high as Altman states. For example, a recent article <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3228973/chatgpt-creators-iris-scanning-crypto-project-signs-hundreds-users-hong-kong-amid-controversy?module=live&amp;pgtype=homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on SCMP declares only a few hundred participants registered in Hong Kong on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>While Worldcoin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-altman-backed-worldcoin-reaches-2-million-signups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it had reached 2 million signups on July 13, the data shows that only about 13% of these users have possession of the WLD tokens on the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-migrates-to-optimism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optimism</a> network. According to <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xdc6ff44d5d932cbd77b52e5612ba0529dc6226f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a>, less than 270,000 participants are holding WLD, the protocol&#8217;s token. This is still far from the 2 billion people Altman <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1683380244013809664?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> recently on social media as his final goal.</p>
<p>According to blockchain research company <a href="https://marketing.kaiko.com/worldcoins-lauch?ecid=AOKeC1Y5KnhB5RM1MYegOhVgYjtelmT_izmJgn0TFogNFfcRyM7sdeii0mzn2WvovyYsADntciY1&amp;utm_campaign=Research%20newsletter&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=74402224&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_AXH6O2CNLn94ufnjXnuWEPciBhkoT889_mepj7-2U-4aoFaS8Fiz8bbiCXR1QOBtoxht8nHlEwmbTnTGYEWIxYPj6tQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiko</a>, due to the distribution of liquidity among market makers, the first weeks might be crucial for the project, given that the value of the airdrop is close to $50 is &#8220;and will likely stay in that range for the next three months.&#8221;</p>

Putin stated that this weaponization and the recent developments in global finance complicated the institution&#8217;s growth to help third-world countries facing difficult conditions.</strong></p>
<h2>Russian President Vladimir Putin Talks Dollar Weaponization in Recent Meeting</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin referred to the weaponization of the dollar and its effects on the global economy in a recent meeting with Dilma Rousseff, president of the New Development Bank (NDB) — also known as the BRICS bank — during the second Russia-Africa Summit held in Saint Petersburg. Putin explained this weaponization complicated Rousseff&#8217;s task of growing and developing the NDB&#8217;s role in the current international arena.</p>
<p>Talking to Rousseff, Putin <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/71809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am confident that &#8230; you will make every effort to develop this institution. In the current conditions, it is not easy to do so, given the developments in global finance and the use of the dollar as a political weapon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Putin declared that the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) were &#8220;increasing the use of national currencies in their mutual settlements,&#8221; mentioning that the NDB might have a role to play in boosting these joint activities.</p>

<h2>Rousseff&#8217;s Statements</h2>
<p>Rousseff stated that even as the bank faces liquidity problems, the institution is called to develop a more significant role in the emerging multipolar world order. She explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bank should play a major role in the development of a multipolar, polycentric world. We must work to attract investment in the markets of our partners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putin had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-president-vladimir-putin-states-emergent-multipolar-world-order-will-be-more-just/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> previously that this new multipolar world already being shaped will be &#8220;more just and democratic.&#8221; Rousseff also talked in favor of using national currencies for international trade, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also believe that the countries of the developing world can freely make their foreign trade transactions between themselves in their national currencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Roscongress Foundation, a Russian think tank that sponsors the Russia-Africa Summit, had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-think-tank-profiles-brics-bank-as-imf-counterpart-to-de-dollarize-credit-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">profiled</a> the role of the NDB as a counterpart to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a report published in May. In Roscongress&#8217; vision, the bank could issue &#8220;energy loans&#8221; based on the energy exporting capabilities of each member.</p>
<p>These energy loans would be secured through the NDB, being liquid due to its multi-currency nature, similar to the IMF&#8217;s Special Drawing Rights (SDR).</p>

However, according to the state&#8217;s new rules, crypto donations must be converted to U.S. dollars within five days. In the event of price changes within the five-day grace period, these must be shown separately in campaign finance reports.</strong></p>
<h2>Converting Crypto Donations to Dollars</h2>
<p>The U.S. state of Minnesota has become one of the first states in the country to okay crypto donations to political campaign committees. Under the state&#8217;s new rules, which took effect in July 2023, recipients of crypto donations are nevertheless required to convert these to U.S. dollars within five days.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2023/07/27/crypto-campaign-donations-minnesota-legal-elections">report</a> by Axios, the crypto contributions must be valued at the digital assets&#8217; respective prices when the donations were made. In the event of the prices changing within the five-day grace period, such changes must be shown separately in campaign finance reports.</p>
<p>Minnesota&#8217;s decision to allow crypto contributions was made after the state’s Campaign Finance &amp; Public Disclosure Board received inquiries from campaign teams which wanted to know the procedures for accepting crypto donations. According to Jeff Sigurdson, the CEO of the state’s political finance and disclosure body, these inquiries in turn prompted it to ask legislators to look into this.</p>
<p>Although the state has okayed crypto contributions, prospective recipients of such donations are still wary of digital assets’ volatility. The identity of crypto donors is also another key concern for the campaign committees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<h2>Politicians Not in a Hurry to Receive Crypto Donations</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. congressman Ken Martin is quoted in the report stating that he is not seeking to actively raise crypto donations.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s so much that you have to do to verify cryptocurrency and &#8230; accept it that it&#8217;s somewhat of an administrative nightmare,&#8221; Martin said.</p>
<p>Minnesota Republican David Han claimed that politicians from the state will accept any &#8220;lawful contribution to help our cause.&#8221; He however claimed that politicians in the state are currently not focused much on raising funds via crypto donations.</p>
<p>As per the report, the new rules are expected to give the green light for collecting political donations via Venmo and other mobile payment apps.</p>

<h2>FIT for the 21st Century Act Advances</h2>
<p>U.S. lawmakers have advanced the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act (<a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20230726/116291/BILLS-118HR4763ih.pdf">H.R. 4763</a>). On Wednesday, the House Financial Services Committee passed the bill, followed by the House Committee on Agriculture approving it on Thursday. The FIT for the 21st Century Act establishes a digital asset framework to provide regulatory certainty to the crypto market.</p>
<p>Reps. French Hill (R-AR), chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion; Glenn &#8220;GT&#8221; Thompson (R-PA), chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture; and Dusty Johnson (R-SD), chairman of the Subcommittee on Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development introduced the bill on July 20. Its co-sponsors include Reps. Tom Emmer (R-MN) and Warren Davidson (R-OH).</p>

<p>Rep. Johnson explained: “The digital asset space is muddled with regulatory uncertainty, lack of authority, and a lacking framework for core operating principles.” He elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The crypto industry wants clarity and our collaborative bill gives both the CFTC and SEC a seat at the table. Our bill establishes clear principles to ensure financial security and certainty as digital asset developers continue to innovate.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FIT for the 21st Century Act also contains a provision that provides for joint rulemakings between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>Congressman Hill commented on Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congress has heeded the call for strong consumer protections and a functional regulatory framework, which is why I introduced my bill after working closely with key stakeholders, the Biden administration, and members from both sides of the aisle.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The status quo is not solving problems, it’s not serving people, and it’s leaving America weaker by the day for failing to provide clarity in the digital assets market. We now have the opportunity to harness and embrace this next generation of technology in the United States,” said Congressman Davidson.</p>
