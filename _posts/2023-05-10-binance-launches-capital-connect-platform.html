<p>Crypto exchange Binance debuts &lsquo;Capital Connect,&rsquo; a new platform that links institutional investors with crypto fund managers. </p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance has launched a new platform called Capital Connect. Capital Connect bridges institutional investors with cryptocurrency fund managers.</p>
<p>Binance explains that the platform will allow institutional investors seeking crypto exposure to do so in a safe and efficient way. Capital Connect will offer information on assets under management (AUM) of different funds, records of their performance, minimum amounts to invest and further pertinent information. After taking the necessary information into account, investors can initiate contact with fund managers via the platform.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that once contacted, investment managers can review the institutional clients&rsquo; information before accepting a connection. Capital Connect automates and facilitates the process and keeps information anonymous until such time both parties have agreed to a connection.</p>
<p>Catherine Chen, Head of Binance VP and Institutional, said in a press release:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Investors and fund managers continue to encounter network inefficiencies due to a lack in market standards.&rdquo; Adding, &ldquo;With Capital Connect, we can help create information disclosure standards for market participants with different investing and fund-raising needs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new service platform is available to Binance&rsquo;s VIP, or high net-worth, users. The exchange has nine levels of VIP users and all are eligible to join Capital Connect.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with digital news outlet The Block, Chen said Binance saw a &ldquo;very rapid growth of the non-trading type of investors in the past 12 months or so&rdquo; who chose not to trade cryptocurrencies on their own, but would rather connect with active fund managers who can undertake this on their behalf. Chen explained that this is how Capital Connect came to be.</p>
<p>Chen added that Binance would not do due diligence on fund managers listed on the platform but will only allow &ldquo;high-quality&rdquo; managers to join. Fund managers must also complete the exchange&rsquo;s verification process that applies to all its users.</p>
<p>Chen further said that like Binance&rsquo;s main exchange, Capital Connect will not be available to users in the US and other restricted regions.</p>
Binance Pushes Forward Despite Numerous Setbacks
<p>Binance recently has faced serious scrutiny and criticism from regulators and the wider crypto community. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) brought charges against the exchange and its CEO Changpeng Zhao which sparked investors to withdraw over $400 million from the exchange in a matter of 24 hours.</p>
<p>Investors also caught a rather big fright on Sunday, May 7, when Binance paused Bitcoin withdrawals twice in a span of 12 hours. Binance halted withdrawals when Bitcoin transaction fees were at a high and the network heavily backlogged.</p>
<p>The exchange did however deliver good news to its users with the announcement of plans to support Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions on its NFT marketplace later this month.</p>
