<p>The Bitcoin mining community struggles to regain composure following the <a href="https://blog.liquid.com/bitcoin-crash-2022"><span>recent crash</span></a>. Since May, 2022, Bitcoin has fallen to more than 40% its former glory and is now dwindling slowly from $19,000.</p> 
<p>The crash brought Ethereum and a host of other cryptocurrencies down with it. A swirl of panic violently emerged as sell-offs flooded the market. As expected, the crisis has now spilled over into mining since it’s one of the primary methods of obtaining Bitcoin. It may not be the most preferable method, but is certainly the most risk-averse route in terms of financial investment.</p>
