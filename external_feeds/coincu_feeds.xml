<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Benji Bananas introduces BENJI token following a security breach involving PRIMATE tokens.</em></li>



<li><em>The new token replaces PRIMATE in Benji&#8217;s ecosystem, ensuring continuity for token holders.</em></li>



<li><em>The token swap process allows PRIMATE holders to exchange their tokens for BENJI at a 1:1 ratio.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a bid to address the fallout from a security breach that occurred several months ago, Benji Bananas, a cryptocurrency ecosystem, has <a href="https://medium.com/benji-bananas/benji-bananas-ecosystem-to-launch-a-new-token-benji-replacing-primate-7226a0535f75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> a strategic initiative that involves the introduction of a new token called BENJI. </strong></h5>

<p>This move comes after approximately 30 million PRIMATE tokens, accounting for 20% of the total circulating supply, were stolen from Benji&#8217;s market maker wallet. By launching BENJI, Benji Bananas aims to fortify its ecosystem and provide a secure foundation for its community.</p>



<p>The token swap initiative is designed to safeguard the interests of PRIMATE token holders and bolster confidence within the broader Benji Bananas community. BENJI will serve as the replacement token for PRIMATE and will be utilized in forthcoming Play-and-Earn (P&amp;E) events and across the entire Benji Bananas ecosystem. It is worth noting that the tokenomics, total supply, and circulation of BENJI will mirror those of PRIMATE, ensuring continuity for existing token holders.</p>

<p>To facilitate a smooth transition, the Benji team has already taken a snapshot of PRIMATE token balances in wallets and liquidity pools at the time of the announcement. PRIMATE holders are advised to refrain from transferring their tokens, except for those held in liquidity pools. In light of the upcoming token swap, Huobi, the centralized exchange where PRIMATE is traded, will temporarily halt PRIMATE trading.</p>



<p>The timeline for the token swap process is as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>A snapshot of PRIMATE token balances was taken at the time of the announcement on July 17, 2023, at 12:30 am UTC.</li>



<li>The PRIMATE token claim function on the Benji Bananas website will be temporarily paused until the new token launch is completed. Tokens that remain unclaimed will be available for retrieval once the process is finalized.</li>



<li>Trading of PRIMATE tokens on Huobi will be temporarily suspended.</li>



<li>New liquidity pools for BENJI will be established, and details regarding these pools will be communicated in due course.</li>



<li>PRIMATE holders will be able to swap their tokens for BENJI at a 1:1 ratio, with each wallet permitted to conduct a single swap. The eligible swap amount will be determined by the snapshot and the current PRIMATE balance in the wallet.</li>



<li>PRIMATE holders with tokens on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) are advised to bridge them back to Ethereum in preparation for the token swap.</li>



<li>On July 18, 2023, the Play-and-Earn (P&amp;E) claim function on the Benji Bananas website will resume.</li>



<li>Over the subsequent month, the ecosystem will transition entirely to using the BENJI token. During this period, PRIMATE holders will have the opportunity to complete their token swaps.</li>



<li>BENJI is anticipated to be listed on Huobi on or before July 31, 2023.</li>



<li>Special events tailored for on-chain BENJI holders will be announced on Benji Bananas&#8217;s community channels.</li>
</ul>



<p>Benji Bananas game is an action-adventure game with a lot of wonderful elements on it that basically tend to make the game a more fantastic one since everything on it was simply incredibly amazing in terms of how the gameplay could appears like it&#8217;s still a great one.</p>

<p>The Benji team has provided comprehensive instructions for PRIMATE token holders, emphasizing the importance of not moving their PRIMATE tokens until the swap process commences. Additionally, a detailed guide explaining the steps required to execute the token swap has been made available, and support will be provided to assist those in need of guidance.</p>



<p>Benji Bananas remains steadfast in its commitment to the security and prosperity of its community. While the security breach was regrettable, the introduction of BENJI and the subsequent token swap initiative are proactive measures aimed at mitigating risks and safeguarding the interests of PRIMATE holders. Benji urges its community members to stay tuned for further updates and encourages them to reach out to official channels for any inquiries or concerns they may have.</p>

<p>Altcoins are currently receiving more public attention than last month due to positive signs from <a href="https://coincu.com/203108-ripple-ceo-rejoices-landmark-court-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple’s</a> revolt against a formidable opponent like the SEC. This is a big win for XRP and for altcoins. It can be said that XRP is being watched because it is a token that is more centralized in nature than other coins, so if XRP can win the SEC, other coins may have a chance.</p>



<p>Unlocks are scheduled for projects:</p>



<ul>
<li>The ApeCoin APE token unlocked 15.6 million shards (approximately US$31.67 million) at 7:00 am on July 17, representing 1.56% of the total supply;</li>



<li>150 million Arkham tokens, ARKM, will be unlocked at 7:00 am on July 18, representing 15% of the total supply;</li>



<li>X2Y2 token X2Y2 will unlock 37.5 million pieces (approximately $970,000) at 10:47 pm on July 18, representing 3.75% of the total supply;</li>



<li>154,380 Euler tokens (approximately $370,000) will be unlocked at 9:22 pm on July 19, representing 0.568% of the total supply;</li>



<li>1inch of 1INCH tokens will unlock 364,290 pieces (approximately $150,000) at 7:00 am on July 20, about 0.024% of the total supply;</li>



<li>SPACE ID Token ID will unlock 15.15 million shards (approximately $4.06 million) at 7:00 am on July 22, representing 0.758% of the total supply;</li>



<li>The Axie Infinity token AXS will unlock 3.43 million shards (approximately $21.62 million) at 8:10 pm on July 22, representing 1.27% of the total supply;</li>



<li>The Cartesi CTSI token will unlock $1.54 million (approximately $240,000) at 11:00 am on July 23, representing 0.154 percent of the total supply.</li>
</ul>



<p>Token distribution is an important process in the token management of a blockchain project. Token distribution is important to many stakeholders, including investors, teams, users, and the community. However, it also has some risks such as token inflation and token price drop due to the sudden sale of unlocked tokens.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Fantom Foundation said it is contacting Circle and Tether to see if the platform can do anything with the frozen funds.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform says it can&#8217;t promise anything in advance, and there&#8217;s probably nothing more that can be done about this incident.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, Fantom had to <a href="https://coincu.com/203008-fantom-freezes-60m-usdc-2m-usdt-multichain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freeze</a> over $60 million USDC and more than $2 million USDT after Multichain announced its shutdown due to the arrest of its CEO.</em></li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;That being said, among other things, we&#8217;re in touch with Circle and Tether to see if something can be done with the frozen funds. There&#8217;s no promises and it might even not be possible to do anything, so keep this info as it is. We&#8217;re also trying to understand better what happened and what&#8217;s going on with multichain.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In earlier news, Fantom founder Andre Cronje responded to a user question on the forum that the failure of Multichain was a &#8220;severe blow&#8221;.</p>



<p>All options are currently being explored, and working with relevant organizations to recover assets, possibly even using Foundation funds. No confirmation can be made until more data is available.</p>



<p>However, the foundation said it will not ignore it and will do what it can to compensate people. In addition, Fantom will continue to work with Circle, Tether, TrueUSD, Binance, and more for native distribution and consider the synthesis of native bridging infrastructure.</p>



<p>As more verifiable information becomes available, Fantom will recommend an action plan. Andre Cronje also stated that the foundation and all employees are exposed to these assets.</p>

<p>The incident started late last week after Multichain officially <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1679768407628185600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> a shutdown notice due to their CEO Zhao Jun being arrested by the Chinese police. This fact was hidden, but before that, many users in China spread in the community. The reason given by the platform for not informing users is due to the influence of legal regulations during the investigation.</p>



<p>After receiving the information, Fantom Foundation made an announcement immediately contacting stablecoin issuers to freeze over $60 million USDC and over $2 million USDT on their Multichain wallet.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Twitter users reported issues with Arkham</strong> <strong>airdrop, as many users couldn&#8217;t submit their wallet addresses before the deadline. The team disqualified some accounts for Sybil attacks, raising concerns about genuine users.</strong></h5>



<p>Recently, a Twitter account known as GA Crypto tweeted about issues with the Arkham team&#8217;s airdrop. The team requested that users submit their wallet addresses before July 16th to receive the airdrop. </p>

<p>However, many users were unable to submit their addresses as there was no option provided. Despite raising tickets on Discord and submitting their account information, users still could not submit their addresses.</p>

<p>During the initial phase of the experiment, a selection of &#8220;kindness&#8221; was shared with 10,000 randomly chosen anonymous users from the community, who received the NFTs as part of the airdrop.</p>



<p>zkSync&#8217;s LIBERTAS OMNIBUS NFT project aims to explore the potential of NFTs within their ecosystem. While the initial airdrop was limited to a specific number of users, the subsequent multi-stage distribution process will provide an opportunity for more community members to participate and receive the LIBERTAS OMNIBUS NFTs.</p>



<p>As the project progresses and additional details are unveiled during EthCC, zkSync continues to engage with the community and demonstrate their commitment to inclusivity and fair distribution practices.</p>

<p>The student was believed to have helped the group launder illegal funds by using e-wallet accounts to trade digital coins, concealing the origins and flow of the crime proceeds. The digital coins were ultimately transferred to e-wallet accounts overseas to evade detection. The syndicate set up bank accounts in mainland China to collect crime proceeds generated through various scams. </p>



<p>Members then used debit cards to launder illegal funds by purchasing valuables such as gold ornaments and watches in Hong Kong, which were later resold. The group bought digital coins as an extra layer of transactions to conceal the flow of illegal funds. The Hong Kong police began investigating the syndicate in late April after receiving intelligence and cooperated with their mainland Chinese counterparts.</p>



<p>The six suspects, aged 22 to 36, were arrested in a series of raids across the city on Thursday. They included the alleged ringleader, two core members, and an employee at a watch shop. The student was one of the two alleged core members, while the other two were accused of helping the syndicate use bank cards to make purchases in the city. The group was detained on suspicion of conspiracy to launder crime proceeds and defraud. </p>



<p>Officers seized more than HK$1 million in cash and valuables such as watches and gold ornaments, along with debit cards, during the operation. The suspects were still in police custody as of Friday afternoon, and the investigation was ongoing. Senior Inspector Chu Ming-man of the Hong Kong Island anti-triad squad urged young people to be extra vigilant when taking on summer jobs and reminded merchants to verify the authenticity of buyers&#8217; identities and bank cards.</p>



<p>In Hong Kong, money laundering is punishable by up to 14 years in jail and a HK$5 million fine. Officers from the financial intelligence and investigation bureau also arrested 18 residents on Thursday in a separate operation in a crackdown on a criminal syndicate that laundered more than HK$46 million in illegal funds through over 110 bank accounts. </p>



<p>The illegal funds were generated from 54 cases of deception that occurred since December, including telephone deception, internet love scams, online investment fraud, and email swindles. The suspects, consisting of 11 men and seven women aged 23 to 61, were still being held for questioning as of Friday afternoon.</p>

Former SEC Official Reveals Shaky Ground 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On December 22, 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs Inc. for conducting an unregistered securities offering of over $1.3 billion in XRP, Ripple&#8217;s native token. The lawsuit has been a hot topic in the cryptocurrency community, with many wondering whether XRP should be classified as a security.</p>



<p>Former SEC official John Reed Stark said that the <a href="https://coincu.com/202656-xrp-price-surges-by-80-as-us-judge-rules/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/202656-xrp-price-surges-by-80-as-us-judge-rules/" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP </a>decision resides on shaky ground, the SEC is likely for appeal and will likely result in reversal. In the Ripple decision, the Court breaks down the Ripple offering into three categories and rules separately on each category: &#8220;Institutional sales,&#8221; &#8220;Programmatic sales,&#8221; and &#8220;Other Sales.&#8221;</p>



<p>With respect to category one, Ripple&#8217;s Institutional Sales of XRP to sophisticated individuals and entities pursuant to written contracts, the court held that XRP was a security when it was sold to institutional investors and thereby constituted an unlawful sale of securities. Those investors are therefore entitled to rescission, and Ripple must pay a penalty for the violation. The court also held that a jury will be needed to decide whether Ripple executives aided and abetted Ripple&#8217;s unregistered issuance.</p>



<p>With respect to category two, sales of XRP to the public (whom the Judge refers to as &#8220;programmatic buyers&#8221; on digital asset exchanges), the court held that XRP was no longer a security when the institutional investors or Ripple sold the XRP anonymously to exchanges because there was no actual privity between exchange customers and Ripple.</p>



<p>With respect to category three, &#8220;Other Distributions,&#8221; the Court concluded that Ripple&#8217;s Other Distributions did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts.</p>



<p>The Ripple decision is troubling on multiple fronts. The SEC&#8217;s position was that this was a traditional application of Howey, but the Ripple decision seems anathema to the SEC&#8217;s mission and authority. Moreover, the Ripple decision appears to declare that if any crypto-issuer sells their tokens through an exchange, then securities regulations do not apply because exchange customers are presumed to not know anything about the crypto-issuer.</p>



<p>The Ripple Court seems to hold that if an issuer does not know who is buying their token and the purchasers do not know who is selling the token, then the token is not a security, even though the issuer used the proceeds from the original, initial sales of the token to fund the issuer&#8217;s operations.</p>



<p>The Ripple decision grants full SEC protection and all remedies that go along with SEC violations to institutional investors, but retail investors are not granted any SEC protection at all. This seems backward to say the least. The Ripple Court appears to distinguish the IPO and trading of Apple from the ICO and trading of a token.</p>

<p>The proposed upgrade outlines a detailed architecture in which the <a href="https://coincu.com/198659-chainlink-data-feeds-go-live-on-celo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celo</a> blockchain would become an Ethereum Layer 2 by initially leveraging the OP Stack. This approach offers several key differentiators, including a decentralized sequencer powered by Celo&#8217;s existing validator set running Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus. It also incorporates an off-chain data availability layer powered by <a href="https://coincu.com/195299-eigenlayer-restaking-deployed-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EigenLayer</a> and EigenDA, operated by Ethereum node operators and protected by restaked ETH. This design enables the platform to maintain its low fees while retaining its 1-block finality.</p>

<p>The transition from an EVM-compatible Layer 1 to an Ethereum Layer 2 solution would be a technical upgrade that does not impact the ecosystem&#8217;s mission. In fact, it is expected to accelerate the path towards that mission. The proposal emphasizes that the ecosystem will continue to foster a financially inclusive community and build openly in the spirit of Web3, bringing real-world use cases to the <a href="https://coincu.com/202925-ethereum-rejects-2000-price-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> ecosystem. At the same time, migrating to an Ethereum Layer 2 solution has the potential to enhance the scope and impact of the blockchain.</p>



<p>Some of the key benefits of this migration include further alignment with Ethereum and EVM compatibility, fostering a seamless developer experience. It also provides stronger security assurances compared to Celo&#8217;s individual security measures. Additionally, it offers a trustless bridge to Ethereum, simplifying liquidity sharing between Celo and Ethereum.</p>



<p>From a community standpoint, the proposed upgrade will not bring changes to existing decentralized applications (dApps) or mobile-first features such as SocialConnect. The growing regenerative finance (ReFi) stack will also remain unaffected. Importantly, the proposed changes will have immaterial impact on gas fees, which is crucial in achieving global financial prosperity and aligns with the core mission of the community. The validator community will continue to play a vital role in operating the network.</p>



<p>By implementing the proposed Layer 2 upgrade, cLabs expects several advantages. Firstly, it will facilitate increased cross-community collaboration between Celo and Ethereum. Celo&#8217;s technical roadmap has historically aligned closely with Ethereum, and this upgrade will provide an opportunity for even deeper collaboration on existing Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and the introduction of new proposals. Secondly, the upgrade will enhance compatibility, making it easier for the platform developers to utilize the full range of Ethereum tooling and libraries. Thirdly, the migration will improve security by anchoring the state on the Ethereum mainnet while leveraging a decentralized source for data availability.</p>

<p>The community has been monitoring Ethereum&#8217;s progress, particularly the developments around Ethereum&#8217;s rollup-centric roadmap. This upgrade proposal reflects the community&#8217;s efforts to future-proof Celo by leveraging Ethereum&#8217;s advancements. It demonstrates the strong connection and overlap between the platform and Ethereum communities, both driven by a shared vision of building a fairer financial system on decentralized technology.</p>



<p>Overall, the proposed transition to an Ethereum Layer 2 solution signifies a significant step for Celo in aligning with Ethereum&#8217;s ecosystem. It aims to combine the strengths of both platforms to create a more inclusive and efficient blockchain infrastructure. The proposal outlines a clear path forward that balances technical considerations, community impact, and mission alignment, offering a promising future for the ecosystem.</p>
