Crypto Twitter’s favorite new meme coin Pepecoin (PEPE) has hit another milestone. With an impressive rally over the last 24 hours, the coin crossed the $1 billion market cap mark and has now solidified its position as a top 100 cryptocurrency. But after rallying over 20,000x since its launch three weeks ago, what could be driving this fresh rally for the meme coin?

The tweet which carried only the single emoji was followed up by another tweet with the emoji but this time with the words “sounds rare” added to it.

The reason for this is that larger exchanges oftentimes require team treasury funds to be secured before they are listed.
