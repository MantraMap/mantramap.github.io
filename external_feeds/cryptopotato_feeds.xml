            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mark Branson &#8211; President of Germany&#8217;s financial market regulator BaFin &#8211; reportedly urged global authorities to cooperate and impose appropriate laws on the cryptocurrency industry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Such rules could grant additional customer protection and prevent the usage of the asset class in illegal activities, he claimed.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8216;Now is the Time&#8217;</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/germany-calls-global-regulation-crypto-industry-2022-12-14/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to Branson, the current supervision of the cryptocurrency sector is not strict enough to keep bad actors away. &#8220;Just let the industry grow as a playground for grownups&#8221; has been the wrong move, he suggested.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He believes all countries&#8217; governments should join hands and form a comprehensive regulatory framework as soon as possible:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Now is the time for serious cryptocurrency regulation. The most important point is that it doesn&#8217;t need just a European solution. It needs a worldwide solution.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Branson has previously shown himself as an advocate of blockchain technology, <a href="https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/interviews/date/2022/html/ssm.in221117~1502f94f4f.en.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">saying</a> it brings &#8220;waves of innovation.&#8221; This novelty, though, could bring along &#8220;freeloaders and crooks&#8221; who can harm investors. He also warned consumers to beware of which crypto projects they invest in as some carry significant risks.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As of the moment, the industry does not pose a threat to global monetary stability, but things could change if lawmakers do not take the necessary measures, Branson concluded.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The leading economy of the European Union has already applied certain rules. For example, only banks that have required licenses can deal with bitcoin and alternative coins.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Crypto trading platforms in Canada can no longer offer leverage to their clients and must segregate their assets with a proper custodian. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With FTX’s collapse spurring global regulators into action against the crypto industry, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) are no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Monday, the association announced an expanded ruleset pertaining to crypto trading platforms in Canada, which would bar them from offering margin or leverage trading to Canadian clients. </span></p>
<h2>No More Leverage</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As </span><a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/news-events/news/csa-provides-update-crypto-trading-platforms-operating-canada" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by the regulator on Wednesday, its new rules will apply to any platform within the country subject to securities legislation, including crypto trading platforms that are yet to register. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unregistered platforms will soon be given a deadline by which they must submit a pre-registration undertaking (PRU) to its principal regulator, in which it promises to comply with the requirements expected of already registered entities. If they don’t, they may face enforcement action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The expanded terms for compliant platforms include requirements to keep Canadian clients’ assets held with an “appropriate custodian,” and to segregate those assets from the company’s proprietary business. They also prohibit  “offering margin or leverage for any Canadian client.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Custodians will generally be considered qualified if they are regulated by a financial regulator in Canada, the U.S., or a similar jurisdiction with a supervisory regime for conduct and financial regulation,” read the regulator’s statement. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though the regulator did not mention FTX by name, both custodial and margin trading issues are widely understood to have been key contributors to the exchange’s downfall. Specifically, bankruptcy lawyer John Ray </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-used-client-assets-for-margin-trading-at-alameda-confirms-bankruptcy-lawyer/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">alleged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> under oath on Tuesday that FTX commingled client assets with Alameda Research, where they were traded and lost on margin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Multiple crypto firms including Celsius, Voyager, and BlockFi have gone </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mike-novogratz-admits-crypto-was-more-leveraged-than-he-thought/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">bankrupt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> this year after using client assets to margin trade, contributing to some higher-than-expected drawdowns in the crypto market. </span></p>
<h2>Stablecoin Securities</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The CSA added that stablecoins – tokens that are price pegged to fiat currencies, like USDC and USDT – are viewed by the regulator as securities. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Crypto trading platforms… are reminded that they are prohibited from permitting Canadian clients to trade, or obtain exposure to, any crypto asset that is itself a security and/or a derivative,” it stated. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gary Gensler, head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has also posited that stablecoins could constitute securities, alongside most other cryptocurrencies. Only Bitcoin, in his view, can be definitively categorized as a commodity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While other politicians within the country once considered Ether to also classify as a commodity, both senator </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/senator-lummis-now-believes-ether-is-a-security/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cynthia Lummis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and Commodities and Futures Trading Commission chair </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cftc-chair-changes-his-mind-about-ethereum-being-a-commodity/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rostin Benham</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> have recently flipped on this issue.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The Fed's latest rate hike takes the central bank’s target interest rate above 4%. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin saw more volatility on Wednesday following a Federal Open Markets Committee meeting, during which the U.S. central bank agreed to raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.5%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement, which aligned with market expectations, signals the Fed’s first movement this year to slow the hawkish momentum of monetary policy. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Federal Reserve unveiled its decision at 14:00 EDT, Bitcoin immediately fell from $18,300 to $17,850 within five minutes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The asset reversed course shortly after, trading for $17,960 at writing time. </span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from </span><a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinGlass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the crypto market move has contributed to $44 million in liquidations within the past 24 hours, most of which came from Bitcoin trades.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest single liquidation was for an ETH-BUSD trade on Binance for $1.04 million</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into the meeting, the market priced in a roughly 80% chance of a 50 basis point rise, with a 20% likelihood of a fifth 75-point rise, according to the CME’s </span><a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FedWatch tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With the prior ringing true, the central bank’s target rate lies between 4.25% and 4.5%. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed has raised rates throughout 2022 in an effort to combat record-high CPI inflation. With November’s inflation numbers showing signs that their efforts are working, market participants expect the hikes to slow heading into 2023.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous other central banks appear to be reeling in rates as well. The Bank of Canada </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-touches-21k-as-bank-of-canada-flashes-signs-of-pivot/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 50 basis point hike back in October, with the Bank of England </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-stable-at-19k-despite-boes-50-basis-point-interest-rate-hike/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">following suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Nations has </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fed-will-trigger-a-global-recession-if-rate-hikes-continue-united-nations/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pressured</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Federal Reserve to reverse course on its interest rate boosts for months, citing risks of a potential global recession.

			            <description><![CDATA[Alameda had its orders processed milliseconds faster than its rivals at FTX, giving it a substantial trading edge. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had alleged that Alameda Research was offered a secret “time advantage” when executing trades at the defunct crypto exchange FTX. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The revelation adds to a growing list of claims and evidence suggesting that FTX and Alameda were not nearly as independent as once publicly portrayed. </span></p>
<h2>The Alameda Advantage</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As </span><a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ftx-s-systems-gave-alameda-trades-a-secret-speed-edge-cftc-says-1.1859043" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Bloomberg, Alameda was able to skirt and sidestep certain aspects of FTX’s trading procedures and verification processes. The CFTC made such claims in a complaint filed on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, while most customers using an API had to route their transaction orders through FTX’s system, Alameda was able to bypass parts of the system, granting them faster access to the API. “These advantages were not publicly disclosed” and yielded a “significant speed advantage,” said the CFTC.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alameda’s transaction orders were received several milliseconds faster than those of other API users,” the agency continued in the suit. “In the high-frequency trading sector, this is a significant time advantage.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alameda had other features baked within its account that let it execute certain trades without first verifying that it had the available funds required. Rival customers placing several orders at once would receive sequential checks from FTX to ensure each transaction was viable, of which “did not apply to the Alameda account.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-regulators-probe-ftx-for-mismanagement-of-client-assets-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">investigating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> FTX in November over mismanagement of client assets, in which Alameda is largely suspected to be involved. It </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-what-sbf-is-facing-after-the-sec-charged-him-with-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> both firms, alongside owner Sam Bankman-Fried on Tuesday, for allegedly engaging in a multi-year scheme to defraud investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bankman-Fried has already been arrested and </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sbf-to-spend-christmas-in-prison-after-being-denied-parole-by-the-bahamas/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">jailed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Bahamian regulators on behalf of the US Department of Justice and is set to remain in prison past Christmas. </span></p>
<h2>Alameda’s “God Mode”</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though Bankman-Fried denies being closely involved with Alameda’s governance, FTX Group’s bankruptcy lawyer John Ray </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-used-client-assets-for-margin-trading-at-alameda-confirms-bankruptcy-lawyer/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">claimed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> otherwise while testifying before congress on Tuesday. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will note that he owned 90% of Alameda,” he said. “There’s no distinction whatsoever. The owners of the company could have free reign across all siloes.” </span></p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s CPI announcement was a significant relief for Bitcoin investors, as declining inflation would likely lead to a bullish trend for risk assets. However, there is still room for caution from a technical analysis standpoint, as the price has yet to break any major resistance level.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: Edris</p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has finally reached the $18K resistance area and is currently trying to break it to the upside. The 50-day moving average, located around the same price, is providing additional resistance at the moment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that a bullish breakout from this significant resistance level could likely lead to a further rally towards the higher boundary of the large descending channel around the $20K mark.</p>
<p>In opposition, if the price gets rejected to the downside, a rapid decline toward the $15K support area would be probable, as there would be no obstacle to holding the price on this timeframe.</p>
<figure id="attachment_228778" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-228778" style="width: 1621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-14-2022.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-228778 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-14-2022.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_141201" width="1621" height="853" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-14-2022.jpg 1621w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-14-2022-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-14-2022-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-14-2022-768x404.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-14-2022-1536x808.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSDT-Daily-Dec-14-2022-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1621px) 100vw, 1621px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-228778" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>
The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, the price has finally broken above the $17K mark and is testing the $18K resistance. A breakout from the mentioned level could pave the way for a surge toward $21K in the short term.</p>
<p>However, the RSI indicator is already showcasing a red flag, as the indicator is deep into the overbought area, currently trending around the 80% mark. This signal could point to a pullback or bearish reversal in the coming days, leading to a likely retest of the $17K area.</p>
<p>Considering the relatively high likelihood for the Feds to ease back on the rate hikes and the price&#8217;s recent bullish momentum, a breakout above $18K would be the more probable outcome.</p>
<p>The RSI overbought signal should not be taken lightly, especially until the price still trades below the mentioned $18K resistance level.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Damage from FTX fallout has been widespread and Robinhood's near-term outlook appears to be gloomy. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Citi downgraded Robinhood Markets (HOOD) stock to &#8216;Neutral&#8217; from &#8216;Buy&#8217; due to potential risks from upcoming market structure proposals by the United States SEC, a cautious equity market outlook, and the impact of bankrupt-platform FTX spilling over the crypto trading revenue and client base.</p>
<p>The analyst stated that the timing of that is &#8220;uncertain.&#8221; It is also important to note that the implosion has removed it from the list of possible Robinhood acquirers. Citi analysts Christopher Allen and Ygal Arounian slashed his price target to $10 from $11 on HOOD shares.</p>
<h2>Mixed Outlook</h2>
<p>In a new research report, the analysts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/citi-downgrades-robinhood-says-crypto-uncertainty-will-weigh-on-trading-platform.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">wrote</a> that Robinhood has gotten many things right, such as materially lowering the cost base, improving active trader offerings, and rolling out attractive products. But they described &#8220;a mixed outlook&#8221; in the near term while detailing several &#8220;potential implications&#8221; for Robinhood stemming from FTX&#8217;s catastrophic collapse.</p>
<p>Citi also mentioned the &#8220;potential liquidation of 56.3 million HOOD shares (7.4% of outstanding)&#8221; owned by Sam Bankman-Fried &#8211; the disgraced chief of FTX &#8211; through Emergent Fidelity Technologies.</p>
<p>The duo also expects Robinhood&#8217;s revenue from crypto trading to decline by over 50% in 2023 after a similar extent of slump this year. While the latest report did forecast a stable outlook for its equities operations, significant growth may not transpire given the choppy market trend. Having said that, Allen is bullish on the options activity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the analysts are also positive about Robinhood&#8217;s longer-term outlook citing the company&#8217;s &#8220;solid balance sheet, monetization of account growth potential, and brand recognition, but near-term see(s) a balance risk/reward.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Navigating Through Chaotic Market</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, Bankman-Fried extracted a 7.6% stake in the trading app worth $648 million in the belief that the shares would &#8220;represent an attractive investment.&#8221;  As his crypto exchange slid into bankruptcy, the founder&#8217;s Robinhood stake became the biggest liquid line item on his balance sheet that he could potentially sell.</p>
<p>In a bid to navigate through the turbulent year, Robinhood <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/robinhoods-crypto-revenue-dropped-by-12-last-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> plans to lay off 23% of its staff last month amid shrinking revenue and declining user numbers. Despite crypto going downhill, the company&#8217;s CEO Vlad Tenev was bullish on the asset class. While speaking at CNBC’s Squawk Box, the exec stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We still see opportunities with crypto. I think in particular customers have been looking for regulated safer options, particularly customers in the US.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Since the collapse of FTX, Solana has been moving sideways, consolidating above $12. But now the price action is giving hints that this may change soon, and interestingly, the positivity came a day after SBF was arrested.</p>
<h2>Solana Price Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $12.5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $15.5</strong></p>
<p>Solana found good support at $12, and the price never went under this key level since November. Buyers now appear eager to take SOL higher and challenge the resistance at $15. While the current momentum remains flat, this can easily change.</p>

<h2>Technical Indicators</h2>
<p><strong>Trading Volume:</strong> The buying volume picked up yesterday and has closed in green which could lead to continuation.</p>
<p><strong>RSI</strong>: The daily RSI is moving higher with higher lows and higher highs. This is promising and bullish.</p>
<p><strong>MACD</strong>: The daily MACD is bullish, but the momentum remains flat, as indicated by the histogram. If the buying pressure picks up, this could soon change to favor bulls.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for SOL is neutral. To turn bullish, buyers would have to take Solana above $15.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for SOL Price</h2>
<p>With the sellers exhausted, Solana seems to have only one way to go, which is up. Even if this materializes, bears may still return at the $15 key resistance.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PR &#8211; Singapore, Singapore, 13th December, 2022, Chainwire]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.staderlabs.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stader Labs</a>, a leading multi-chain liquid staking protocol, has announced that it is launching its liquid staking solution, ETHx for Ethereum. This week, Stader Labs published its <a href="https://blog.staderlabs.com/stader-x-ethereum-our-vision-5b86a3dbc575" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">vision</a> for Ethereum which sheds light on what to expect.</p>
<p><strong>The State of Ethereum Staking</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, a glance at the state of Ethereum staking today shows that liquid staking has emerged as the most popular way (33% of all staked eth) for users to stake Ethereum, followed by CEXs (29%). And within the liquid staking ecosystem, there’s a dominant protocol, Lido, that has a market share of ~90%. Additionally, the problem is only made worse by Lido’s model of working with a limited set of ~30 permissioned node operators. And, across Lido and the top 2 CEXs in Coinbase &amp; Kraken, over 50% of all staked Eth flows through just these 3 entities. This clearly highlights the need for more robust alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Stader x Ethereum: Vision</strong></p>
<p>Stader’s vision on Ethereum is to deliver a liquid staking product that can find the right balance of being user backward (think great UX, staking yield, Defi integrations), scalable (can support user demand), and a force for decentralization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stader’s approach to delivering this vision will be 3-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>A hybrid ecosystem of permissionless and permissioned node operators with a focus on decentralization. The permissioned set will enable Stader to continue to scale as the permissionless ecosystem develops to support  billions of dollars in staked assets</li>
<li>Lower bonding requirements for permissionless operators, fully reflecting the non-punitive nature of ETH staking design, especially for non-malicious performance issues. Plus, Stader will adopt cutting edge DVT technologies that significantly lower the risk of slashing and penalties</li>
<li>Actively developing DeFi around its soon-to-be-released liquid token, ETHx. Leveraging the experience of building Defi offerings across chains, where Stader has integrations across top Defi protocols like AAVE, Balancer, QiDAO, Beefy Finance, Venus, Apeswap and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking on the eve of the launch announcement, Amitej Gajjala, Co-founder and CEO, Stader Labs said:</p>
<p>“In line with our vision to bring staking to 1 bn users, we are happy to bring our well-loved liquid staking solution to Ethereum and add to the liquid staking diversity on ETH. Our focus will be on delivering a solution that users love, think highest staking yield, and fantastic Defi opportunities, while also furthering decentralization of Eth staking by enabling anyone to operate nodes for ETHx permissionlessly from day 1”.</p>
<p>Stader has already received grants from SSV Network, the leading distributed validator technology (DVT) provider, and here’s what Alon Muroch, Lead developer at SSV had to share:</p>
<p>“We are excited to see Stader build on Ethereum and SSV. Stader is one of the largest liquid staking protocols, with ~110 mn $ in TVL and presence across 6 chains, and it&#8217;s good to see them add to the liquid staking diversity on Ethereum. We are glad to partner with them on this journey and have them as early adopters of DVT. The resilience provided by DVT will enable them to be a force for decentralization on Ethereum”.</p>
<p>A white paper, laying out Stader’s ETHx design, is expected in December 2022 with the mainnet launch scheduled for Q1 2023.</p>
<p><strong>About Stader</strong></p>
<p>Founded in April 2021, <a href="https://www.staderlabs.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stader Labs</a> is a non-custodial multi-chain liquid staking platform with over USD 110 Mn+ PoS assets staked. Currently live on 6 chains (including BNB Chain, Polygon, Hedera, Fantom, Near, etc.), users can stake PoS tokens, earn staking yields, and also amplify yields across several DeFi opportunities like Aave, Balancer, etc</p>
<p>Over 25,000+ wallets have been staked with Stader. Stader is backed by notable funds including Coinbase Ventures, Pantera, Jump Crypto, Accel Partners and Accomplice.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PR &#8211; Singapore, Singapore, 12th December, 2022, Chainwire]</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/3ha75Qa" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BinaryX</a> launches a new 220,000 BNX Cyber Incubation Fund, aimed at driving the growth and adoption of Web3 games.</p>
<p>The fund, supported by the project team, seed investors and members of the BNX community, will be used to invest in on-chain gaming projects that utilize or are experimenting with blockchain technology. BinaryX is also offering advisory services alongside the fund to bolster support for projects under the fund.</p>
<p>The fund will be used to provide resources and all forms of support for games at any stage, including early-stage, and late-stage development.</p>
<h2>BinaryX Incubation Fund Distribution Breakdown</h2>
<p>The fund distribution comes from the overall BinaryX fund as pictured below:</p>
<p>BinaryX will allocate 8% of their overall funds to the Cyber Incubation Fund, the amount is $12 million USD at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Rudy, Head of Growth at BinaryX, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“BinaryX is committed to accelerating the adoption of Web3 technologies in gaming. The fund is not limited to supporting blockchain games already in the space, but also traditional developer teams who want to experiment with blockchain in their games or NFTs. We believe in the overall growth and adoption of blockchain within the gaming ecosystem, and we will strive to support any project that is promising to that effect.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since launching the incubation arm mid-2022, BinaryX has invested in and incubated 2 GameFi projects. Its portfolio includes SHIT games, and Rh!noX NFT collection, with several exciting projects underway.</p>
<p>BinaryX will accelerate its search and adoption of projects in need of incubation, and offer support across all stages, including early-stage and late-stage development.</p>
<p>With this incubation arm, BinaryX aims to connect projects with BinaryX’s network of resources, advisors and investors to help projects go to launch. The Incubation Fund is open to receive applications and all year round, providing iterative support to any project at any stage of development.</p>
<p>The news comes amidst <a href="http://bit.ly/3UHivc0" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">already refuted rumours</a> that BinaryX is selling tokens. To reiterate their stance, Rudy said, ‘We would like to emphasize that there was no foul play from our team. We are entirely focused on our games, and we have been communicating our upcoming plans transparently.’ The team has just arranged a DAO vote to decide on the buy back plan for BNX, and are working to execute it alongside other strategic plans for long-term growth, including the development of their latest game, CyberLand.</p>
<h2>About BinaryX</h2>
<p>BinaryX is the GameFi platform behind play-to-earn games CyberDragon and CyberChess, both of which run on the BNB chain.</p>
<p>BinaryX began as a decentralised derivative trading system. The team gradually evolved into developing decentralised video games, and is now transitioning to becoming a GameFi platform offering IGO services to bridge Web2 developers to Web3.</p>
<p>As one of the top 10 projects on the BNB Chain, BinaryX has a vast community of more than 100k coin holders and 17K monthly active wallets. It is also one of the largest metaverse projects by trading volume on the BNB chain. BinaryX also has a token, $BNX, that has consistently demonstrated strong performance despite the bear market.</p>
