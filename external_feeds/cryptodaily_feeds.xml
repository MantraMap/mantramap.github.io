			  <description><![CDATA[<p>There are some exciting crypto competitions taking place in the world of cryptocurrency right now. These competitions are often an exciting backdoor into buying crypto and are always enticing propositions for investors. Right now, there are some exciting crypto competitions taking place and we&rsquo;ll take a closer look at three of them hosted by the meme coin DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI), the crypto exchange Crypto.com and CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>DogeMiyagi Widening Its Reach On Twitter With Its Crypto Competition</p>
<p>DogeMiyagi is the latest meme coin to have caught the attention in recent weeks. It&rsquo;s currently in the process of a presale with real aspirations of being a prominent cryptocurrency when it eventually goes live. Inspired by the iconic Karate Kid films, it&rsquo;s currently hosting a crypto competition, shared on its Twitter pages, to widen its reach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rules of DogeMiyagi&rsquo;s crypto competition are straightforward: whoever spends the most on MIYAGI tokens between the 24th and 30th of May will receive double their amount of tokens in that period. It represents an interesting proposition for investors. They will undoubtedly be racing with others to see who can buy the most in MIYAGI tokens, and for the winner, the rewards will be an incredible return.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Crypto.com Offering Competition With SHIB</p>
<p>Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has introduced a fresh trading competition that incorporates Shiba Inu's SHIB. Participants in this contest are required to engage in a spot trade of no less than $100 for SHIB, GEL, or SAND, giving them the opportunity to win up to $1,000.</p>
<p>As per the official announcement, there is a chance for the top 20 traders to secure a maximum reward of $1,000. It is worth mentioning that Crypto.com recently initiated another trading competition for the governance token of Shiba Inu, known as ShibaSwap (BONE). Winners of this event can participate in a total rewards pool of $5,000. In a similar manner, the top 20 spot traders of BONE have the chance to win up to $1,000. At the time of writing, SHIB experienced a 5.14% decline within the last 24 hours, reaching a value of $0.00001093. BONE also witnessed a decline of 6.76%, settling at $1.</p>
<p>CoinMarketCap Is Introducing a Novel Crypto Competition</p>
<p>CoinMarketCap, a crypto price tracking website, is entering reality television by introducing a competition show named "Killer Whales," seemingly inspired by the TV series &ldquo;Shark Tank.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In collaboration with Web3 entertainment company Hello Labs, this new program offers entrepreneurs the opportunity to present their projects to the panel of "Killer Whale" judges, consisting of entrepreneurs, influencers, and founders of Web3 companies. Hello Labs was established by Paul Caslin, who is known for producing the MTV VMA Awards.</p>
<p>Jonathan Isaac, the chief marketing officer at CoinMarketCap, stated, "Killer Whales is an enjoyable and thrilling way to bring the entrepreneurial spirit of the Web3 space to households around the world," in a press release.</p>
<p>Starting from the 2nd of May, interested individuals can submit their applications to Hello.one and CoinMarketCap. Selected candidates will undergo multiple rounds of interviews in Hollywood. The show's filming is scheduled to commence in June, and it will be made available on major streaming platforms as well as Hello Labs' on-demand Hello TV service.</p>
<p>CEO of Hello Labs, Sander Gortjes, stated, "Our aim is to engage and educate the next billion users about Web3 by providing them with entertainment on various aspects of cryptocurrency," emphasising the intention to facilitate broader adoption.</p>
<p>In recent months, a number of television shows related to Web3 have emerged, showcasing the diverse applications of blockchain technology and the growing interest in cryptocurrencies among mass media consumers. Co-creator of "Rick and Morty,"&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Want to be the MVP of your own investment game and make all the right calls?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fun meets investment&rdquo; &mdash; that has been the core of meme coins for almost a decade now. As the fandom of these joke coins expands, the time has come to welcome projects that offer a blend of light-hearted investment adventure and adrenaline-pumping gaming experience!</p>
<p>Enter Big Eyes Coin (BIG), the game-changer that propels your financial ambitions to triumphant heights! With a plethora of product offerings up its alley and exciting dates slated for launch, this rapidly ascending meme and play-to-earn (P2E) project embodies the grace and agility of a crafty striker. No doubt that its GameFi launch on August 29, 2023, will dazzle both seasoned players and newcomers alike, leaving them spellbound and craving for more! The story unfolds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BIG Milestones</p>
<p>The whistle is about to blow, and the stage is set ablaze with anticipation. Big Eyes Coin emerges as a fireball, casting a radiant glow upon the world of investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>June 3, 2023: Presale Wrap-Up</p>
<p>After nine months of playing in the presale arena, Big Eyes Coin is finally ready to join the big leagues. But before the finale, BIG tries to entice its Kitty Cuddlers one last time, in the shape of Stage 3 Price Rollback!</p>
<p>As a result of this price slashing, BIG has been rapidly accumulating million-dollar presale funds daily &mdash; currently at $43.7 million! The Stage 3 price comeback has also made way for the unrolling of the ever-shiny Stage 14. If this presses on, BIG would just need $7.8 million to hit its presale hard cap of $51.5 million at Stage 15!</p>
<p>June 15, 2023: Big Eyes Coin Launching</p>
<p>Exactly 12 days after the presale closing, BIG plans to officially launch on June 15, 2023.</p>
<p>Here are some things you should enjoy once Big Eyes hits the big leagues:</p>
<ul>
<li>BIG token price at $0.0006;</li>
<li>Fully-diluted market cap at around $96 million &mdash; since 80% of its 200-billion total supply is in circulation;</li>
<li>Tier-1 CEX and DEX listing;</li>
<li>Fee-free buy/tax transactions &mdash; except for gas fees; and</li>
<li>Groundbreaking collaborations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s Almost Here: Big Eyes Casino!</p>
<p>On August 29, 2023, just over two months after its debut, BIG will unleash its groundbreaking move: the Big Eyes Casino and P2E Gaming Platform! This will offer 4,000+ cutting-edge games exclusively rewarding the Kitty Cuddlers with BIG tokens.</p>
<p>This BIG move may seem like a straightforward one. But, it can actually be the catalyst of a more sustainable BIG, fostering a sprightly community, and thereafter strengthening the token's adoption and ecosystem. How?</p>
<p>BIG&rsquo;s GameFi foray will attract gaming enthusiasts and investors seeking the best P2E projects. As a result, it will drive user demand for BIG, catapulting the token&rsquo;s trading volume and market capitalization to the moon! The best part? It will reduce the token supply available on exchanges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Crypto Community: The Close-Knit Kitty Cuddlers&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin, a cat-inspired cryptocurrency on Ethereum, goes beyond wealth generation. It shines with generosity, supporting charitable causes worldwide, and donating $16,000 to different organizations worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the heart of BIG lies its dedicated team, always attentive to the cheers of the crowd. As such, BIG responded to its community's plea for an earlier kickoff before reaching its hard cap &mdash; so its Kitty Cuddlers could experience Big Eyes&rsquo; full grandeur.</p>
<p>Tick Tock!</p>
<p>The countdown for the most spectacular series of launches you&rsquo;ve ever seen has started! As the saying goes, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a spectator, be a player.&rdquo; Hence, escape the sidelines and dive into the realm of savvy investors, where thrilling rewards await.</p>
<p>Be An Early Adopter to Grab BIG Rewards Early On!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a recent announcement, an EU watchdog emphasised the need for measures to prevent excessive leveraged bets on crypto assets.</p>
<p>The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) has made a range of recommendations with which to address the challenges faced by the crypto sector. Among the proposed actions, the ESRB suggested implementing stringent regulations such as mandatory regular reports from all companies involved in crypto assets. Additionally, it highlighted the necessity of specific rules tailored to the largest firms operating within this space.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past 18 months, marked by significant fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin and with the collapse of various crypto institutions.</p>
<p>Highlighting the potential rapid emergence of systemic risks, the ESRB stressed the urgency of addressing these issues. As highlighted in a Reuters article earlier today, the report cautioned that if the industry's exponential growth trajectory persists, crypto-assets could pose a threat to financial stability.</p>
<p>Proposing an amendment to existing EU regulations, the ESRB recommended the introduction of leverage limits for investment funds exposed to crypto-assets. By curbing the extent of leverage employed, the aim is to mitigate the potential risks associated with highly leveraged bets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ESRB called for higher collateral requirements for distributed finance products and stablecoins, further bolstering risk management within the crypto space.</p>
<p>While these recommendations are not legally binding, they hold significant weight and are expected to influence the EU's future endeavours in refining its regulatory framework for crypto assets. As the EU revisits its markets in cryptoassets regulation (MiCA), it is likely to take these suggestions into serious consideration.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Robinhood has been a top online investing and trading platform for many years. Nevertheless, it has also been the subject of litigation, public outcry, and allegations from the SEC for some of its operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiple new and old trading platforms are trying to capitalize on these Robinhood shortcomings and emerge as fan favorites. One of them will be Tradecurve, an upcoming DEX (decentralized exchange) currently in its presale stage that some analysts believe has the potential to become a top 3 trading platform, surpassing Robinhood in the process. Today, we will compare these exchanges and find out what makes Tradecurve so appealing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Robinhood vs. Tradecurve - Ease of use</p>
<p>One point of criticism that has been brought up for Robinhood is its sign-up KYC requirement. This eliminates any chance of anonymity while trading, something new traders aim for. Not only that, Robinhood offers more simplistic resources that may not be appealing to the more experienced traders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a clear difference between Robinhood and Tradecurve, as the latter will not require any sign-up KYC checks. Tradecurve users may simply create an account using their email, connect their crypto wallet to the platform and begin trading. This removal will solve the issue of "no anonymity," as users can now trade in complete privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robinhood vs. Tradecurve - Social trading</p>
<p>Another difference between Robinhood and Tradecurve is that Robinhood offers no social trading opportunities. In comparison, Tradecurve will possess copy trading, meaning users can copy the trades of other individuals for a subscription fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, traders will benefit from their subscribers while also providing complete transparency to those subscribers regarding the traders real-time trading outcomes, which are maintained on-chain. Meanwhile, the subscribers can generate profits from other traders' choices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robinhood vs. Tradecurve - Range of offerings</p>
<p>There are several differences between Tradecurve and Robinhood regarding the assets they provide. Investors may trade stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrency, and options with Robinhood. The same assets, futures, and gold are available through Tradecurve. Regarding the range of trading options, Tradecurve will surpass Robinhood. Tradecurve's high-leverage products, which start at a leverage ratio of 500:1, will also be available on just one account.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Final Verdict&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many traders would be hesitant to utilize Robinhood as their preferred platform because of a history of lack of transparency around downtime and asset trading limitations. Because of this, Tradecurve is the clear winner as it will provide a decentralized hybrid trading platform that offers low fees, privacy, and borderless access to millions of global traders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors have been backing this upcoming platform by buying its utility token, TCRV, which is currently worth only $0.012. Interest in this project can also be seen by its total token sales - 20M of tokens as a whole. And since the presale is now in Stage 2, by the time it finishes, this number may skyrocket with its value accompanying it. Experts predict that a 50x increase is in store and a 100x one when the TCRV utility token gets listed on Uniswap after its launch. Those interested can invest in this upcoming top 3 trading platform by following the links below and signing up for its presale.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">With the rapid expansion of the crypto space, investors are constantly seeking the next promising project. Currently, Chainlink (LINK) investors are amassing a large amount of Sparklo's SPRK token. Sparklo is currently at the second stage of its token presale and investors' interest in the project has been overwhelming. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Sparklo (SPRK): own fractional shares in precious metals</p>
<p class="s7">Investing in precious metals has always been reserved for the affluent, primarily due to the high capital requirements. However, a significant shift is on the horizon, thanks to the imminent arrival of Sparklo. Leveraging fractionalization and blockchain technology, Sparklo is set to make the sector accessible to everyone.</p>
<p class="s7">When an individual invests in the platform, an NFT is minted to represent the individual's investment. Interestingly, these NFTs are backed by precious metals such as gold, platinum, and silver. Additionally, Sparklo will collaborate with jewelry stores to launch their products on its marketplace. This will give investors firsthand access to this jewelry at discount prices.</p>
<p class="s7">Notably, the Sparklo team has already obtained a KYC application from the Block Audit Report, signaling its commitment to transparency and compliance. At present, the SPRK token presale is underway, with tokens available at just $0.026 per token. This presents a remarkable opportunity for smart investors to join the project before prices skyrocket by 50x.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Chainlink (LINK) price breaks out of bearish cycles momentarily</p>
<p class="s7">The downward pressure that Chainlink (LINK) experienced starting from April 19th, 2023, appears to have died down lately. During this period, Chainlink's (LINK) price declined from $8.57 to a low of $6.37, marking a dip of 25.67%. As of press time, Chainlink (LINK) is showing bullish signals, trading at $6.53. Also, Chainlink's (LINK) 24-hour trading volume has surged by 88.90% within the past 24 hours.</p>
<p class="s7">The Fear &amp; Greed Index of Chainlink (LINK) is at 76% (Extreme Greed), implying that market sentiment is predominantly inclined toward buying sentiment. Chainlink (LINK) is currently oscillating between its immediate support level of $6.212 and resistance level of $6.773. Notably, the subsequent significant support level is positioned at $5.404, while the next resistance level stands at $7.5. Depending on the direction of the market, whether from bulls or bears, Chainlink (LINK) may reach these levels in the near future.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">There are over 22,000 cryptocurrencies in the coin market today, yet new coins are introduced almost daily. Uwerx is one of these new coins, and it is already turning heads with its impressive presale. Having completed its first, second, and third presale, this freelance-focused project is the coin to watch in the crypto market. </p>
<p class="s6">This article will explore why Uwerx is turning heads in its presale. But first, we shall look at the latest development in Chiliz (CHZ) and Filecoin (FIL).</p>
<p class="s9">Chiliz (CHZ): Made For Sport Fans</p>
<p class="s6">After Chiliz (CHZ) introduced the One Shirt Pledge in April 2023, the coin experienced a slight rise in price. The One Shirt Pledge was introduced to get athletes to raise money for goals like LGBTQ Acceptance, Gender Equity, and even for support for people affected by earthquakes. This One Shirt Pledge has been a success so far. </p>
<p class="s6">Chiliz then moved on to other ventures. They partnered with Sony Pictures to promote the latest Spider-Man movie, Through the Spider-verse. </p>
<p class="s6">On May 10, 2023, Chiliz (CHZ) announced the launch of the Chiliz Chain mainnet. According to the announcement, The Chiliz Chain Mainnet is the first-of-its-kind blockchain infrastructure for sports and entertainment. On the same day, they announced that the Chiliz Bridge was officially live. Users can use the bridge to migrate their $CHZ from the Ethereum mainnet (ERC-20) to Chiliz Chain (CAP-20).</p>
<p class="s6">Thanks to these new collaborations and innovations, Chiliz (CHZ) experienced a slight rise in value. But in the past 24 hours, Chiliz (CHZ) has fallen by -0.94% and currently trades at $0.11. Although traders and fans still expect a rise soon, analysts advise them to turn to the ongoing Uwerx presale for a chance at profits before the year runs out.</p>
<p class="s9">Filecoin (FIL) Data Storage Innovation Grows</p>
<p class="s6">Filecoin (FIL) has become a critical addition to the decentralized web. This is thanks to its innovative approach to data storage. The project recently made several announcements, including the release of Waterlily, the IPC Subnet, and FIL Covered Call Vaults. </p>
<p class="s6">Waterlily is a generative AI art platform that utilizes the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) to pay artists for their pictures or designs. In addition, the IPC Subnet helps in facilitating high-performance use cases for the apps on FVM. Finally, the FIL Covered Call Vaults is a novel financial product that enables FIL holders to generate additional income by selling call options on their FIL assets. </p>
<p class="s6">Thanks to these innovations, Filecoin (FIL) has performed below better in the past 24 hours. The project sells for $4.42, a 2.16% increase from the last 24 hours. Filecoin (FIL) is ranked #31 in the coin market, with a market cap of $1,866,102,488. </p>
<p class="s6">Analysts believe that as more traders and companies seek decentralized data solutions, Filecoin (FIL) will continue to grow.</p>
<p class="s9">Uwerx (WERX): Set To Break Records In the Freelance Industry </p>
<p class="s6">The freelance industry proved its resilience during the pandemic. While other industries recorded losses, the freelance industry experienced exponential growth. This strong and ever-growing industry is where Uwerx is coming in to make much-needed changes that will benefit freelancers and investors. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx will solve the issues of pending payments, lack of transparency in pricing, high fees, etc. It will provide real-world value while offering incentives to users. So what will freelancers benefit from Uwerx? </p>
<p class="s6">With its blockchain technology, Uwerx will bring decentralization, faster payments, intellectual property rights protection, and affordable fees to the freelance industry. These are features that freelancers have been craving in the industry.</p>
<p class="s6">Regarding fees, traditional freelance platforms charge as high as 20% as a transaction fee, but that will not be the case with Uwerx. Uwerx will charge only 1%. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx has set strong foundations to make it a reckoning force in the freelance sector and the coin market.</p>
<p class="s6">The developers had initially decided to place a 25-year liquidity lock on their tokens, starting at the end of the Uwerx presale. But after a poll in which 82.8% of the Uwerx community favored locking the developer's tokens prior to the end of the presale, the team has agreed to activate the lock before the end of the presale at a soon-to-be-announced date.</p>
<p class="s6">The project has completed audits from InterFi Network and SolidProof before the presale. In addition, the team announced that they would renounce smart contract ownership of Uwerx when the project is ready to list on centralized exchanges. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx is available now at $0.0315 in its fifth presale stage and selling fast. The team has indicated that a price increase is imminent. To compensate for this rise in demand, Uwerx developers have made some changes. Of the total supply of 750,000,000 WERX tokens, the team has allocated 57% (427,500,000) of it for presale. This allocation is a change from the previous 45% (300,000,000). </p>
<p class="s6">Before now, the team had allocated 60,000,000 tokens for the fourth presale. This allocation has been increased to 77,500,000 tokens. There will now be the 5th stage which will have 72,500,000 tokens available for sale. </p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx team has also increased the coin's launch price to $0.095 - $0.115. As for the date for the end of the presale, it still remains July 31, 2023. After considering that 98.2% of the Uwerx community voted for a Test Airdrop. The team has decided to run the Airdrop to help users know if they entered their Receiving Wallet address correctly.</p>
<p class="s6">The developers have also decreased the founding team's token allocation from 8% to 7%. Additionally, the Uwerx team has announced that they will share the Alpha version of the Uwerx platform in a few days. Furthermore, on May 19, 2023, they will release the platform's landing page and sign-up/sign-in pages.</p>
<p class="s6">They have also announced the Uwerx Vault, a feature that will help sustain the Uwerx Community by allowing them to store their WERX tokens for a period. </p>
<p class="s6">These features are what have put Uwerx in the limelight. The project currently boasts of 5,000 users. While Chiliz (CHZ) and Filecoin (FIL) have unique features, Uwerx has more factors that tip the scales in its favor. Considering the locked liquidity, full audit done before the presale, low fees, etc., you will see why analysts see tremendous potential in Uwerx. Analysts believe it could increase in value up to $2 by Q4 2023</p>
<p class="s6">Experienced traders know that buying a high-value coin like Uwerx, in its presale stage, is a great way to earn massively in the coin market. There is a 20% bonus for every WERX token purchased, but this bonus will be reduced soon.&nbsp;So, take advantage of this info and join the Uwerx presale now. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s8">Memecoins have stamped their authority in the crypto market over the last few years since their unveiling. DigiToads' impressive rise over the last month traces the resilience of traditional meme coins that largely depended on their community for sustainability. Ultimately, DigiToads' multidimensional nature, incorporating an NFT staking feature and web-3 gaming are a factor in its 170% growth.</p>
<p class="s10">DigiToads Leading the Way with Massive Gains</p>
<p class="s8">Over the past year, the meme-coin market has grown immensely, pushing some players to adopt interesting features that appeal to many investors. The popularity of DigiToads confirms that adding some layer of confidence to a meme-coin can have an impressive effect on the market. </p>
<p class="s8">Over the past month, DigiToads has grown by about 170%, which is impressive considering the state of the crypto market. In what experts recognize as a cut above the rest, DigiToads has incorporated entertainment, community support, and real-world utility that seeks to cement a sustainable asset that will revolutionize crypto space.</p>
<p class="s8">DigiToads most impressive feature is play-to-earn, which gives back to the community special characters called NFTs. The ability to make passive income is a principle in the running of the DigiToads ecosystem that is often on an upward trend. Valuable NFTs won in the immersive games have their role to play, and critically they are core in DigiToads metaverse.</p>
<p class="s8">Emphasis on the community is something DigiToads has factored impressively in its growth plans. Twitter, Telegram, and Discord have diverse groups of people that have helped solidify the position of DigiToads in the crowded crypto market. The Twitter community adds to tens of thousands, bringing people who share a common vision. The community&rsquo;s role in the staking pools helps create funds that drive the DigiToads project forward.</p>
<p class="s8">Unique sustainability projects run by DigiToads are a hallmark of its meteoric rise over the past month. The platform has set aside a portion of earnings that will go towards environment conservation to prevent a possible climate catastrophe. While such a move seems normal in the current age, it also ensures that ESG investors know about the climate course and can make significant contributions to society and serve personal interests.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Render Token Up by 45%</p>
<p class="s8">Render Token has taken impressive steps to the top by registering a 45% rise, impressing meme-coin enthusiasts. The notable progress aligns with other crypto-coins, which have enjoyed a spike at the end of quarter one, following months of poor performance. </p>
<p class="s8">Render is a utility-centered Token that has created an impressive ecosystem for rendering services. The utility potential is tremendous, meaning the Token has a significant potential to reach considerable heights in the crypto market.</p>
<p class="s8">Unique Tokens have captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and outsiders alike because each solves a significant problem. The case of Render is also unique in that it serves people who are willing to set aside some of their GPU power to a centralized Render network. While the Render coin rides in the crypto wave, it exists as a Token for its ever-growing community that helps make rendering services a possibility. </p>
<p class="s8">The Token started in 2017 and has since gathered steam to trade at about $2 in April. Currently, it has a total supply of about 363,911,539, which sets it at about $850 million in market capitalization.</p>
<p class="s8">Render has gradually grown from the fringes of the crypto market to enter into the top 100 most valuable coins. Investors have quickly taken a large portion of the Token with great anticipation of significant returns in the future.</p>
<p class="s8">Recent movements of Render Tokens in the market have captured the attention of investors. Notably, it has registered a weekly surge of about 12%. Over the last few months, it has also held steady in the 50 and 200-day moving averages, meaning that it will continue to rise in the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="s10">Innovation Among Tokens is the Fuel For Growth </p>
<p class="s8">DigiToads' impressive growth and Render's exploits which have seen it higher by 45% are a testament that utility is the key driver of the crypto market. The P2E feature that DigiToadsboasts of, and NFT staking are the pull factors that will help the minor Tokens grow even higher in the next decade. </p>
<p class="s8">Stronger demand for rendering services is imperative for the growth of Render, and indeed the entire crypto market. Critically, Investors can exploit different utility potentials and use them as the cornerstone for future Tokens.</p>
<p class="s10">Final Remarks</p>
<p class="s8">Crypto coins have moved beyond speculation as the sole reason for their growth, and are starting to peg their existence in real-world utility. The continued development of DigiToads is a significant factor in the growth of web 3. Investors whose interests align with the blockchain and its technology will find DigiToads impressive in the way its native coin powers a metaverse and helps create an immersive experience through play-to-earn gaming.</p>
<p class="s8">Ultimately, the right time to own a piece of DigiToads is now, as it is in a pre-sale that promises massive discounts and prizes.</p>

The platform has set aside a portion of earnings that will go towards environment conservation to prevent a possible climate catastrophe. While such a move seems normal in the current age, it also ensures that ESG investors know about the climate course and can make significant contributions to society and serve personal interests.</p>

<p class="s10">Render Token Up by 45%</p>
<p class="s8">Render Token has taken impressive steps to the top by registering a 45% rise, impressing meme-coin enthusiasts. The notable progress aligns with other crypto-coins, which have enjoyed a spike at the end of quarter one, following months of poor performance. </p>
<p class="s8">Render is a utility-centered Token that has created an impressive ecosystem for rendering services. The utility potential is tremendous, meaning the Token has a significant potential to reach considerable heights in the crypto market.</p>
<p class="s8">Unique Tokens have captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and outsiders alike because each solves a significant problem. The case of Render is also unique in that it serves people who are willing to set aside some of their GPU power to a centralized Render network. While the Render coin rides in the crypto wave, it exists as a Token for its ever-growing community that helps make rendering services a possibility. </p>
<p class="s8">The Token started in 2017 and has since gathered steam to trade at about $2 in April. Currently, it has a total supply of about 363,911,539, which sets it at about $850 million in market capitalization.</p>
<p class="s8">Render has gradually grown from the fringes of the crypto market to enter into the top 100 most valuable coins. Investors have quickly taken a large portion of the Token with great anticipation of significant returns in the future.</p>
<p class="s8">Recent movements of Render Tokens in the market have captured the attention of investors. Notably, it has registered a weekly surge of about 12%. Over the last few months, it has also held steady in the 50 and 200-day moving averages, meaning that it will continue to rise in the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="s10">Innovation Among Tokens is the Fuel For Growth </p>
<p class="s8">DigiToads' impressive growth and Render's exploits which have seen it higher by 45% are a testament that utility is the key driver of the crypto market. The P2E feature that DigiToadsboasts of, and NFT staking are the pull factors that will help the minor Tokens grow even higher in the next decade. </p>
<p class="s8">Stronger demand for rendering services is imperative for the growth of Render, and indeed the entire crypto market. Critically, Investors can exploit different utility potentials and use them as the cornerstone for future Tokens.</p>
<p class="s10">Final Remarks</p>
<p class="s8">Crypto coins have moved beyond speculation as the sole reason for their growth, and are starting to peg their existence in real-world utility. The continued development of DigiToads is a significant factor in the growth of web 3. Investors whose interests align with the blockchain and its technology will find DigiToads impressive in the way its native coin powers a metaverse and helps create an immersive experience through play-to-earn gaming.</p>
<p class="s8">Ultimately, the right time to own a piece of DigiToads is now, as it is in a pre-sale that promises massive discounts and prizes.</p>

This groundbreaking development marks a critical milestone in the exponentially growing Bitcoin ordinals ecosystem that is now reaching half a billion dollars in total market capitalization in less than six months.</p><p>#USD is a BRC20 standard stablecoin created via the Bitcoin ordinals protocol which was introduced in January 2023 after the recent Taproot upgrade. BRC20 tokens use a technique called ordinal inscriptions to attach data to individual "satoshis," the smallest unit of a Bitcoin. These satoshis can then represent anything from digital art ownership to &ldquo;meme coins&rdquo; and even stablecoins.</p><p>According to Stably, every #USD token is backed 1-to-1 with USD in a collateral account managed by a US-regulated custodian for the benefit of KYC/AML-verified token holders. Monthly reports for the account are also conducted by a third-party stablecoin attestor to ensure #USD tokens are always fully collateralized with USD.</p><p>"When I met Domo, the creator of the BRC20 standard, at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, I told him about our upcoming plans for #USD," said Kory Hoang, Stably&rsquo;s CEO and Co-Founder. &ldquo;He thought it was great and funny how we are creating a stablecoin on Bitcoin to enable Bitcoin trading on-chain&hellip; With a stablecoin built on Bitcoin.

By then, users of #USD will be able to on/off-ramp via more traditional payment methods like ACH, instant ACH, and credit/debit cards, in addition to bank wires.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Founded in 2018, the 20+ team member Seattle FinTech is backed by leading institutional and angel investors in the crypto space, such as Morgan Creek Capital, BEENEXT, 500 Startups, Hard Yaka, CREAM Labs, Sunny Lu of VeChain, and Paul Stahura of Donuts, Inc.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Aave community is mulling over a proposal to launch its V3 on the Coinbase-backed Layer-2 blockchain solution, Base network.&nbsp;</p>
Aave V3 Considers Base Deployment
<p>The upcoming Base network is a Layer-2 blockchain solution backed by the Coinbase crypto firm and is currently going through a temperature check phase by the Aave community. As per early reports, it is being considered by Aave for the deployment of its V3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea was first proposed by analytics firm Flipside Crypto and then brought to the attention of Aave&rsquo;s governance forum by Flipside&rsquo;s protocol specialist Francis Gowen, who is also one of the delegates and contributors of Aave. In his proposal, Gowen highlighted that the integration could result in multiple revenue streams for Aave V3 and open it up to a significantly larger user base.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than suggesting the protocol, Gowen also touched upon the necessity of maintaining risk parameters for assets that would be deployed on Base.</p>
Temperature Check Ongoing
<p>The presently ongoing temperature check phase will allow the community members to experience the platform and provide initial feedback, based on which the next step of the decision might be taken. If the initial feedback is positive and garners sufficient preliminary votes, the proposal will be considered for further discussion. These discussions will include risk parameter evaluations, which, if successful, will advance the proposal to an on-chain vote as a final step before deployment.&nbsp;</p>
Base Mainnet To Launch After Optimism Upgrade
<p>The Base network project has so far only launched its testnet, which already displayed significant developer activity. The network has been supporting 18,000 developers who deployed 55,000 smart contracts. This indicates a strong growth potential for the mainnet once it is launched later this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the Base team has yet to finalize a launch date for its mainnet, it has been announced that the project has completed its first hardfork, Regolith, in testnet. Furthermore, the OP Labs team has also completed a project infrastructure review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team has also explained that once Optimism completes its June upgrade (Bedrock), Base will be able to move on to its internal and external audits stage to demonstrate testnet stability and then launch the mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
Other Interest In Base Network
<p>Aave is a decentralized and non-custodial liquidity market protocol that allows users to lend, borrow, and generate interest on multiple crypto assets, including stablecoins. The upcoming Aave V3 will be the third major iteration of the protocol and, if the above proposal is greenlit, could have a significant impact on the Base network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Aave is not the only crypto powerhouse considering a move to Base. A week back, the largest decentralized exchange, Uniswap, also revealed that it is considering an expansion to the Base network.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A high court in Montenegro overturned a decision to grant bail to disgraced Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon as he faces charges of attempting to travel with falsified passports. </p>
<p>Bloomberg reports a higher court on Wednesday revoked bail previously granted to Do Kwon and a fellow defendant pending trial.</p>
<p>The Basic Court of Montenegro&rsquo;s capital Podgorica accepted a previous application by Kwon&rsquo;s lawyers to give him and fellow accused, Terra executive Han Chang-Joon, supervised bail as they face trial for attempting to travel with falsified documents.</p>
<p>Kwon and Chang-Joon were set to be released on supervised bail with a payment of 400,000 euros each.</p>
Kwon Arrested in Montenegro
<p>The duo were detained at the airport of Montenegro&rsquo;s capital Podgorica March 23 as they tried to board a flight to Dubai with falsified travel documents. Reuters reported Kwon and Joon had doctored Costa Rican passports, a second set of Belgian passports, laptops, and other devices.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Kwon and Chang-Joon were charged with forging official documents and were ordered to a 30-day pre-trial detention.</p>
<p>Following their arrest, a court deemed both a flight risk and scheduled them for trial on May 11.</p>
US and South Korea Seek Extradition of Do Kwon
<p>Shortly after his arrest, the United States and South Korean authorities announced that they were seeking the extradition of Kwon. Kwon is a South Korean national charged in September with violating the country&rsquo;s Capital Market Act, and a warrant of arrest was issued for him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>US federal prosecutors indicted Kwon with two counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Following investigations by numerous law enforcement agencies, the International Criminal Police Organisation, or Interpol,&nbsp;issued a red notice&nbsp;for Kwon.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The German banking sector is now gradually embracing digital assets, primarily for institutional investors.&nbsp;</p>
Preparing for a future tokenised economy
<p>The potential diversification benefits that digital assets offer have not escaped the notice of German Banks, and these are now being offered by the banks to institutional investors seeking alternatives beyond conventional investment opportunities due to the transformational power of digital assets in portfolio diversification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an article released earlier today by CoinTelegraph, it was reported that Deutsche WertpapierServiceBank (Dwpbank) had launched its wpNex crypto trading platform in March. The service enables 1200 banks across Germany access to digital assets.</p>
<p>The CoinTelegraph article reported that although the vast majority of cryptocurrencies were considered unsuitable for institutional investment, some digital assets were being offered and stored, and a future tokenised economy was being prepared for.</p>
Regulatory and custodial solutions
<p>Regulatory clarity plays a critical role in the German financial institutions' slow but steady adoption of digital assets. Establishing a clear legal framework for crypto related activities promotes confidence ensuring that banking operations operate within defined boundaries and comply with required practice guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>German banks developed tailored custodial services designed explicitly for institutional investors desirous of cryptocurrency investments. These services ensure that digital assets remain secure within regulated environments through features like multi signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and extensive reporting tools consistent with industry standards.&nbsp;</p>
Expanding Blockchain Technology Innovations
<p>Germany&rsquo;s Banking Sector recognizes the vast potential of blockchain technology beyond cryptocurrencies by exploring related innovative applications across various other domains; cost savings could be achieved through streamlining processes in cross border payments and identity verification systems while transforming customer experiences. Although institutional investment in cryptocurrencies is catching on in Germany, there's still much work to be done when it comes to educating the broader public. Banks have recognized that education and awareness are important factors that will help bridge this gap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A shift is happening within Germany's financial industry toward embracing digital assets such as cryptocurrencies - with priority being given to institutional investors. This move springs from increased regulatory clarity as well as a surge of interest in blockchain applications and custodial services on offer today.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has said that he believes the crypto space could see the beginning of a bull run after China Central Television aired a segment on crypto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCTV programming has an audience of over 1 billion and could spark a bull run based on past examples.&nbsp;</p>
A Rare Segment On Crypto&nbsp;
<p>On the 23rd of May, 2023, the state broadcasting corporation, China Central Television (CCTV), aired a segment discussing the adoption of cryptocurrencies. According to the details available, the segment reported that regulators in Hong Kong have made &ldquo;final preparations&rdquo; for trading virtual assets in the special administrative region. According to the segment, the regulators are ready to begin accepting applications from virtual asset trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the segment, an official representing the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Zhonghui Cai, explained that virtual asset regulation faces several challenges, such as the potential for conflict of interest between platforms and clients, cybersecurity, and the surety of client assets. It was previously reported that the guidelines in question would become effective by June 2023. However, the Securities and Futures Commission has yet to approve any virtual asset trading platform for retail investors.&nbsp;</p>
Could This Signal An Impending Bull Run?&nbsp;
<p>As a result of the broadcast of a segment on Chinese Central Television, the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem is buzzing with excitement. The broadcast on China&rsquo;s largest state-run broadcaster caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts, including Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. In response to the coverage, Zhao took to Twitter to predict that the coverage could lead to a bull run in the crypto market, going by previous instances. According to Zhao, past coverages similar to the one on China Central Television have historically sparked bull runs in the crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;CCTV (China Central Television) just broadcasted crypto. It&rsquo;s a big deal. The Chinese-speaking communities are buzzing. Historically, coverages like these led to bull runs. Not saying the past predicts the future. And not financial advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Changpeng Zhao has plenty of reasons to be bullish. This bullishness stems from the fact that the coverage and greater exposure to cryptocurrencies could lead to increased interest and greater participation in the crypto markets. According to Zhao, this recent exposure to the crypto ecosystem could act as a catalyst and drive individuals to explore and invest in cryptocurrencies driving up asset prices and increasing market capitalization. However, he added that he could not predict the future and that people should be careful when investing in crypto.&nbsp;</p>
Broader Implications For Crypto&nbsp;
<p>China Central Television is the largest state broadcaster in China and broadcasts an array of programs that reaches an audience of over one billion. Furthermore, the segment did not air or mention anything negative about cryptocurrencies. This is in contrast with the position and stringent regulations adopted by Chinese authorities against cryptocurrencies. This includes a complete ban on Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency exchanges operating in China. However, ownership of crypto assets is currently permitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The broadcast could have significant implications for the crypto industry, both globally and in China. The exposure the segment provides could lead to increased awareness and a broader adoption and use of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, institutional investors who were watching Chinese markets and the current regulatory environment could see a ray of hope and gain some level of confidence in the market. This could lead to greater institutional adoption and capital to flow into the crypto ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April, the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin, started publishing cryptocurrency price quotes in its index. Duoyin has over a billion registered users. However, the price quotes were removed and replaced with the following text just a day later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unofficial digital currencies do not possess the same legal standing as fiat currencies. Please invest cautiously.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity firm Unciphered has claimed that it managed to hack the hugely popular Trezor T hardware wallet manufactured by Satoshi Labs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Trezor T hardware wallet is one of the most popular wallets in the market today.&nbsp;</p>
A Potential Hardware Vulnerability?&nbsp;
<p>Unciphered showcased the hack in a YouTube demonstration, claiming it could extract the hardware wallet&rsquo;s mnemonic seed phrase by exploiting a hardware vulnerability. In the video, Unciphered is able to dismantle the hardware before extracting the seed phrase or private key. However, the hack requires the physical possession of the wallet, along with specialized equipment. Furthermore, the cybersecurity firm also claimed that there is no way to fix the vulnerability that facilitates the hack without initiating a complete recall of all Trezor T wallets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the video, the team at Unciphered claimed they developed an &ldquo;in-house exploit&rdquo; that enabled them to extract the wallet&rsquo;s firmware. Co-founder of Unciphered, Eric Michaud, stated that by leveraging specialized GPU chips, the team was able to crack the Trezor T hardware wallet&rsquo;s pin seed phrase. Michaud explains in the video,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uploaded the firmware we extracted onto our high-performance computing cracking clusters. We have about 10 GPUs, and after some time, we extracted the keys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardware wallets are used to store private keys offline in an air-gapped environment. Because these wallets keep the private keys offline, they are generally considered highly secure. However, Unciphered has stated that the hardware security mechanisms put in place in the Trezor T wallet could theoretically be bypassed if any hacker or malicious individual gained possession of a Trezor T wallet.&nbsp;</p>
An Old Vulnerability?&nbsp;
<p>Unciphered&rsquo;s demonstration of the vulnerability in Trezor T hardware wallets resulted in speculation that it had rediscovered an old vulnerability known for years. However, Unciphered denied this, stating that the old vulnerability in question had been patched in 2019. According to the firm, the vulnerability and the method to exploit it were developed in-house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not the first time Unciphered has successfully retrieved seed phrases from a hardware wallet. In February, the cybersecurity company demonstrated a similar hack of a popular hardware wallet, OneKey. In the video related to OneKey, Unciphered showed how it exploited the lack of encryption between the hardware wallet&rsquo;s CPU and the secure element through a field programmable gate array. This was able to intercept all communications between the secure element and the processor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The FPGA is a high-speed processor also known as a field programmable gate array, allowing us to iterate through different algorithms, bypass the wallet&rsquo;s security and extract the mnemonics.&rdquo;</p>

Trezor Responds&nbsp;
<p>Trezor responded to Unciphered&rsquo;s demonstration of the exploit and stated that it had quite a few similarities with the Read Protection Downgrade (RDP) vulnerability. This vulnerability was discovered by researchers from Kraken Security Labs and impacted both Trezor One and Trezor Model T. In short, this implied that Trezor was aware of the vulnerability. Chief technology officer at Trezor, Tom&aacute;&scaron; Su&scaron;&aacute;nka, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This appears to be a vulnerability called an RDP downgrade attack, and as communicated on our blog in early 2020, RDP downgrade attacks require the physical theft of a device and extremely sophisticated technological knowledge and advanced equipment. Even with the above, Trezors can be protected by a strong passphrase, which adds another layer of security that renders an RDP downgrade useless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The company further added that it had taken steps to resolve the issue and had developed a new secure element for hardware wallets in collaboration with its sister firm, Tropic Square.&nbsp;</p>
Hardware Wallets Not As Safe As They Claim To Be?&nbsp;
<p>With their promise of keeping seed phrases and access codes offline and safe from the prying eyes of hackers, hardware wallets have long been considered the pinnacle of safety when it comes to storing digital assets. Their popularity grew even further with the collapse of major centralized exchanges such as FTX, with investors and users opting for self-custody of their assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, recent events have put a considerable dent in the reputation of hardware wallets. One of the primary events that led to the confidence crisis in hardware wallets was the announcement of Ledger Recover. Ledger&rsquo;s Recover feature set the cat among the pigeons as it sparked concerns that third parties could gain access to private keys, allowing them access to the crypto held in the wallets. Ledger&rsquo;s response did little to calm frayed nerves and led to considerable backlash for Ledger. Eventually, Ledger was forced to postpone the feature&rsquo;s release and open-source the code for transparency.</p>
