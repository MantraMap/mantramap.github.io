<p class="s7">According to experts, Bitcoin (BTC) may surge in early August 2023, thanks to the options expiry exercise. Also, Maker (MKR) recorded a massive price surge in July, and analysts are monitoring to see if this bullish momentum will hold through Q3 2023. On the other hand, Borroe ($ROE) is ready to disrupt decentralized fundraising, and the platform has already sold all of the Borroe ($ROE) tokens listed for its Beta presale stage.</p>

Bitcoin (BTC) May Record a Price Surge in Late July 2023
<p class="s7">Today, July 28, 2023, $2 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) options will expire. Historically, this monthly Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry is always associated with bullish volatility for Bitcoin (BTC). This time we could see Bitcoin&rsquo;s (BTC) support level rise from $29,000 to $29,500. According to experts, the effects of Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry often take a few days to consolidate, and we may see Bitcoin (BTC) rise to $31,000 in the first few days of August 2023.</p>
<p class="s7">Also, requests for Bitcoin (BTC) Spot ETFs could propel Bitcoin (BTC) to a greater price surge. If the US SEC approves the requests from Blackrock and Fidelity, Bitcoin (BTC) should break through its 2023 high. Interestingly, Bitcoin (BTC) hit this $31,657 high on July 13 after a US federal court ruling dealt a blow to the SEC&rsquo;s crypto regulatory efforts. Bitcoin (BTC) turned bearish shortly after this price surge, and the token is currently trading at $29,180 on July 28.</p>

Maker (MKR) Ecosystem Developments Trigger Massive Price Surge
<p class="s7">In May 2023, MakerDAO released a five-phase roadmap tagged &lsquo;Endgame.&rsquo; According to Maker (MKR) developers, this upgrade will include a rebrand, a new blockchain, and the introduction of two new tokens. During this period, Rune Christensen (co-founder of Maker DAO) also revealed that Maker (MKR) users could initiate hard forks in response to power attacks or abuse.</p>
<p class="s7">These ecosystem developments and the Maker (MKR) token burn led to a massive price surge last month. Maker (MKR) launched a Smart Burn Engine program that recently cleaned more than $230,000 worth of Maker (MKR) tokens from the market.</p>
<p class="s7">As a result, we saw Maker (MKR) rise from $672 on June 28 to a current price of $1,167 on July 28. The token gained 72.84% this last month, and only a few tokens, like XRP and Borroe ($ROE), can match this surge in Q3 2023. &nbsp;</p>
