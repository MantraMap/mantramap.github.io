					<description><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, Elon Musk tweeted that his recently acquired Twitter would provide a new but &#8220;higher priced&#8221; Blue subscription that will remove advertisements from the micro-blogging platform. Although this functionality hasn&#8217;t yet been made available, the existing $7.99 per month Twitter Blue subscription offers 50% fewer advertisements when compared to &#8220;non-verified persons.&#8221; Twitter&#8217;s New Blue <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/doge-fan-elon-musk-twitter-blue-subscription-feature/" title="DOGE Fan Elon Musk Announces New Feature For Twitter"></a></p>

Although this functionality hasn&#8217;t yet been made available, the existing $7.99 per month Twitter Blue subscription offers 50% fewer advertisements when compared to &#8220;non-verified persons.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Twitter&#8217;s New Blue Plan</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that Elon&#8217;s solution to Blue&#8217;s poor membership numbers and the 40% decrease in ad revenue, which CoinGape has already <a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/twitter-revenue-drops-down-whats-next/">reported</a>, is to provide a subscription that is more expensive but does not include ads. Musk <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1616855485294215168" rel="nofollow">claims</a> Twitter is also working on a mechanism to minimize the frequency and size of the adverts showcased on Twitter.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a> aficionado was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ads are too frequent on Twitter and too big. Taking steps to address both in coming weeks</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023</a></em></p>
<p>Although, the billionaire hasn&#8217;t been public about the new pricing, industry experts believe it to be around the range of $15-$16. The existing Blue subscription comes with privileges such as a blue &#8220;verified&#8221; checkmark, the option to undo tweets, a means to submit lengthier 1080p videos, a reader mode for threads, and preferential ranking in conversations. All of these features can be accessed by paying an additional fee of $8.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136351" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/22021803/Screenshot-2023-01-22-021738.png" alt="" width="699" height="253" /></p>
<h2>Twitter&#8217;s Attempt To Monetize</h2>
<p>Since he acquired the platform in October, Musk has been working to diversify the company&#8217;s economy away from advertising income. He is resting his hopes on revenue from &#8220;<a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-twitter-rolls-out-8-twitter-blue-plan-with-verification/">Twitter Blue</a>&#8221; memberships as a means to accomplish this goal. In order for Twitter to compensate for the commission that Apple and Google take out of in-app purchases, Twitter currently imposes a $3 premium to Blue sign-ups that originate from iOS or Android smartphones.</p>
<p>Since it was relaunched in December, Blue has been offered as a paid subscription on iOS for the price of $11 a month. On Thursday, Twitter began offering Blue to users of its Android platform for the same price. There is also the possibility of purchasing a subscription for a period of one year at the discounted rate of $84.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1140" height="760" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/23131855/The-differences-between-bitcoin-and-ethereum-graphic-1.webp" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Crypto price today" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin, Ethereum price prediction: the market leaders,<a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-surge-ethereum-eth-price-2000/"> Bitcoin and Ethereum</a>, showed sluggish price behavior earlier this week. With no significant gain or loss registered from these coins, the majority of major altcoins continue to struggle in a sideways rally. However, the BTC price breakout from its ongoing range may signal the revival of bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global crypto market cap is %<span class="sc-e225a64a-0 lktIfA" data-sensors-click="true">1.06</span> Trillion, with a <span class="sc-f1e838b2-0 dRLonq">5.84</span>% jump since yesterday. Meanwhile, the total crypto market volume is $71.87 Billion, showing a 72.8% rise.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Gainers and Losers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-136352" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/22022441/Screenshot_20230122_022408.png" alt="heatmap of cryptocurrency prices" width="1200" height="675" />Source- Coin360 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, the </span>Aptos a<span style="font-weight: 400;">nd </span>Optimism tokens <span style="font-weight: 400;">showcased the highest gain, where the APT price rose 37.16% to reach the $12.91 mark, while the OP price increased 18.51% to $2.33. On the other hand, </span>Frax Share <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span>Rocket Pool <span style="font-weight: 400;">tokens are top losers, with FXS price is 2.47% to reach $10.75, while RPL price loss at 21% to reach $36.42.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-136353" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/22022741/Screenshot_20230122_022709.png" alt="btc" width="1200" height="348" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following an exceptional rally in the first two weeks of 2023, the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin price</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went sideways below the $21600 resistance. Thus, earlier this week, the coin price witnessed a short consolidation between the $21600 and $20400 barriers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this short break allowed the BTC price to neutralize excess buying and replenish the bullish momentum. As a result, this coin price rose 12.6% in the last three days and reached the $23220 mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/OGJNsOFA.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this price jump hints at the resumption of prior recovery and recently breached a local resistance of $22600. If the daily candle closes above the mentioned resistance, the accelerated bullish momentum will drive the BTC price 6-8% higher to hit $24700-$25000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the Bitcoin price fails to sustain above $21500 in the coming week, the bullish momentum will weaken.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-136354" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/22022936/Screenshot_20230122_022924.png" alt="eth" width="1200" height="372" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to Bitcoin, this altcoin went sideways above the breached resistance of $1500, trying to stabilize the aggressive buying in the market. Furthermore, the post-retest rally surged the price 10% higher to hit the neckline resistance of the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rounding bottom pattern.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the ETH price trades at $1657 and challenges the neckline resistance($1660) of a rounding bottom pattern. However, the daily chart shows a Doji candle indicating uncertainty among market participants.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/uOKoML3l.png" alt="Ethereum Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-Tradingview</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, if the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum price</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> breaches the $1660 resistance, the triggered bullish pattern will encourage buyers to rally further. As per the technical setup, this pattern completion could bolster coin price to surpass $2000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, the failure to break the $1600 barrier will weaken the bullish thesis.</span></p>

Within the past three weeks, the coin price surged 162% and reached the current price of $25.5.Moreover, the steady growth in volume activity and in between minor corrections indicate a sustained growth in SOL price. Moreover, this parabolic price recovery reveals the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">rounding bottom pattern.</a></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of the rounding bottom pattern, the Solana coin price aims for the $38.6 mark.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $27.2 mark stands as a troublesome resistance against buyers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $2.5 Billion, indicating a 221.5% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/m/MHxIqvUz.png" alt="Solana coin price" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bullish rounding bottom pattern currently influences the ongoing recovery in SOL price. This pattern creates a sense of gradual growth in the asset&#8217;s market value which leads its prices beyond the neckline resistance. Anyhow, the Solana coin price shows its neckline at the $38.6 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, this altcoin trades at $25.3 and shows a power struggle to surpass the $27-$27.5 supply. The daily chart shows a Doji-type candle at mentioned resistance indicates uncertainty among market participants. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, if the selling press persists, the Solana coin price could witness a minor correction to replenish the bullish momentum. This potential downfall could tumble the prices by 20% and revisit the $20 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, the daily candle closing above $27.5 will hint at the resumprion of the prior rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MADC:</strong> despite recent price correction, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal line prevent a bearish crossover and continue to rise higher. The steady growth in this indicator reflects sustained growth in the Solana coin price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger band:</strong> the rising coin price constantly hits the upper band of this indicator, indicating aggressive buying in the market, which needs a little cooldown.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $25.8</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>

In theory, a bullish breakout from this pattern indicates a recuperation of bullish momentum and a sign of a bullish recovery rally. In response to this pattern, these prices are currently trying to breach the $0.8 resistance. Should you enter now?</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from $0.8 sets the SAND price for a New term target of 25%.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reclaimed EMAs(20, 50, and 100) could support the coin price in case of possible pullback</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in SAND price is $525 Million, indicating a 226% gain.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, amid a minor consolidation in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/the-sandbox/">SAND price</a> managed to retest the breached trendline as valid support. During the retest phase, the SAND price held about the trendline, indicating that the prices could sustain higher levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-correction rally has appreciated the Sandbox price by 17.6% in the last three days, currently trading at the $0.81 mark. Furthermore, with the increasing volume activity, the buyers attempt to breach the following resistance of $0.8.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the daily candle closes about the $0.8 resistance, the buyers will gain a suitable launchpad to fuel further price rallies. The post-breakout rally could surge the prices 25% higher to challenge the $1 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as per the technical setup, a breakout from the parallel channel pattern would lead a price rally to the highest swing top, which for Sandcoin price is $1.5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if this altcoin is struggling to sustain about the $0.8 barrier, the price action could run sideways for a few trading sessions.</span></p>

Despite the fact that are a few bearish indications that appear along the levels of lower timeframes, bulls have still continued to prevail. However, as per recent analysis by experts, the price seems to indicate a trend exhaustion that could be underway.</p>
<h2>Ethereum (ETH) Price Surge</h2>
<p>The price of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> has increased by 38% since the beginning of 2023 and is presently trading in the $1,650 range. Because of this enormous rise, new all-time highs were established on January 13 and 20. And, in spite of the fact that there is a clear theoretical prognosis for the Ethereum price to reverse, there is a possibility that there will be a liquidity run, which might result in a third higher high being reached.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023</a></em></p>
<p>This has been echoed by industry stalwarts like Michael van de Poppe, a prominent crypto analyst, who is of the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1616802923022778369?s=20&amp;t=oP3O_zqNCg4dNLp_DMMLeA" rel="nofollow">opinion</a> that ETH can continue rallying towards $1,700-1,730 before facing any sort of rejection. Earlier, when the ETH price had dipped, Micheal noted that those dips were the &#8220;best options before the relief rally occurs&#8221;.</p>

<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-16y2uox r-1pi2tsx r-13qz1uu">
<p class="css-1dbjc4n r-1adg3ll r-1udh08x">In this scenario, bulls have a possibility of making a comeback if they can drive the momentum signal to create a higher high at the same time. In the event that buyers are unable to make this occur, investors should expect a moderate trend reversal. Bears need to push prices below $1,568—a level that serves as a support for higher time frames—in order to generate momentum against buyers. If the support level of $1,568 is breached and turned into a resistance level, it will clear the way for sellers to push the price of Ethereum down to the support levels of $1,417, $1,331, and $1,227.</p>

<h2>ETH To Cross $2K?</h2>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-16y2uox r-1pi2tsx r-13qz1uu">
<p class="css-1dbjc4n r-1adg3ll r-1udh08x">On the other hand, few experts tend to believe that the uptrend for Ethereum is far from being done. ETH bulls must stage a rebound in order to force the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</a> to create another higher-high in the overbought area in their quest to gather liquidity resting above $1,650. The $1,820 barrier can become a support floor for Ethereum pricing if it is overcome, according to experts. Concurrently if the RSI supports this upward climb, the bearish argument will be refuted &amp; a similar development would make ETH retest the psychological threshold of $2,000 as well.</p>

<p>As things stand, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently being traded at $1,661. This represents an increase of 6% in the past 24 hours, in contrast to its 9% jump during the last seven days, as per CoinGape’s <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker.</p>

However, now both the cryptos (XRP and ADA) have caught in race led among the biggest BSC whales.</p>
<h2>ADA beating XRP among BSC whales?</h2>
<p>As per WhaleAlert, XRP flipped ADA for the most traded token among the top 100 BSC whales in the last 24 hours. However, coming from the back Cardano became the most traded token as the whales went on to transact more ADA. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>As we dig in, ADA is still above the XRP in terms of trading volume among BSC whales. Data depicts that both XRP and ADA have landed in the top 10 tokens purchased in the last 24 hours. However, here too ADA is placed above XRP.</p>
<p>On the market side, ADA price has surged by 11% in the last 24 hours. Cardano is trading at an average price of $0.369, at the press time. ADA’s 24 hour trading volume has jumped by over 180% to stand at $588 million. While its market cap stands at $12.7 billion.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price</a> has surged by almost 5% over the past day. Its 24 hour trading volume is up by 40% to stand at $1.27 billion. Ripple’s native token is trading at an average price of $0.408, at the press time. However, its market cap is approaching upwards to regain the $21 billion mark.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="628" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19193514/mana-and-decentraland-logo-1614900236158.webp" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="mana token" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a brief break earlier week, the bullish momentum continues of the majority of major cryptocurrencies. As a result, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/decentraland/">MANA coin price</a> rose 20% in the last three days and reached the current price of $0.742. This price jump also breached the $0.732 neckline resistance of the cup and handle pattern. Here’s how this bullish pattern may affect the near-term future of the Decentraland token.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.732 breakout sets MANA price for a 53% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recently reclaimed 200-day EMA could assist buyers in leading the further recovery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Decentraland token is $319 Million, indicating a 14% fall. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asy5zvL0.png" alt="MANA price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning a minor correction in the MANA price earlier this week, the daily time frame chart showed the formation of a cup and handle pattern. This is one of the famous bullish reversal patterns commonly observed in the market bottom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, this pattern formation consists of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">U-shaped recovery</a> which indicates a steady directional uptrend, and a minor correction which confirms the price sustainability above the higher price. Thus, the short pullback observed in the MANA price must have stabilized the excess buying and prepared the token for a future rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the MANA price showed a 1.7% intraday jump which breached the $0.732 neckline resistance of the cup and handle pattern. If the daily candle closes above the neckline, resistance and buyers will obtain a significant footing to lead further growth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, in an ideal bullish condition, this pattern breakout should drive the MANA price 53% higher to hit $1.12. However, this bull run could face in-between resistances at $0.823 and $0.935.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the bullish thesis will weaken if the price cannot sustain above the $0.732 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strenght index</strong>: the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> wavering in the overbought region indicates the buying is aggressive for spent time, and the MANA price could need a minor correction before resuming the prevailing rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: in case of possible pullback, the reclaimed EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) could act as valid support levels. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MANA Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.739</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.823 and $0.935</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.732 and $0.61</span></li>

If there are chances that you know someone who would appreciate a good <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">crypto</a> gift this holiday then you are at the right place. You can be sure that these desirable crypto gift ideas will make your loved ones stop and say &#8220;OMG&#8221; (that&#8217;s a compliment).</p>
<h4>1. Ledger wallet</h4>
<p>Storing their coins in electronic wallets or on exchanges is one of the biggest nightmares for crypto investors. With the number of increasing hack attacks against cryptocurrencies, a secure asset storage device such as a Ledger wallet will surely make every crypto holder happy.</p>
<p>For example, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://shapeshift.com/keepkey">KeepKey</a>, is unhackable, which makes it a great place to keep your crypto safe. With no operating system, viruses can&#8217;t touch it. Plus, it&#8217;s so easy to use that even Bitcoin noobs can figure it out. This gift is portable and suitable for beginners and experienced traders.</p>

<h4>2. Physical Bitcoin</h4>
<p>Physical representations of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> have existed for a long time now. In the past few years, several different renditions have also cropped up, each with different compositional material, values, and purposes. However, these are not real cryptocurrencies and have no value correlated to crypto coins.</p>
<p>Gifting physical bitcoins is a way of telling your crypto lover that you care about them and also, wish them well on their future investments. The easiest way to get physical bitcoins is through online stores like Etsy.</p>
<h4>3. Crypto Art</h4>
<p>Last but not the least, Crypto art is a gifting idea if the person is interested in both cryptocurrencies and art. If you have made up your mind to buy one, then there is this popular online destination called <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoart.io/">Crypto Art</a>, where everyone can look through various art products focusing on crypto.</p>
<p>The concept of “crypto art” references digital art pieces that are bought with cryptocurrencies, while anything can be an <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFT</a> even if it is not art-related. These are valuable digital assets that offer something hard to find in digital art: ownership of the piece. It is one of the best crypto gift ideas for Chinese New Year 2023.</p>

<h2>What can be the outcomes of XRP lawsuit?</h2>
<p>John Deaton, XRP holders’ lawyer brought up the pre-1933 blue sky argument people have been talking about after the latest submissions. He cleared that this particular argument is for the 2nd Circuit and Supreme Court. He believes that Judge Analisa Torres will go with the argument.</p>
<p><em>Blue Sky Laws in the United States law that regulates the offering and sale of securities in order to safeguard investors from frauds. However, this law varies from state to state and requires sellers of new issues to register with the authorities.</em></p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1616497240989749248" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">XRP lawyer highlighted</a> that the judge could possibly check into the XRP sales done by <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a>. This is could happen as the commission didn’t go through to each transaction and ran them under the Howey test.</p>
<p>However, the SEC in the XRP lawsuit argues that Ripple created a secondary market for XRP. As per the commission claims past and as well as present XRP sales are securities. While it argues that if any other nation declares XRP a currency then it will because of Ripple’s efforts.</p>
<h2>Is Ripple case going to jury?</h2>
<p>Deaton stated that the experts have failed to consider that the Judge could go on to deny Both<a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-verdict-or-settlement-xrp-lawyer-to-drop-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Summary judgment</a> motions. This decision will lead the XRP lawsuit to a jury. It is near to impossible to predict any outcome of the case until the Rule 56 facts are read out.</p>
<p>The SEC in a response to Amicus curiae’s writ of Mandamus admitted that the court will now make a decision over whether the commission’s theory is valid or not.</p>

India has rarely been successful in creating and growing local companies and cutting-edge technological solutions in lockstep with Western competitors. In the last two decades, India has had considerable success building a robust IT industry and, later, an internet services business. Yet, whether it be smartphones or semiconductors, humans have been slow to adopt and shape novel technologies.</p>
<p>On crypto, however, our entrepreneurs have chosen an untried path: to create goods and services that compete with those of global peers. Indian platforms have been able to expand and meet the needs of millions of users even in the early days of cryptocurrency. In both the crypto investment and infrastructure sectors, India has created unicorns. This has developed concurrently with India&#8217;s digital development. As a result, India accounted for 172 billion USD in crypto transactions between July 2021 and June 2022, placing India fourth globally in terms of purchasing power parity adoption.</p>
<p>The Union Budget from the previous year recognized this rising use by imposing a tax system for VDAs was established. The budget provided much-needed clarity on crypto taxation. Beyond this solace, however, the tax system facing crypto investors was one that was incomparable to that of other asset classes.</p>
<h2>The tax imposition and high TDS</h2>
<p>The fundamental exemption, the distinction between long-term and short-term capital gains based on the length of ownership, and the ability for investors to carry forward or offset losses were all absent from the flat 30% tax on earnings. Significantly, the <a href="https://coingape.com/1-tds-on-crypto-in-india-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TDS of 1%</a> on each sell transaction had a compounding effect on capital-rich high-frequency traders, who are the source of market liquidity.</p>
<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/us-fed-seizes-700-million-to-sam-bankman-fried/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Regulators Seize $700 Million Belonging To FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried</a></p>
<p>Nearly a year later, it is evident that these restrictive measures achieved the opposite of what was intended. Rather than increasing transparency and compliance in crypto transactions in India. They unintentionally encouraged consumers to switch to offshore exchanges and grey markets.</p>
<h2>The harsh consequences</h2>
<p>According to a recent <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.taxsutra.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/Esya%20Centre%20Special%20Issue%20VDA%20Taxation.pdf">study</a> by the Esya Centre and Taxsutra, domestic cryptocurrency startups will shift their whole transaction volume from February to October 2022 to overseas exchanges by almost INR 32,000 crore.</p>
<p>This has substantial consequences, including lost tax revenue for the government, diminished control over cryptocurrency transactions, and significantly increased consumer exposure to offshore risk. We hope that the government will change its course and enact taxes that encourage users to adhere to the law and remain inside our territorial jurisdiction. Higher taxes result.</p>

However, the native tokens supporting game economies can be found in these special games. With these in-game currencies, users can trade, buy, sell, and play. <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blockchain technology</a></strong> is used in the play to earn games to give players the opportunity to earn <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a></strong> rewards for their skill and effort.</p>
<h2><b>Here are 5 Blockchain Games to Play and Earn This Week</b></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not shocking that <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/play-to-earn-p2e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play-to-earn gaming</a></strong> has taken over the cryptocurrency world. Here are the top 5 play-to-earn games of the week:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sandbox</li>
<li>Star Atlas</li>
<li>Decentraland</li>
<li>Axie Infinity</li>
<li>My Neighbor Alice</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>1. The Sandbox</b></h3>
<p>One of the top blockchain games for creative people to earn money is The Sandbox. An open-world game powered by Ethereum was created as <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sandbox</a></strong>. Since then, the game has switched to Polygon&#8217;s layer 2, primarily to decrease its carbon footprint and fees, and increase speed. The game most resembles <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/explained-roblox-metaverse-and-how-does-roblox-meta-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roblox</a></strong> or Minecraft, and it is a well-known <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/top-10-igo-launchpads-for-initial-game-offering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameFi</a></strong> crypto token project. In the social center, users can create their own games, worlds, and adventures. The most valuable resource in the Sandbox is LAND. Each LAND is an NFT that represents virtual land ownership.</p>
<h3><b>2. Star Atlas</b></h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/top-5-metaverse-tokens-for-great-returns-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Atlas</a></strong> is redefining what a play-to-earn game can be thanks to its robust <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metaverse</a></strong>. It is based on blockchain technology. However, the Solana protocol enables a mostly serverless and secure gaming experience. The year 2620 is the setting for this multiplayer online game. In the game, an alliance of extraterrestrial species, sentient robots, and humans are the three main groups that have emerged and are competing for resources. Deflationary mechanics are incorporated into the game, whereby resources used to produce objects are destroyed when a new one is created.</p>
<h3><b>3. Decentraland</b></h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentraland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentraland</a></strong> is a virtual world built on the Ethereum blockchain in which players can earn NFTs by playing.  In the Decentraland universe, various businesses are opening shops and selling land as <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a></strong>. This includes companies like Samsung, DKNY, Selfridges, and even sportswear companies like Sketchers. However, in Decentraland, players can try to make money by buying MANA tokens and hoping that the value will rise or by buying LAND, which is represented by NFT plots. It is one of the best play-to-earn games.</p>
<h3><b>4. Axie Infinity</b></h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/my-neighbor-alice-vs-axie-infinity-which-is-superior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axie Infinity</a></strong> allows players to control and run a portion of the game. This game was inspired by Nintendo&#8217;s Pokémon franchise. Players can acquire AXS tokens by participating in the game. Also, they can then use these tokens to change the course of the game. Players will gather creatures during gameplay and engage them in combat. However, players will receive cryptocurrency tokens as compensation for killing monsters and finishing tasks. Players will own Axie NFTs, and they will be able to resell them hope for a profit. The game runs on the Ethereum blockchain using Ronin, a sidechain that aids in lowering transaction costs and latency.</p>
<h3><b>5. My Neighbor Alice</b></h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/my-neighbor-alice-an-introduction-to-the-play-to-earn-crypto-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Neighbor Alice</a></strong> is a well-designed animated world where players can farm, fish, socialize, and keep bees, among other things. However, in order to enter Alice World, players must first purchase a plot of land, the cheapest of which is 247 ALICE ($260). After the initial purchase, it&#8217;s just a matter of living and taking care of daily tasks. But being a good neighbor and assisting Alice with her tasks is the key to earning rewards. Players receive rewards from this, which players can trade for things that can use on players&#8217; lands. However, players looking for casual blockchain gaming with the knowledge to take part in this realistic simulation are the target audience.</p>
