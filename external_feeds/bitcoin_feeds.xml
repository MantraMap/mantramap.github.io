The network&#x2019;s difficulty is now at an all-time high. This means, on average, it takes 37.73 trillion hashes, or attempts, to find a valid bitcoin block reward and add it to the blockchain.</strong></p>
<h2>2023&#x2019;s First Difficulty Increase Outpaces All but One of the Difficulty Increases in 2022</h2>
<p>As of 8:15 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday, Jan. 15, 2023, approximately <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">286.36 exahash per second (EH/s)</a> of hashrate is dedicated to the Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) blockchain. The Bitcoin network experienced a difficulty retarget at 4:11 p.m. Eastern time, at <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/772128">block height 772,128</a>, resulting in an increase of <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">10.26%</a>.</p>
<p>The difficulty was approximately 34.09 trillion last week, and it reached an all-time high (ATH) of 37.73 trillion on Sunday, making it exceptionally difficult to find a <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block. Prior to the Jan. 15, 2023, difficulty increase, the highest difficulty rating on the Bitcoin blockchain was 36.76 trillion on Nov. 6, 2022.</p>

<p>The current difficulty is 2.63% higher than the previous high. The Jan. 15 difficulty rise also surpasses all but one of the difficulty increases from last year. In 2022, the largest difficulty increase took place on Oct. 10, 2022, at block height 758,016, when it rose by 13.55%. Bitcoin&#x2019;s price has <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">climbed 22.7% higher</a> in the last seven days, which is beneficial to Bitcoin miners. However, the 10.26% difficulty increase will make profits a lot tighter.</p>
<p>The new year began with a bang for Bitcoin as the network&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hashrate-reaches-all-time-high-boost-could-lead-to-record-setting-difficulty-increase/">hashrate reached an all-time</a> high of 361.20 exahash per second (EH/s) on Jan. 6, 2023, at block height 770,709. This surpassed the previous record of 347.16 EH/s set on Nov. 12, 2022. The high hashrate has led to faster block intervals and the difficulty increase that was recorded on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>With two records set in the first month of the new year, 2023 will be noteworthy for miners. At press time, the cost of Bitcoin production, according to macromicro.me <a href="https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-cost">data</a>, is an estimated $17,377 per unit, while <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is trading at $20,876 per coin.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool">mining pool concentration</a> has grown significantly, with two mining pools commanding more than 56.68% of the global hashrate over the past three days. Statistics show that the top mining pool, Foundry USA, commands 97.03 exahash per second (EH/s) of hashrate, while Antpool has around 55.92 EH/s.</p>
<p>The next difficulty change is expected to occur on or around Jan. 28, 2023, and the current block interval time is around 8 minutes, 26 seconds. Despite reaching an all-time high on Jan. 6, the average hashrate during the past 2,016 blocks has been around 268.9 exahashes per second (EH/s). At the time of writing, there are 67,846 blocks left to be mined before the next reward halving, and an issuance of 1,736,531.23 Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) waiting to be discovered.</p>

He believes that eventually the Fed &#8220;will be forced to pivot.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Jeff Booth Warns About Danger of Continued Fed Rate Hikes</h2>
<p>The author of &#8220;The Price of Tomorrow,&#8221; Jeff Booth, shared his thoughts in an Ask-Me-Anything session on Stacker News last week. Among numerous questions asked was whether he believes the recent Federal Reserve interest rate increases will actually cause widespread deflation. Booth replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>If they keep hiking, it will &#8216;eventually&#8217; turn into debt deflation — or credit wipeout. (ala great depression on steroids). Eventually, they will be forced to pivot.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;One important consideration for people is to think in terms of lag effect…ie 18 months from when actions are set in motion,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Remember when no inflation, transitory inflation, high inflation,&#8221; Booth added, cautioning:</p>
<blockquote><p>This tightening only really started in September and Fed only reduced their balance sheet by 2.7 % last year — with subsequent damage&#8230;. If they continue&#8230;..ugly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Booth published a book titled &#8220;The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation is the Key to an Abundant Future&#8221; in 2020. In his book, the author explored “the problem of how to integrate the deflation brought on by technology into a system where inflation has been the norm,” according to the book&#8217;s overview. Booth believes &#8220;we can avoid a looming economic crisis if we can learn to embrace what abundance brings, which could even be a world without work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Booth has long been a proponent of bitcoin. He said in May last year: &#8220;Bitcoin will give individual rights and freedoms to the billions of people on our planet that should&#8217;ve had them in the first place.&#8221; The Price of Tomorrow author tweeted Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p>We live in a world of abundance, bounded by a financial system built on scarcity. And while many don&#8217;t yet realize it because they are still trapped in the system requiring scarcity, bitcoin is the key that unlocks the abundance.</p></blockquote>

However, combined transaction volume on layer two (L2) chains Arbitrum and Optimism has outpaced Ethereum&#x2019;s onchain transaction output. On Saturday, Jan. 14, 2023, Ethereum processed 1.10 million onchain transactions, while combined transactions on Arbitrum and Optimism reached 1.32 million for the same day.</strong></p>
<h2>Rise of L2 Scaling Solutions Arbitrum and Optimism</h2>
<p>Onchain transaction fees have decreased significantly since the first week of Aug. 2022 and even more so since the blockchain transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network on Sept. 15, 2022. Data from <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">etherscan.io&#x2019;s gas tracker</a> shows that the highest priority onchain ether transaction costs an estimated $0.75 or 23 gwei on Sunday afternoon at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p>
<p>According to Sunday, Jan. 15, 2023 data, the average <a href="https://arbitrum.io/">Arbitrum</a> transaction costs around $0.101 per transfer, while an <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a> transaction costs $0.1410 per transfer. L2 scaling solutions have become increasingly popular since 2020, with options such as <a href="https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-hermez/">Polygon Hermez</a>, <a href="https://zksync.io/">Zksync</a>, <a href="https://boba.network/">Boba</a>, and <a href="https://starkware.co/starknet/">Starknet</a>, in addition to Optimism and Arbitrum.</p>

<p>These solutions allow for faster and cheaper transactions by reducing the computational workload on the main blockchain network (Ethereum), or layer one (L1). Arbitrum and Optimism transactions are <a href="https://medium.com/offchainlabs/how-arbitrum-rollup-works-39788e1ed73f">periodically</a> &#x201C;rolled up&#x201D; and recorded on Ethereum using an optimistic rollup or optimistic virtual machine. Dune Analytics <a href="https://dune.com/blockworks_research/l2-comparison-dashboard">statistics</a> show that both L2 networks, Arbitrum and Optimism, have seen a significant increase in daily transactions.</p>
<p>For example, Optimism recorded 737,191 transactions on Jan. 14, and Arbitrum captured 586,745 transactions on the same day. Since Jan. 10, 2023, the combined number of transactions on both Arbitrum and Optimism has surpassed the number of direct Ethereum onchain transfers. For example, on Jan. 10, the combined transaction count for both L2 scaling networks was around 1.12 million, while Ethereum processed 1.06 million on-chain transfers.</p>
<p>On Jan. 14, 2023, according to data from Dune Analytics, the combined transaction count for both L2 networks was around 1.32 million transactions, compared to the 1.10 million transactions settled on the Ethereum chain. Ethereum still processes a significant number of transactions per day compared to most blockchains. Since June 17, 2020, Ethereum has typically processed over a million transactions per day. However, a few other crypto networks settle more transactions than Ethereum does, such as <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-eth-xrp.html#3y">XRP</a> and <a href="https://polygonscan.com/chart/tx">Polygon</a>.</p>

<p>On Jan. 14, Polygon recorded 3.10 million transactions and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> saw 1.25 million transactions settled on that day. While the L2 chains Arbitrum and Optimism on their own have not surpassed Ethereum&#x2019;s, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s or Polygon&#x2019;s transaction per day count, they have seen a significant increase in the last 12 months.</p>

<p>For example, on Jan. 15, 2022, Ethereum processed 1.17 million transactions that day, while Arbitrum processed 21,734 transfers per day, and Optimism processed 30,430 transactions per day. The data shows that over the last 12 months, Arbitrum&#x2019;s transaction per day count has increased by 2,599%, and the L2 scaling solution Optimism&#x2019;s daily transfer count has risen by 2,322% since Jan. 2022.</p>

The trading platform also misled customers that it was operating with the regulatory approval of the financial authorities in the country.</strong></p>
<h2>Belize-based Exchange Risks Hefty Fine in Poland for Allegedly Deceiving Crypto Traders</h2>
<p>The Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) is pressing charges against Good Solution Investments Ltd., the operator of Kanga Exchange. According to the agency, the coin trading platform claims that its “business model” has been approved by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF).</p>
<p>“Kanga Exchange has never received the approval it refers to. Moreover, its activities are not subject to supervision or evaluation by the KNF. Providing such information could mislead consumers as to the legality and safety of the performed operations,” the head of UOKiK, Tomasz Chróstny, explained in an announcement.</p>
<p>The crypto market in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/poland-romania-rank-in-top-10-for-number-of-bitcoin-atms-worlds-total-exceeds-23000/">Poland</a> is not specifically regulated as it’s not considered part of the financial market, the office noted. So far, KNF has published only a warning of the risks associated with the acquisition and trading of crypto assets.</p>

<p><a href="https://uokik.gov.pl/home.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UOKiK</a> established that the false information about the Polish regulatory approval was published on two websites, kanga.exchange and kangakantor.pl. Kanga Exchange also promoted itself as a “Polish cryptocurrency exchange” when its operator is registered in the Caribbean nation of Belize. According to its terms, the law applicable to the contracts with users is also the one of Belize.</p>
<p>Just because a person authorized to represent the company is a citizen of Poland does not justify the claims that the product offered is of Polish origin, Chróstny elaborated further. Misleading consumers in that regard may impact their financial decisions. Had they known that Poland’s legislation was not applicable, they could have chosen not to use its services, he pointed out.</p>
<p>If the charges against it are confirmed, Good Solution Investments would face a fine of up to 10% of its turnover for violating collective consumer interests. The company’s name is also on a warning list issued by the KNF and the case is being examined by the District Prosecutor’s Office in Warsaw.</p>
<p>The Office of Competition and Consumer Protection has taken action regarding other cryptocurrency platforms before, including Coincasso OÜ, which it fined, the Lodz-based Selfmaker Technology, and the Dubai-registered Selfmaker Smart Solutions, suspected of running a pyramid-like promotional system.</p>

Adebajo also suggested that the Central Bank of Nigeria governor Godwin Emefiele should be probed for his role in allowing the DMO&#8217;s borrowings to balloon to more than $48.8 billion. </strong></p>
<h2>DMO Accused of Contravening the Fiscal Responsibility Act</h2>
<p>According to Adetilewa Adebajo, an international financial markets expert, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) violated the law when its borrowings exceeded $2.2 billion (1 trillion nairas). In remarks <a href="http://pulse9ja.com/nigerias-debts-have-exceeded-limit-contravenes-law-adebajo/">reportedly</a> made during an interview with Arise TV, Adebajo argued that the DMO can be sued for contravening both the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Act and the Fiscal Responsibility Act.</p>
<p>Although the DMO is allowed to borrow domestically without a mandate from the country’s National Assembly, the agency’s borrowings which now exceed $48.8 billion mean it has violated the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DMO is not mandated to go to the National Assembly before they borrow abroad, but the Ways and Means give them the right. But it is not supposed to exceed N1 trillion. It is at N22 trillion [$48.8 billion], which indicates that they have exceeded the limit. This is where the illegality comes in,&#8221; Adebajo reportedly said.</p>

<h2>Expert Slates Nigeria&#8217;s Planned Securitization of Its Debt</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, a different <a href="https://thewhistler.ng/cfg-advisory-boss-calls-for-emefieles-probe-over-alleged-violation-of-cbn-act/">report</a> quotes Adebajo who said the Nigerian central bank governor Godwin Emefiele should be probed for his role in allowing the DMO to exceed its borrowing limits. Concerning the Nigerian government’s plan to securitize its debt for 40 years, Adebajo insisted that such an would be illegal.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want to send the securitisation proposal to the ways and means committee of the National Assembly, under which law? There is no law in Nigeria that states that you take ways and means financing to the National Assembly for approval,&#8221; the expert reportedly said.</p>

Before his role at FTX US, Harrison worked with SBF at Jane Street and prior to joining FTX, he worked for Citadel Securities. In the Twitter thread, the former president of the U.S. subsidiary explained that his &#8220;relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried and his deputies had reached a point of total deterioration, after months of disputes over management practices at FTX.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Brett Harrison&#8217;s Deteriorating Relationship With FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried Leads to Resignation</h2>
<p>On Jan. 14, 2023, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88">Brett Harrison</a>, the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftxus-appoints-brett-harrison-as-president-301291096.html">former president of FTX US</a>, shared his <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1614371358519042051?s=20&amp;t=o-FOIufS1-Gkn-fWMGwOKw">personal account</a> of his experience working at FTX US, the United States-based crypto exchange company, for seventeen months. Harrison described his days with the U.S. exchange in a 49-part Twitter thread that goes into great detail. Initially, Harrison was excited to join the company, but over time, his relationship with the company&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disgraced-ftx-co-founder-awaits-trial-passes-time-playing-video-games-and-blogging-on-his-new-substack-newsletter/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> (SBF), deteriorated due to disputes over management practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six months into my time at the company, pronounced cracks began to form in my own relationship with Sam,” Harrison said. “Around then I began advocating strongly for establishing separation and independence for the executive, legal, and developer teams of FTX US, and Sam disagreed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite facing immense pressure, Harrison persisted in disagreeing with the CEO of FTX, whose sway over various industries was both pervasive and unyielding. Harrison said others at FTX US shared his dissent towards the CEO and his inner circle, as he remarked that it was a team of seasoned professionals from reputable firms in U.S. finance, law, and regulated exchanges.</p>
<p>“Our collective experience and professional acumen were frequently treated as though they were irrelevant and valueless. It was extremely frustrating for all of us,” Harrison insisted. Harrison added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sam was uncomfortable with conflict. He responded at times with dysregulated hostility, at times with gaslighting and manipulation, but ultimately chose to isolate me from communication on key decision-making.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Harrison Resigned From FTX on Sept. 27, 2022, After Attempts to Address Organizational Problems at the Company</h2>
<p>Ultimately Harrison decided to leave the company and founded his own firm because he felt that the &#8220;dream job&#8221; of working at FTX US was not worth it due to the deterioration of the relationship with SBF. Harrison said SBF’s behavior and decisions were influenced by insecurity and volatility in temperament.</p>
<p>In early April 2022, Harrison made a final attempt to address the organizational problems at FTX US by making a formal complaint. In response, he was threatened with being fired and having his professional reputation destroyed by Bankman-Fried if he did not retract his complaint and apologize. This event solidified Harrison&#8217;s decision to leave the company. He wanted to ensure that the company was well-positioned for success after his departure, so he left the company in an orderly manner.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ An announcement: I’m stepping down as President of <a href="https://twitter.com/FTX_Official?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FTX_Official</a>. Over the next few months I’ll be transferring my responsibilities and moving into an advisory role at the company.</p>
<p>&mdash; Brett Harrison (@BrettHarrison88) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1574782901748727809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“So I gradually wound down, finished building and releasing the US stock brokerage, and saw FTX US employees through their mid-year reviews,” Harrison said. &#8220;I never could have guessed that underlying these kinds of issues … which I’d seen at other more mature firms in my career and believed not to be fatal to business success … was multi-billion-dollar fraud,&#8221; Harrison remarked.</p>

<p>Harrison added that he has received apologies from many people who are aware that he had no involvement in the criminal scheme. He has learned a lot about the industry over the last few months, some people treated him differently, while some offered sympathy and support. He also mentions that it will be difficult to forget the frenzied and baseless accusations leveled against him on social media.</p>
<p>When Harrison left FTX US last year, SBF <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/crypto-exchange-ftx-us-president-brett-harrison-steps-down">told Bloomberg</a> that the executive&#8217;s departure had been in the works for &#8220;a little while.&#8221; The news outlet also asked SBF about his own succession plans, and the FTX CEO said at the time that he had no plans to leave FTX and he would be there &#8220;for the long term.&#8221;</p>

<p>Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is attempting to regain access to his Robinhood shares, worth over $460 million. The former CEO of the collapsed crypto exchange claimed that he needs them to “pay for his criminal defense,” stressing that without them the consequences would be serious and “irreparable.” FTX customers, on the other hand, “face only the possibility of economic loss,” SBF’s court filing states.</p>

The bank believes that its electronic money platform represents an economically viable implementation of blockchain technology. </strong></p>
<h2>Tascombank Conducts Tests With New Ukrainian Digital Currency</h2>
<p>An “electronic hryvnia” has been tested by Ukraine’s Tascombank during the pilot phase of a project to create a currency with the Stellar network. During the trials, the coin was used in settlements between buyers and sellers, the financial institution announced in a <a href="https://tascombank.ua/files/Electronic_hryvnia_Pilot_TASCOMBANK.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>.</p>
<p>Operations with the new digital asset were carried out in accordance with the current know-your-customer and anti-money laundering procedures, the bank pointed out in the document, quoted by the crypto news outlet Forklog.</p>
<p>Tascombank also emphasized its research demonstrated a number of advantages of employing blockchain, including transparency at all stages of circulation and between all participants in the transactions, increased security and confidentiality for user data, low costs, and high capacity.</p>
<p>The electronic money circulation scheme studied during the pilot is an economically viable business model for using blockchain technology, the authors of the report elaborated, stating that they “consider the pilot project successful and promising in terms of further product development and implementation.”</p>

<p>The bank added that it plans to continue its studies on the issuance and circulation of blockchain-based electronic money. One of the areas its future research is going to cover will be the possible use of such currency in retail non-cash payments.</p>
<p>Tascombank also revealed that the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) believes the results of its pilot, which was launched at the end of 2021, can be used by experts at commercial and central banks to conduct further analysis.</p>
<p>In January of 2021, the Ministry of Digital Transformation in Kyiv <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ukraine-chooses-stellar-foundation-to-develop-its-cbdc-regulatory-infrastructure-for-stablecoins/">chose</a> the Stellar Development Foundation as a partner in the development of the country’s virtual assets ecosystem, including infrastructure for NBU’s central bank digital currency (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>). In November, last year, the NBU <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/national-bank-of-ukraine-unveils-e-hryvnia-concept/">presented</a> a “draft e-hryvnia concept” to members of the crypto industry, banks, and other financial institutions.</p>

Metamask users should instead &#8220;develop a habit of thoroughly checking every single character of an address&#8221; before sending a transaction.</strong></p>
<h2>Scammers Exploiting Users&#8217; Carelessness</h2>
<p>Metamask crypto wallet users should be wary of a new scammer tactic known as the address poisoning attack, which is dependent on the user’s &#8220;carelessness and haste above all else,&#8221; the team behind the software cryptocurrency wallet has warned. The Metamask team added that while the attack method may seem harmless, &#8220;it can just as easily result in a loss of funds.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A new scam called &#39;Address Poisoning&#39; is on the rise. Here&#39;s how it works: after you send a normal transaction, the scammer sends a $0 token txn, &#39;poisoning&#39; the txn history. (1/3)</p>
<p>&mdash; MetaMask Support (@MetaMaskSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaMaskSupport/status/1613255316870729728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In its Jan. 11 <a href="https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/11967455819035-Address-poisoning-scams">statement</a> that explains how scammers use this new tactic to steal from unsuspecting users, the Metamask Support team said cybercriminals and scammers often exploit common behavior among crypto users such as the copying and pasting of wallet addresses. Although this ensures that funds are sent to the correct address, the team warned that scammers are aware that many users are unwilling to memorize their wallet addresses. The statement said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Since they&#8217;re so long, crypto wallet addresses are typically shortened. You might see the first lot of characters only, or sometimes you may see the initial 5-10 or so and the final 5-10 or so, skipping the middle. This is how most people recognize addresses: not by knowing every single character, but by becoming familiar with the start and finish. This is the tendency that address poisoning preys on.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Users Must Check Every Single Character in a Wallet Address</h2>
<p>According to the Metamask Support team, scammers often initiate a poisoning attack by sending a negligible amount to a dummy wallet address which closely matches that of a Metamask wallet user. After this, the scammer will wait and hope the targeted user[s] will &#8220;inadvertently copy their address from your transaction history and paste it elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since transactions like these are said to be immutable or irreversible, when funds are sent to an incorrect address, they are lost forever. Therefore, wallet users need to take all precautions including &#8220;checking every single character.&#8221; The Metamask Support team said wallet users must try to end the practice of copying addresses from their transaction history.</p>
<p>Instead, wallet users should &#8220;develop a habit of thoroughly checking every single character of an address before you send a transaction.&#8221;</p>
