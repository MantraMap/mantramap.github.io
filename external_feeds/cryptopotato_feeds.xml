            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prime Trust &#8211; a once-leading cryptocurrency custodian &#8211; filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware approximately two months after the Nevada Financial Institutions Division claimed it operates in an &#8220;unsafe and unsound manner.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company was among the leaders in its field a few years ago, holding funds on behalf of other fallen behemoths such as FTX and Celsius Network.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Latest to Go Bankrupt</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the firm&#8217;s </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/X274/12452/PLEADINGS/1245208152380000000024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, its estimated liabilities (on a consolidated basis) range from $100 million to $500 million, while the number of creditors is up to 50,000.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite being based in Las Vegas, Nevada, Prime Trust filed for bankruptcy protection in the district of Delaware since it had its domicile, principal place of business, or principal assets in this region for 180 days prior to the date of the petition.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency custodian had regulatory issues with the Nevada watchdogs in June when they issued a cease and desist order, claiming the firm had major liquidity cracks and could not honor clients&#8217; withdrawal requests. Shortly after, the Nevada Financial Institutions Division </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/prime-trust-placed-in-receivership-by-nevadas-regulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a petition to place Prime Trust in receivership.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;With consideration of the above, Prime is in an unsafe financial condition and/or is insolvent. Additionally, Prime&#8217;s condition will only progressively worsen as customers continue to withdraw from Prime,&#8221; the agency maintained at the time.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The regulator estimated that the crypto firm owed more than $85 million in fiat currency to customers but had only $2.9 million. It also had $69.5 million worth of cryptocurrency debt, while its digital asset holdings equaled $68.6 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prime Trust was once an industry leader, storing assets and providing services to the defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the crypto lender Celsius Network. Both firms filed for bankruptcy last year, adding their names to the long list of entities that collapsed amid the prolonged bear market or some alleged fraudulent actions.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Who Else Went Bankrupt?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The crypto winter, which seemed to have intensified in the spring of 2022 (around the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/here-is-what-happened-to-luna-and-why-the-price-can-continue-crashing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Terra crash</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">), hampered investors&#8217; interest and significantly affected the operation of many firms serving the sector. As such, some could not operate properly and filed for bankruptcy protection.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">SHIB appears at a crossroad as the price is quickly losing its bullish momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.000010; $0.000094</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.000012 </strong></p>
<h2>1. Rejection under Key Resistance</h2>
<p>The rally continued until Sunday when the price started to fall. This is the first time in over a week when sellers showed strength and were able to stop the rally. If this continues, then SHIB may enter a correction.</p>

<h2>2. Bearish Divergence</h2>
<p>The daily RSI is showing a clear bearish divergence. The price made a higher high, while the RSI momentum indicator made a lower high. This shows that bulls are starting to lose control over the price.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266541" style="width: 2447px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266541" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04" width="2447" height="1199" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04.png 2447w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-1024x502.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-768x376.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-1536x753.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-2048x1003.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-56-04-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2447px) 100vw, 2447px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266541" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. Momentum Shifting Bearish?</h2>
<p>Similarly to the RSI, the MACD histogram has been making lower highs for four days. This is a clear warning sign that momentum may soon change if buyers don&#8217;t return soon.</p>
<p>While a bearish cross is still some distance away, this price action may encourage sellers to step up their pressure.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266534" style="width: 2447px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266534" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26" width="2447" height="1199" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26.png 2447w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-1024x502.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-768x376.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-1536x753.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-2048x1003.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-15_18-46-26-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2447px) 100vw, 2447px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266534" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for SHIB is neutral.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for SHIB Price</h2>
<p>Even if a correction unfolds this week, SHIB has good support at $0.000010 and $0.000094. Only if these levels fail to hold would the price action turn bearish. The resistance remains at $0.000012.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[In response to the upcoming event, miners have shifted from a selling spree that began in August 2022 to the recent accumulation trend.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On-chain data analyzed by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex shows that bitcoin (BTC) miners have entered an accumulation phase in preparation for the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 2024.</p>
<p>According to the latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report, the miner reserve metric <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bitfinex-Alpha-67-1.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">indicates</a> a significant accumulation trend from May 27, 2023, which has increased since bitcoin&#8217;s recent downturn from the $30,000 price level.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Miners Accumulate BTC</h2>
<p>The bitcoin halving, which <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/breakdown-of-btcs-price-performance-after-previous-halvings-will-history-repeat/" data-wpel-link="internal">occurs</a> every four years or after 210,000 blocks, is a mechanism that slashes the network&#8217;s miners&#8217; rewards by half to reduce the speed at which new BTC is created and possibly increase the asset&#8217;s value. The upcoming one is the fourth since BTC&#8217;s inception and is expected to reduce the network&#8217;s rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.</p>
<p>In response to the upcoming event, miners have shifted from a selling spree that began in August 2022 to the recent accumulation trend. Bitfinex found that July recorded restrained on-chain BTC outflows with a sudden increase towards its end. The exchange noted that the move was &#8220;likely a protective measure against potential resistance against buyers.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/whats-the-cost-to-mine-1-btc-for-top-bitcoin-miners-bernstein-clarifies/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin mining firms</a> have enhanced liquidity positions, reducing their tendency to sell more BTC. This can be attributed to the surge in their stock prices following the buzz around BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With their strong financial reserves, the miners can expand their mining equipment and handle potential price downturns.</p>
<h2>Institutional Crypto Investors Apply Caution</h2>
<p>As bitcoin miners increase their holdings, institutional crypto investors are applying caution to their investments. Bitfinex said this is because the broader market is &#8220;languid,&#8221; and trading volumes have slumped by 62% year-to-date.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Volatility indicators show that we are in for quieter times overall. Bitcoin&#8217;s historical metrics seem to be settling, pointing towards an impending stabilization in market swings, with traders indicating a balanced market,&#8221; the exchange said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, bitcoin funds continue to see large outflows, while institutional investors have stopped shorting BTC via investment products for the first time in 14 weeks. The movement of funds aligns with investors locking in their profits.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a token that&#8217;s closely related to the Shiba Inu ecosystem has been making headlines. The cryptocurrency in question is called BAD, and it&#8217;s short for Blockchain + AI + DAO.</p>
<p>Throughout the past 24 hours alone, BAD&#8217;s price is up 20%, bringing its total monthly gains up to around 440%. But why?</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266519" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg" alt="bad_shib_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bad_shib_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu and Bad Idea: What&#8217;s the Relationship?</h2>
<p>Right off the bad, it&#8217;s important to note that BAD is a token that brings forward a decentralized experiment, seeking to combine Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-dao/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</a> in a &#8220;risky, meme-worth concoction.&#8221;</p>
<p>In essence, the planning of the project, as well as other tasks, are handed to the community.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also been a notable relationship between BAD and Shiba Inu. Earlier in August, the lead developer of SHIB &#8211; Shytoshi Kusama &#8211; pointed out how he sees the partnership going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>BAD has more to do with our next phase than just a silly voice in a keynote. It&#8217;s about being thought leaders in a world of copycats.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Why is BAD Price Pumping?</h2>
<p>BAD&#8217;s been on a roll during the last 30 days, as the cryptocurrency has surged by more than 440% throughout the period.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266517" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266517" style="width: 689px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266517" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-15 135321" width="689" height="463" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321.jpg 689w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321-300x202.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-15-135321-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266517" class="wp-caption-text">BAD Price. Source: CoinGecko</figcaption></figure>
<p>As it can be seen in the chart above, the surge started more or less when Kusama posted about the long-term plans of Shiba Inu, including Bad Idea.</p>
<p>Moreover, Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing strategist, Lucie, has also recently highlighted the partnership between both projects, pushing the community to vote in favor of a free audit for BAD through CertiK.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Institutional invetors will be able to enter the BTC ecosystem and meet ESG goals at the same time, said Jacobi.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the US SEC continues to reject or delay, at best, all spot Bitcoin ETF applications, such a product has seen the light of day in Europe.</p>
<p>Called the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF, it will be the first similar product compliant with SFDR Article 8 through its decarbonization strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230815404630/en/Jacobi-Asset-Management-lists-Europe" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">press release</a> dated August 15 informs that the spot Bitcoin ETF will be the brainchild of Jacobi Asset Management and Wilshire Indexes. It will be under the ticker BCOIN and has already been listed on Euronext Amsterdam.</li>
<li>Jacobi said it had &#8220;implemented a verifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution which allows institutional investors to access the benefits of Bitcoin whilst also meeting ESG goals.&#8221;</li>
<li>The ETF will be regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC). Fidelity Digital Assets will be the custodian, Flow Traders will serve as market makers, and Jane Street and DRW will be Authorized Participants.</li>
<li>Wilshire Indexes&#8217; CEO &#8211; Mark Makepeace, commented:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“The launch of the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is an important milestone for the digital asset industry and a transformative moment for the global financial industry. We are excited about the partnership with Jacobi and, as a leader in the development of institutional-grade digital asset benchmarks, we are committed to helping accelerate the advancement of the entire digital asset ecosystem.”</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Spot Bitcoin ETFs have launched in a couple of other countries in the past few years, including Brazil and Canada. However, the US securities watchdog &#8211; the SEC &#8211; continues to reject all applications for such a product.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, the landscape can change soon as the world&#8217;s largest asset manager &#8211; BlackRock &#8211; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrocks-etf-success-rate-with-the-sec-is-575-to-1-what-about-its-bitcoin-application/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> for a spot Bitcoin ETF in mid-June.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has gained significant popularity recently due to its fast transaction speed and low cost.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transactions on the XRPL are processed within seconds and at a fraction of a penny, making it an efficient and cost-effective platform for payments, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA).</p>
<p>A recent study <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/xrp/markets/BTC" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">conducted</a> by CryptoCompare revealed that XRPL is the fastest and most cost-effective blockchain network for payments.</p>
<p>The study found that XRPL transactions were processed in an average of just 3.3 seconds, with a transaction cost of only $0.00003. This represents a significant improvement compared to BTC, ETH, and ADA, which have average transaction times of 10 minutes, 15 seconds, and 20 seconds, respectively.</p>
<h2>XRP’S Scalability and Mechanism</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the study highlighted the scalability of XRPL compared to BTC, ETH, and ADA. While BTC, ETH, and ADA can only handle 7 transactions per second, 15 transactions per second, and 100 transactions per second, respectively, the XRPL can process up to 1,500 transactions per second.</p>
<p>Unlike BTC, which relies on energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, the XRPL utilizes a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>This not only contributes to its speed, cost-efficiency, and scalability but also makes <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/two-things-to-watch-for-in-ripple-xrp-price-this-week-volatility-ahead/" data-wpel-link="internal">XRPL</a> a more sustainable choice for businesses seeking fast and affordable payment solutions.</p>
<p>Overall, the attributes of the XRP Ledger position it as an attractive platform for payments, surpassing BTC, ETH, and ADA in terms of speed, cost-efficiency, and scalability, and it offers a more environmentally conscious alternative.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s also the other side of the argument &#8211; decentralization. Unlike Bitcoin&#8217;s distributed ledger, which relies on open-source technology developed and maintained by hundreds of independent developers and runs on tens of thousands of nodes across the world, XRP remains a largely centralized solution operated by a single entity &#8211; Ripple Labs.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin is trying to make a move above $29K but has so far been unsuccessful, unlike a few altcoins. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has been unable to make any forward progress in terms of price action throughout the past 24 hours, but it wasn&#8217;t for the lack of trying.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some altcoins are charting considerable increases over the same period.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Can&#8217;t Push $30K</h2>
<p>Throughout the last 24 hours, Bitcoin bulls made an attempt to push the price toward the coveted $30K level.</p>
<p>They managed to get BTC all the way up to around $29,700, but that&#8217;s when bears intercepted the move, as it&#8217;s clearly visible in the following hourly chart.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266477" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266477" style="width: 1333px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266477" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14.png" alt="BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14" width="1333" height="858" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14.png 1333w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14-300x193.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14-1024x659.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14-768x494.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-15_11-43-14-50x32.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266477" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>They pushed the price back toward $29,400, where it&#8217;s currently trading, and Bitcoin ended the day completely flat, according to CoinGecko.</p>
<p>In any case, the presence of volatility, albeit low, is perceived as a refreshing mark in the industry, given how flat the market has been throughout the past month. It&#8217;s now interesting to see if the price will finally manage to escape its narrow range or if more of the same is incoming.</p>
<h2>Some Altcoins Soar, Others Stagnate</h2>
<p>The broader altcoin market has also been relatively calm throughout the past 24 hours, with certain exceptions, of course.</p>
<p>As seen in the heatmap below, most of the larger cryptocurrencies failed to chart any considerable increases and are trading close to flat on the day.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266479" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266479" style="width: 1650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266479" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231.jpg" alt="cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231" width="1650" height="1168" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231.jpg 1650w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231-300x212.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231-1024x725.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231-768x544.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231-1536x1087.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1508231-50x35.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266479" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Quantify Crypto</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, there are a few cryptocurrencies that are pushing ahead of the herd considerably. First, FLEX Coin (FLEX) exploded by 16% throughout the past day and is undoubtedly the best performer for today.</p>
<p>THORChain (RUNE) is also up around 14%, but the cryptocurrency skyrocketed by almost 70% in the past week.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also Hedera&#8217;s HBAR token which is up over 10% on the day, also making it one of the best performers.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, there&#8217;s Kaspa. KAS is down 12% in the last 24 hours and is today&#8217;s worst-performing cryptocurrency.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Is a SHIB rally in the making? Voyager has sold out its entire SHIB stash, while lead developer is expected to come up with a major announcement today.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an explosive cryptocurrency known for its sudden and unexpected rallies. Throughout the past seven days, it&#8217;s up 13.2%, making it one of the best-performing altcoins from the top 20 by means of total market capitalization.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s interesting data surfacing, indicating that SHIB&#8217;s price action has actually been compressed by tremendous selling coming from an institutional market participant.</p>
<h2>Is a SHIB Rally Incoming?</h2>
<p>Data from the popular on-chain analytics resource <em>Lookonchain </em><a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1691272802077429761" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">revealed</a> that Voyager has been selling a considerable number of SHIB tokens throughout the past 4 days.</p>
<p>The asset manager, which is currently going through a bankruptcy procedure, sold a whopping 1.4 <em>trillion </em>SHIB worth around $14.4 million.</p>
<p>This has likely suppressed the price from going higher. A couple of days ago, <em>CryptoPotato </em><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/voyager-reportedly-moved-5-5m-of-eth-and-shib-to-coinbase-amid-bankruptcy-procedures/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> that Voyager moved $2.7 million worth of SHIB to Coinbase. It turns out that the reason was obvious.</p>
<p>The good news is that <em>Lookonchain </em>reported that Voyager has no more SHIB to sell. If the cryptocurrency continues its impressive performance from the past seven days, this might mean that more gains are in sight.</p>
<h2>Good News Coming?</h2>
<p>SHIB proponents are also expecting developments in its broader ecosystem. A few days ago, the lead developer Shytoshi Kusama <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/will-shiba-inus-leash-skyrocket-this-week-lead-developer-teases-big-updates-heres-when/" data-wpel-link="internal">teased</a> a new utility for its LEASH token.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing strategist also pushed some updates, stating that later in the day, Kusama will be &#8220;giving a presentation that you won&#8217;t want to miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the recent developments have also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/this-new-shiba-inu-whale-adds-48-million-worth-of-shib-ahead-of-developments/" data-wpel-link="internal">attracted</a> a brand new whale to the ecosystem. Someone bought a whopping $48 million worth of SHIB just a couple of days ago. Could they be waiting for something?</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[According to newly published documents, SBF used other FTX C-Suite members to bypass donation limits.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 14th of August, the prosecution in SBF’s ongoing court case produced the longest and most explicit list of charges so far.</p>
<p>The document is 70 pages long and names legal precedents for most of the charges brought against him. However, special attention is given to the accusation of illegal political campaign contributions.</p>
<p>It wasn’t too long ago that Bankman-Fried was requesting the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sbf-to-enter-not-guilty-plea-to-campaign-financing-and-china-bribery-charges-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">dismissal</a> of the contribution charge, among others. Unfortunately for the defense, the document shows that the prosecution plans to revive the charges based on new evidence garnered during the discovery period.</p>
<h2>Things Sam Is Freaking Out About</h2>
<p>A highly important part of the prosecution’s strategy is the use of Caroline Ellison’s personal notes and archives, which include a list named “Things Sam Is Freaking Out About,” as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/14/technology/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-prosecutors.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by the New York Times.</p>
<p>These archives were virulently attacked by the defense, who labeled them as hearsay. However, the prosecution argues that Ellison’s notes are admissible evidence. In their opinion, the notes were not organized systematically due to any personal quirk. Instead, they were used to help keep track of the FTX C-suite’s off-the-books dealings, making her notes more akin to a secret ledger than a personal diary.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ellison’s personal notes and to-do lists include entries such as a list titled “Things Sam is Freaking Out About,” which delineates Ellison’s understanding, from conversations with the defendant, of what remained the defendant’s top business concerns, such as Alameda’s trading hedges, bad press about the relationship between Alameda and FTX, and fundraising. […]</p>
<p>Keeping track of Alameda’s finances and objectives clearly constitutes a statement “designed to promote or facilitate achievement of the goals of [the] conspiracy.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Breach of Campaign Donation Law</h2>
<p>The 70-page document also outlines the prosecution’s intent to use text messages to and from members of FTX’s C-Suite as evidence of a breach of political campaign donation law.</p>
<p>This accusation primarily centers on using Nishad Singh and Ryan Salame to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/biggest-donors" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">donate</a> funds to both sides of Congress on behalf of SBF.</p>
<p>Among the text messages cited as evidence is one sent by Salame to a relative of his, stating that SBF was donating to “weed out anti-crypto dems for pro-crypto dems and anti-crypto repubs for pro-crypto repubs” and stating that SBF would route money through him to erase that republican side.</p>
<p>However, Ryan Salame – who is facing his own set of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-ftx-exec-under-investigation-for-possible-violations-of-campaign-finance-law-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">accusations</a> regarding violations of campaign finance law – will not be available as a witness in the case against Sam Bankman-Fried, choosing to plead the 5th amendment instead in a bid to not incriminate himself.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">From the US government&#8217;s motion in limine in the Sam Bankman-Fried criminal trial: &#8220;[Ryan] Salame is unavailable as a witness&#8230; Salame’s attorney has represented that if subpoenaed, Salame would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.&#8221; <a href="https://t.co/NrB5d6PJDH" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/NrB5d6PJDH</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Over $24 million were donated by Ryan Salame to representatives of the Republican Party – and the accusations seem to indicate that none of it was out of his own pocket.</p>
