<p>The transaction took place on the bankruptcy claims platform, Found, where the $31,307 claim was tokenized, and its ownership was represented by a non-fungible token (NFT). The NFT was used as collateral for a $7,500 loan that needs to be paid back within five days. If the borrower is not able to repay the loan, the lender will be entitled to the claim.</p>

<p>This transaction is an excellent example of the potential of real-world assets (RWA) tokenization, which allows tokenizing the ownership rights of an asset on a blockchain. The tokenization of assets in DeFi is a hot topic, and it is one of the most prominent areas in the space. Many real-world assets can be tokenized, including stocks, government bonds, real estate, and commodities.</p>

<p>Found, the bankruptcy claims platform, confirmed that the original creditor and lender went through its biometric Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering screenings. The company&#8217;s website states that users can access loans using bankruptcy claims as collateral, with a 10% transaction fee on successful trades.</p>



<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, resulting in billions of dollars being locked in users&#8217; accounts for court proceedings. According to some estimates, FTX claim holders could recover between 35% and 66% of their face value. The surge in bankruptcy filings in the crypto industry is driving on-chain claims solutions. Found, for example, was launched at the beginning of this year, and the co-founders of the collapsed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital launched the claims trading platform Open Exchange in April.</p>

<p>The bankruptcy cases in the crypto industry have flooded the courts in the past year, with many of them stemming from the collapse of FTX. Some notable examples include cases associated with crypto firms Genesis Global Trading and BlockFi.</p>

<p>This development has sparked widespread interest and could potentially unlock a $15 trillion crypto boom. The firm filed for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on the spot bitcoin market, which has already catalyzed a notable rise in bitcoin&#8217;s value, with the flagship cryptocurrency up nearly 20% over the past week. The broader cryptocurrency market has also rallied, now boasting a market capitalization of $1.17 trillion. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum ($ETH), $BNB, $XRP, and even meme-inspired cryptocurrencies have also rallied as a result, with some like $PEPE outperforming the wider market.</p>

<p>In addition to BlackRock&#8217;s recent filing, a survey conducted by the digital assets subsidiary of banking colossus Nomura, Laser Digital, revealed that a staggering 96% of professional investors who collectively manage close to $5 trillion are interested in investing in cryptocurrencies. Laser Digital&#8217;s CEO, Jez Mohideen, conveyed that the study reveals &#8220;that the majority of institutional investors surveyed saw a clear role for digital assets in the investment management landscape, and the benefits they can bring, such as greater diversification of portfolios.&#8221;</p>



<p>The survey encompassed 303 professional investors, and the data painted a clear picture: 82% of the participants expressed a positive outlook on both BTC and ETH, and 88% indicated that either they or their clientele are contemplating investments in cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase serving as its custodial partner for the fund. The move was followed by several large financial institutions filing for their own spot Bitcoin ETFs, including Invesco, WisdomTree, and more. This increased interest in cryptocurrency ETFs has generated excitement about the future of digital assets, and the potential for these funds to unlock enormous amounts of liquidity in the market for bitcoin.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/korbit-exchangee.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="414" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/korbit-exchangee.jpeg" alt="Korbit Exchange Review: A Reliable South Korean Platform for Crypto Trading" class="wp-image-197716" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/korbit-exchangee.jpeg 680w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/korbit-exchangee-300x183.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" title="Korbit Review: A Reliable South Korean Platform for Crypto Trading 10"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pros</h3>



<ul>
<li>Established Reputation: Korbit has built a strong reputation since its launch in 2014. With its years of experience and successful operations, the exchange has gained the trust and confidence of users in the South Korean cryptocurrency market. The platform has demonstrated reliability and security, contributing to its positive reputation.</li>



<li>Fiat-to-Crypto Trading: One significant advantage of Korbit is its support for fiat-to-crypto trading. This means users can easily convert their local currency, the South Korean Won (KRW), into various cryptocurrencies available on the platform. This feature simplifies the onboarding process for newcomers and enables a seamless transition from traditional finance to the world of cryptocurrencies.</li>



<li>Broad Range of Cryptocurrencies: Korbit offers a diverse selection of cryptocurrencies for trading. Users can access popular options such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and more. This wide range of options allows traders to explore different investment opportunities and diversify their portfolios according to their preferences and risk appetite.</li>



<li>User-Friendly Interface: The platform&#8217;s interface is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible to both novice and experienced traders. The intuitive layout and navigation enable easy account setup, depositing funds, executing trades, and monitoring portfolio performance. Korbit strives to create a seamless trading experience for its users.</li>



<li>Strong Security Measures: Korbit prioritizes the security of user funds and personal information. The exchange implements stringent security measures, including two-factor authentication (2FA) for account access, encryption protocols, and cold storage for storing a significant portion of users&#8217; digital assets offline. These measures help protect against unauthorized access and mitigate the risk of hacking incidents.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cons</h3>



<ul>
<li>Limited International Availability: Korbit primarily caters to the South Korean market and has limited availability for international users. This may pose a challenge for traders outside of South Korea who wish to access the platform&#8217;s services. Geographic restrictions may limit the potential user base and limit opportunities for international traders.</li>



<li>Limited Trading Features: While Korbit offers essential trading features, it may lack some advanced tools and functionalities available on other international exchanges. Traders who require advanced charting tools, extensive order types, or specific trading options may find the platform&#8217;s offerings relatively limited.</li>



<li>Customer Support Options: The availability of customer support options is an area where Korbit could improve. Currently, customer support is primarily provided through email and phone, with limited options for real-time assistance. A more comprehensive and responsive customer support system, including live chat or ticket-based support, would enhance the overall user experience.</li>



<li>Regulatory Uncertainty: South Korea&#8217;s cryptocurrency market operates in a regulatory gray area, and there is ongoing discussion and potential future regulation concerning cryptocurrency exchanges. While Korbit has operated successfully within this framework, regulatory changes or uncertainties could impact its operations and user experience in the future.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>In conclusion, Korbit offers a reputable and user-friendly platform for cryptocurrency trading, particularly for the South Korean market. Its support for fiat-to-crypto trading, diverse range of cryptocurrencies, and robust security measures are notable advantages. However, the platform&#8217;s limited international availability, trading features, customer support options, and the regulatory landscape should be considered when evaluating whether Korbit aligns with individual trading needs and preferences.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1857.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1857.png" alt="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols" class="wp-image-197709" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1857.png 720w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1857-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" title="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Introduction</h1>



<p>The Maverick Protocol (MAV) has garnered significant attention from investors since it was selected as the 34th Launchpool project on Binance. Despite being a relatively new project launched in March, Maverick has already achieved impressive results in terms of fee revenue on the protocol.</p>



<p>One of the standout features of Maverick is its Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, which optimizes capital utilization by automatically concentrating liquidity during price volatility conditions. This enhances capital efficiency, increases market liquidity, and benefits traders with better prices, while liquidity providers earn additional fee revenue. Furthermore, Maverick&#8217;s integrated feature eliminates the need for costly gas fees by automatically adjusting trading positions based on the price level.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1856.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="720" height="360" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1856.png" alt="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols" class="wp-image-197708" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1856.png 720w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1856-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1856-360x180.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" title="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Liquidity providers now have the option to track the price of an asset in a single direction and effectively speculate on the price trajectory of a specific token. This approach is similar to one-sided liquidity strategies, where providers focus on a particular asset within a specific group.</p>



<p>These technological innovations are revolutionizing liquidity management models through the use of smart contracts. Maverick stands out as the first Dynamic Distribution AMM protocol capable of automating liquidity strategies that previously required daily maintenance or super complex protocols. The project pioneers a new approach and brings new opportunities to the decentralized finance sector.</p>



<p>Maverick has raised $17,460,000 through three rounds of private token sales to fund its development, selling 360,000,000 out of the total token supply of 2,000,000,000 MAV. In the most recent private token sale round, the MAV price was $0.1. As of June 13th, 2023, the total supply of MAV is 2,000,000,000, and the circulating supply upon listing will be 250,000,000 (~12.5% of the total token supply).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1854.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1854.png" alt="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols" class="wp-image-197706" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1854.png 720w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1854-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" title="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The MAV token serves as a joint utility and governance token, enabling stakeholders to stake, vote, and direct community and ecosystem incentives. These utilities operate on a voting-escrow model, where MAV holders stake their tokens to receive a vote-escrowed MAV (veMAV) balance. </p>



<p>With Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) emerging as the next crucial DeFi primitive, the stage is set for intense competition among liquid staking protocols reminiscent of the Curve Wars. As veCRV played a critical role in the Curve Wars, veMAV is expected to be pivotal in the upcoming <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-shanghai-liquid-staking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LST Wars</a>.</p>



<p>The stakes in the LST Wars resemble those of the Curve Wars: LST protocols require liquidity and trading volume for their tokens to gain traction, and they are already competing by offering various incentives to achieve their objectives.</p>



<p>The Curve Wars were contested by protocols now among the most prominent names in the crypto space, including FRAX, USDC, and USDT. Similarly, in the LST Wars, established players like Lido, Rocketpool, and Frax are already in the arena, alongside smaller LST projects emerging each week. These protocols are vying for a share of the same market and seeking a competitive edge.</p>



<p>Maverick&#8217;s Dynamic Distribution AMM has already proven to be an ideal fit for LST liquidity due to its native automation of liquidity movements that track the natural yield of LSTs over time. Since its launch in March, the Maverick AMM has facilitated over $1 billion in trading volume for wstETH, accounting for 30% of all wstETH trading in DeFi. The list of LSTs available on Maverick continues to grow, including wstETH, swETH, cbETH, and rETH.</p>

<p>Recently, Maverick Protocol has made significant strides in enhancing the utility and governance features of its MAV token through the introduction of the Voting-Escrow Model. This innovative mechanism has garnered attention and is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the protocol&#8217;s future. Let&#8217;s explore what the Voting-Escrow Model is and how it functions.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">What is a voting-escrow model?</h1>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1853.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="720" height="685" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1853.png" alt="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols" class="wp-image-197705" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1853.png 720w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1853-300x285.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" title="Maverick Protocol&#039;s Voting-Escrow Model: A New Dawn For Liquid Staking Protocols 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Curve first introduced the voting-escrow (ve) concept and later adopted by numerous decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It establishes a decentralized governance system that ensures voting power remains in the hands of users who demonstrate commitment to a protocol&#8217;s long-term growth and development.</p>



<p>In the ve model, token holders must deposit the protocol token (e.g., MAV) into a &#8220;ve&#8221; contract in exchange for voting power, represented by a veMAV balance—the voting power increases based on the duration and size of the stake. The tokens staked by users are locked in the ve contract until the staking period expires. This mechanism prevents opportunistic voting power from manipulating the governance process to harm the protocol&#8217;s users and community members.</p>



<p>The advent of Curve&#8217;s vote-escrowed token (veCRV) led to the emergence of the Curve Wars. These wars resulted from two complementary innovations: first, Curve&#8217;s pioneering stableswap automated market maker (AMM) achieved a unique fit with the growing stablecoin sector, and second, the veCRV system offered a means for projects to compete for an advantage in the expanding stablecoin market.</p>



<p>Similarly, with the introduction of veMAV, Maverick now possesses a comparable framework that could become the battleground for the LST Wars. Firstly, Maverick AMM&#8217;s dynamic distribution mechanism provides a native solution for liquidity provisioning of LST pairs, just as stableswap AMM did for stablecoins. Secondly, the veMAV system will offer LST projects a fresh strategic option in their quest for liquidity within the AMM ecosystem.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">What Makes Maverick&#8217;s VE Model Worthy?</h1>



<p>Maverick&#8217;s VE (Voting Escrow) model offers compelling advantages that make it worth your attention, particularly if you are involved in liquid staking protocols or other projects seeking to bootstrap liquidity or incentivize a price peg.</p>



<p>The VE-based governance mechanics implemented by Maverick play a crucial role in attracting liquidity providers (LPs) to Boosted Positions and effectively competing with other projects for liquidity. By utilizing the veMAV (Voting Escrowed MAV) token to direct user incentives within the Automated Market Maker (AMM), Maverick enables projects to align their interests with the accumulation of veMAV voting power.</p>



<p>This alignment of interests leads to projects exploring additional incentives for veMAV holders to utilize their veMAV in ways that benefit their respective projects. Consequently, veMAV holders gain greater value and influence within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>One of the standout features of Maverick&#8217;s VE model, compared to existing VE systems like Curve and Balancer, is its critical improvement in targeting voting power to specific parts of the AMM distribution. Unlike other VE models that act as blunt instruments for incentivizing liquidity, Maverick allows protocols to create Boosted Positions, specific liquidity distributions within a given pool. Through the veMAV model, protocols can precisely drive incentives toward these Boosted Positions.</p>



<p>This precision empowers protocols with what can be described as &#8220;incentive efficiency,&#8221; enabling them to optimize the allocation of incentives to meet their liquidity goals with minimal capital expenditure.</p>



<p>Metaprotocols such as Convex and Aura have evolved to facilitate similar dynamics in other VE-based systems. It is highly likely that comparable metaprotocols will emerge specifically tailored for Maverick. These metaprotocols simplify the voting and direction mechanisms for ve holders while maximizing the utility of ve tokens through aggregated market power.</p>



<p>A common mechanism employed by metaprotocols involves attracting incentives from protocols to direct voting power to a specific position. Ultimately, these incentives flow back to the MAV community members, ensuring the value and engagement of the ecosystem.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Conclusion</h1>



<p>Maverick&#8217;s VE model presents a unique opportunity for projects involved in liquid staking protocols and others seeking to bootstrap liquidity. By utilizing veMAV, protocols can precisely incentivize liquidity, drive engagement, and enhance their overall efficiency in achieving their liquidity objectives. Furthermore, the emergence of metaprotocols tailored for Maverick is likely to amplify the benefits and utility of the veMAV ecosystem.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite encouraging advancements in the Solana network, the native cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL), has performed poorly, with a sustained negative bias.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Solana has seen a sustained negative bias despite encouraging developments in its network.</li>



<li>Recent legal developments and regulatory ambiguity have contributed to the negative trend, including lawsuits brought by the SEC against major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.</li>



<li>The increased popularity of Solana&#8217;s network due to high Ethereum gas fees and the surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price could possibly aid SOL&#8217;s recovery from the current decline.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Despite encouraging advancements in the Solana network, the native cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL), has performed poorly, with a sustained negative bias.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="500" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850.png" alt="Solana Is Rising Weakly, Will It Return To The $20 Price Zone?" class="wp-image-197700" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850-300x167.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850-768x427.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1850-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Solana Is Rising Weakly, Will It Return To The $20 Price Zone? 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>This negative trend may be ascribed to a variety of macroeconomic issues, including concerns about the US debt limit and debates about worldwide cryptocurrency legislation.</p>



<p>Bakkt, a New York-based derivatives exchange, delisted prominent cryptocurrencies, which was a major move altering the altcoin scene. This decision was driven by recent legal developments in the United States, including lawsuits brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<p>The SEC labeled over 20 digital assets, including SOL, as securities in their litigation cases. As a consequence of the accompanying regulatory ambiguity, several trading platforms, such as Robinhood, have discontinued coverage for certain assets.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="980" height="653" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851.png" alt="Solana Is Rising Weakly, Will It Return To The $20 Price Zone?" class="wp-image-197701" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851.png 980w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1851-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" title="Solana Is Rising Weakly, Will It Return To The $20 Price Zone? 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>Nevertheless, Bitcoin has just surpassed $31,000 due to a wave of confidence from institutional investors who began scrutinizing the commodity after a high-profile ETF application and the debut of a new crypto exchange.</p>



<p>The surge comes after BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<p>Moreover, the increased popularity of the meme token Pepecoin (PEPE) has contributed to the Ethereum network&#8217;s skyrocketing transaction costs. Because of the increase in Ethereum gas fees, consumers are looking for alternatives, such as the Solana network, for quicker and more cost-effective transactions.</p>



<p>The increased usage of Solana&#8217;s network might possibly sustain SOL&#8217;s stock and help it recover from the current decline. Investors are currently debating whether it is a good time to buy SOL since its price forecast indicates an upward trend.</p>



<p>Solana&#8217;s price has just begun a new upward trend from the $13.5 support zone. Bitcoin and Ethereum have recently seen sustained gains, generating good movements in Solana and Cardano.</p>



<p>The bulls are actively pushing the price up from the old support area that SOL broke earlier, $17. Besides, SOL price is currently trading above the 26.6% Fib level, creating the premise for a correction around the $16.2 price zone before it bounces up further.</p>

<p>SOL is now trading above $17, but traders should note that the $20 price level is extremely important as it is the confluence of the 50% Fib and the bearish trend line created from the April top. At this price, SOL will bounce up very strongly.</p>

<p>Prior to the mint, it is critical to be attentive during a time when phishing links and scams disguised as Azuki will be on the rise, therefore the project warns users to be cautious of the late increasing frauds.</p>



<p>Azuki is a metaverse-specific brand. The NFT collection includes 10,000 anime avatars that provide community members with access to &#8220;The Garden,&#8221; an exclusive virtual environment or metaverse where Web3 fans, artists, and builders come together to form a decentralized future.</p>



<p>The project&#8217;s version of the metaverse is The Garden, a virtual realm where community, art, and culture collide to create enchantment or described as &#8220;the lines between the physical and digital worlds are blurring, and the rules are being rewritten,&#8221; according to their website.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this is just a misunderstanding, and no damage has been reported. However, cryptocurrency scams are now widespread and sophisticated. The attackers aim to steal sensitive information, such as the private key for your wallet. They do this by posing as a trusted company or individual and requesting your personal information. The information you provide is then used to steal your digital assets.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Three Arrows Capital and OPNX founder Su Zhu, said on Twitter that the oUSD credit stablecoin launched by OPNX was inspired by UST and FTT.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OPNX founder Su Zhu said that the oUSD credit stablecoin launched by OPNX was inspired by UST and FTT.</em></li>



<li><em>According to Su Zhu, UST, and FTT, many techniques exist to avoid bank runaways. This creates a critical structural vulnerability and personal risk.</em></li>



<li><em>oUSD inherits properties of provable solvency and provable liquidation.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Three Arrows Capital and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191524-3ac-founders-opnx-announces-celsius-claims-trading-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OPNX</a> founder Su Zhu, said on Twitter that the oUSD credit stablecoin launched by OPNX was inspired by UST and FTT (negative case).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1841.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="506" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1841.png" alt="Su Zhu: oUSD Credit stablecoin Inspired By 2 Failed Stablecoins UST And FTT" class="wp-image-197666" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1841.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1841-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1841-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1841-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Su Zhu: oUSD Credit stablecoin Inspired By 2 Failed Stablecoins UST And FTT 24"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to the OPNX founder, UST is a passive sink for investors, but the capital utilization rate is shallow, while FTT has a great borrowing demand. Still, Genesis and FTX users are lenders only naturally. The UST failed to issue enough active bonds, leading to a death spiral without a natural buyer. There were many techniques to avoid bank runaways in the UST and FTT cases. This creates a critical structural vulnerability and personal risk.</p>



<p>The margin currency should be the account&#8217;s unit, replicating the extremely stable derivative structure that OKX has had for many years, i.e., continuously socializing risk into a profit pool. As a result, OPNX uses oUSD to inherit the properties of provable solvency instantly, and provable liquidity (especially proof of non-liquidity that cannot be liquidity), and all client assets are on-chain, allowing it to avoid the risk of force majeure events calmly.</p>



<p>Earlier, the OPNX exchange announced that they would launch the first Launchpad project, and oUSD will be available soon. Users can use USDT 1:1 from an unlimited oUSD purchase agreement. Its function acts as margin and PNL for all OPNX currency futures contracts (profit and loss).</p>



<p>After hiding for a while after the investment fund Three Arrows Capital collapsed, two infamous founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davis shook hands with the two founders of CoinFLEX, raising $25 million to start building an exchange called the exchange OPNX.</p>

<p>According to the introduction from the project, OPNX carries a &#8220;beautiful ideal&#8221;, born to fill the wounds of creditors who were victims of the crashes of FTX, Celsius, BlockFi, and Mt.Gox…</p>



<p>Specifically, the victims (and current creditors) of FTX, Celsisus… instead of just keeping the debt until the date of compensation (unknown when), the GTX floor offers creditors two other options. : resell debt in exchange for USDG cryptocurrency &#8211; a form of credit asset or used for leveraged trading.</p>



<p>Not only was the founder of Three Arrows Capital scandalous, but CoinFLEX, the unit that cooperated to build OPNX, also had financial problems and filed for restructuring in August 2022 after the crypto crisis, making the company The company was forced to delay the withdrawal.</p>



<p>Since the GTX floor information appeared, Su Zhu has continuously received satire from the public opinion of investors, project leaders in the industry, and the media.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>4 major newspapers protested that the bankruptcy judge of FTX allowed to keep customer information confidential.</em></li>



<li><em>Legal representatives of the media have argued that FTX is not entitled to an exception for using cryptocurrency.</em></li>



<li><em>The judge found this consistent with an exception in U.S. bankruptcy law that addresses potential harm from disclosure.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bloomberg, Dow Jones, New York Times, and Financial Times have appealed Judge John Dorsey&#8217;s ruling on June 9, allowing<a href="https://news.coincu.com/197547-bankman-fried-desperate-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> FTX </a>to &#8220;permanently remove&#8221; individual customers from all records of the confidential name and to protect the legal rights of FTX.</strong></h5>

<p>A legal representative for the media organization argued that FTX is not entitled to a &#8220;new and broad exception&#8221; to bankruptcy disclosure requirements simply because its clients used cryptocurrencies. The media has stood by the fact that bankrupt companies are often obliged to disclose the names and amounts owed to their creditors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Media group appeals decision to permanently redact the names of a million FTX customers.<br><br>We believe keeping the customer list a trade secret is vital to improve recovery for all in bankruptcy reorganisation.<br><br>Seeking to further harm people who are already down is unfortunate. <a href="https://t.co/0fbpvIE9We" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/0fbpvIE9We</a></p>&mdash; FTX 2.0 Coalition (@AFTXcreditor) <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1672142097330184192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 23, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Judge Dorsey previously ruled that he wanted to ensure customers&#8221; are protected from becoming a victim of any fraud,&#8221; which is consistent with the exception of U.S. bankruptcy law to address the potential risk of identity theft or other harm.</p>



<p>Reportedly, bankrupt companies are generally required to disclose the names of their creditors and the amount of their debts, including those owed to individual customers. Still, there are exceptions in U.S. bankruptcy law. Disclosure of information may create the risk of identity theft or other damages.</p>



<p>This is not the first time the media has protested the sealing of the names of FTX customers, having previously filed an objection on May 3.</p>

<p>Bloomberg, Dow Jones, The New York Times, and Financial Times first filed petitions against FTX and the Official Committee on Unsecured Creditors to redact and withhold customer information for the first time on January 11h.</p>



<p>In the previous filing, it was argued that the name disclosure would not expose creditors to &#8220;undue risk&#8221; nor that the listing did not qualify as &#8220;confidential commercial information&#8221;.</p>
