					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum's price has encountered a downside correction, failing to clear the $1,975 resistance level. <p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com"><strong>Coincu News</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum&#8217;s price fails to clear the $1,975 resistance and starts a downside correction, trading below $1,950 level.</em></li>



<li><em>Immediate resistance is near the $1,925 level and the next major resistance is near the $1,945 level.</em></li>



<li><em>Clear move above $1,945 resistance could push the price towards $1,975 and the next major resistance is near the $2,120 level.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>&#8216;s price has encountered a downside correction, failing to clear the $1,975 resistance level. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethereum--1024x539.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="539" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethereum--1024x539.jpeg" alt="Ethereum" class="wp-image-200542" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethereum--1024x539.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethereum--300x158.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethereum--768x404.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethereum--750x395.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethereum-.jpeg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ethereum Price Retests Uptrend Support Amidst Market Turmoil 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As a result, there has been a decline below $1,950, similar to Bitcoin, and even below the $1,920 support level. The price eventually spiked below $1,900, reaching a low of $1,894, and is now consolidating losses. Currently, the price is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,974 swing high to the $1,894 low.</p>



<p>Ether is now trading below $1,940 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend. On the hourly chart of ETH/USD, there is a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,925. The immediate resistance level stands near the $1,925 level, which is the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major resistance level is at $1,945, which is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,974 swing high to the $1,894 low.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-373.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="472" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-373-1024x472.png" alt="image 373" class="wp-image-200541" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-373-1024x472.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-373-300x138.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-373-768x354.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-373-1536x707.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-373-750x345.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-373-1140x525.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-373.png 1835w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ethereum Price Retests Uptrend Support Amidst Market Turmoil 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, if there&#8217;s a clear move above the $1,945 resistance level, the price could be pushed toward $1,975. This could be a significant milestone for Ether as the main resistance level still remains near the $2,000 level. A successful push above this level could initiate a decent increase in the value of Ether. The next major resistance level is near $2,120, and any further gains could propel Ethereum toward the $2,200 resistance level.</p>



<p>Ethereum&#8217;s recent price decline and consolidation could be attributed to its inability to clear the $1,975 resistance level. However, the presence of key bearish trend lines and resistance levels should not be ignored. Traders and investors should keep a close eye on the $1,945 and $2,000 resistance levels, as these will be crucial in determining the future price action of Ether.</p>

<p>It has been revealed that the attackers have distributed 1 million DOWS (Digital Options Worth Securities) to four different addresses. Additionally, they have transferred 7.3 million FLUX tokens to a new address, which interestingly starts with 0x6c21, the same address that was initially targeted in the attack.</p>

<p>Poly Network community has taken action to counteract the attackers&#8217; actions. They have successfully moved approximately 0.3 ETH (Ethereum) from the compromised addresses to a more secure location. This proactive response by the Poly Network team demonstrates their commitment to protecting the interests of their users and mitigating the impact of the attack.</p>



<p>While the attack on Poly was undoubtedly a setback, the ongoing efforts by Paidun&#8217;s early warning and monitoring system, coupled with the swift response from the Poly Network community, showcase the resilience and determination of the crypto community to tackle such challenges.</p>



<p>As investigations into the attack continue, Poly Network is collaborating with law enforcement agencies and blockchain security experts to identify the culprits behind the breach. Their primary objective is to recover the stolen assets and ensure the security and integrity of their platform moving forward.</p>

<p>Poly Network has assured its users that they are working tirelessly to rectify the situation and enhance their security protocols. In the meantime, they urge their community to remain cautious and report any suspicious activities.</p>

<p>The annual net issuance rate for Ether yesterday was -3,352.67 ETH. The Ethereum network set a new milestone with 3.4 million ETH worth about $6.5 billion burned after nearly two years of implementing the <a href="https://coincu.com/68412-almost-2-million-eth-burned-since-ethereum-network-upgrade-eip-1559/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EIP-1559</a> coin-burning mechanism.</p>

<p>Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. On August 5, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented a significant upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal has dramatically changed the fee model. Each transaction now includes a variable base fee adjusted to the current demand for block space. This base fee is either burned or permanently removed from circulation, reducing the Ether supply forever. Thereby increasing the token price.</p>



<p>Ethereum is issuing new Ether at a rate of 4% per year, although the rate is expected to drop to around 0.5 -1% as part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. When this happens, many speculate that the burning rate of Ether will be greater than the rate of token issuance, making ETH a deflationary currency.</p>



<p>In May 2023, Ethereum saw a spike in burn rates due to the memecoin craze triggered by the introduction of <a href="https://coincu.com/187106-pepe-crypto-market-cap-plummets-below-500m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PEPE</a>. At its peak, about 14,600 ETH was burned on May 5, destroying millions of dollars worth of coins. But since then, the burn rate has dropped dramatically.</p>



<p>However, from May 5 to July 4, the amount of ETH burned daily decreased by more than 64%, from 14,967 to 5336.77. This could be a reason why ETH&#8217;s plan to tighten the supply has not been effective. ETH price has fluctuated between $1,930 and $1,960 after another unsuccessful attempt to break out of the $2,000 range this week.</p>

<p>ETH is the dominant bridged asset, accounting for nearly 75% of all assets bridged, largely due to it having by far the highest maximum cap imposed by StarkWare. JediSwap is the top protocol by total value locked, with more than 2x the TVL of second place, and the only non-AMM is the lending protocol zkLend &#8211; the native L2 money-market protocol built on Starknet. The relatively low TVL can be largely attributed to the restrictions imposed on the network.</p>

<p>The platform has recently announced the release of Alpha V0.12.0, which aims to enhance performance and scalability. The update targets Starknet&#8217;s Sequencer to address throughput and latency challenges. This is a significant milestone in Starknet&#8217;s journey to scale Ethereum.</p>

<p>While it is still in its infancy with limited performance, there is relatively significant activity, and updates like Starknet 0.12 are expected to improve TPS in Q3. Deposits on Starknet greatly accelerated from mid-March when the deposit caps were raised again.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>NFT market is struggling, and fingers are pointed at Blur, a rival to OpenSea targeting savvy traders.</em></li>



<li><em>Pacman, founder of Blur, defended the marketplace, saying that the market moves based on liquidity more than anything else.</em></li>



<li><em>The floor price of popular NFT collections like Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club and Azuki has decreased significantly, causing concern among NFT whales and investors.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Tieshun Roquerre, known as Pacman, responded to Twitter chatter about whether Blur is responsible for the decline of the market.</p>



<p>Pacman clarified that since its launch in October 22, the floor prices of some NFT collections have gone up, while others have gone down. He also pointed out that Blur injected liquidity into NFTs through their airdrop, which led to an increase in floor prices. On the other hand, $40 million of liquidity was removed via the Azuki mint, which caused a decrease in floor prices. Pacman also acknowledged that liquidity is the main factor that affects the market&#8217;s movement.</p>

Even the premier collections have been affected by the decline. For instance, the floor price of Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club has decreased to 28 ETH (approximately $53,000), the lowest it has been in over 18 months, and less than half its value at the beginning of the year, according to NFT Price Floor data. Additionally, the floor price of Azuki, another popular collection, has plummeted after the mishap in the launch of a new set of NFTs by its creator, Chiru Labs.</p>

<p>Blur, the Paradigm-backed marketplace for pro traders, was blamed for the decline. Lior Messika, whose venture firm Eden Block is an investor in Yuga Labs, pointed out that NFT whales who had previously identified as “collectors” are now branding themselves as traders or even “Blur farmers,” which has distorted the space. Brad Kay also attributed a large part of the Azuki sell-off to <a href="https://coincu.com/194832-blur-token-will-be-unlocked-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blur</a>&#8216;s lending platform.</p>

<p>According to the ASXN <a href="https://twitter.com/asxn_r/status/1676670721655984128?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/asxn_r/status/1676670721655984128?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, MakerDAO&#8217;s MKR token has seen impressive growth over the past few weeks, with a 40% increase in the past seven days alone. This growth is attributed to several factors, including the Smart Burn Engine proposal, the expansion of the Spark protocol, and the deployment of the MKR repurchase contract. MakerDAO&#8217;s earned fees have also been rapidly growing, currently earning $315,000 in fees daily. </p>

<p>The Smart Burn Engine launch governance proposal is transitioning MakerDAO from a buy and burn model to a new approach called the POL model. Additionally, the rapid growth of Spark, a lending platform that uses a credit line from Maker called a Dai Direct Deposit Module (D3M), is contributing to the growth of MKR.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/197005-makerdao-purchasing-700m-bonds/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/197005-makerdao-purchasing-700m-bonds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>that the issuer of stablecoins and decentralized finance protocol MakerDAO purchased another $700 million in US Treasury bonds, bringing the platform&#8217;s DAI stablecoin reserve to $1.2 billion.</p>



<p>MakerDAO is an open-source project on the Ethereum blockchain and a Decentralized Autonomous Organization created in 2014. The project is managed by people around the world who hold its governance token, MKR. Through a system of scientific governance involving Executive Voting and Governance Polling, MKR holders manage the Maker Protocol and the financial risks of Dai to ensure its stability, transparency, and efficiency. MKR voting weight is proportional to the amount of MKR a voter stakes in the voting contract, DSChief. In other words, the more MKR tokens locked in the contract, the greater the voter&#8217;s decision-making power.</p>

<p>Hotbit, a crypto trading platform, is <a href="https://twitter.com/Mahidhar_Crypto/status/1676677717671149568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspected</a> of attempting a rugpull on its users. RichQuack, a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) initiative, stated on Twitter that it had been the victim of a rugpull engineered by Hotbit. To the tweet, the crypto trading site purportedly sold 256 Trillion QUEK coins belonging to According to PancakeSwap QUAACK holders.</p>



<p>The DeFi project&#8217;s efforts to withdraw have not been authorized, and RichQuack claims that no response has been provided as of yet. According to several on-chain data insights, the exchange is now engaged in dumping actions across many projects.

<p>The exchange said that among its holdings are locked assets that will be opened in 2-3 year periods. It was proposed that these assets be transformed into more liquid form at the same intervals and given to HTB token holders.</p>

<li><em>Japan was one of the first countries to have a law governing stablecoins, and it went into effect on June 1.</em></li>

<p>According to CoinDesk, Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said that in light of the fact that the stable money management law took effect on June 1, Circle is considering issuing a stablecoin in Japan.</p>



<p>If the plan is successful, Japan could become an extremely large market if it is applied to cross-border trade, foreign currency trading and global trade.</p>



<p>Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed interest in the Japan partnership he visited last month.</p>



<p>In a historic move, Japan&#8217;s parliament passed the regulatory framework around stablecoins in early June, providing a safety net for investors. This makes Japan one of the first major economies to pass legislation specifically for stablecoins.</p>



<p>Reportedly, Japan&#8217;s revised &#8220;Payment Services Law&#8221; will certify fiat currency-backed stablecoins as &#8220;electronic payment methods&#8221; and authorize their issuance.</p>

<p>The bill provides clarity around the definition of stablecoins, which will now be considered digital currencies and must be linked to a yen or other legal tender, ensuring holders have the right to redeem them at face value.</p>



<p>Stablecoins can currently only be issued by licensed banks, registered remittance agents, and trust companies. The bill does not address existing asset- or algorithm-backed stablecoins. However, exchanges in Japan do not list stablecoins.</p>



<p>Japan has moved to relax some of its crypto rules, such as token listing and taxation, but overall the country is considered to have strict regulations.</p>
