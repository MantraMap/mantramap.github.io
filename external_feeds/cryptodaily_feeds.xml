			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Eden Island, Republic of Seychelles, June 27th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>A new PEPE memecoin is launching, following hot on the heels of its Ethereum namesake. Issued as a BEP20 on BNB Chain, PEPE is a novel memecoin with a number of unique mechanisms programmed into its tokenomics.</p><p>Like the original PEPE token, which has proven a runaway success in 2023, the BEP20 PEPE draws its cues from the mischievous frog of the same name, whose design was derived from the webcomic "Boy's Club."</p><p>The market capitalization of the original PEPE token, which debuted on Ethereum in April, exceeded $1 billion on May 5th, prompting a new wave of memecoins, including a number of frog-themed efforts. Unlike subsequent memecoins, the PEPE (BEP20) has several unusual features programmed in including a syndication system designed to support price stabilization.</p><p>The team behind the BNB Chain PEPE aren&rsquo;t settling for just one memecoin either: they plan to launch multiple PEPE projects, all based on the loveable frog. 13 such launches have been cued up for 2023 alone.</p><p>Although each PEPE project will operate independently, the introduction of a "Burn &amp; Drop" system will govern the consortium. Burn &amp; Drop is a first-of-its-kind system in which burning one token leads to the airdrop of another.</p><p>To initiate a Burn &amp; Drop, two types of tokens are required. For example, this could involve a scenario in which Token A is priced at $1 and PEPE (BEP20) is also priced at $1. However, if the price of Token A were to drop to $0.8, Token A holders would have the option to burn their tokens on the Burn &amp; Drop platform, automatically receiving PEPE (BEP20) through an airdrop, and with Token A having been burned, its total supply would decrease.</p><p></p><p>By initiating the Burn &amp; Drop process between tokens, excess volatility can be reduced while possibly providing trading opportunities for arbitrage and intra-token trading. This logic is a fundamental component of PEPE (BEP20), and one which users can engage with directly within the platform.</p><p>In addition, PEPE (BEP20) has plans to introduce numerous services that will further extend the token&rsquo;s utility. To further increase interest in the project, PEPE (BEP20) is currently running an airdrop campaign on Twitter that&rsquo;s open to everyone.</p><p>About PEPEBEP20</p><p>PEPE is a project launched on the Binance Smart Chain, taking the form of a BEP20 token. The Pepe Syndicate and the unique "Burn&amp;Drop" mechanism of Pepe are designed to manage the token's price volatility. This is not a guarantee of price stability, but a mechanism to potentially mitigate price fluctuations.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Road Town, BVI, June 27th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, listed Disney (DIS) on June 27, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the DIS/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading.</p><p>Disney (DIS) is a meme token issued by the relevant communities of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and mining.</p><p>Introducing Disney</p><p>LBank Exchange is thrilled to announce the upcoming listing of Disney (DIS), a meme token that was initiated by Miningtw Technology Co., Ltd., a collaborative team based in Hong Kong and Taiwan. This token was issued by various communities involved in blockchain, cryptocurrency, and mining. The token is intended for use in various capacities such as interactive activities, event rewards, gifts, charitable endeavors, and aspirational purposes. With an economic model in which 50% of its circulating supply is committed to pledge mining for a period exceeding 5 years, users are rewarded proportionately per second based on the total amount of their pledges. The goal is to create a value that is worth holding and collecting over the long term. However, it's worth noting that DIS has no association with Walt Disney and their similar names are purely coincidental. Despite sharing a similar name, they operate in distinct domains and scopes, with the meme tokens existing purely for the sake of amusement and enjoyment.</p><p>DIS token is a meme cryptocurrency, created with the intention of fostering fun and innovation. It is committed to building a democratic, transparent, and equitable community grounded on blockchain technology. The token was conceived by DaddyPig, a Hong Kong native who immigrated to Taiwan in search of democratic freedoms. In collaboration with Taiwan, DaddyPig established Miningtw Technology Co., Ltd. Starting off as a cryptocurrency miner, the company branched out to construct large mining facilities, dedicating itself to the development of several blockchain projects. These projects include the creation of a decentralized exchange (DEX) and several other blockchain ecosystem initiatives. DaddyPig has actively participated in blockchain development endeavors, such as Ethereum's PoS fork, the maintenance of EthereumFair (ETHF) under a PoW consensus mechanism, and the fork of DogeCoin from the Scrypt algorithm to the ETHASH algorithm, resulting in DogeW. Upholding the principle of decentralization, DaddyPig has invested significant resources in anticipation of the potential and future prospects of Web3.</p><p>About DIS Token</p><p>Based on BEP-20, DIS has a total supply of 100 million (i.e. 100,000,000). In a move to incentivize DIS token holders, a five-year liquidity mining program has been launched, dedicating 50 million tokens, or half of the total issuance, to the staking mining reward pool. Approximately 27,397 DIS tokens will be distributed daily, or around 0.317 DIS per second, based on the total number of staked tokens. Additionally, 10% of the total DIS issuance, which equates to 10 million DIS tokens, will be locked for staking over a five-year span, with economic model and deflation mechanism, please refer to the white paper for details. It was listed on LBank Exchange at 9:00 UTC on June 27, 2023, investors who are interested in DIS can easily buy and sell it on LBank Exchange now. The listing of DIS token on LBank Exchange will undoubtedly help it further expand its business and draw more attention in the market.</p><p>Learn More about DIS Token:</p><p>Official Website: https://distoken.xyz/</p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/distoken_xyz</p><p>Telegram: https://t.me/miningtwxyz</p><p>Contract: https://bscscan.com/token/0xe2ecc66e14efa96e9c55945f79564f468882d24c</p><p>About LBank</p><p>LBank is one of the top crypto exchanges, established in 2015.

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/plynk-kucoin-offer-warm-welcome-as-caged-beasts-coin-joins-top-passive-income-cryptos</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency is not merely about acquiring and holding altcoins; its potential for passive income cannot be overlooked. Picture yourself earning revenue effortlessly, without having to lift a finger. Moreover, crypto exchange platforms are upping the ante with their enticing welcome rewards. Among these are KuCoin and Plynk, but a newcomer is making waves: Caged Beasts Coin has joined the rank of Top passive income cryptos. Unlock the secrets of these offerings and maximise your profits.</p>
Plynk Has &ldquo;$50 For You&rdquo;
<p>Plynk is an SEC-regulated trading app designed for US investors. It provides a user-friendly platform where beginners can trade various instruments like stocks, fractional shares, mutual funds, and ETFs. In collaboration with Paxos Trust Co., Plynk introduced crypto trading in 2022. Users can trade and hold popular coins such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) through Paxos. Existing Plynk app users can apply for a crypto account offered by Paxos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, Plynk is offering a $50 promotion. To qualify, open a new account on the app and link a bank account. You receive a $10 bonus just for signing up. When you&nbsp; deposit at least $25 within 15 calendar days of linking their eligible bank account,&nbsp; $50 will be credited to your account within 30 days of the Qualification Period, which starts when the bank account is linked.</p>
Avail KuCoin&rsquo;s New User Rewards
<p>The crypto exchange Kucoin offers great advantages such as high liquidity, low fees, and fast withdrawals. It was established in 2017 by Leon Kuensingh, who observed a shift of traders from Binance to Coinbase due to the recent ban on crypto trading on US exchanges.</p>
<p>New users who register on KuCoin can enjoy rewards of up to $100 USDT. These rewards are earned when users complete their first deposit or crypto purchase, make their first trade, and engage in pro trading. The rewards include USDT and valuable coupons, which can add up to a total worth of 3200 USDT. To receive these rewards, users need to fulfil the designated tasks within 60 days of signing up for their KuCoin account. It's important to note that each user can only receive each reward once.</p>
Caged Beasts&rsquo;s 20% USDT Commission
<p></p>
<p>Caged Beasts Coin (BEASTS) is no ordinary cryptocurrency. Aiming to overthrow the dominance of a privileged few and redistribute financial power to the masses, the BEASTS are out to start the DeFi Revolution and here&rsquo;s why they might just do it.</p>
<p>Community is at the heart of the BEASTS ecosystem. The referral scheme, for example, allows holders to bag a 20% USDT commission instantly. All you have to do is visit the website, select the 'Earn USDT' option, connect your wallet and generate a referral code to share. Each user can earn a generous 20% of any deposits made by their referrals, which is automatically added to their wallet. That&rsquo;s not all: the user who uses the referral code also receives a 20% share.</p>
<p>The token tells the tale of Rabbit 4001, who embarks on a quest to gather a group of rebels. During the token's presale journey, Rabbit 4001 bestows young animals with mutagens and cybernetic enhancements, symbolising the growth and accumulation of locked funds over time. The name itself, Caged Beasts, is a clever take on the concept of Caged Liquidity. The referral system aims to cultivate a united and expanding community that rewards its members, while the project as a whole thrives through active involvement and contributions from individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
The Takeaway
<p>With their respective welcome bonuses, KuCoin &amp; Plynk are top-notch platforms to consider for trading crypto. However, in the quest for the top passive income cryptos, Caged Beasts Coin emerges as a contender. Brace yourself for the imminent DeFi Revolution, spearheaded by none other than the mighty BEASTS.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Circle, the issuer of the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin, has announced the operationalization of its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) on Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This integration enables faster and more secure transfers of USDC across several blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Avalanche, and now Arbitrum.</p>
Enhanced Functionality with CCTP
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">CCTP facilitates the movement of USDC across different blockchain networks by employing a burn-and-mint mechanism. Native USDC tokens on the original chain are burnt, and an equivalent amount is minted on the receiving chain. This mechanism enhances the efficiency and security of USDC transfers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Arbitrum is the third chain to support CCTP, and the protocol is live on the official Arbitrum Bridge. The addition of CCTP to Arbitrum follows Circle's recent announcement of a native version of its stablecoin on the Arbitrum network.</p>
Integration with Other Protocols
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Several other bridge projects and interoperability-centric protocols, such as Celer Network, Li.Fi, Wormhole, O3 Labs, Wanchain, and Router Protocol, have incorporated CCTP into their systems. These integrations enable USDC transfers via their respective platforms.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, the integration of CCTP with Arbitrum is expected to replace the traditional "lock-and-mint" bridging process typically used for transferring tokens between chains. This conventional mechanism has been associated with security issues in the past. Using CCTP instead can expedite bridge transfers, improving efficiency and security.</p>
The Growth of USDC
<p class="md-end-block md-p">USDC is currently the second-largest centralized stablecoin in the market after USD Tether, boasting a supply close to $28 billion. Its increasing adoption and the integration with Arbitrum underline the significant role it plays in the crypto landscape.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Circle expressed its enthusiasm for the CCTP integration with Arbitrum in a series of tweets. The company highlighted that the integration simplified the process of moving USDC natively to Arbitrum, enabling direct transfers to and from Ethereum and Avalanche.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As a many-to-many messaging protocol, CCTP can now burn and mint USDC through six unique routes between its three supported chains. Each new chain added automatically connects to all existing CCTP chains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Users receive native USDC with CCTP, eliminating the need for lock-and-mint bridging. This development brings added security and capital efficiency to the process of sending USDC across supported chains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The protocol also allows for a swift return of USDC to Ethereum, bypassing withdrawal delays when moving liquidity from Layer 2 solutions to Layer 1.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Circle's CCTP offers developers the opportunity to build applications offering native cross-chain deposits, swaps, purchases, and more. As such, the integration promises significant improvements to the cross-chain capabilities of the ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Advances from 30342 Technicals:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 28 June 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought to add to recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair reached the 30782.06 area before consolidating some advances, the latest renewal of upside pressure that strengthened around the 29900 area.&nbsp; Bulls continue to eye the 30994.30 area as an upside hurdle that represents the 23.6% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 29539.57 to 31443.67.&nbsp; Buying pressure also recently intensified just above the 30198.14 area and 29863.96 area, retracement levels associated with buying pressure that rallied around the 26165.98 and 24750 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently elected above the 30127.80 area during the ongoing appreciation, an upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.</p>
<p>Stops were also triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.&nbsp; Following recent upside price activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 30192, 29863, 29423, 28886, 28179, 28096, and 27293 areas.&nbsp; Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29365.77 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30400.23.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Despite the recent price recovery in the crypto market, Polygon is still struggling with bearish pressure as the bulls try to surpass the $0.60 mark, leaving investors and supporters eagerly awaiting a potential breakthrough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tradecurve (TCRV) has emerged as a promising player in the crypto market, fueled by its unique approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). Tradecurve's native token is aiming for a more bullish price movement after crossing the $0.018 mark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Polygon (MATIC) Struggling To Break Past $0.60
<p>In recent days, Polygon has experienced a significant price decline, dropping below the crucial $0.750 support level and entering a bearish zone. However, the cryptocurrency has found some stability as a low point formed near $0.5432. Currently, it is attempting to regain its value and follow the upward trend observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notably, there has been a positive development in Polygon's price movement. At first, bulls struggled to cross the resistance around $0.605 before finally soaring above&nbsp; $0.64 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours), signaling a potential recovery. However, it faced resistance around the $0.725 level. To continue its upward momentum, MATIC would need to break above this resistance level with the next significant resistance awaiting near $0.78.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, failure to surpass the $0.725 resistance level could lead to a fresh decline in MATIC's price. In such a scenario, immediate support can be expected around the $0.65 level. At present, Polygon is trading at $0.666567, a decline of 4.40% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve Aiming For A Further Increase
<p>While Polygon is aiming to surpass the $0.725 resistance, Tradecurve's utility token, TCRV, is aiming for a further increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last week, the TCRV token experienced a 20% price surge to set a new trading high of $0.018. Based on its current trajectory, market analysts have predicted that the token has gathered enough momentum to potentially reach $0.025 in the coming week.</p>
<p>The strong bullish performance of TCRV can be linked to the growing attention its parent Tradecurve exchange is enjoying. Unlike other exchanges such as OKX and Kraken, Tradecurve offers more tradable assets apart from cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>These tradable assets include forex, commodities, stocks, indices, and CFDs. Additionally, Tradecurve offers several advantageous features, including low trading fees and access to a diverse range of tradable assets and derivatives. As a hybrid trading platform, Tradecurve will also allow users from around the world to trade anonymously.</p>
<p>TCRV token holders enjoy various benefits, such as staking rewards, voting rights, and discounts. Now in the fourth stage of its presale, crypto market experts predict that the price of the token price could increase by a further 40% in the fifth stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As demand for Tradecurve and its TCRV token increases, leading industry experts predict a potential 50x increase in value before the end of its presale. Furthermore, market analysts anticipate a remarkable surge of 100x by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>

Currently, it is attempting to regain its value and follow the upward trend observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As bitcoin makes its break higher the spark this has given to the whole crypto sector has set the altcoins alight.</p>
Altcoins demonstrate persistence
<p>Just when everyone thought that the crypto space was dead it has just got up and started walking around again. Like Lazarus from the dead, the altcoins have started to come back to life.</p>
<p>The SEC seeking to destroy the fiat on/off ramps, its targeting of the two biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in Binance and Coinbase, the pulling down of the three main banks associated with the crypto sector - all designed to bring the entire crypto industry crashing to its knees.</p>
<p>Obviously these actions, as well as many others, have affected the crypto sector. However, who would have thought that after such anti-crypto news had dropped, that within just a couple of weeks or so crypto would have made back all the losses and more.</p>
<p>Gary Gensler of the SEC might want to look into how new technology will always rise, no matter what any heavy handed regulator might think about it. Even the banks are now finally starting to recognise the potential for such crypto innovations as tokenisation and alternative payments systems.</p>
USDT Dominance struggling at support
<p>Back to the altcoins, and USDT Dominance is fighting for survival at the 7.25% level. It has lost 7% over the last couple of weeks, and granted, much of that will have been lost to bitcoin, but even so, a rising bitcoin floats all altcoins.</p>
<p>Having said that, &ldquo;all altcoins&rdquo; most certainly will not be the case. The vast majority of altcoins are arguably going to zero, and it might be said, the sooner the better. "The vast majority" will definitely leave a handful of incredibly disruptive altcoins that will be able to flourish and fulfil their incredible potential.</p>
<p>Total 3, which charts all altcoins without bitcoin or ethereum, tells this story. The chart is still in a downtrend but there are signs that it is picking up, having been down to the 0.786 Fibonacci level, and having followed a downward channel since mid-2022.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, altcoins will still for now have to rely on the ascension of bitcoin. The pattern would appear to be a strong upwards move from BTC and then accumulation. It is at this point that value will be diverted out of bitcoin and into altcoins, with the best of these making the running.</p>
Can there still be an altcoin season?
<p>The altcoin seasons of before have been epic in their proportions. If enough liquidity comes into bitcoin and the crypto space in general, then why not? However, with far more regulation coming to crypto there are more uncertainties as to how altcoins will behave.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Chibi Finance, an Arbitrum-based yield farming optimizer, reportedly conducted a major exit scam earlier today.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">CertiK, a blockchain security firm, confirmed that the developers behind Chibi Finance had stolen approximately $1 million worth of various tokens, according to their analysis of blockchain data shared to the CryptoDaily Editorial team. This factor led to the price of the CHIBI token to plummet by 98%.</p>
The Scam and its Execution
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Chibi Finance's exit scam unfolded as the developers, having gained control of the platform's smart contracts, proceeded to steal a significant amount of users' funds. The scam was orchestrated using a malicious contract set up by the deployer of Chibi Finance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">By establishing this malicious contract as the _gov address, the developers gained the ability to invoke the panic function. This function enabled them to trigger an emergencyWithdraw of funds to the exit scammer's address.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Approximately 256,012.95 USDC, 94.67 WETH, 4.25520843 WBTC, 115,049 USDT, and 89,563.95 ARB were siphoned off from the project's contracts. The stolen assets were subsequently swapped for 555 ETH, which were then bridged from the Arbitrum network to the Ethereum network. These funds were ultimately laundered through Tornado Cash, a privacy-focused Ethereum mixing service frequently used to obscure transactional activity.</p>
Aftermath and Indications of Fraud
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the immediate aftermath of the scam, the price of the CHIBI token plummeted, registering a staggering 98% drop. Adding to the distressing developments, Chibi Finance also deactivated its Twitter account and took down its official website, thereby leaving no room for doubt about the fraudulent nature of the operation.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The exit scam came as a shock to the users of Chibi Finance, which had launched around April 2023 and had promoted itself as a yield-optimizing service on the Arbitrum chain. In addition to auto-compounded yields, Chibi Finance had touted several other features typically associated with yield farming.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The platform had undergone its first audit on May 31 and had recently reported $500k in Total Value Locked (TVL), with ambitions to reach $1 million. As recent as June 26, Chibi Finance announced that it had been listed on CoinGecko.</p>
Scams on the Arbitrum Network: A Growing Concern
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This exit scam is unfortunately not an isolated incident. CertiK reports that over $14 million has been lost to scams on the Arbitrum network across 12 different instances in 2023 alone. The growing number of such fraudulent activities underlines the need for greater vigilance and more stringent security measures in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These scams, commonly referred to as "rug pulls," typically involve developers gaining legitimacy on social media, hyping up their projects, and raising substantial amounts of money. Once the project's tokens are offered to the public, the developers abruptly withdraw the liquidity, leaving the token holders high and dry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">This incident serves as a cautionary tale, underscoring the importance of thorough due diligence and careful assessment of risk when investing in DeFi projects, especially those operating on relatively new platforms such as Arbitrum. The security and integrity of smart contracts remain crucial factors to consider, and potential investors are advised to be wary of any red flags that may indicate possible fraudulent intentions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Affected Voyager customers can now open a Gemini account until July 23, 2023, and withdraw their cryptocurrencies directly in accordance with the distribution process claims.</p>
Gemini Enables Voyager Funds Recovery
<p>In a statement posted on Sunday, June 25, the Gemini team announced a fund recovery program for those affected by the Voyager bankruptcy. The customers who hope to reclaim their lost funds will need to join the Gemini platform and will have time till July 23, 2023, to avail of the offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the team is also presenting a promotional offer of $5 BTC for every new verified Voyager customer from the United States who joins the Gemini platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statement reads,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through July 23, 2023, Voyager customers impacted by the Voyager bankruptcy can create a Gemini account to withdraw their crypto in-kind, pursuant to the claims of the distribution process. We are pleased to offer a promotional welcome to all Voyager customers who join Gemini. New U.S. customers from Voyager will receive $5 in BTC after they sign up and become verified within 30 days of opening their account.&rdquo;</p>

Customers To Recover Gemini-Supported Tokens
<p>Gemini has been powering through the current crypto landscape, especially seeking expansion opportunities in the APAC countries. The company has, in fact, applied for its UAE license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has now taken on the responsibility of being the full-reserve exchange and custodian for all client funds on the Voyager platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company also clarified that the fund recovery would only be applicable to tokens supported by Gemini. If a Voyager customer sends tokens not supported by the Gemini platform, they might be lost and completely unrecoverable. A similar loss of funds might affect the transition of tokens to Gemini over an unsupported network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, if users do not withdraw their funds from the Voyager platform within the stipulated time, they will be liquidated and distributed back in cash.&nbsp;</p>
Voyager&rsquo;s Bankruptcy Struggles
<p>Just a few weeks ago, there were reports of a Voyager bankruptcy plan which claimed that the bankrupt firm was going to restart customer withdrawals to refund 35.72% of what was owed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After facing financial difficulties and declaring bankruptcy almost a year ago, Voyager Digital struggled with securing deals to reopen customer withdrawals. In fact, the company had two prior unsuccessful attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first was the $1.4 billion deal with FTX US that fell through when the latter&rsquo;s bankruptcy scandal broke. Voyager&rsquo;s second attempt was a $1 billion deal with the US division of prominent cryptocurrency firm Binance. However, this, too, failed to materialize as Binance withdrew from the agreement, citing concerns over a "hostile and uncertain regulatory climate" in the United States.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With bitcoin gathering strength above $30,000 another strong move to the upside could be on the way.</p>
A safe haven - but do people know it?
<p>Having taken all that could be thrown at it by government and financial agencies, bitcoin appears to be doing exactly what it was built for, and that is providing a safe haven for the peoples&rsquo; wealth outside of a fast-crumbling fiat financial system.</p>
<p>The real shame of the matter is that a lot of the mud that has been frantically slung at the crypto sector by mainstream media on behalf of the banks has undeniably stuck, with the vast majority of people not feeling that they can trust one of the only life rafts available to them.</p>
<p>However, if bitcoin can continue its current strong trend to the upside the mainstream media will find it increasingly difficult to ignore and will be able to manufacture less reasons to stop the average retail investor from buying it - as long as the SEC hasn&rsquo;t destroyed all the on/off ramps from the banks.</p>
Momentum about to pick up
<p>Momentum indicators are starting to go bitcoin&rsquo;s way. The huge pump in price from $24,800 to around $31,400 wasn&rsquo;t something that could be sustained, and bitcoin has had to go downwards and sideways for the last few days in order for the RSIs (momentum indicators) to reset.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With bitcoin gathering strength above $30,000 another strong move to the upside could be on the way.</p>
A safe haven - but do people know it?
<p>Having taken all that could be thrown at it by government and financial agencies, bitcoin appears to be doing exactly what it was built for, and that is providing a safe haven for the peoples&rsquo; wealth outside of a fast-crumbling fiat financial system.</p>
<p>The real shame of the matter is that a lot of the mud that has been frantically slung at the crypto sector by mainstream media on behalf of the banks has undeniably stuck, with the vast majority of people not feeling that they can trust one of the only life rafts available to them.</p>
<p>However, if bitcoin can continue its current strong trend to the upside the mainstream media will find it increasingly difficult to ignore and will be able to manufacture less reasons to stop the average retail investor from buying it - as long as the SEC hasn&rsquo;t destroyed all the on/off ramps from the banks.</p>
Momentum about to pick up
<p>Momentum indicators are starting to go bitcoin&rsquo;s way. The huge pump in price from $24,800 to around $31,400 wasn&rsquo;t something that could be sustained, and bitcoin has had to go downwards and sideways for the last few days in order for the RSIs (momentum indicators) to reset.</p>
<p>This has happened for both the shorter term 4-hourly and 8-hourly, and the 12 hourly is on the way down. Looking out at the long term weekly timeframe things do look good for bitcoin given that the weekly Stochastic RSI has crossed upwards and has pierced through the 20 level signalling strong upwards momentum.</p>
<p>Continuing with this more macro outlook, closing a weekly candle above the $30,000 price level was an extremely bullish action for bitcoin. It could certainly be argued that this is the all-important level for it to get above since it has been support and resistance since early 2021.</p>

<p>US regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ether is damaging the token&rsquo;s performance compared with a recent rally in Bitcoin.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In what is being called substantial progress in asset recovery, the new FTX management has recovered $7 billion in liquid assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recovery comes against the backdrop of a new investigative report that has been released by the now-collapsed cryptocurrency exchange.&nbsp;</p>
$7 Billion In Liquid Assets Recovered&nbsp;
<p>The FTX collapse was one of the most controversial developments in the cryptocurrency industry, having rocked the entire ecosystem. The exchange was once the blue-eyed boy of the industry but was eventually exposed as one of the biggest fraudulent operations in the industry when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year. However, there has been significant progress since then, with the new FTX management announcing the recovery of $7 billion in liquid assets, calling the development &ldquo;substantial progress&rdquo; in asset recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new FTX management also published an investigative report, with the new CEO laying bare the reality of the exchange.&nbsp;</p>
The FTX Report&nbsp;
<p>According to the report, the Sam Bankman-Fried-led crypto conglomerate made several false statements to banks about accounts related to the use of trading firm Alameda Research&rsquo;s accounts for customer transactions. This was after the banks in question raised several queries about Alameda Trading&rsquo;s wire transfers and started rejecting them. The report documented a specific instance where a bank representative asked if an Alameda Research account that received customer deposits would be used to settle trades for the FTX exchange. In response, the report alleges that a senior FTX executive directed an Alameda employee to lie and state that customers occasionally end up confusing FTX and Alameda but that all incoming and outgoing wire transfers were used to settle Alameda trades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report also alleged that FTX created a new entity called North Dimension Inc. which was falsely advertised as a crypto trading firm with an average monthly trading volume of $10 million and 2000 counterparties. However, in reality, North Dimension Inc. was a shell company that FTX utilized to receive customer deposits and fund withdrawals. When an attorney discovered this, the company ended up firing the attorney. John Ray III, the CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX entities, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the inception of the FTX.com exchange, the FTX Group commingled customer deposits and corporate funds and misused them with abandon at the direction and by the design of previous senior executives.&rdquo;</p>

A Web Of Lies&nbsp;
<p>The complicated relationship between FTX and Alameda Research was the primary reason behind the unraveling of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led crypto empire. According to the report, the former CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison, in private notes written in March 2022, estimated that FTX.com alone had a cash deficit of over $10 billion. According to Ray, the report is in line with the new management&rsquo;s objective of greater transparency. He further added that FTX&rsquo;s reputation as a customer-focused entity was a mirage, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The release of this report furthers our stated objective of transparency. The image that the FTX group sought to portray as the customer-focused leader of the digital age was a mirage. We will continue to report our analysis and findings as our work progresses and remain committed to recovering as much value as possible for creditors.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Subsequent reports are expected to be released at regular intervals, with later reports bringing in further revelations about FTX and its day-to-day operations.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has reversed its decision to delist certain privacy coins in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After feedback from several projects and the community, Binance had earlier revised its operations to comply with EU regulations and delist several privacy coins.&nbsp;</p>
Binance Goes Back On Initial Decision&nbsp;
<p>The European Union&rsquo;s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations triggered the move to delist privacy coins in the European markets. These new regulations called for increased transparency and information sharing when it came to cryptocurrency transfers and transactions. Binance stated in a press release issued on the 26th of June,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After carefully considering feedback from our community and several projects, we have revised how we classify privacy coins on our platform to comply with EU-wide regulatory requirements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It also added that because Binance conducts operations as an exchange registered in several European Union jurisdictions, the exchange is obliged to follow local regulations. These require them to monitor transactions for the coins that are listed on the platform. The exchange had previously announced that it was shuttering trading services of 12 privacy-focused tokens. These included several well-known coins such as Dash, Monero, and Zcash, along with lesser-known ones such as SCRT and XVG.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move came in the face of growing regulatory pressure on the cryptocurrency ecosystem and would impact users based in France, Spain, Poland, and Italy. Delisting the tokens meant that users in these jurisdictions could not purchase these privacy tokens, dealing a significant blow to privacy coin enthusiasts. Binance had stated at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While we aim to support as many quality projects as possible, we are required to follow local laws and regulations regarding the trading of privacy coins to ensure we can continue to serve as many users as we can. &ldquo;As part of Binance&rsquo;s ongoing compliance processes, we have reached out to affected users to notify them that they will no longer be able to purchase or trade privacy tokens on our platform after the 26th of June.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Binance is not the only exchange that has moved to delist privacy tokens. Several other prominent exchanges, such as Huobi, Kraken, and Bittrex, had already removed several popular privacy tokens, such as Dash and Monero, from their listings. Furthermore, several governments, such as those in Japan, South Korea, and Dubai, have taken a hawkish stance against privacy coins, with some even banning them outright.&nbsp;</p>
Projects Rush To Reassure Users&nbsp;
<p>According to email communications sent to users, several cryptocurrencies, such as XMR, MOB, BEAM, ZEN, and FIRO, are still subject to restrictions. However, with the ban retracted, several cryptocurrency projects took to Twitter to reassure their users that their projects would remain unaffected. Verge Currency had posted an update as early as the 22nd of June, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to inform you that $XVG will remain unaffected by @binance&rsquo;s trading restrictions on #privacy coins in certain EU countries. Verge utilizes a public #blockchain with visible transactions, amounts, and wallet addresses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Secret Network also posted an update for its users, stating that it is not included among the currencies Binance planned to delist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke, and Binance listened! @binance will not be delisting $SCRT, along with six other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, in European countries.&rdquo;</p>

The Current Regulatory Landscape&nbsp;
<p>Binance&rsquo;s decision to reverse the delisting of privacy coins comes after receiving feedback from the crypto community and reviewing its operations to comply with regulatory requirements in the European Union. The initial move to delist the coins was the result of the European Union&rsquo;s Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which was signed into law on the 31st of May. The regulation also includes a &ldquo;travel rule&rdquo; for transactions, requiring more transparency and information sharing. This clashed with the very nature of privacy coins, leading to several concerns when it came to compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the cryptocurrency industry has been welcoming of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulations, stating that it provides regulatory clarity for digital assets. Crypto payments service provider Ripple is one company that has expressed considerable appreciation for the clarity ushered in by the MiCA regulations. Furthermore, the European Securities and Markets Authority is also planning a MiCA consultation process, set to begin in July.</p>

Crypto payments service provider Ripple is one company that has expressed considerable appreciation for the clarity ushered in by the MiCA regulations. Furthermore, the European Securities and Markets Authority is also planning a MiCA consultation process, set to begin in July.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Tezos, the innovative self-amending proof-of-stake blockchain and strong competitor of Ethereum, recently announced the implementation of its 14th network upgrade, dubbed Nairobi.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The upgrade comes with several major enhancements intended to improve user experience and network performance. Despite these advancements, $XTZ, the blockchain's native token, saw no significant impact on its price.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Nairobi Upgrade: Boosting Transaction Throughput and Streamlining User Experience</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Collaboratively created by numerous teams including Nomadic Labs, Marigold, TriliTech, Oxhead Alpha, Tarides, DaiLambda, and Functori, the Nairobi upgrade introduces a range of mainnet improvements. A key highlight of these improvements is the increased transaction throughput which allows for faster processing of transactions and lower transaction fees.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Following the upgrade, Tezos' throughput has skyrocketed by eight times, a boost applicable to various operations including transactions, smart contract calls, and Smart Rollup maintenance operations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, with the Nairobi update, Tezos now offers support for Smart Rollup functions. The blockchain platform has introduced new functions and internal Layer-2 messages, enabling Tezos to seamlessly synchronize rollup kernels with future protocol upgrades. Additionally, for better understanding and communication, Tezos has improved its terminology. Enhancements for faster consensus have also been made, particularly through the increased speed of pre-attestation propagation.</p>
Tezos Ecosystem DAO: Streamlining On-Chain Funds Deployment
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Nairobi upgrade coincided with the launch of the Tezos Ecosystem DAO, aimed at improving on-chain funds deployment and treasury management for vital initiatives within the Tezos ecosystem. The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) enables community members to submit funding requests for Tezos-related initiatives which are then subjected to curation, voting, and the distribution of XTZ. Ensuring transparency and accountability, all DAO activities will be publicly visible. Initially, the DAO will be governed by a three-out-of-five multi-sig setup, with organizations such as Trilitech, the Tezos Foundation, and the Tezos India Foundation holding the keys.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Despite these major advancements, the XTZ prices remain under pressure. As of June 26, XTZ is trading at $0.80, up 13% from the lows of June 2023. The current bearish trend, down 45% from February highs, persists even as the overall cryptocurrency market appears to be bottoming up.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Looking Ahead</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Nairobi upgrade marks a significant milestone in Tezos' journey, highlighting the blockchain platform's commitment to continuous improvement and innovation. By boosting transaction throughput, improving terminology, and launching the Tezos Ecosystem DAO, Tezos has not only improved its network's performance but also streamlined user experience. Despite the current XTZ price trends, these advancements pave the way for a promising future for the Tezos network.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">HSBC Hong Kong, a subsidiary of one of the world's largest banking and financial services organizations, has recently added support for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">This move expands access to digital asset derivatives in the flourishing Asian crypto hub. Jeff Feng, co-founder of Sei Labs, believes that ETFs deliver "simplicity and convenience" for newcomers to the crypto space.</p>
Broader Exposure to Digital Assets
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As of Monday, HSBC Hong Kong customers are now able to trade ETFs that offer exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures based on derivative contracts listed on commodity exchanges. These ETFs, treated as securities, were listed on HSBC Hong Kong's mobile app "Easy Invest."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">HSBC Hong Kong has confirmed to Decrypt that the specific offerings are CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF. The news was initially reported by Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu, who underscored that HSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong, is the first lender in the region to grant its customers access to digital asset ETFs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Jeff Feng, including ETFs on its investment platform provides HSBC Hong Kong investors with access to derivatives, which they might otherwise seek on unregulated exchanges. This new offering represents a clear opportunity for the bank to take the lead and fulfill a clearly identified customer need.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF and CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF are managed by CSOP Asset Management. This firm listed the two products on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December of last year, marking the first time ETFs in Asia had tracked digital asset futures. Both ETFs invest in futures contracts trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), providing a straightforward way for investors to participate in the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
Safer Path Through Regulatory Scrutiny
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the strong demand for spot access to crypto among retail investors in Hong Kong, Feng noted that the demand for derivatives is equally high, if not higher. ETFs offer companies a way to provide crypto exposure without exposing themselves to regulatory risk in a rapidly evolving industry. Hong Kong's financial authorities have recently signaled a shift toward a more open stance on cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The regulatory scrutiny around centralized exchanges has led to caution in launching new platforms.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"If all of the centralized exchanges are getting this much regulatory scrutiny, it wouldn't be too wise to go out and try to launch another," Feng stated. "It's much safer to do what's already been proven. There's a clear playbook."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the United States, futures ETFs related to the performance of digital assets have become more common. Despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) not yet approving a spot-based Bitcoin ETF, ProShares' Bitcoin futures ETF was launched on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"When you have simplicity, what you eventually will get is volume,&rdquo; he said. "People will eventually speculate because it&rsquo;s just so easy," Feng said.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Feng, the "simplicity and convenience" offered by ETFs make them an attractive option for retail traders, particularly compared to other derivatives like options, which require an understanding of more complex concepts.</p>

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/robinhood-to-lay-off-7percent-of-its-workforce</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In a recently leaked internal announcement, Robinhood Markets, the popular online brokerage firm, reportedly plans to lay off approximately 150 full-time employees, equating to about 7% of its total workforce.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This move signifies the third wave of job cuts the company has undertaken in just over a year, reflecting its ongoing adjustments to fluctuating market conditions.</p>
Aligning to Volumes and Team Structures
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As per an internal message obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Robinhood CFO, Jason Warnick, stated that the layoffs were part of a plan to "adjust to volumes and to better align team structures." The company's spokesperson has not issued any statement to confirm or deny the layoffs, but asserted that the firm continually strives for "operational excellence."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The representative's statement read:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We&rsquo;re ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis. In some cases, this may mean teams make changes based on volume, workload, org design, and more."</p>

Possible Reaction to Recent Acquisition and Decreasing Margins
<p class="md-end-block md-p">News of the layoffs follows shortly after Robinhood's acquisition of credit card company X1 for $95 million, which took place just five days prior. It's worth noting that the company had already conducted two rounds of significant job cuts in 2022, reducing its total headcount by 9% in April and by a further 23% in August.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The move was seen as a response to dwindling trading activity and decreased prices of equities and cryptocurrencies, both of which considerably squeezed the firm's profit margins. Together, these layoffs accounted for a loss of more than 1,000 staff members.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Three weeks ago, the firm mulled the delisting of a number of tokens due to an SEC citation. It later went on to delist Solana, Cardano, and Polygon. </p>
Dwindling User Base and Revenue Decline
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At its peak in Q2 2021, Robinhood boasted a user base of 21.3 million active users, generating more than $565 million in revenue. However, recent financial figures paint a less rosy picture. The firm's Q1 2023 results indicated a stark 44% decline in monthly active users and a 30% year-over-year decrease in revenue.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the turbulence, Robinhood shares have seen some positivity, trading at $9.63 per share, representing an 18% increase year-to-date. However, this is significantly down from its August 2021 all-time-high, having fallen more than 82% since then.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The latest layoffs at Robinhood underline the shifting dynamics in the financial technology sector, illustrating the necessity for firms to adapt rapidly to the ever-changing market environment.</p>

It's worth noting that the company had already conducted two rounds of significant job cuts in 2022, reducing its total headcount by 9% in April and by a further 23% in August.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The move was seen as a response to dwindling trading activity and decreased prices of equities and cryptocurrencies, both of which considerably squeezed the firm's profit margins. Together, these layoffs accounted for a loss of more than 1,000 staff members.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Three weeks ago, the firm mulled the delisting of a number of tokens due to an SEC citation. It later went on to delist Solana, Cardano, and Polygon. </p>
Dwindling User Base and Revenue Decline
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At its peak in Q2 2021, Robinhood boasted a user base of 21.3 million active users, generating more than $565 million in revenue. However, recent financial figures paint a less rosy picture. The firm's Q1 2023 results indicated a stark 44% decline in monthly active users and a 30% year-over-year decrease in revenue.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the turbulence, Robinhood shares have seen some positivity, trading at $9.63 per share, representing an 18% increase year-to-date. However, this is significantly down from its August 2021 all-time-high, having fallen more than 82% since then.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The latest layoffs at Robinhood underline the shifting dynamics in the financial technology sector, illustrating the necessity for firms to adapt rapidly to the ever-changing market environment.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Swiss authorities have reportedly seized over $26 million worth of Bitcoin and other digital assets connected to Terraform Labs and its former executives. This move comes as the latest in a series of legal repercussions following the collapse of Terraform Labs' crypto project in May 2022.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The confiscated crypto assets, previously held at the Zurich-based Sygnum Bank, belonged to Do Kwon and Han Chang-joon, former CEO and CFO of Terraform Labs, respectively, according to the news outlet Digital Asset. Swiss authorities executed this action in response to a request from the New York Federal Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, the amount seized&mdash;$26 million&mdash;doubles Bloomberg's prior reports, which suggested that Kwon stored $13 million in Sygnum Bank. This disclosure from June 8 also noted that Kwon had moved an additional $29 million of cryptocurrency outside of the Swiss account. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The seizure comes as authorities in the U.S. and South Korea continue to seek separate charges against Kwon and his associates following the spectacular failure of Terraform Labs and its various projects.</p>
The Collapse of Terraform Labs and Kwon's Troubles
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Terraform Labs and its algorithmic stablecoin project, Terra-Luna, collapsed in May 2022, erasing $40 billion in market cap and sending ripples through the broader crypto market. South Korean authorities subsequently charged Kwon in September 2022 for violating its Capital Markets Act and issued a warrant for his arrest. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Shortly after, the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) issued a red notice for Kwon, a South Korean national. The notice is essentially an international arrest warrant, instructing law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and detain him on charges of fraud.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">U.S. Federal prosecutors also indicted Kwon with multiple counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy. Both South Korea and the U.S. are currently seeking Kwon's extradition.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Kwon and his associate Han Chang-Joon were sentenced to four months in jail by a Montenegro district court for forging travel documents. The co-founder of Terraform Labs was arrested in March in Podgorica, the Montenegro capital, while attempting to travel to Dubai with a forged passport. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite being released on bail in June, the duo has remained in custody, with their detention time to be included in the four-month sentence. Notably, Kwon and his associates reportedly fled multiple countries in 2022 after Terraform Labs' project failure.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As investigations continue and more assets are seized, the full scope of the fallout from Terraform Labs' implosion becomes clearer. What remains to be seen is how the pursuit of justice will continue in this complex, cross-border case involving crypto-assets and high-profile individuals.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Australia's Treasury Department is developing its token mapping framework for digital assets to be both "tech agnostic" and "principles-based," rather than adopting a rigid, "token specific" methodology. This innovative approach aims to flexibly classify tokens based on their function and purpose.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Trevor Power, the Australian Treasury assistant secretary, shared in an interview with Cointelegraph during the Australian Blockchain Week that the purpose of this approach is to structure regulations around the principles of the token's function, rather than focusing solely on the specific technology or token.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"The token mapping paper spends a lot of time talking about the token, the system, the value delivered for the very purpose of trying to structure whatever regulation such that it draws on those principles so then a token can be placed within that," Power stated. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">He further emphasized the intent behind the approach, stating: "It's trying to be tech agnostic. It's not trying to be token specific."</p>
Shaping the Framework
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Power outlined that crypto assets, which change their utility and function over time, would be subject to regulatory review, particularly if they become significant within the ecosystem. This review will ensure that they "graduate through the regulatory system" accordingly, despite previous delays.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">He stressed the importance of creating a robust token mapping regulation that could function in a "tech-neutral" and "principles-based manner," to adequately account for such changes.</p>
Influence and Reception
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Power highlighted that the token mapping initiative hadn't been influenced by recent regulatory enforcement actions by the United States Securities Exchange Commission. Instead, he hinted that Australia's crypto framework might lean closer to the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation in its approach.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As Australia's token mapping framework takes shape, Power welcomed U.S. and foreign digital asset firms to consider the Australian market, asserting that they should align with the token mapping framework, designed to balance innovation and consumer protection:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"There are two arms to every component of regulation. One is to make sure that that framework is there, and the second one is to make sure there's room for industry to grow and be innovative."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Australia's Treasury Department believes that token mapping is essential to understanding how the crypto ecosystem interacts with the country's existing financial regulatory frameworks. They had earlier conducted a consultation process, inviting stakeholders' views on the proposed token mapping framework.</p>
