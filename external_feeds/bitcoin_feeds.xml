The bank&#x2019;s head of crypto research now expects bitcoin to reach $50,000 this year and $120,000 the following year. &#x201C;Increased miner profitability per bitcoin mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> supply and pushing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices higher,&#x201D; the analyst explained.</strong></p>
<h2>Standard Chartered Boosts Bitcoin Price Prediction</h2>
<p>Geoff Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered&#x2019;s crypto research team and emerging markets FX (West), has raised his bitcoin price prediction. Standard Chartered is a banking corporation with global headquarters in London, England. Operating in more than 57 markets worldwide, the bank&#x2019;s total assets at the end of 1Q 2023 amounted to $821 billion.</p>
<p>Kendrick stated in April that crypto winter had ended, predicting at the time that bitcoin&#x2019;s price could reach <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/standard-chartered-bank-crypto-winter-is-over-bitcoin-could-reach-100k-next-year/">$100K</a>. The Standard Chartered analyst now <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/standard-chartered-bumps-up-bitcoin-forecast-120000-2023-07-10/">expects</a> the price of the largest cryptocurrency to reach $50,000 this year and $120,000 by the end of 2024. He believes that the price surge could incentivize bitcoin miners to hoard more of the cryptocurrency&#x2019;s supply.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As well as maintaining the Bitcoin ledger, miners play a key role in determining net supply of newly mined <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Specifically, based on their profitability, miners decide how much of the new <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> supply reaches the market,&#x201D; Kendrick wrote on Monday, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Increased miner profitability per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> supply and pushing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices higher.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that the reason behind his projected <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price increase was that miners worldwide, who mint 900 new bitcoins daily, would soon need to sell fewer coins to cover their costs, including electricity needed to power mining equipment.</p>

<p>Kendrick estimated that bitcoin miners have been selling 100% of their newly mined coins. However, if the price of bitcoin hits $50,000, he expects them to only sell 20%-30% of their output. The Standard Chartered analyst detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is the equivalent of miners reducing the amount of bitcoins they sell per day to just 180-270 from 900 currently.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Over a year, that would reduce miner selling from 328,500 to a range of 65,700-98,550 &#x2014; a reduction in net <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> supply of roughly 250,000 bitcoins a year,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/standard-chartered-bank-cryptocurrency-exchange-brokerage/">launched</a> a cryptocurrency exchange and brokerage service in June 2021. The bank&#x2019;s CEO, Bill Winters, previously said that the adoption of digital currencies is &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/standard-chartered-bank-ceo-cryptocurrency-adoption/">absolutely inevitable</a>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $30,506, up 18% in the past 30 days and 84% year-to-date. Last week, crypto firm <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/matrixports-year-end-2024-prediction-bitcoin-to-reach-125000-as-strong-performance-fuels-bullish-sentiment/">Matrixpoint</a> predicted that bitcoin will reach $125,000 by the end of 2024. Meanwhile, venture capitalist Tim Draper has insisted that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will hit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-adjusts-timeframe-for-his-250k-bitcoin-price-forecast/">$250,000</a> in about two years.</p>

The company announced it would not involve its largest franchises in blockchain initiatives, avoiding a possible devaluation of its intellectual properties (IPs), shelving in-house developed games and developments from third parties.</strong></p>
<h2>Sega Changes Its Blockchain Gaming Strategy</h2>
<p>Sega, the Japanese game development and publishing company, once a supporter of blockchain games, is now withdrawing its support for initiatives of this kind. In a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-06/sega-joins-blockchain-games-pullback-as-crypto-winter-persists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Bloomberg, co-Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi stated that the company was pulling the plug on games using this technology.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Utsumi also declared that Sega would not license its most prominent intellectual properties (IPs) to third parties involved in these kinds of games to avoid &#8220;devaluing&#8221; its content. However, Utsumi acknowledged that lesser franchises like Three Kingdoms and Virtua Fighter could be lent to be used in non-fungible token (NFT) projects.</p>
<p>Utsumi&#8217;s statements are a departure from the former stance that the company had on blockchain games, being involved in several projects as a developer and licensing its IPs to third parties. On April 2022, Sega <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sega-hints-at-inclusion-of-nft-and-metaverse-elements-in-its-super-game-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at including NFT and blockchain elements as part of its &#8220;super game&#8221; concept, contemplating investing more than $800 million in this initiative.</p>
<p>Also, in October, Sega <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-gaming-giant-sega-to-launch-first-blockchain-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the launch of its first licensed blockchain game, using its Sangokushi Taisen franchise and being built using <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gamefi-focused-oasys-blockchain-launches-mainnet-with-support-of-sega-ubisoft-and-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oasys</a> technology, a gaming-oriented blockchain project.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Games Are &#8216;Boring&#8217;</h2>
<p>Utsumi explained his position on blockchain games and the reasons behind the company&#8217;s change of heart. He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The action in play-to-earn games is boring. What’s the point if games are no fun? We’re looking into whether this technology is really going to take off in this industry, after all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Utsumi stated Sega has not closed the door on including blockchain elements in its games when the technology matures. He declared that the company &#8220;should not ever underestimate&#8221; blockchain advocates and their proposals for the gaming space, even if they &#8220;sound a bit extreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast, Square Enix, another Japanese gaming company known for supporting the inclusion of blockchain and NTF elements in AAA games, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/square-enix-to-deepen-its-blockchain-efforts-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in January that it would deepen its blockchain push, revealing it had multiple blockchain games based on original IPs under development.</p>

<h2>Jim Rickards States Biden &#8216;Destroyed the Dollar&#8217;</h2>
<p>Best-selling author and economist Jim Rickards has given his opinion about the Biden administration&#8217;s handling of U.S. monetary policy. Rickards, an investment expert with 35 years of experience, accused President Joe Biden of taking down the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency.</p>
<p>On social media, Rickards <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGRickards/status/1677860685148049408?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biden is now a world historic figure. He has destroyed the dollar, not an easy task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The currency expert noted that one of the biggest rivals for the dollar is the birth of a BRICS bloc-wide currency that could potentially link the economic transactions of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (the BRICS bloc). Rickards stated that a gold-backed BRICS common currency will be previewed on August 22 and that it will be implemented in stages.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/russembkenya?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1675727818888716288%7Ctwgr%5Edea5c53961602aa205727bcd0725622df9bd6942%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.bitcoin.com%2Fbrics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reports</a> coming from the Russian embassy in Kenya support this allegation. In contrast, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS bank, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that there was no immediate push to create a common currency, explaining that any alternatives in this area would be part of &#8220;a medium to long-term ambition.&#8221;</p>

<h2>SCO and BRICS Merge</h2>
<p>According to Rickards, BRICS and the <a href="http://eng.sectsco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shanghai Cooperation Organization</a> (SCO), two of the most significant economic blocs in the world, will merge into an unnamed cooperation group. Rickards believes the size of this new organization will inspire other countries to unite, consolidating an economic unity that will hurt the status of the U.S. dollar as a reserve and transactional currency.</p>
<p>However, Rickards maintains that the dollar will continue to be used as a second-hand currency, being &#8220;marginalized.&#8221; This is one of the scenarios that Rickards predicted in his 2011 best-seller Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis, where he describes the rise of a multicurrency world as dollar dominance continues to fade.</p>
<p>Others have also warned about the destruction of the dollar and its value. Jim Rogers, an investor who <a href="https://www.jimrogers.com/unreal-estate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> the 2008 financial crisis in 2002, recently warned about the effects of the demise of the U.S. dollar, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-warns-us-is-going-to-suffer-as-dollars-value-erodes-further/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> that the country is &#8220;going to suffer&#8221; due to inflation and debt problems.</p>

The financial institution&#8217;s researchers predict a dramatic expansion in India&#8217;s gross domestic product.</strong></p>
<h2>Economic Shift: Goldman Sachs Predicts India&#8217;s Ascent to World&#8217;s No. 2 Economy</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/how-india-could-rise-to-the-worlds-second-biggest-economy.html">report</a> titled &#8220;How India Could Rise to the World&#8217;s Second-Biggest Economy,&#8221; Santanu Sengupta, an economist with Goldman Sachs Research, projects substantial expansion for India&#8217;s economy. The report forecasts a surge in India&#8217;s gross domestic product, making it the world&#8217;s second-largest economy by 2075.</p>
<p>This growth is largely credited to India&#8217;s advantageous demographic makeup, balancing its working-age population and those too young or old to work. The study indicates that the key for India is to boost labor force participation and offer ample training and skill development opportunities.</p>
<p>“Over the next two decades, the dependency ratio of India will be one of the lowest among regional economies,” Sengupta detailed. “India has made more progress in innovation and technology than some may realize,” the economist added.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-597160 size-full" title="India Poised to Leapfrog Major Economies, Becoming World's Second-Largest by 2075, Goldman Sachs Report Predicts" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected.jpg" alt="India Poised to Leapfrog Major Economies, Becoming World's Second-Largest by 2075, Goldman Sachs Report Predicts" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>The Goldman report asserts that India has seen significant growth in innovation, technology, and worker productivity. In economic terms, this suggests higher output for each labor and capital unit. The report also emphasizes that capital investment, driven by expected savings increases due to falling dependency ratios, rising incomes, and financial sector development, will be instrumental in fueling growth.</p>
<p>“Given healthy balance sheets of private corporates and banks in India, we believe that the conditions are conducive for a private sector capex cycle,” Sengupta notes.</p>
<p>The economist indicates that the primary challenge and risk to India&#8217;s economic growth forecast is productively engaging the labor force. Sengupta asserts that this involves creating job opportunities and enhancing job-related skills. The upside growth potential lies in digitizing the economy. The bank&#8217;s researcher cites Aadhaar, the world&#8217;s largest biometric ID system, which Sengupta claims has improved public service delivery and expanded access to credit.</p>
<p>Lastly, the report underscores India&#8217;s domestic demand-driven economy, the influence of global commodity prices, and the country&#8217;s energy needs as crucial factors in understanding its economic landscape. India currently holds the position of the world&#8217;s fifth-largest economy, and Goldman&#8217;s researchers posit that &#8220;India&#8217;s savings rate is likely to increase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goldman&#8217;s examination of India follows <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-dollar-will-lose-dominant-status-china-and-india-could-play-key-role-in-currency-shift-says-economist-lord-oneill/">commentary</a> from British economist Lord Jim O&#8217;Neill, who conceived the acronym BRIC. O&#8217;Neill discussed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/what-is-de-dollarization-exploring-the-shift-away-from-the-us-dollars-global-dominance/">de-dollarization</a> and anticipates the Chinese yuan and the Indian rupee will become “much more important currencies for the world.”</p>

Youssef claimed that Paxful is now &#8220;just paying legal bills&#8221; and that &#8220;no African or any non-American should trust any IS corporation.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Paxful&#8217;s Alleged Removal of Reserve Funds From Status Page Raises Concern</h2>
<p>Following reports that Paxful, the peer-to-peer crypto marketplace, has removed the reserve funds amount from the status page, former CEO Ray Youssef advised users to cease trading. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/raycivkit/status/1677424162015461377?s=20">reply</a> to a Twitter user who warned of an FTX-style collapse, Youssef suggested that users should consider switching to self-custody until &#8220;we get to the bottom of this.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-597048 size-full" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12.png" alt="" width="1180" height="426" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12-300x108.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12-1024x370.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12-768x277.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px" /></p>
<p>In addition to exposing the alleged removal of reserve funds from Paxful’s website, the unidentified social media user also claimed to have seen tweets from former employees who complained of not being paid all their dues after they left. The user also claimed to have heard rumors that Paxful was dipping into customer funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>In another <a href="https://twitter.com/raycivkit/status/1677423787208318978">tweet</a>, Youssef, in an apparent response to Paxful’s pledge to unfreeze $4.5 million in customer funds, reiterated his lack of confidence in the process, declaring:</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not trust lawyers. Paxful is now just paying legal bills. No African or any non-American should trust any IS corporation. Don’t say you were [not] warned folks. My reputation I value over any shares in any company.</p></blockquote>
<p>In early April, trading on the P2P marketplace was suspended due to regulations and what Youssef attributed to the departure of key personnel. However, after Paxful announced the resumption of services, Youssef, who had already left the organization, said he could not vouch for anything that is happening there now.</p>
<p>Since leaving Paxful, Youssef, who has more than 50,000 followers on Twitter, has not only urged users to abandon the platform but has routinely promoted Civkit which he founded. Although many of the followers have lauded Youssef&#8217;s efforts, some have accused him of being an &#8220;attention seeker.&#8221; He has also been accused of seeking to use his influence to harm rivals.</p>

<h2>’Central Banks Are Diversifying Currency Holdings’</h2>
<p>Invesco, an asset management firm with $1.5 trillion in global assets under management, published its 11th annual study of sovereign investors on Monday. The &#8220;2023 Invesco Global Sovereign Asset Management Study&#8221; includes insights from 142 chief investment officers, heads of asset classes, and senior portfolio strategists representing 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks. Together, these institutions oversee around $21 trillion in assets as of March 31.</p>
<p>Noting that &#8220;Central banks are diversifying currency holdings, stirred by geopolitical uncertainties and attractive opportunities in emerging markets,&#8221; Invesco described:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amid volatile yields, 2022 saw a flight to gold, questions around the U.S. dollar’s future as the world’s reserve currency, and increased diversification of currency holdings.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the study, central banks see gold as a safe-haven asset, which led to record purchases in 2022, &#8220;with net acquisitions of 1,136 tonnes, marking a 12th consecutive year of a net increase in gold holdings.&#8221; While emphasizing that almost 20% of these net purchases came from Turkish and Chinese central banks, Invesco noted that other central banks, particularly in the Middle East and emerging markets, were also noteworthy gold buyers in 2022.</p>
<p>The study also explores de-dollarization. &#8220;The freezing of Russian assets by Western nations has thrust the world’s reliance on the U.S. dollar as the dominant reserve currency into the spotlight, raising questions about its long-term viability amidst high U.S. debt levels,&#8221; Invesco explained, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>A growing percentage of central banks year-on-year believe that the U.S. debt levels are negatively impacting the dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>“However, central banks generally agree that there is no clear alternative to replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency, with 53% disputing that the dollar will be weaker in five years, up from 46% last year,” the asset management firm continued. One central bank based in an emerging market was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>People have been looking for alternatives to the dollar and euro for a long time and they would’ve gone to them already if there were any suitable alternatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study also examines the potential for the Chinese yuan to replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s dominant currency. “The Chinese renminbi, with its increasing allocations in recent years, is often considered a potential future alternative,&#8221; the asset manager detailed, adding that in the long term (10 years or more), “most central banks do not anticipate a significant shift in global trade currencies,” but “a considerable proportion do expect a shift towards renminbi (27% of central banks), but expectations differ based on the region.”</p>
<p>Invesco pointed out that &#8220;sentiment surrounding the renminbi becoming a true reserve currency has declined year on year, with a significantly greater proportion of central banks disagreeing that it will achieve that status within five years.” In addition, the firm stressed that &#8220;barriers such as liquidity, property sector debt, and political risk hinder the renminbi’s potential to overtake the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.&#8221; Nonetheless, the asset manager concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite these concerns, central banks still expect to increase renminbi holdings over time.</p></blockquote>

Egypt, the world&#x2019;s 14th most populous country, grapples with soaring prices for goods and services across the region. Additionally, the bitcoin exchange rate in Egypt is approaching the record high set in November 2021.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Egyptian Pound Plummets as Inflation Reaches Highest Level in Decades, Bitcoin Nears All-Time High</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Recent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/egypt-economy-inflation-record-russia-ukraine-8024c29526c135bb87f74c55cfd3af57">inflation figures</a> show Egypt is currently grappling with soaring inflation rates. The annual inflation rate surged to 36.8% in June. Citizens face rising food prices, a depreciating currency, higher fuel costs, and a growing fiscal deficit. Since June 2022, when the inflation rate was at 14.7%, the cost of goods and services in Egypt has more than doubled.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Egyptian pound (EGP) has <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-USD">declined significantly</a> against the U.S. dollar in the first half of 2023, according to the latest exchange rates. The EGP&#x2019;s value has dropped 80.25% against the dollar since Dec. 26, 2003, with 42.09% of that decline occurring within the past five years. The currency has depreciated nearly 20% against the U.S. dollar since the start of 2023. Additionally, the inflation rate in Egypt has reached the highest level recorded since 1958.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In response to the inflation crisis, the Egyptian government has taken measures such as <a href="https://mepc.org/commentary/rising-inflation-egypt-impacts-responses">reducing state spending</a>. Moreover, the Central Bank of Egypt increased the benchmark bank rate four times in 2022. Despite the significant rise in inflation in Egypt, the exchange rate of the Egyptian pound (EGP) against Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) indicates <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is nearing a record high. The current exchange rate is nearing the all-time high set in November 2021, when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> surpassed one million EGP per unit. As of July 10, 2023, the exchange rate is <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-EGP">936,506 EGP per Bitcoin</a>.&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
Egypt&#x2019;s ongoing currency crisis and rampant inflation have severely impacted its citizens. An Egyptian family <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/egyptians-struggle-to-afford-food-this-ramadan-as-crisis-worsens-831e5a54">told</a> the Wall Street Journal in April they were &#x201C;hardly surviving this crisis&#x201D; and were running low on food. In order to mitigate the severe inflationary conditions, on January 16, 2023, the government announced a plan to sell discounted bread to low-income Egyptians most affected by the economic upheaval.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to government statistics, nearly 30% of Egyptians live below the poverty line. Egyptian policymakers have also been seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Since 2016, Egypt has received multiple financial support packages from the IMF. The most recent of these, a $3 billion loan, was <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/01/31/egypt-imf-bailout-highlights-risks-austerity-corruption">approved</a> by the IMF in December 2022.&#13;<br />

Thielen&#x2019;s forecast is based on a signal indicating the conclusion of the bear market, which occurred when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> reached its highest point in 12 months since the 2022 &#x2018;Crypto Winter.&#x2019;</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Matrixport Research: Bitcoin Expected to Hit $125,000 by Year-End 2024</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin prices have experienced a period of consolidation over the previous three days. However, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s value has still seen a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-leaves-major-assets-in-the-dust-surges-80-in-the-first-half-of-2023-soars-to-12th-largest-global-asset/">notable increase</a> of 17.5% over the past 30 days and a significant surge of 72% against the U.S. dollar within the last six months. This recent upward momentum has sparked several predictions.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Three days ago, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/btcs-year-end-price-projections-for-2023-vary-widely-ranging-from-25k-to-40k-while-future-forecasts-extend-into-six-digit-territory/">featured</a> two projections regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price by the end of 2023. These reports revealed a wide range of forecasts, ranging from $25,000 to $40,000 per bitcoin. On July 5, 2023, Markus Thielen, the head of research at Matrixport, published his own prediction for the end of 2024.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Thielen emphasizes that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> reaching its one-year high serves as a compelling indicator that has consistently marked the conclusion of bear markets and the onset of new crypto bull markets. The Matrixport researcher draws attention to notable instances when this signal occurred in August 2012, December 2015, May 2019, and August 2020. Thielen underscores that, in each of these cases, the bull market commenced within a timeframe of 12 to 18 months following the signal. The Matrixport executive added:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>If history is any guide, then, there is now a 100% probability that by the end of 2024, Bitcoin will experience another massive bull market with a price target of $125,000 (+310%) &#x2013; based on the previous three signals.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Matrixport&#x2019;s projection for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price at the end of 2024 follows venture capitalist Tim Draper&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-adjusts-timeframe-for-his-250k-bitcoin-price-forecast/">revised timeline</a> for bitcoin&#x2019;s value to reach $250,000. Draper acknowledged the possibility of a slightly extended wait, suggesting it could take an additional two years. These forecasts from Matrixport and Draper have also emerged with less than 300 days remaining until the next <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-2024-halving-presents-new-challenges-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-mining-rewards/">Bitcoin block reward halving</a>. Matrixport predicts a price of $63,160 for the halving, citing the Blackrock spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filing</a> and a surge in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-backed-by-fidelity-schwab-citadel-launches-with-trading-of-4-cryptocurrencies/">institutional interest</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;There is no obvious indication of what will drive the next bull market, but the data indicates that bitcoin could continue to rally into the 2024 halving,&#x201D; Matrixport&#x2019;s Thielen writes. &#x201C;Many market participants argued that the bitcoin bear market would continue throughout the year as the overhang from the crypto bankruptcies and the expected regulatory backlash would cause prices to stay low for the year. &#x2018;Matrix on Target&#x2019; had a different view, based on proven and reliable data analysis.&#x201D;&#13;<br />

The emergence of a discount on crypto assets paired with USD on Binance US has fueled speculation about the affiliate&#x2019;s future and the fate of users&#x2019; funds.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Stablecoin Asset Pairs Tracking the True Value of Crypto Assets</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
On July 10 the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD value on the beleaguered crypto exchange Binance US stood at just over $27,500, about $2,500 below the price prevailing on other centralized exchanges. In contrast, when paired with the stablecoin <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, the top cryptocurrency&#x2019;s value of just over $30,100 on Binance&#x2019;s affiliate in the U.S. was consistent with that on other exchanges.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In fact, as shown by data on Binance US, most crypto assets listed on the platform have also been trading at a discount in USD terms. Yet, when paired with the stablecoins <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> and USDC, many of the crypto assets appeared to track their true values. While news of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and other crypto assets&#x2019; discounts was one of the most trending topics on Twitter on July 9, recent <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance-us/">data</a> on the trading platform indicates that these price discrepancies initially emerged around June 21.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The emergence of a discount on all assets paired with USD is seemingly the direct opposite of what happened when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sought to freeze user assets via a court motion. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-trading-at-premium-on-binance-us-amid-sec-lawsuit-and-asset-freeze-motion/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in early June, the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD value on Binance US was $1,444 higher per bitcoin than the average global exchange rate. Ethereum was also trading at a premium of $100.&#13;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>The Existence of Arbitrage May Indicate Deeper Problems</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In the meantime, the emergence of a discount on all crypto assets paired with the USD appears to be linked to the crypto exchange&#x2019;s banking partner challenges. In its message to users on June 23, Binance US <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-restores-usd-withdrawals-suggests-users-withdraw-or-spend-their-dollars/">said</a> it expected its banking partners to discontinue the USD withdrawal service. At the time, the affiliate encouraged &#x201C;users to use, withdraw, or convert their USD fiat balances to stablecoins to continue crypto-to-crypto trading on the platform.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> is trading $3000 lower on Binance US & <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ETH</a> is trading $200 lower. I don&#x2019;t think this is an arbitrage opportunity. It&#x2019;s too obvious and it smells like something is seriously wrong. Again, this is Binance US. Just US version. Don&#x2019;t freak out yet. <a href="https://t.co/6WS9y6bMjD">pic.twitter.com/6WS9y6bMjD</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; Max (@MaxBecauseBTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBecauseBTC/status/1677719251589775360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On Twitter, the emergence of a discount on crypto assets paired with the USD has on one hand fueled speculation about the affiliate&#x2019;s future and the fate of users&#x2019; funds. On the other hand, users have questioned the apparent discount on nearly all assets paired with the USD. For example, a user by the name of Max said the price discrepancies on Binance US may not be an indication of an arbitrage opportunity. Another user named James Foura characterized the supposed arbitrage opportunity as one-way trade.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;People keep talking arbitrage on Binance US &#x2026; it&#x2019;s a one-trip trade folks. Getting money back in requires crypto that has to be bought at higher prices elsewhere. So it&#x2019;s basically a wash unless you want to dump your crypto. Can anyone find parity on Coinbase,&#x201D; Foura said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/J_Foura/status/1678005929411747841">tweet</a>.&#13;<br />

The move pushed the price near a one-week high, and came as the global crypto market cap fell 0.07% lower as of writing. Solana also dropped, following a recent bull run.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Binance Coin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Binance coin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>) was a notable gainer on Monday, as the token rose by nearly 5% to start the trading week.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
After falling to an intraday low of $232.01 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>/USD rose to a peak of $244.80.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This resulted in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> hitting its strongest point since last Tuesday, when the token climbed to a high of $246.90.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
From the chart, it appears that this latest rally occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 48.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 49.33, with the next visible point of resistance at 52.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should the index reach this point, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> will be near $250.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
After climbing to a two-month high last week, solana (SOL) was in the red on Monday, falling for a second straight day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
SOL/USD hit an intraday low of $20.57, which comes less than 24 hours after price peaked at $21.53.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The move appears to be a result of profit taking, since solana reached its highest point since May 6, this past Saturday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, it seems that sentiment is still somewhat bullish, as traders opted to reject a breakout below $20.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, the token is trading at $21.09, with the 10-day (red) moving average still upward facing.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Overall, the recent decline comes following a collision with a ceiling at $22.00.&#13;<br />
