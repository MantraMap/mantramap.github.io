<li>Tezos (XTZ) is up 2% in the last 24 hours as its price steadies near psychological $1 mark</li>
<li>A whole new level of scaling capabilities within the Tezos network and beyond are expected to be introduced with the Mumbai upgrade plan</li>
<li>This is one of the most <em>&#8220;transformative&#8221;</em> updates for the well-known proof-of-stake blockchain</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xtz-price-analysis-tezos-xtz-up-19-as-crypto-market-recovers-binance-us-announces-tezos-giveaway/">Tezos (XTZ)</a> is up 2% in the last 24 hours as its price steadies near psychological $1 mark. A whole new level of scaling capabilities within the Tezos network and beyond are expected to be introduced with the Mumbai upgrade plan, which was presented by Nomadic Labs, the top blockchain developer in the Tezos community. This is one of the most <em>&#8220;transformative&#8221;</em> updates for the well-known proof-of-stake blockchain, according to Tezos co-founder Arthur Breitman. The main features made public by Nomadic Labs include the activation of smart rollups, the introduction of Epoxy on Mainnet, which will further strengthen instant finality due to SNARKs proof-of-validity, a 15-second block time reduction, ticket transfers between accounts, and the addition of two new RPC endpoints for better visibility into ticket ownership. All of these improvements are anticipated to significantly increase scalability, resulting in more productive transactions and processing power for Tezos network users. The faster transaction assurance and extensive ticket transfer functionality between user accounts will both depend on the reduced block time feature.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $2.00, %1.50, $1.00<br />Support Levels: $0.92, $0.70, $0.500</p>

<p>Following a brief consolidation, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xtz-price-analysis-striking-rally-holds-back-beneath-4-43-on-xtz-usd-tezos-q2-growth-remains-positive-on-etoro/">XTZ/USD</a> recorded a mild retracement after breaking above the $1.00 barrier to approach daily moving average (MA 200). The near-term oscillators are supporting the move higher, with the RSI strengthening inside the bullish zone despite the lack of confirmation of overbought conditions. <br /><br />If buying demand remains strong, initial resistance might come from the $1.50 level before the bulls target the $2.0 handle. If the price falls below the psychological level of $1.00 and approaches the previous range low of $0.70, a critical support zone could form between the $0.70 and the daily MA 50 at $0.90. Tezos aims to return to an ascending trend pattern.</p>

<p>XTZ/USD recorded fresh selling above the 4-hour moving average (MA 50) near the $1.08 level, extending its retracement impulse to a new low of $0.964 on Wednesday. The market&#8217;s enthusiasm pushed the RSI into the overbought zone, while the indicator showed no symptoms of weakness. <br /><br />Currently, the price appears to be under pressure near the $0.950 mark. If the bulls take that level, the path to $1.50 and $2.00 will open up. Higher, the surge could go to the $2.50 level. On the downside, initial constraints may arise near $0.90, a break of which may result in some consolidation near the MA 200 at $0.825. The $0.70 low and the neighboring MA 200 at $0.825 may also be important levels to monitor.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/10/ethereum-software-firm-consensys-to-cut-upwards-of-100-staff-as-crypto-bear-market-takes-another-casualty/">ConsenSys</a>, the founder of MetaMask and an Ethereum development company, has revealed plans to lay off 11% of its personnel. CEO Joseph Lubin confirmed the decision in a blog post today.<br /><br />ConsenSys will lay off 97 employees as part of its attempts to fight <em>&#8220;challenging and uncertain market conditions,&#8221;</em> according to Lubin. Furthermore, the decision continues a pattern that has been prevalent in 2023, as companies prepare for a likely economic recession.<br /><br />Although it is only about a month into 2023, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cryptocurrency-hacks-increase-as-north-korea-focuses-on-defi/">cryptocurrency sector</a> has already seen several ups and downs. Prices of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have rebounded from the disastrous 2022, which harmed the sector. Despite this, Bitcoin companies have shed 27,000 positions since April 2022.<br /><br />That figure is about to rise, as ConsenSy announced plans to lay off 11% of its workforce in a blog post by CEO Joseph Lubin.<em> “Today we need to make the extremely difficult decision to streamline some of ConsenSys’ teams to adjust to challenging and uncertain market conditions,”</em> Lubin said.<br /><br />Furthermore, <em>“This decision will impact a total of 97 employees, which represents 11% of ConsenSys’ total workforce.”</em> Furthermore, the post noted that departing employees had access to severance compensation based on tenure, with an exercise window ranging from 12 to 36 months. ConsenSys, on the other hand, is providing<em> “personalized support from an external placement agency and extension of healthcare benefits in relevant jurisdictions.”</em></p>

<p>Amid a legal battle with the SEC, cryptocurrency startup Genesis is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/crypto-firm-genesis-said-to-prepare-bankruptcy-filing-as-soon-as-this-week">considering filing</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The firm has been involved in a dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which charged it last week with marketing unregistered securities.<br /><br />The conflict between Genesis and Gemini has been a major headline in 2023, culminating with last week&#8217;s allegations. Following the circumstances of the past month, Genesis appears to be obliged to seek Chapter 11 protection.<br /><br />This month, the platform has been a consistent narrative in the cryptocurrency world. Following a 30% layoff in early January and its well-publicized struggle with the SEC and Gemini. Genesis, a Bitcoin lender, has now been forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/gemini-and-genesis-hit-with-sec-charges-for-earn-program-violations/">Gemini</a> has publicly attacked Genesis, which is owned by the Digital Currency Group and Barry Silbert. Publicly declaring the cryptocurrency firm&#8217;s accounting irregularities and deceptive actions concerning its former collaborator. All of this followed the two platforms&#8217; collaboration in February 2021, which resulted in the SEC&#8217;s allegations last week.<br /><br />Gary Gensler and the regulatory body both charged both platforms with selling unregistered securities. As a result, it is also tied to the collaboratively designed Gemini Earn program.<br /><br />The cryptocurrency startup is now said to be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week. Furthermore, Bloomberg claims that the company has been in <em>&#8220;confidential negotiations with various creditor groups amid liquidity crunch.&#8221;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an interview with CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Squawk Box Europe&#8221; on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed his hopes for Ripple’s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. <br /><br />A decision should come <em>&#8220;sometime in the coming single digit months,&#8221;</em> maybe as soon as June, Garlinghouse says on the lawsuit. He continued by saying that although he is still open to the idea, he doesn&#8217;t think the company will settle the case.<br /><br />According to Garlinghouse,<em> “We have always said that we would love to settle, but it requires one very important thing, and that is that, on a going-forward basis, it’s clear that XRP is not a security.”</em><br /><br /><em>&#8220;The SEC and Gary Gensler have publicly said that they consider practically all cryptocurrencies to be securities. In the Venn diagram, that leaves very little room for settlement’’.</em><br /><br />If<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-might-be-the-next-big-thing-in-2023-here-are-five-reasons-per-santiment/"> XRP</a> is declared to be a security, Ripple may be subject to far harsher restrictions with regard to the token. This could include demands for better investor protections and transparency disclosures, similar to those imposed on registered broker-dealers.<br /><br />It might also serve as a model for numerous other blockchain and cryptocurrency projects that might later be categorized as securities.</p>
<h2>Expectations remain</h2>
<p>According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and General Counsel Stuart Alderoty, a ruling on the action is anticipated in the first half of 2023. <br /><br />According to James K. Filan, the decision could be made in March 2023 or earlier. Stuart Alderoty believes that the decision, whenever it is announced, will have a significant impact on the development of cryptocurrencies in the US.<br /><br />Bloomberg presents some observers&#8217; viewpoints. According to Joseph Hall, a partner at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell who served as an SEC employee from 2003 to 2005, &#8220;the recent upheaval in the crypto markets might taint the court&#8217;s view.&#8221; You simply have to assume that the judge&#8217;s decision might be impacted by the investment losses they have witnessed, according to Hall.<br /><br /><em>‘’And the SEC will make it obvious to them that if they opt for a different decision, they won&#8217;t have the tools they need to stop this kind of activity’’.</em><br /><br />Even if Ripple wins, it might not be the ticker-tape celebration that cryptocurrency enthusiasts are hoping for, according to Andrew Stoltmann, a securities lawsuit attorney based in Chicago.<br /><br />According to Stoltmann, <em>&#8220;I anticipate Congress will step in over the above and essentially decide who gets jurisdiction with regard to enforcement.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Coinbase Global Inc., an American publicly traded trading platform, has been named in a new<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/koqcuqyj47fvhlv/AADXxp8HCyvwKFQtd1wws_WVa?dl=0&amp;preview=001_2023.01.13_complaint.pdf"> class action lawsuit</a> for failing to provide two airdrops including Flare Network&#8217;s native token, FLR, and the accompanying Songbird (SGB) token. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.<br /><br />According to the case filed by HODL LAW CALI, the plaintiff&#8217;s attorney, Dallas Woody, and anyone who may join in, Coinbase has broken its agreement to participate in the Flare Network airdrop, which it promised in December 2021. According to the lawsuit, the Flare Network airdrop was supposed to be dispersed to every XRP holder based on a snapshot of account balances. <br /><br />The terms noted that the Songbird token would be distributed first, followed by the deposit of FLR tokens for all users. According to the lawsuit, despite receiving distribution of both SGB and FLR tokens before the latter&#8217;s distribution on January 9 of this year, the trading platform has refused to give it to all qualified clients.<br /><br />As seen in the lawsuit, rival exchanges have transferred their received FLR and SGB tokens to eligible users, and Coinbase&#8217;s delay or failure to do so on time has cost clients some money. The defendant is requesting that the court order Coinbase to credit customers&#8217; tokens and compensate them for any losses they may have suffered.<br /><br />The<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/flare-networks-to-bridge-ripple-and-ethereum-ecosystems/"> Flare Network</a> airdrop has recently become one of the most acclaimed in the digital currency industry, with several trading firms expressing support. Despite the participation of exchanges such as Binance, the Flare Token experienced a large drop as many beneficiaries sold the tokens as soon as they received them.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-acknowledges-busd-peg-issues-says-not-always-been-fully-backed/"> Binance</a> is still aiming to lower the total number of BNB in circulation to 100 million. To accomplish this, the firm announced the completion of the 22nd burn of its native token.<br /><br />According to Binance&#8217;s statement, it has pulled 2.064 million BNB from circulation, which is worth over $620 million at today&#8217;s prices.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1615272723885727745"> 22nd burn</a> was the largest in terms of BNB tokens since the record-breaking 14th two years ago.

Binance&#8217;s native crypto, like the rest of the market, has been on a run since the beginning of the year. It began in 2023 at roughly $240 but quickly skyrocketed by double digits.<br /><br />This resulted in a rise of $315 on Saturday, marking the highest price for BNB since late November 2022. Barring a modest retracement, the asset is currently trading above $300.</p>

<ul>
<li>Chiliz (CHZ) is up 20.5% in the past seven days at $0.136</li>
<li>The 10,000,000th transaction on the Chiliz Scoville Testnet has been surpassed</li>
<li>Users can now own the game-scored balls from the SerieA Super Cup</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/chz-price-analysis-chiliz-price-jumps-15-in-week-amid-fresh-wave-of-hype-ahead-of-fifa-world-cup-2022/">Chiliz (CHZ)</a> is up 20.5% in the past seven days at $0.136, but trades down at 1.49% in the last 24 hours. Chilizle Chain 2.0 has reached a new milestone ahead of its release. In a Twitter announcement, the 10,000,000th transaction on the Chiliz Scoville Testnet has been surpassed. In March 2022, Chiliz announced the launch of <em>&#8220;Scoville,&#8221;</em> the public testnet for Chiliz Chain 2.0 and the first Layer-1 blockchain created especially for the sports and entertainment industries. Developed in collaboration with Ankr, a leading provider of decentralized infrastructure, CC2 is EVM compatible with gas fees up to 200x cheaper than ETH. In a move that is deemed the world’s first, users can now own the game-scored balls from the Serie A Super Cup as the Socios collectibles launch. According to the announcement, only fan token holders will be able to win the real balls from the goals. The first drop gives fans a chance to own a game-scored ball from the EA Sports Super Cup Final between AC Milan and Inter. The EA Sports Supercup final paves the way for the first-ever Socios.com collectibles, and its final will be played on Wednesday, January 18.</p>
<p><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.2400, $0.2000, $0.1500<br />Support Levels: $0.1000, $0.0761, $0.0500</p>
<h4>CHZ/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p>Chiliz (CHZ) achieved a daily high of $0.1443 in the prior week before retracing to $0.1314 on Monday as bulls aim to convert this $0.1500 zone into support ahead of a move higher. A break of the moving average (MA 200) threshold near $0.1700 could provide market players with the impetus needed to move the pair higher. Daily, the RSI indicator is currently above 60, indicating a buy signal.<br /><br />If the market confirms overbought conditions, a minor retreat is not out of the question shortly. This, however, may present a buy-the-dip opportunity. In the event of a pullback below the moving average (MA 500), the $0.1000 might provide quick support to the CHZ price. Otherwise, the bears may target the $0.076 low if they continue to push lower in unfamiliar terrain.</p>

<p>On the 4-hour chart, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/chz-price-analysis-chiliz-rebounds-from-lows-fc-barcelona-fan-token-powered-by-chiliz-goes-live-on-binance/">CHZ/USD</a> pair is rising in a positive trend. It&#8217;s upside resistance is yet to be broken, as the CHZ price is rising. A break over the $0.1500 barrier should signal a continued rise toward the $0.200 level. Otherwise, if the price retraces to the psychological level of $0.100, we may witness another push to the low, impacting the current trend negatively.<br /><br />If the price continues to fall, the $0.076 level may provide support. Only a break below this support would give bears greater momentum to target the $0.05 level. Overall, Chiliz is still on the rise, aided by good fundamentals in the fan token sector. A retreat may produce a consolidation pattern before the continuation of the trend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/polygonhederatron-see-large-scale-adoption-from-countries-heres-how-they-are-being-utilized/">Polygon,</a> an Ethereum scaling solution, will hard fork its proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain to handle gas spikes and chain reorganization. The proposed hard fork is scheduled for January 17. It said in a <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/hardfork-incoming-upgrading-polygon-pos-chain-to-boost-performance">blog post</a> that it will modify its software to solve gas spikes and chain reorganizations (reorgs).<br /><br />The first phase of the hard fork will involve a change in how the blockchain calculates gas fees. Gas fees are a type of tax paid to a blockchain to transact on it. Polygon&#8217;s goal with the fork is to decrease gas price spikes that might occur when there is a lot of activity on the chain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although gas will still increase during peak demand, it will be more in line with the way Ethereum gas dynamics work now. The goal is to smooth out spikes and ensure a more seamless experience when interacting with the chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Polygon said that a reduction in gas fee spikes will be achieved by doubling the value of the “BaseFeeChangeDenominator,” which the company says will “help smooth out the increase or decrease rate of the baseFee for when the gas exceeds or falls below the target gas limits in a block.” The project believes the modification will be successful as it backtested such changes “against historical Polygon PoS mainnet data.”<br /><br />The second suggested portion of the hard fork will deal with reorgs, which can happen when a validator node—a computer that runs the blockchain—receives information that can temporarily generate a new version of the blockchain. Reorganizations might occur as a result of network faults or malicious activities. A reorg can result in lost or duplicate transactions for as long as it lasts.<br /><br />To address this issue, Polygon aims to minimize the time it takes to finish a block to validate a successful transaction, and the hard fork will cut Polygon&#8217;s &#8220;sprint length&#8221; from 64 to 16 blocks, implying that a block producer can create blocks for a considerably shorter period.<br /><br />Hard forks differ from soft forks in that they are not backward-compatible and will require all network node operators to update to the most recent software at a predetermined period. To prepare for the hard fork, all Polygon node operators will need to upgrade their nodes before the scheduled date. Holders of Polygon&#8217;s native token, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-matic-moves-near-1-bitpay-announces-support-for-polygon-making-it-available-for-merchants/">MATIC</a>, will not be affected and will not need to take any action. Decentralized apps, such as Web3 games, will be unaffected and will not need to take any action.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-miners-secure-1-09-billion-mining-revenue-in-january/">Bitcoin miners</a> were impacted in 2022. Several mining giants were knocked off by what appeared to be a year of adequate capital for expansion, high energy prices, increasing competition, and a bear market.<br /><br />After a slumber, Bitcoin miners have returned, with mining difficulty increased by more than 10%, from 34.09 trillion to 37.59 trillion, according to data provided by <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">BTC.com</a>.<br /><br />Following the news, f2pool, a major participant in the industry, <a href="https://twitter.com/f2pool_official/status/1614832488370798592">tweeted</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bitcoin mining difficulty increased by 10.26%, to an ATH! In this 2-week cycle, If BTC can go up above $23,000, machines that are more efficient than 40W/T can be running with profits at the electricity of $0.08/kWh.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statistic that defines how difficult it is to mine a Bitcoin block comes during a bullish reversal in the market behavior of the digital asset.<br /><br />Bitcoin, which is currently trading at $21,175, has managed to recoup losses from the two-month-old collapse of Sam Bankman&#8217;s crypto Fried&#8217;s empire. The next difficulty modification is expected in two weeks, which could result in a tiny decrease of 0.02%, at least for the time being.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bitcoin&#8217;s mining hash rate achieved two new highs in only two weeks, although bankrupt miner Core Scientific turned off 9,000 ASICs in December.</p>
<p>This trend could indicate that hash is shifting from weak to powerful hands. Bitcoin&#8217;s hash rate is now sitting around 271.86 EH/s.</p>
<p>In terms of mining pool distribution, Foundry USA has the largest share with 35.5%, followed by AntPool (20.9%), Binance Pool (12.3%), and f2pool (10.4%), among others.</p>

</ul>
<p>In the past seven days, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has increased by up to 22%, propelled by an improving macroeconomic outlook and growing interest in Ethereum&#8217;s planned <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-devs-move-ahead-with-shanghai-upgrade-to-enable-withdrawals-bitcoin-still-weak-analyst-plan-b-says/">Shanghai upgrade.</a> ETH was marginally up in the last 24 hours at $1,545. The Total Value of the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract has just reached an ATH of 16,042,407 ETH, according to Glassnode data. Now, all eyes are on Ethereum&#8217;s upcoming significant upgrade, known as the<em> &#8220;Shanghai hard fork,&#8221;</em> which is anticipated to occur in March and will enable users of the network to access ether (ETH) they had staked on the blockchain but have been unable to access for months. In December, it was decided to move forward with Shanghai. According to a statement by Messari research analyst Kunal Goel, the total quantity of ethereum staked might probably rise after Shanghai. Crypto trader Thomas Kralow claims that if the Shanghai upgrade is successful, it will pave the groundwork for proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844, which would make Ethereum more scalable through sharding, later this year. In the weeks leading up to its March hard fork, Ethereum on-chain data shows a significant increase in the number of Ether shark addresses.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels:$2,300 $2,000, $1,700<br />Support Levels: $1,500, $1,300, $1,000</p>
<h4>ETH/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63979 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-15.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-15.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-15-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-15-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-15-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-15-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-15-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETH/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-sees-another-bull-favoring-element-as-on-chain-analytics-indicate-increased-blockchain-activity/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> traded in an upside range throughout the week as both volatility and volume increased significantly. To sustain a string of higher lows and higher highs, ETH/USD must keep today&#8217;s daily candle above the $1,500 level of support while the recovery from $1,200 continues to move higher. If this is not done, downside price goals of $1,300 and $1,200 might be attempted.<br /><br />The bull market started when a daily close occurred above $1,300, while the $1,200 low was more of a bear trap than a negative reversal. If bears return to the market, the decline should be contained to the first downward support level at $1,300. Investors&#8217; attention will be on closing much above the $1,500 level today.</p>
<h4>ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bullish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63980 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-15.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-15.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-15-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-15-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-15-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-15-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-15-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>ETH/USD has broken above the $1,500 resistance line, which has since turned into short-term support, far above the 4-hour moving average (MA 50 &amp; MA 200). Given that the pair&#8217;s relative strength index indicator remains above its 80 overbought regions. Despite signs of an overbought market in the near term, most investors prefer to maintain a positive outlook for ETH.<br /><br />If selling pressure picks up again, the pair may try to reach, if not break, the $1,300 support level, while a higher break may see Ether smash the $2,000 psychological barrier and open the door for the $2,500 barrier. Overall, only a successful break of the target at $2,000 might sustain the present bullish sentiment among traders.</p>
