<p>Despite the recent lawsuit against Binance that accuses them of selling unregistered securities, XRP remains unnamed, and pro-crypto lawyers are still anticipating a win in the SEC vs Ripple.&nbsp; Solana&rsquo;s charts show bullish potential, although SOL is one of the coins that may be affected by the SEC.&nbsp; Tradecurve, currently in presale, recognises the growing problems of regulation in the US and offers a solution for traders around the world.</p>

Ripple lawyers remain confident of a win
<p>The crypto market reels from the latest Binance lawsuit from the SEC, that could see coins such as SOL, ADA, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI as securities. However Ripple is notably absent from the lawsuit, adding strength to Ripple lawyer John Deaton&rsquo;s argument that XRP will not be declared a security.</p>
<p>Deaton now anticipates that the case will come to a close around the end of September.&nbsp; He expects either an outright win, or the potential that a cut off line will be drawn that allows Ripple to officially not be a security.</p>
<p>He also predicted a potential price for the XRP token assuming that the outcome is favorable, saying that &ldquo;I certainly believe that somewhere between $2 and $10 is reasonable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Solana is named in the SEC vs Binance lawsuit.
<p>Although Solana has been demonstrating bullish potential from a technical analysis point of view, the recent Binance lawsuit names Solana&rsquo;s coin SOL in the lawsuit, as an unregistered security.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t the first lawsuit that Binance have faced, and similarly to the XRP vs Ripple case, the judgment could go either way.</p>
<p>Still it&rsquo;s not great news for the layer 1 chain, and Solana&rsquo;s price has fallen by 7% over the last 24 hours, currently trading at around $20 per coin.</p>
<p>Solana and the other tokens and coins named in the lawsuit, may take comfort in the words of John Deaton, who believes that it may be possible for future redemption even if they do get named as securities. This is because once cryptocurrencies like Solana achieve a significant level of decentralization, there is a possibility that they could transition from being classified as securities to being recognized as commodities.</p>

Is Tradecurve the answer to regulatory woes?
<p>As the US continues to pursue aggressive anti crypto regulations, in what Nic Carter sees as a concerted effort to de-platform crypto from the banking system, the need for regulation free platforms increases.&nbsp; This could be where Tradecurve gets its chance to shine, offering a borderless and KYC trading platform that combines the financial products of TradFi, including commodities, stocks and bonds, and of course, crypto.</p>
<p>Tradecurve are based in St Vincent and Kitts where offering these products are legal.&nbsp; Tradecurve follows Binance and other exchanges such as Gemini, who are increasingly looking to move their operations outside of the US.</p>
<p>Tradecurve&rsquo;s token is TCRV, and is currently in stage 3 of presale.&nbsp; TCRV is changing hands at $0.015 and will launch at a minimum price of $0.088.&nbsp; Experts are predicting a rise as big as 1000x once it is listed on Uniswap and tier 1 CEXes.</p>
