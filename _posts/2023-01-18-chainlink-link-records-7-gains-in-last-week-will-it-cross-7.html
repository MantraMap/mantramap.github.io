The total value of transactions, its oracle service, exceeded $6.9 trillion. Also, the network provided users with data feeds that extend across new blockchains and layer 2. Another innovation driving the price is the Chainlink proof of reserve. The collapse of FTX created distrust in the industry. This distrust prompted the increased demand for Proof of Reserves. Chainlink&#8217;s Proof of Reserve has become popular among stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide their customers with transparency. The adoption has also aided the LINK price increase. Also, the launch of Web3 solution Chainlink Economics 2.0 has created a framework for the network&#8217;s core interests; Chainlink BUILD, SCALE, and Staking. Chainlink’s BUILD and SCALE enable users to build Web3 dApps. Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink&#8217;s co-founder, stated that the crisis in traditional finance creates opportunities for blockchain technology to fortify crypto as an alternative financial system. Chainlink Price Prediction Chainlink LINK has enjoyed a positive rally in the past week. The asset is currently trading at $6.50 as it approaches the $7 mark. The support levels are $6.27, $6.44, and $6.64, while the resistance levels are $7.01, $7.18, and $7.37. LINK is close to its first resistance level, but the uptrend might pull back as the bearish candles begin to form on the chart. The asset is currently above its 50-day Simple Moving average and approaching its 200-day SMA. This suggests bullish momentum for LINK in the short term. However, expect a pullback before it continues its surge.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 65.73 is slightly into the buy zone but not in the overbought region. It reflects the current market condition as the bears struggle to push down the asset&#8217;s price. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is above its signal line and shows divergence, which is a bullish signal.
