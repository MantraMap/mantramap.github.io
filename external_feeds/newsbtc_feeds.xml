					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is struggling to clear the $27,500 resistance zone. BTC is sliding and there could be a sharp decline toward $25,550 in the coming sessions. Bitcoin is still struggling to stay above the $27,000 support zone. The price is trading below $27,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $27,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could revisit the $26,550 support and might continue to decline. Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance Bitcoin price started a minor upside correction from the $26,550 support zone. BTC climbed above the $27,000 resistance zone and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $28,450 swing high to the $26,571 low. However, the bears were active near the $27,500 resistance zone. There was no convincing move above the $27,350 resistance zone. Bitcoin price stayed below the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $28,450 swing high to the $26,571 low. It is now trading below $27,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $27,200 level and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The next major resistance is near the $27,350 level. The main resistance sits near the $27,500 level. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com An upside break and close above $27,500 could start a decent increase toward $28,000. Any more gains above the $28,000 resistance zone might send the price toward the $28,500 resistance zone. If there is a close above the $28,500 resistance, there could be a move toward the $30,000 resistance zone in the near term. More Losses in BTC? If Bitcoin’s price fails to clear the $27,350 resistance, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $26,800 level. The next major support is near the $26,550 zone, below which the price might start a strong decline. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $25,500 support in the coming sessions. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $26,800, followed by $26,550. Major Resistance Levels – $27,200, $27,350, and $27,500.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tron (TRX), the native cryptocurrency of the Tron blockchain, witnessed a substantial increase over the weekend. The token spiked by 10% yesterday, buoyed by recent developments within its ecosystem.  However, at the time of writing, it has experienced a slight correction, but all signs show that this could be a bullish signal.  Tron Spike Due To Bittorent Bridge Launch  The reason behind this latest surge can be attributed to the recent launch of the BitTorrent Bridge platform, which now allows users to seamlessly transfer their TRX tokens between the Tron blockchain and Ethereum. Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, confirmed this development on the morning of June 2. The BitTorrent Bridge serves as a decentralized system that facilitates token interoperability across different blockchain networks. Developed by the Tron organization under the leadership of Justin Sun, this platform strengthens the collaborative efforts between BitTorrent and Tron. A notable instance of their collaboration is the BitTorrent Live streaming service, which was launched in 2019 and operates in conjunction with Tron&#8217;s system. Related Reading: Quant Hype Spikes As Price Surges 15% – Is This A Top Signal? The integration between TRON and Ethereum through the BitTorrent Bridge opens up new possibilities for TRX users while enhancing the interoperability between these prominent blockchains. This breakthrough expands Tron&#8217;s presence within the Ethereum ecosystem and has the potential to drive greater adoption of TRX among Ethereum users. It is important to note that TRX initially existed as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network before being migrated to the TRON main network in mid-2018. Since then, Tron has grown into one of the biggest blockchains and currently processes 40% of USDT transactions.  Related Reading: XRP Climbs 12% As Crypto Celebrates 11-Year Milestone Tron Price Analysis  Analyzing Tron&#8217;s current price performance, the coin is currently trading at $0.0805. Moreover, Tron has the potential to maintain its position above the moving averages. If the resistance level of $0.085 is breached, it could serve as a catalyst for a bullish trend, potentially leading to further price gains. The market sentiment appears optimistic as buyers continue to demonstrate a strong commitment. Based on the daily chart analysis, another upward movement in the market price is possible. Therefore, if Tron surpasses the channel&#8217;s upper boundary, it could further reinforce the market and reach resistance levels of $0.095, $0.100, and $0.105, respectively. Conversely, there is a chance of a downward correction, with the support level of $0.082 being a potential target. However, if sellers gain momentum, traders should anticipate a further decline towards support levels of $0.075, $0.070, and $0.065, respectively. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (14), a technical indicator, is currently situated in the overbought region, indicating the possibility of the bullish trend continuing. Tron&#8217;s price against Bitcoin maintains its position above the 9-day and 21-day moving averages, indicating a potential move towards the resistance level of 330 SAT. However, this resistance level is anticipated to be convincingly surpassed, leading to a market price that closes above it. -Featured image from Invezz, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Optimism is gearing up for its eventual mainnet upgrade next week. This upgrade will offer lower protocol and security fees for users on the platform. This led to the ecosystem’s governance token, OP, enjoying an increase in price, albeit a modest 3.7% in the past 24 hours. This price movement only came after last month’s dismal performance where OP dropped by over 30% in the monthly timeframe. With the promise of lower fees along with Ethereum-like security for the coming upgrade, we might see OP continue its present bullishness.

<p>The token’s current support at $1.3 has no backing which could pull OP to the sub-$1 range. If this happens, OP bulls should be able to endure a possible drop to $0.5 support. But the current momentum held by the token is enough for investors to confidently target higher highs in the coming days.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Quant (QNT), an Ethereum-based token, has experienced a 15.15% increase in its price over the past seven days. QNT plays a vital role in Quant Network&#8217;s Overledger, a suite of enterprise software solutions designed to connect public blockchains and private networks seamlessly. By enabling the creation of multi-chain decentralized applications (mDapps), Quant Network empowers developers to build and operate applications that span across multiple blockchains simultaneously. With its focus on interoperability, Quant Network&#8217;s Overledger solution provides a framework for bridging different blockchain networks, fostering connectivity and facilitating efficient data exchange between disparate systems. The use of QNT within the Overledger ecosystem not only powers these interoperability capabilities but also plays a crucial role in securing and incentivizing participants within the network. As the price of Quant (QNT) continues its upward trajectory, the growing interest in the token reflects the recognition of its importance in enabling the seamless operation of mDapps and facilitating cross-chain communication. With Quant Network&#8217;s innovative approach to interoperability, the future holds promising possibilities for enhanced collaboration and integration across various blockchain platforms. Related Reading: Injective Protocol (INJ) Tallies 23% Price Surge In Past 7 Days – Here’s Why Why’s There A Strong Bullish Sentiment For QNT?  The recent price surge of Quant (QNT) can be attributed to the transformative power of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and the unique features offered by the Quant platform.

					<description><![CDATA[Arbitrum (ARB), a prominent governance token in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, recently witnessed a decent surge in price following renewed buying activity from a well-known DeFi whale address.  Large-scale investors often influence market sentiment and can significantly impact the price of a given asset. However, as the rally unfolds, questions arise about the sustainability of this upward momentum and its implications for the future of Arbitrum. Related Reading: Floki Inu Gains Momentum As Chinese E-Commerce Giant Recognizes Its Utility Whale’s Unusual Buying Activity Coincides With ARB’s Rally Arbitrum&#8217;s (ARB) current price of $1.24 on CoinMarketCap highlights its remarkable performance, with a noteworthy 3.4% rally witnessed within the past 24 hours, followed by an impressive seven-day climb of 7%. Interestingly, this surge in value coincided with unusual buying activity associated with renowned trader Andrew Kang&#8217;s crypto addresses. Source: CoinMarketCap Particularly noteworthy is the fact that Andrew Kang, co-founder of Mechanism Capital, has been making some interesting movements within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Kang put $1 million worth of stablecoins into Arbitrum pools and allocated nearly a quarter of the funds to the purchase of RDNT tokens. RDNT is the native token of the DeFi lending platform Radiant Capital. BTCUSD currently trading at $27,150 on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: XRP $1 Threshold On The Horizon? Noted Trader Fuels Speculation After filling his bags with RDNT, Kang subsequently exchanged his newly acquired tokens and existing RDNT reserves for $867,000 worth of ARB. These transactions were further followed by Kang depositing the proceeds into Radiant Capital, where he borrowed Circle&#8217;s USD Coin. These details have been revealed through data obtained from Lookonchain, a reliable data resource. Seems like Andrew Kang is using leverage to go long $ARB on @RDNTCapital. Buy $ARB → Deposit $ARB → Borrow $USDC → Buy $ARBhttps://t.co/PQwi0Zj9TT pic.twitter.com/afXjeRtTpv — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 2, 2023 Multiple Whales Seize Opportunity As ARB Price Improves In addition to Kang&#8217;s intriguing buying activity, another significant player, known by the address &#8220;0xf59b,&#8221; has also recognized the potential in ARB&#8217;s upward trajectory. This whale made a strategic move by depositing 1.2 million ARB tokens, equivalent to $1.5 million, into the popular cryptocurrency exchange OKX. Whale&#8221;0xf59b&#8221; finally waited for the rise of $ARB and deposited 1.2M $ARB ($1.5M) into #OKX 30 minutes ago. He withdrew 1.2M $ARB from #OKX on May 8th, and the buying price may be around $1.2.https://t.co/cJReZfg007 pic.twitter.com/jFwBRtPUpK — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 2, 2023 This whale&#8217;s decision to pull the tokens out from OKX on May 8 and potentially purchase them at around the $1.2 mark suggests a deliberate strategy of waiting for a price increase before taking advantage of their holdings. By carefully timing their actions, this entity sought to maximize their potential gains as ARB&#8217;s value climbed. These recent large-scale investments signify a growing optimism surrounding Arbitrum&#8217;s Layer 2 solution, despite the challenges it has faced in the market recently. The renewed interest from both Kang and the whale behind the address &#8220;0xf59b&#8221; reflects a belief in the long-term viability and potential profitability of ARB. Furthermore, these strategic moves by multiple whales indicate a broader sentiment within the crypto market. As the Ethereum network gradually recovers from the recent drop, there is a growing expectation of increased activity on Layer 2 networks. This anticipation sets the stage for a potentially bullish cycle for these networks, including Arbitrum. (This site&#8217;s content should not be construed as investment advice.

<h2><strong>Multiple Whales Seize Opportunity As ARB Price Improves</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to Kang&#8217;s intriguing buying activity, another significant player, known by the address &#8220;0xf59b,&#8221; has also recognized the potential in ARB&#8217;s upward trajectory. This whale made a strategic move by depositing <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1664569055746093060" rel="nofollow">1.2 million ARB tokens</a>, equivalent to $1.5 million, into the popular cryptocurrency exchange OKX.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Whale&#8221;0xf59b&#8221; finally waited for the rise of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$ARB</a> and deposited 1.2M <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$ARB</a> ($1.5M) into <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OKX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#OKX</a> 30 minutes ago.</p>

<p>This whale&#8217;s decision to pull the tokens out from OKX on May 8 and potentially purchase them at around the $1.2 mark suggests a deliberate strategy of waiting for a price increase before taking advantage of their holdings. By carefully timing their actions, this entity sought to maximize their potential gains as ARB&#8217;s value climbed.</p>
<p>These recent large-scale investments signify a growing optimism surrounding <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/blockchain/what-is-arbitrum" rel="nofollow">Arbitrum&#8217;s Layer 2 solution</a>, despite the challenges it has faced in the market recently. The renewed interest from both Kang and the whale behind the address &#8220;0xf59b&#8221; reflects a belief in the long-term viability and potential profitability of ARB.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these strategic moves by multiple whales indicate a broader sentiment within the crypto market. As the Ethereum network gradually recovers from the recent drop, there is a growing expectation of increased activity on Layer 2 networks. This anticipation sets the stage for a potentially bullish cycle for these networks, including Arbitrum.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Celsius, a popular lending platform, has made significant moves in staking Ethereum (ETH) as they stake almost $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. According to the Blockchain intelligence company Arkham Intel, In the past 24 hours alone, Celsius has staked over $600 million worth of ETH, with no signs of slowing down. This represents a massive on-chain flow, and the rate of deposits continues to increase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Becoming Greener At An Unexpected Pace, Good For BTC Price? Celsius Goes All-In On ETH Celsiu&#8217;s address was the largest withdrawer when Lido (LDO) opened withdrawals in mid-May, withdrawing over 400,000 ETH, worth $800 million. They held this ETH in the &#8216;Unstaking&#8217; wallet for two weeks, declaring their intent to stake with institutional provider Figment instead. Around 24 hours ago, Celsius separated the ETH from the unstaking wallet into two separate deposit wallets. One wallet is marked Celsius&#8217;s ETH2 Deposit wallet, while the other wallet is labelled &#8220;Staked ETH&#8221; and deposits to Figment. Celsius&#8217;s staking wallet has seen over $400 million worth of ETH inflows over the past 24 hours, with continual deposits made every few minutes. Figment is a staking and infrastructure provider for blockchain networks, including Ethereum. The company provides institutional-grade staking infrastructure and tools for investors and companies looking to participate in the proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. Furthermore, the infrastructure provider offers a range of staking services, including delegated staking, which allows investors to delegate their tokens to a validator node to generate rewards without having to run their own node. The company also provides a range of developer tools, APIs, and analytics to help users better understand and manage their staking activities. Morevoer, the wallet provided to Celsius by Figment has seen over $215 million worth of ETH. In total, Celsius has deposited over $600 million worth of ETH, with the Celsius Staking wallet still holding over $150 million worth of ETH, and around $60 million worth of ETH left in the wallet they used to unstake from Lido. This means that Celsius still has a significant amount of ETH that they can potentially stake with another provider or use for other purposes. It also highlights the confidence that Celsius has in the staking services provided by Figment, as they have entrusted them with a large amount of their ETH holdings. Celsius&#8217;s move to stake such a large amount of ETH is a testament to the growing trend of staking in the crypto market. With more investors looking for ways to earn passive income on their holdings, staking is becoming an increasingly popular option. As more companies like Celsius enter the market, it can be expected to see even more growth in the staking sector in the coming months and years. Ethereum Market Poised For Major Move On the other hand, crypto analyst Jackis has recently shared insights on the current state of the Ethereum market, stating that there is potential for things to get exciting very soon. Despite the market remaining stagnant over the past few weeks, Jackis believes that Ethereum could be gearing up for a major move. According to Jackis, Ethereum has broken out of its downtrend and has successfully retested the breakout demand. If the cryptocurrency manages to flip the $1,887 resistance level, then there could be nothing stopping it from retesting the yearly range high at $2030. If Ethereum manages to reach and surpass this level, it could potentially continue to climb higher, possibly even reaching new yearly highs later down the line. Related Reading: Bloomberg’s Senior Macro Strategist Predicts More Pain Ahead For Bitcoin At the time of writing, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading at $1,905, which represents a 2% surge in the last 24 hours. It is yet to be seen if Ethereum can consolidate above this key level to breach the psychological barrier of $2,000 and continue its upward trend.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celsius, a popular lending platform, has made significant moves in staking Ethereum (ETH) as they stake almost $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1664669447880048644?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According </a>to the Blockchain intelligence company Arkham Intel, In the past 24 hours alone, Celsius has staked over $600 million worth of ETH, with no signs of slowing down. This represents a massive on-chain flow, and the rate of deposits continues to increase.</p>

<h2>Celsius Goes All-In On ETH</h2>
<p>Celsiu&#8217;s address was the largest withdrawer when Lido (LDO) opened withdrawals in mid-May, withdrawing over 400,000 ETH, worth $800 million. They held this ETH in the &#8216;Unstaking&#8217; wallet for two weeks, declaring their intent to stake with institutional provider Figment instead.</p>
<p>Around 24 hours ago, Celsius separated the ETH from the unstaking wallet into two separate deposit wallets. One wallet is marked Celsius&#8217;s ETH2 Deposit wallet, while the other wallet is labelled &#8220;Staked ETH&#8221; and deposits to Figment. Celsius&#8217;s staking wallet has seen over $400 million worth of ETH inflows over the past 24 hours, with continual deposits made every few minutes.</p>

<p>Figment is a staking and infrastructure provider for blockchain networks, including Ethereum. The company provides institutional-grade staking infrastructure and tools for investors and companies looking to participate in the proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the infrastructure provider offers a range of staking services, including delegated staking, which allows investors to delegate their tokens to a validator node to generate rewards without having to run their own node. The company also provides a range of developer tools, APIs, and analytics to help users better understand and manage their staking activities.</p>
<p>Morevoer, the wallet provided to Celsius by Figment has seen over $215 million worth of ETH. In total, Celsius has deposited over $600 million worth of ETH, with the Celsius Staking wallet still holding over $150 million worth of ETH, and around $60 million worth of ETH left in the wallet they used to unstake from Lido.</p>
<p>This means that Celsius still has a significant amount of ETH that they can potentially stake with another provider or use for other purposes. It also highlights the confidence that Celsius has in the staking services provided by Figment, as they have entrusted them with a large amount of their ETH holdings.</p>
<p>Celsius&#8217;s move to stake such a large amount of ETH is a testament to the growing trend of staking in the crypto market. With more investors looking for ways to earn passive income on their holdings, staking is becoming an increasingly popular option. As more companies like Celsius enter the market, it can be expected to see even more growth in the staking sector in the coming months and years.</p>
Ethereum Market Poised For Major Move
<p>On the other hand, crypto analyst Jackis has recently shared <a href="https://twitter.com/i_am_jackis/status/1664568909993762816?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">insights </a>on the current state of the Ethereum market, stating that there is potential for things to get exciting very soon. Despite the market remaining stagnant over the past few weeks, Jackis believes that Ethereum could be gearing up for a major move.</p>
<p>According to Jackis, Ethereum has broken out of its downtrend and has successfully retested the breakout demand. If the cryptocurrency manages to flip the $1,887 resistance level, then there could be nothing stopping it from retesting the yearly range high at $2030.</p>
<p>If Ethereum manages to reach and surpass this level, it could potentially continue to climb higher, possibly even reaching new yearly highs later down the line.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading at $1,905, which represents a 2% surge in the last 24 hours. It is yet to be seen if Ethereum can consolidate above this key level to breach the psychological barrier of $2,000 and continue its upward trend.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, is going green, and the pace at which the network has reduced its carbon emissions in the past three years has been noted by climate activists. Nonetheless, how this could impact BTC prices and attract technology firms like Tesla, the electric automobile manufacturer, is yet to be seen. Carbon Emission Associated With Bitcoin Miners Rapidly Falling As of late May, on-chain data from Woonomic shared by Daniel Batten, a climate technology investor, and activist, noted that the amount of Carbon emission associated with Bitcoin mining has fallen by nearly 50% from 601g/kWh to 299g/kWh in three short years. It should be observed that the Bitcoin hash rate and prices have been rising steadily during this time. In the last quarter of 2021, the Bitcoin price soared to as high as $69,000 before collapsing to below $16,000 in November 2022. Although prices have since recovered, soaring to as high as $31,000 in April 2023, the hash rate has been steadily rising over the years.  In proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin and Litecoin, the hash rate relays the computing power dedicated to the network in real time. It is a variable that makes the network secure and robust against third-party attacks, and can also be used to gauge the pace at which the Bitcoin platform consumes energy. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Schwartz Reveals Insights Into AMM Trading Strategy Miners channel computing power as “hash rate” to secure the Bitcoin network. They need this to verify transactions in exchange for network rewards. The more the hash rate, the higher the chance of earning a block and, thus, the 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes.  However, the tough competition for the block rewards has been partly blamed for environmental degradation and carbon emissions from miners. To stay competitive, Bitcoin miners have to operate gear that is energy-intensive. Critics have always maintained that electricity powering them is from coal and other non-renewable sources. As of June 2, the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index shows that 105.23 TWh powers Bitcoin. It is the same amount of electricity consumed by Kazakhstan. The resulting Carbon emission, they add, stands at 58.69 Mt CO2, comparable to that emitted by Libya. However, data from the Bitcoin Mining Counsel, a group comprised of some of the largest BTC miners in the world, provides more insight into the cryptocurrency&#8217;s energy consumption after conducting a study on its members: (&#8230;) the members of the BMC (Bitcoin Mining Council) and participants in the survey are currently utilizing electricity with a 63.8% sustainable power mix. Based on this data, the global bitcoin mining industry’s sustainable electricity mix has improved marginally to 58.9% and remains one of the most sustainable industries globally. Will Green Mining Support BTC Prices? In that sense, Woonomic data coincides that emissions have fallen drastically over the last three years. It has nearly halved to 299g/kWh, suggesting miners switched to greener energy sources to power their rigs.

Earlier, Tesla reneged on their decision to accept BTC for payment, citing the impact of Bitcoin mining on the environment. With Carbon emissions decreasing, this could positively impact BTC as major entities worldwide will embrace the coin and network. Feature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView]]></description>
