The cryptocurrency also tops the global investment bank&#x2019;s list as the asset with the highest risk-adjusted return &#x2014; above gold, real estate, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Outshines Other Investments on Goldman&#x2019;s Chart</h2>
<p>Global investment bank Goldman Sachs has reportedly ranked bitcoin the best-performing asset year-to-date (YTD). The Twitter account Documenting Bitcoin <a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1617594072280989698">tweeted</a> earlier this week:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is the best performing asset in the world this year, according to latest data by Goldman Sachs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The tweet includes a market performance chart by Goldman Sachs showing the top 25 markets&#x2019; total returns as well as their year-to-date risk-adjusted returns.</p>
<p>Bitcoin tops the total return list at 27%, followed by MSCI Emerging Markets Index at 8%. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> also tops Goldman Sachs&#x2019; risk-adjusted return list, with a Sharpe Ratio of 3.1. The price of bitcoin has risen since the firm published its chart. At the time of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is trading at $23,130, up more than 39% so far this year.</p>


<p>Gold, which many people have compared bitcoin to as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, ranked several places below <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on both the total and the risk-adjusted return lists. The metal has a total return of 6% year-to-date and a Sharpe Ratio of 2, according to Goldman&#x2019;s chart. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates that the investment has yielded higher returns for a given level of risk.</p>
<p>However, Goldman Sachs said in December last year that gold is a better &#x201C;portfolio diversifier&#x201D; than <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> since it is likely to be less influenced by tighter financial conditions. Furthermore, the bank&#x2019;s analysts believe that gold has developed non-speculative use cases while bitcoin is still looking for one.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has been in the crypto space for several years. The firm formally <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/goldman-sachs-bitcoin-trading-desk-crypto-market-mature/">established</a> a cryptocurrency trading desk in May 2021. In January last year, the investment bank predicted that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> could reach <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/goldman-sachs-predicts-bitcoin-100k-btc-take-golds-market-share-store-of-value/">$100,000</a> as the crypto continues to take gold&#x2019;s market share. Last year, Goldman Sachs executed its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/goldman-sachs-executes-banks-first-otc-crypto-transaction-trading-a-bitcoin-non-deliverable-option/">first OTC crypto transaction</a>, offered its first <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/global-investment-bank-goldman-sachs-offers-its-first-bitcoin-backed-loan/">bitcoin-backed loan</a>, and launched a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/goldman-sachs-launches-data-service-to-help-investors-analyze-crypto-markets/">data service</a> to help investors analyze crypto markets.</p>

For all users of LBank Exchange, the GDCC/<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> trading pair is now officially available for trading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new-age protocol and peer-to-peer network, Global Digital Cluster Coin (GDCC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restructures the concept of money and assets with cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to transform various industries and allow people to adapt crypto assets. Its native token GDCC will be listed on LBank Exchange at 8:00 UTC on January 27, 2023, to further expand its global reach and help it achieve its vision.</span></p>
<p><b>Introducing Global Digital Cluster Coin</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Digital Cluster Coin (GDCC) is a new-age protocol that caters to web3.0 services and community-driven technology, allowing users to build their dApps and serving as a hub for digital assets, international payments, and applications. Because the protocol is open to all, anyone in the world with an internet connection can access the system at any time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a peer-to-peer network that allows users to conduct transactions directly with the person in question, GDCC eliminates the need for intermediaries. Because no entity or institution controls it, no one can impose restrictions on the process of receiving payments or using on-chain services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Global Digital Cluster Coin, blockchain developers can create a wide range of applications, including decentralized applications and wallets. Utility applications have unlimited privileges because the network allows them to deploy and execute smart contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Digital Cluster Coin will also launch its own decentralized exchange, to provide direct custody of funds to users. Hopium, GDCC&#x2019;s decentralized exchange, will provide a seamless and hassle-free crypto trading experience to its community as a protocol developed by the community for the community. Because of the non-custodial nature, users will be fully responsible for all of their funds/transactions, and the platform will not interfere at any cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform uses the Automated Market Maker model, which is made up of self-executed protocols capable of managing the liquidity pool on its own. These pools will be supported by liquidity providers, who will provide the tokens used to create the pairs. These liquidity providers will be compensated with &#x201C;liquidity tokens&#x201D; based on their contribution to the liquidity pool. These liquidity tokens can also be redeemed for the underlying shares.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GDCC&#x2019;s Muzella platform, as a creator-centric marketplace, provides wonderful opportunities for creators by acknowledging their masterpieces. Users will be able to mint NFTs, and the marketplace gives users immutable ownership rights to the NFTs they hold. The platform also enables users to trade NFTs instantly, ensuring a high level of liquidity for holders. The marketplace will have an exclusive collection of rare and branded NFTs that will add unique value to the portfolio of the holder. In addition, users can connect to different blockchain networks with the help of cross-chain functionality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, as a compatible network, GDCC enables users to create tokens. To create their own token, issuers must provide a token name, total token supply, the exchange rate to GDCC, market cap, circulation duration, description, website, frozen token quantity, and so on. The GDCC-20 standard is the technical standard for smart contracts that generate tokens that are compatible with the GDCC virtual machine. This standard is compatible with the GDCC-20 token standard used by GDCC.</span></p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>

The project, which will use the Tezos blockchain and has the assistance of Oxhead Alpha, a crypto dev company, aims to allow users to transfer titles as NFTs in the future.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Innovation Comes to the DMV in California</h2>
<p>The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in California is working to bring innovation to its tasks by decentralizing its functions. The institution is currently in the process of moving all of its registered titles to the blockchain, according to Ajay Gupta, the chief digital officer of the DMV in the state.</p>
<p>The project, which started back in 2020 and stopped progress due to the pandemic, will produce a &#8220;shadow ledger&#8221; of all of the vehicle titles in the state, to modernize its registry and operations. The new system will be established on top of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tezos-major-upgrade-network-functionality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tezos</a> blockchain and will be built in partnership with Oxhead Alpha, a cryptocurrency development company.</p>
<p>The system will be managed by the DMV in a privately managed instance of the Tezos blockchain, which is already running with nodes validating operations, Fortune Crypto <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/26/california-announces-dmv-run-blockchain-through-partnership-with-tezos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Title Transfers on the Blockchain</h2>
<p>The DMV of California hopes to finalize the setup of the system in the next three months and start building apps that offer various functionalities for customers.</p>
<p>One of the touted benefits of having a digitized, persistent registry is that vehicles sold as lemons, meaning they were sold with significant defects, will remain registered as such, protecting future buyers. This was not possible with the current system, which allows cars registered in other states to be sold without this designation.</p>
<p>Another application of this system would be to link it with similar systems from other states to build a global registry of cars in the country, but this would depend on how interested other areas might be in implementing a blockchain system.</p>
<p>One of the most significant applications projected is to allow customers to transfer titles as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using a consumer app managed by the DMV, given that the users comply with all of the requirements to do so. This kind of functionality is on the horizon, per Gupta&#8217;s statements. However, he did not give a time frame for the launch of this feature.</p>

Hive is believed to have targeted various organizations worldwide in the past couple of years, often extorting payments in cryptocurrency.</strong></p>
<h2>Captured Decryption Keys Helped Hive Victims Avoid Paying $130 Million in Ransom</h2>
<p>Ransomware network Hive, which has had around 1,500 victims in more than 80 countries, has been hit in a months-long disruption campaign, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) revealed. A total of 13 nations participated in the operation, including EU member states, the U.K. and Canada.</p>
<p>Hive has been identified as a major cybersecurity threat as the ransomware has been used by affiliated actors to compromise and encrypt data and computer systems of government facilities, oil multinationals, IT and telecom companies in the EU and U.S., Europol said. Hospitals, schools, financial firms, and critical infrastructure have been targeted, the DOJ noted.</p>
<p>It has been one of the most prolific ransomware strains, Chainalysis pointed out, which has collected at least $100 million from victims since its launch in 2021. A recent <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-ransomware-revenue-down-as-victims-refuse-to-pay/">report</a> by the blockchain forensics company unveiled that revenue from such attacks has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ransomware-revenue-drops-as-victims-pay-less-often-chainalysis-reports/">decreased</a> last year, with a growing number of affected organizations refusing to pay the demanded ransoms.</p>
<p>According to the announcements by the law enforcement authorities, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) penetrated Hive’s computers in July 2022 and captured its decryption keys, providing them to victims around the world which prevented them from paying another $130 million.</p>
<p>Working with the German Federal Police and the Dutch High Tech Crime Unit, the Bureau has now seized control over the servers and websites that Hive used to communicate with its members and the victims, including the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/darknet-market-solaris-hacked-by-competitor-elliptic-reveals/">darknet</a> domain where the stolen data was sometimes posted. FBI Director Christopher Wray was quoted as stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The coordinated disruption of Hive’s computer networks … shows what we can accomplish by combining a relentless search for useful technical information to share with victims.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Hive ransomware was created, maintained and updated by developers while being employed by affiliates in a ‘ransomware-as-a-service’ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware">RaaS</a>) double extortion model, Europol explained. The affiliates would initially copy the data and then encrypt the files before asking for a ransom to decrypt the information and not publish it on the leak site.</p>
<p>The attackers exploited various vulnerabilities and used a number of methods, including single factor logins via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), virtual private networks (VPNs), and other remote network connection protocols as well as phishing emails with malicious attachments, the law enforcement agencies detailed.</p>

Additionally, the attorneys intend to question some of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s top deputies, including FTX co-founder Gary Wang, ex-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, the former chief operating officer Constance Wang, and the exchange&#8217;s former director of engineering Nishad Singh.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX Attorneys Push for Subpoena of Co-Founder, Associates, Parents, and Brother</h2>
<p>Lawyers for FTX Trading Ltd. and the <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo">bankruptcy case</a>&#8216;s official creditors committee filed a motion that aims to question <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)</a>, his parents, his brother, and a few of the former CEO&#8217;s top lieutenants. The lawyers contend that specific insiders associated with Bankman-Fried&#8217;s dealings could provide much-needed insight into financial matters.</p>
<p>“Certain insiders are currently cooperating with the debtors to provide important information. But others are not, and thus authorization to issue subpoenas to those with the missing information is critical to the debtors’ and committee’s recovery efforts,” the joint motion details.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ftx-ceo-discusses-possibility-of-rebooting-defunct-crypto-exchange-in-first-interview-since-taking-over/">current FTX CEO</a>, John J. Ray III, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ftx-ceo-told-members-of-congress-sbfs-family-certainly-received-payments-from-the-business/">told</a> Congress that Joseph Bankman and &#8220;the family certainly received payments&#8221; from FTX. Bankman and Barbara Fried have not been charged with any wrongdoing, but the recent court filing claims they both had associations with the firm. The filing alleges that Fried&#8217;s political action committee (PAC) Mind the Gap received funds from FTX. Barbara Fried “has ignored the requests altogether,” the joint motion discloses. Bankman allegedly gave tax advice to staff and was involved in linking FTX with the company&#8217;s first litigation firm, the court filing explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;The insiders are best positioned to assist&#8221; the case, FTX attorneys further insist in the latest filing. The document notes that lawyers want to question Gabriel Bankman-Fried, SBF&#8217;s brother. The filing talks about Bankman-Fried&#8217;s brother&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-donations-to-early-covid-19-researchers-raise-questions-of-propaganda-tied-to-pandemic-prevention/">nonprofit</a>, Guarding Against Pandemics. It mentions the alleged political <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/washington-townhome-tied-to-disgraced-ftx-co-founder-listed-for-3-28-million-amid-controversy-and-bankruptcy/">lobbying</a> that reportedly took place near the U.S. Capitol at a “multimillion-dollar property,” which “the debtors believe was purchased using misappropriated customer funds.” In addition to Bankman-Fried&#8217;s brother and parents, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-ftx-execs-offered-taylor-swift-100m-to-endorse-the-exchange-source-says-singer-never-considered-the-deal/">Constance Wang</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/caroline-ellisons-testimony-claims-ftx-boss-sbf-directed-her-to-co-mingle-customer-funds-since-2019/">Caroline Ellison</a>, Gary Wang, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-ftx-director-of-engineering-under-scrutiny-by-us-law-enforcement-alleged-proffer-sessions-held-with-prosecutors-in-new-york/">Nishad Singh</a> are mentioned in the request.</p>
<p>The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware judge, John Dorsey, must approve the request to subpoena SBF and the members of his inner circle. Bankman-Fried has been <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/kxfZltq/unsealed-indictment-in-us-v-bankman-fried-22-cr-673-abrams-as-sam-bankman-fried-of-ftx-heads-to-sdny-echoes-of-onecoin-and-un-bribery-cases-pdf">indicted</a> by a federal grand jury in Manhattan and faces charges of &#8220;conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission and commit campaign finance violations.&#8221; SBF currently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disgraced-ftx-co-founder-awaits-trial-passes-time-playing-video-games-and-blogging-on-his-new-substack-newsletter/">awaits trial</a> over the charges, which is scheduled for Oct. 3, 2023.</p>
<p>“Debtors have not received meaningful engagement or any response from Singh or Mr. Gabriel Bankman-Fried,” the FTX attorneys added in the filing.</p>

The new crypto casino offers players 100% crypto gameplay, a selection of over 2,500 games, and plenty of promotions which will keep its growing audience asking for more.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
With quick signups and instant withdrawals an important part of its product offer, Metaspins supports numerous top cryptocurrencies such as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> and many more. Registration typically takes one click, and transferring funds from crypto wallets to the casino is quite easy. Players can also buy and sell their crypto directly at the casino.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Moreover, new players can benefit from a 100% Welcome Offer that can go up to 1 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or equivalent in any of the supported currencies. The bonus funds can be used on thousands of games at the casino, which include top games from NetEnt, Yggdrasil, Pragmatic Play and all the top names of the gaming industry.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Metaspins guarantees its players a massive selection of slots, live casino and table games, and also features a section dedicated to provably fair games, which allow players to verify the fairness of their bets.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A highlight of Metaspins is undoubtedly their gamification and loyalty programme, with a custom-built feature to reward players. The Metaspin is triggered when players go up a level at the casino, and they&#x2019;re rewarded with a guaranteed crypto prize.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Unlike traditional cashback schemes which offer players part of their losses, at Metaspins they can get up to 60% Rakeback, meaning they recoup part of the amount they have played. In addition to this, they can trigger a Big Win that can reach up to USD 1000 at the higher levels.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
There is also a Daily Metaspin, which gives crypto prizes to players based on their gameplay over a 12-hour span.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Metaspins is licensed in Curacao. Affiliates interested in this crypto casino can get in touch <a href="https://3rdwaveaffiliates.com/">here</a>.&#13;<br />

In the past seven days, Aptos has increased 123.7% after reaching an all-time high of $19.92 per unit on Jan. 26, 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>The Role of Decentralized Finance, Infrastructure Support, and NFTs in Aptos&#8217; Recent Surge in Value</h2>
<p>A relatively new cryptocurrency, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aptos">aptos (APT)</a>, reached an all-time high on Thursday when the token hit $19.92 per coin. Aptos, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/vc-backed-blockchain-project-aptos-reveals-protocols-mainnet-has-arrived/">launched</a> in mid-Oct. 2022, was created by two developers who previously worked on Meta&#8217;s Diem project before it was discontinued. The project is also supported by several venture capital firms including Parafi, Andreessen Horowitz, and Multicoin Capital.</p>
<p>When the mainnet went live and aptos (APT) started trading, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/proof-of-stake-l1-blockchain-token-aptos-climbs-close-to-20-higher-in-24-hours/">price increased about 20%</a>. However, like the rest of the cryptocurrency market during the last two months of 2022, the value of aptos dropped. On Dec. 29, 2022, aptos reached an all-time low of $3.08 per coin. As of Jan. 27, however, the value of APT is 474% higher. Today, aptos&#8217; value is around 11% lower than its all-time high of $19.92 per coin, and in the past 24 hours, APT reached a low of $17.37 per unit.</p>

<p>Currently, APT is the 28th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization out of the entire $1 trillion cryptocurrency market. On Friday, aptos had an overall market capitalization of around $2.83 billion. At the time of writing, aptos has a circulating supply of around 160.54 million APT tokens and in the last 24 hours, the token has seen $813 million in global trading volume. While some traders attempted to <a href="https://twitter.com/BitMart_Futures/status/1618879791834484736?s=20&amp;t=aKuaeWpQYuSgG0Tn6hj0ZA">short</a> the market during the climb in value, many were <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1618804348284436483?s=20&amp;t=aKuaeWpQYuSgG0Tn6hj0ZA">ultimately unsuccessful</a>.</p>
<p>“I got completely wiped out,” one trader <a href="https://twitter.com/InstinctCrypto/status/1618345292935622656?s=20&amp;t=aKuaeWpQYuSgG0Tn6hj0ZA">wrote</a> on Wednesday. “I never short, today I decided to do it and I lost everything. I committed to my APT short and got destroyed. I’m left with nothing, even my bags I sold trying to save that f***ing short. It hurts, I’ve never lost so much in my entire life,” the trader added.</p>
<p>The recent surge in aptos (APT) is being attributed to its deployment by the leading decentralized exchange Pancakeswap. Aptos&#8217; total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (defi) has climbed rapidly in recent weeks, with Pancakeswap accounting for 57.62%.</p>
<p>The price rise is also being credited to the blockchain&#8217;s issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and NFT projects like Aptos Land Genesis, Aptos Monkeys, Babyapetos, and Aptopunks. Aptos-based NFTs are seeing significant trading activity on the NFT marketplace topaz.so. Furthermore, APT has also been recently <a href="https://twitter.com/aptosbigfinance/status/1618710535134142465?s=20&amp;t=s_BDhH3HYRwU5tyFEKMoCg">integrated</a> with Atomic Wallet, a defi Web3 wallet with more than 5 million users.</p>

Sentiment rose to 64.9 in January, up from a reading of 59.7 in December. Chainlink also surged in today’s session, hitting its strongest point in nearly two months.</strong></p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) was a big gainer on Friday, as prices rose to their highest point in 11 weeks.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1.07 on Thursday, MATIC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1.15 earlier today.</p>
<p>As a result of this, polygon moved to its strongest point since November 11, which is the last time prices were trading at this point of resistance.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, the surge took place when the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 69.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 72.14, and appears to be en route to a ceiling at the 77.00 mark.</p>
<p>Should this occur, there is a strong possibility that MATIC will be trading above the $1.20 mark.</p>
<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>Another notable mover on Friday was chainlink (LINK), which also surged to a multi-month high.</p>
<p>LINK/USD jumped to a high of $7.33 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after falling to a low of $6.93.</p>
<p>This rally in price pushed chainlink to its highest point since December 5, breaking it out of a price ceiling in the process.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the chart, LINK climbed past its resistance level of $7.25, however the RSI was unable to also achieve this feat.</p>
<p>Price strength is currently at a reading of 64.15, which is marginally below a ceiling at 65.00.</p>

The change follows the last difficulty retarget, which advanced by 10.26% to the current all-time high of 37.59 trillion.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Block Time Breakdown: How Faster Discovery is Impacting Bitcoin Difficulty</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In just over a day, the Bitcoin network will see a difficulty increase of around 3.82%, according to current estimates. Right now, the mining difficulty is already at an all-time high (ATH) at 37.59 trillion, and with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127135537/https://btc.com/stats/diff">3.82% jump</a>, it&#x2019;s expected to be around 39.03 trillion. The number of hashes needed to mine a block is directly proportional to the difficulty level, which means each participating miner needs to perform 39.03 trillion hashes in order to mine a block at that level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The average Bitcoin block time has been around <a href="https://www.bitcoinsensus.com/bitcoin-halving-countdown/">8:54 minutes</a> to <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">9:31 minutes</a>, which has been lower than the 10-minute average. This too is linearly related to the estimated increase expected on Jan. 29.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This is because when blocks are discovered faster than the 10-minute average, the 2,016 blocks in between difficulty retargets are also found faster than the two-week average. As a result, the Bitcoin protocol&#x2019;s mining difficulty rises. With <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price higher, a lot more hashrate has been dedicated to the blockchain.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Bitcoin&#x2019;s hashrate is running high with an average of 278.2 exahash per second (EH/s) during the last 2,016 blocks. Foundry USA commands the <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool">top position</a> in terms of mining pools with the most amount of dedicated SHA256 hashrate. Foundry has around 93.82 EH/s, over a three-day period, which accounts for 32.99% of the network&#x2019;s computational power. The Bitcoin mining pool Antpool has dedicated 49.57 EH/s to the Bitcoin network over a three-day span, accounting for 17.43% of the hashpower.&#13;<br />

Following a move to a five-month high on Thursday, prices were once again below $23,000. Ethereum also slipped, moving below $1,600 in the process.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) fell back below $23,000 on Friday, as markets consolidated ahead of U.S. consumer sentiment data.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD slipped to a bottom of $22,654.59 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $23,215.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The drop came ahead of this afternoon&#x2019;s U.S. consumer sentiment report, which is expected to come in at a reading of 64.6.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As can be seen from the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) also edged closer to a floor of 78.00, leading to a slight shift in momentum.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The 10-day (red) moving average continues to move in an upward direction, however should the index move below 78.00, this trend will likely reverse.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, the index is tracking at 79.64, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD trading at $22,965.60.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
There was a slight shift in sentiment in ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), with prices moving below $1,600 during today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a high of $1,619.45 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,565.25 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Today&#x2019;s move came as the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency was unable to break out of a resistance level of $1,640 on Wednesday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Since this time, prices have moved to lower lows in back-to-back sessions, with ethereum&#x2019;s RSI also dropping below a key point of support.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index is tracking at 61.94, which is marginally under its recent floor at 63.00, and its weakest level since January 8.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should this bearish trend continue into the weekend, there is a strong possibility that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will hit a floor at $1,500.&#13;<br />
