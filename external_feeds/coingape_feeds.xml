This is a major accomplishment for the Terra Classic community as core developers plan the <strong>Cosmwasm v1.1.0 upgrade (parity)</strong> on May 31 to allow projects and builders across Cosmos and Terra Luna 2.0 to once again build on the Terra Classic chain. Surprisingly, core developer <strong>Edward Kim</strong> also participated in the upgrade.</p>
<p>This comes as <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-dev-teases-ai-app-chain-block-entropy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edward Kim shared images</a> of the whitepaper for the AI chain called <strong>Block Entropy</strong>. TestNet will only support a small set of ML inference tasks at this time (AI image diffusion, text language models, and music generation). Distributed training, fine-tuning, python APIs, and SNARK verification comes later.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Prepares Toward AI Capability</h2>
<p>The Joint L1 Task Force can now set to run the <strong>Cosmos SDK v0.45.11</strong> Columbus-5 mainnet upgrade on May 17. The developer group will publish an Agora proposal shortly for the v2.0.0 mainnet upgrade.</p>
<p>The Cosmos SDK upgrade on the Rebel-2 testnet was earlier planned on May 5, but the developer group stated that they will be able to conduct the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint upgrades on the Rebel-2 testnet slightly sooner. The Tendermint upgrade on the Rebel-2 testnet is scheduled on May 9.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Terra Classic core developer <strong>Edward Kim</strong> participated in the upgrade. Validators including <strong>StakeBin</strong>, <strong>Allnodes</strong>, Lunanauts, StellarDrift, and SolidVote also participated in the rebel-2 testnet to v2.0.0 with Cosmos SDK v0.45.</p>
<p>The <strong>Cosmwasm 1.1.0 Parity</strong> upgrade is targeted on May 31. It will bring back utility to the Terra Classic network by allowing projects and builders across Cosmos and Terra Luna 2.0 to once again build on the Terra Classic chain.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price To Hit $1?</h2>
<p>LUNC price is up 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.000104. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000102 and $0.000106, respectively.</p>
<p>The latest upside momentum came as the LUNC community votes on a <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-ust-repeg-proposal-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal to repeg USTC</a> stablecoin to $1. However, major validators have opposed the proposal due to terms for the repeg.</p>
<p>The community needs to work continuously for many months in order to revive LUNC and USTC to $1. The developments are still in the early phase as per the <a href="https://coingape.com/official-terra-classic-lunc-revival-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terra Classic Revival Roadmap</a>.</p>

Amid the consolidation phase, the price resonated between two converging trendlines revealing the formation of a bearish flag. Here’s how this pattern may influence the Ethereum coin’s future trend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price narrowing within two trendlines can be considered a no-trading zone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin price breakout on either side will determine the potential trend in ETH</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $9.04 Billion, indicating a 42.5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/hnr1yMzI.png" alt="Ethereum Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 3rd, the US Fed <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-gains-despite-25-basis-points-hike-by-the-fed-bitcoin-btc-above-29000/">announced a 25 basis points rate hike</a> during the FOMC meeting. The crypto market reacted positively to these expected numbers, triggering a minor uptick in several cryptocurrencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum price</a> still within the triangle pattern indicated uncertainty among market participants. With a 1% intraday fall, the coin price turned down from the pattern’s resistance trendline indicating a prolonged consolidation phase. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-crypto-margin-trading-platforms-in-australia/">Top 10 Crypto Margin Trading Platforms In Australia</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, the bearish pattern creates a higher possibility for a breakdown below the support trendline and resumes the prevailing downfall. A daily candle closing below the trendline will increase the selling pressure and tumble the Ethereum price 10% down to hit $1650.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakout above the overhead trendline will signal the belonging of a fresh recovery rally which may surge the price back to the last swing high of $2133.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> wavering around the neutral line accentuates an indecisive market sentiment.</span></p>
<p><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price flipped the midline of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger band indicator</a> into a viable resistance offering sellers an additional resistance to pressurize buyers for longer correction.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1884</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $1965 and $2133</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $1800 and $1700</span></li>

Over the past 24 hours, PEPE </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/"><span style="font-weight: 400">jumped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by more than 73% pushing its price from a 24-hour low of $0.0000009165 to the new ATH of $0.000001766, data from CoinMarketcap reveals.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_147210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147210" style="width: 1084px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-147210" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/04223604/PEPE-CHART.jpg" alt="" width="1084" height="633" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-147210" class="wp-caption-text dfdfdf1">Image Source: <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/">CoinMarketCap</a></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the volatility surrounding the PEPE memecoin is high, there is a significant difference in the way the crypto traded within the first few days of its launch. This time around, the price growth is backed by a verifiable uptick in the trading volume on exchanges. At the time of writing, more than $407 million worth of PEPE tokens have been traded with a diluted market cap of $696 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The emergence of PEPE somewhat stirred a lot of dissenting views within the digital currency ecosystem. While many saw the token as a scam at the beginning, a couple of others who got in early </span><a href="https://coingape.com/pepe-coin-whale-crypto-market-news/"><span style="font-weight: 400">made millions of dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as the token recorded its meteoric rise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://coingape.com/pepe-coin-rally-bitmes-listing/"><span style="font-weight: 400">support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from some of the industry’s top trading platforms has also helped in pushing the popularity and price valuation of the asset since its inception.</span></p>
<h2><b>Where is PEPE Headed Next</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The growth of PEPE to its ATH, like any other digital currency, is not sustainable. By default, the next move is for the token to undergo a major price reversal as some of the early buyers are billed to take profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The signs for reversal are already being showcased as despite its bullish gains at this time, it has reversed some of the gains from when it topped its ATH. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are numerous memecoins in the industry today with </span><a href="https://coingape.com/dogecoin-doge-price-to-hit-1-after-this-binance-announcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dogecoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) among those that have attained the right level of stability. With market capitalization running into billions and the integration of several utilities, the pioneering memes coins are setting the standard that new entrants like PEPE can learn from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As part of the major next steps, PEPE may seek to first stabilize its price volatility, then focus on trackable protocol utilities in the near future.</span></p>

However, this support is also the lower band of a bearish flag pattern indicating this memecoin is poised for a prolonged downfall. Here’s how this pattern may affect the future trend of the Shiba Inu coin.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the bearish flag is a downtrend continuation pattern that offers a short break before the price continues to fall further</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shiba Inu price escape from the consolidation phase will determine this future trend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $104.5 Million, showing a 10% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/z/zEBdbW86.png" alt="SHIB Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the aggressive fall in the Feb to Early March, the last two months&#8217; consolidation in the daily time frame chart shows the formation of an inverted flag pattern. Under the influence of this pattern, this consolidation phase is temporary and the sellers are likely to intensify supply pressure once the price breached the flag’s range support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu price</a> trades at $0.00000994, with an intraday loss of 1.58%. If the daily price pierced below the $0.00000996 support with a candle closing the accelerated selling pressure may tumble the prices 20% down to hit the 4-hour month low of $0.0000078.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/low-cap-crypto-gems-gunning-to-explode/">Low Cap Crypto Gems Gunning To Explode In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily candles showing lower price rejection indicate the possibility of a bullish reversal which may prolong the sideways trend. Thus, if the buyer continues to defend this support, an upside breakout above $0.0000102 will trigger a bull cycle within the pattern and surge the prices $25% higher to hit $0.0000119.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>

The bank&#8217;s management said it was not exploring a sale and that it did not hire an advisor to explore strategic options. The statement came as the bank&#8217;s shares continued to tumble on Thursday, with a drop in value by 39%. Earlier, reports suggested it was exploring potential sale. Meanwhile, another bank, PacWest Bancorp is believed to be likely facing a collapse, as its stock price dropped around 48% on Thursday.</p>

<h2>Western Alliance Not Exploring Sale</h2>
<p>Stating that it was not exploring sale, the bank disputed the reports that said Western Alliance was exploring sale options. The statement <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1654144051807961088?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> reports stating that the bank was exploring sale option was &#8216;absolutely false&#8217;. However, the bank now stands among the biggest losers among US regional banks, as the stock price dropped in reaction to a Financial Times <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.ft.com/content/bf2bd5af-1e55-4be3-b29d-f5cae9533b29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> that said Western Alliance was looking for potential sale.</p>
<p>Since March 2023, U.S. regional banks like Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank collapsed, leading to a domino effect in the US banking sector.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Interestingly, the use of blockchain in KYC has the potential to significantly reduce costs, speed up processing times, and increase data security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Polkadot’s KILT protocol is a blockchain-based identity verification platform that allows users to securely and privately share their personal data. The platform uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to create unique digital identities for each user, which can be used across different platforms and services. </span></p>
<h2><b>How Deloitte Plans to Leverage Kilt</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By leveraging blockchain technology, the KILT protocol ensures that personal data is stored securely and can be accessed only by authorized parties. </span><a href="https://coingape.com/recent-deloitte-survey-shows-the-majority-of-american-merchants-prioritize-crypto-as-payment-method/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Known</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for its interest in crypto-related innovations, Deloitte Switzerland’s decision to use the KILT protocol for its KYC solution shows how blockchain technology can help address some of the major challenges faced by compliance professionals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notably, KYC processes are often time-consuming and costly, with many financial institutions relying on manual checks and paperwork. In return, this leads to errors and delays, resulting in frustrated customers and lost revenue. By using the KILT protocol, Deloitte Switzerland can streamline its KYC processes and reduce the risk of errors or fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likewise, the platform allows for faster verification of customer identity, as well as secure sharing of personal data between different parties. This can help financial institutions save time and money while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition to improving efficiency and security, the use of blockchain technology in KYC also has the potential to enhance privacy.</span></p>
<h2><b>Expanding Blockchain Use in KYC</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ultimately, the adoption of blockchain technology in KYC represents a significant step forward for the financial industry. As more companies like Deloitte Switzerland look to improve their compliance processes, the use of blockchain-based solutions is likely to become increasingly common. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This will offer an encompassing benefit as the trend has the potential to revolutionize the way financial institutions operate, making them more efficient, secure, and customer-friendly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just last month, Bybit Exchange </span><a href="https://coingape.com/bybit-introduces-compulsory-kyc-in-move-toward-full-compliance/"><span style="font-weight: 400">introduced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">compulsory KYC for all its users in a move towards full compliance. According to the Dubai-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange, KYC is a compulsory requirement for financial service providers that clients must fulfill. It is conducted to verify the identity, suitability, and risks involved, in order to minimize the risk to the respective account.</span></p>

<h2>XRP Coinbase Relisting, Possible Or Not?</h2>
<p>In a recent <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwtlbCPkotc&amp;t=2510s&amp;ab_channel=RealVisionCrypto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>, Paul Grewal, Coinbase&#8217;s legal chief explained the possibility of relisting XRP on Coinbase. The host asked Grewal that if the District Court decides that secondary market sales of Ripple’s XRP token are not securities, how would that affect the relisting of XRP token?</p>
<p>To this Coinbase legal chief highlighted that they continuously evaluate and reevaluate the listing of tokens. The nature of XRP was subject to litigation and 2 years later the matter is still subject to ligation, he added.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP Lawsuit News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>He mentioned that lot of key industry players are waiting for a <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verdict in the XRP lawsuit</a>. However, whatever the court rules out, Coinbase will be following the appeal after that and it completely depends on the court’s determination. Post the courts ruling the exchange can think about relisting XRP, while Coinbase is eagerly waiting for the decision to do that.</p>
<p>Earlier, Coingape reported that <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-coinbase-legal-head-meets-ripple-chief-legal-officer-will-coinbase-relist-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple and Coinbase legal chiefs had a meeting</a> on Wednesday. Both executives called this meeting critical.

<p>The House Financial Services Committee has scheduled two crucial hearings as US-based crypto firms plan to move offshore amid regulatory crackdowns and the banking crisis risking an economic catastrophe.</p>
<h2>US House Blames Biden Administration for Crypto Regulatory Unclarity</h2>
<p>The U.S. House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion &amp; House Agriculture Subcommittee on Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development have <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408758" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">scheduled</a> the hearing &#8220;<b>The Future of Digital Assets: Measuring the Regulatory Gaps in the Digital Asset Markets</b>&#8221; on May 10.</p>

<p>They also seek answers over a recent shift in position regarding the benefits of digital assets and distributed ledger technology. The House Financial Services Committee has blamed the Biden Administration, especially action against crypto by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Mike Flood asserts digital assets are crucial for the digital economy in the future, but recent crackdowns and lack of regulatory clarity are making firms move offshore.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Digital assets are at the heart of our digital economy’s future, but the Biden’s Administration’s response is driving innovators out of America and into the hands of international competitors. </p>

<h2>US House Hearing on Banking Failures</h2>
<p>The US House Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy Subcommittee has scheduled a hearing on the federal responses to recent bank failures. The hearing <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408757" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">titled</a> &#8220;<b>Federal Responses to Recent Bank Failures</b>&#8221; on May 10 will seek answers from the FDIC and Federal Reserve on their approach to preventing bank failures and managing the risks to the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>After the collapse of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/first-republic-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Republic Bank</a>, banking shares continue to fall with <a href="https://coingape.com/pacwest-bancorp-other-us-bank-stocks-drop-pre-market-ahead-of-fomc-meet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PacWest Bancorp plunging 52%</a> on Wednesday.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Seychelles-registered cryptocurrency exchange is embarking on this project as part of its corporate social responsibility and has also decided to dedicate up to $10 million to its actualization. Ultimately, Bitget is trying to integrate the younger generation into the adoption of blockchain technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the firm, &#8220;The project aims to create a blockchain future by empowering and inspiring younger generations to use Web3 and сrypto tools to create and engage in a decentralized space.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before now, Bitget has always been a core advocate of pushing for mainstream crypto adoption. As far as the exchange is concerned, a blockchain-based future plays an important role in providing better services and products, all directed towards crypto adoption. As a result, the launch of Blockchain4Youth is in alignment with the exchange&#8217;s core mission and objectives.</span></p>
<h2><b>Bitget Survey Confirms Crypto Craze Amongst Younger Generation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last month, Bitget published results from a survey which stated that Millenials and Gen Z are the future of a crypto-enabled future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The research which was </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bitget.com/en/blog/articles/bitget-study-reveals-forty-six-percent-of-millennials-across-major-countries-own-cryptocurrencies"><span style="font-weight: 400">conducted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for almost seven months involved respondents from about 26 countries in Africa, Asia and even Europe. The 255,000 respondents were categorised into Millennials, Gen X-ers, Gen Z, and Baby Boomers based on their age range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, it was discovered that a significant percentage of Millennials and Gen Z own digital assets and are crypto enthusiasts already. With Blockchain4Youth, Bitget will be relinquishing the responsibility of pushing most crypto ideas to the younger generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Bitget aims to uplift the youth of today with valuable knowledge regarding Blockchain and Web3 information, ensuring a future where the world is blockchain-connected,&#8221; Gracy Chen, the Managing Director of Bitget said in a statement, &#8220;In light of this, Bitget aims to leverage its global reach and initiate meaningful projects to empower the younger generation.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Similarly, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance has been improving the Web3.0 ecosystem with some of its inclusion strategies including the recent expansion to Japan. After acquiring Japan-based crypto firm Sakura Exchange Bitcoin Co. (SEBC) last year, the exchange announced plans to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/binance-japan-announces-official-opening-date/"><span style="font-weight: 400">commence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> operations in June. </span></p>

The inflation rate in the <strong>Euro Area</strong> reached 7% in April, with the core rate remaining near an all-time high at 5.6%.</p>
<p>The crypto market reacted positively to the ECB rate hike on expected terms after the <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-fed-hikes-interest-rates-by-25-bps-signals-pivoting-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Fed too raised rates</a> by 25bps. Bitcoin price remains over $29,000, while Ethereum price jumps over $1900. Traders will likely open positions for bullish prices after central banks hint at no aggressive rate hikes.</p>
<h2>ECB Hikes Rates By 25 Bps</h2>
<p>The <strong>European Central Bank Governing Council</strong> <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2023/html/ecb.is230504~f242392c72.en.html" target="_blank">decided</a> to increase the interest rate on the main refinancing operations, the interest rates on the marginal lending facility, and the deposit facility to 3.75%, 4.00%, and 3.25% respectively.</p>
<p>The ECB aims to bring policy rates near the 2% target amid high levels of inflation. The central bank will look to maintain low levels for as long as necessary. Further, the Governing Council will keep reducing the Eurosystem’s asset purchase program (APP) portfolio at a measured pace, discontinuing reinvestments under the APP as of July 2023.</p>
<p>Stock market indexes fell to red after the ECB raised interest rates, with Euro falling slightly against the US dollar. The <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy" target="_blank">DXY</a> index jumped sharply from 101.1 to 101.57, indicating slight pressure on the crypto market. However, the overall outlook remains bullish, with Bitcoin price looking to cross $30,000.</p>
<p>ECB President <strong>Christine </strong><span class="link-complex-target"><strong>Lagarde</strong> said the central bank will continue to work on bringing inflation lower. It will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of the restriction.</span></p>

<h2>Bitcoin and Ethereum Jumps</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price</a> jumps after the ECB rate hike decision. The price is currently trading at $29,093, up over 3% in the last 24 hours. Traders and investors are looking for upside momentum to push BTC price above $30,000 again as the banking crisis just starting in the US. <strong>PacWest Bancorp</strong> is believed to be the next bank to collapse.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum price</a> is trading over $1900, up nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. Other altcoins such as Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are also showing strength.</p>

Meanwhile, the PacWest Bancorp stock is down by about 37% on Thursday, while the stock already lost over 42% value over the last five days.</p>

<h2>Bill Ackman Warns Of Risk To All US Banks</h2>
<p>According to latest remarks by Ackman, the next weakest bank, in the current case PacWest could fall prey to the domino effect, at the back of the recent collapse of First Republic Bank. He <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/05/32205292/bill-ackman-warns-no-regional-bank-can-survive-current-crisis-running-out-of-time-t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that no regional bank can survive bad news or bad data, amid constant fall in stock prices.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As each domino falls, the next weakest bank begins to wobble. We are running out of time to fix the problem, we need a systemwide deposit guarantee regime now.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, a benchmark stock index of the banking sector, fell by over 5% over the last few days as the PacWest stock began to show signs of weakness.</p>

<h2>TD Bank and First Horizon Bank Ends Merger Agreement</h2>
<p>TD Bank Group and First Horizon Corp have entered into a mutual agreement to terminate their merger agreement, as per a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/td-bank-and-first-horizon-mutually-agree-to-terminate-merger-agreement-301815874.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> on May 4. TD Bank has been increasing its crypto exposure in recent times and completed the acquisition of financial services Cowen Inc in March this year.</p>
<p>The regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. regarding crypto and the ongoing banking crisis have resulted in TD Bank getting no time for approval about the merger. TD Bank reached First Horizon to inform that TD does not have a timetable for regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Bharat Masrani, CEO of TD Bank Group, argues the decision offers clarity to colleagues and shareholders about the developments and growth of the bank in the US. The merger deal, which was first announced in February last year, faced regulatory uncertainty for months and recently came under pressure from TD&#8217;s investors amid the banking crisis.</p>
<p>First Horizon Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer <span class="xn-person">Bryan Jordan, said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;While today&#8217;s announcement is unfortunate and unexpected, First Horizon will continue on its growth path operating from a position of strength and stability.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>TD Bank will make a <span class="xn-money">$200 million</span> cash payment to First Horizon as per the terms in the termination agreement, with an additional <span class="xn-money">$25 million</span> fee reimbursement.</p>

<h2>Banking Crisis to Take Several Banks Down</h2>
<p>The US government seized and sold First Republic Bank to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co this week after shares plunged 60% after it reported a fall of nearly $100 billion in deposits. Now, PacWest Bancorp has confirmed strategic options including a potential sale after shares slide over 40% in pre-market hours on Thursday.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, the complete list of creditors has been kept confidential by the court. In an </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-creditors-lauds-former-us-secret-service-agent-in-bankruptcy-case/"><span style="font-weight: 400">April filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the FTX and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors had requested that the court withhold customers’ information for fear of scams, identity theft, asset theft, personal attack, and further online victimization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the media outlets argue that such fears are only speculations, and the public&#8217;s presumed right to examine bankruptcy filings cannot be overcome by such. Additionally, they stated that there is no provision under foreign laws that prevents the disclosure of customers’ identities in a bankruptcy court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, the media platforms highlighted that the majority of people who take part in bankruptcy proceedings do so publicly. According to them, if a desire for secrecy were sufficient grounds for redaction, a court would be required to seal all personal information in every case.</span></p>
<h2><b>Defunct FTX Receives Offers for Relaunch</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The recently appointed FTX CEO, John J. Ray III, has previously expressed interest in restarting the defunct cryptocurrency exchange. The idea of a potential reboot, however, has developed over the past several months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-news-bankrupt-exchange-250m-offer-relaunch/"><span style="font-weight: 400">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Tribe Capital, a venture firm that invested in the platform prior to the FTX crash, is now considering a $250 million capital injection to jump-start the initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the details, the investment firm is considering taking the lead on a $250 million fund-raising campaign, with an initial anchor contribution of $100 million from the company and its limited partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notably, Tribe was a shareholder in the international FTX exchange as well as its American spinoff, FTX US. The San Francisco-based venture capital firm manages more than $1.6 billion in assets and has previously funded the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.</span></p>
