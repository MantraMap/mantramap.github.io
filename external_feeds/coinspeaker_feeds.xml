<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/musk-lawyer-microsoft-twitter/">Elon Musk’s Lawyer Sends Letter to Microsoft CEO due to Abusing Twitter’s Data Access</a></p>
<p>There appears to be a subtle data war brewing between Twitter Inc and American tech giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Corporation</a> (NASDAQ: MSFT). This claim stems from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/18/23729216/twitter-microsoft-api-data-sharing-elon-musk-satya-nadella" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">letter</a> sent by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a>’s personal lawyer Alex Spiro to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella over the misuse of access to social media’s API.</p>
<h2>The Issue at Hand</h2>
<p>The news was first reported by the New York Times which claims that Microsoft has been violating “multiple provisions” of the social media company’s developer agreement for an extended length of time. Twitter is accusing Microsoft of using its data APIs in 8 of its applications including Bing, xBox One, Azure, and Power Platform to mention a few.</p>
<p>Despite this extended usage, the Elon Musk team said appropriate permissions were only sought for two of the products. With Twitter notably adjusting its terms of use such that developers can generally pay for some of its data content, Microsoft pulled away from using the APIs sometime in April this year.</p>
<p>The letter claimed specifically there were “unauthorized uses and purposes” and that Microsoft failed to inform it of “any use case for six of the eight Microsoft Apps that it continued to operate until last month”.</p>
<p>“The Agreement makes clear that Microsoft was obligated to disclose and obtain approval for its intended use case for each Microsoft App, and to notify Twitter of any substantive modification to those use cases,” the letter reads, “Yet Microsoft did not identify any use case for six of the eight Microsoft Apps that it continued to operate until last month.”</p>
<p>The letter, having stated some of the perceived ways in which Microsoft violated its generosity also gave a very specific demand. This demand included a full “compliance audit” on all of the Microsoft apps that utilized Twitter’s data up until the time the support was shut down by the bigger tech giant. Microsoft was given until June 7th to comply with the demands.</p>
<p>The letter did not mention a lawsuit, however, Musk threatened to seek legal redress if there is such a need when he first mentioned this violation back in April.</p>
<h2>Twitter’s Data Abuse: Microsoft Responds</h2>
<p>The claim of Twitter’s data abuse has elucidated a response from Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw. In his response, Shaw said;</p>
<p>“Today we heard from a law firm representing Twitter with some questions about our previous use of the free Twitter API. We will review these questions and respond appropriately. We look forward to continuing our long-term partnership with the company.”</p>
<p>Twitter has been pursuing a number of monetization options since the acquisition of the company by Elon Musk was finalized. In the age of ChatGPT’s Large Language Model (LLM) data training, Twitter&#8217;s current adjustment of its terms of use might turn out to be very profitable for it in the long term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/chatgpt-app-ios-openai/">ChatGPT App for iOS Is Live, OpenAI Planning to Launch Android Version</a></p>
<p>OpenAI Inc, a research laboratory that focuses on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), has <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> the launch of an iOS version of the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> app. According to the company, later, the app will also be available on Android. It will first be rolled out for users in the US, with more countries added in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>As OpenAI has stated, the ChatGPT app is free to use. Its features include synchronizing a user&#8217;s history across devices as well as integration of Whisper – an open-source speech-recognition system that enables voice input. The app is also free from ads. In addition, those who have a subscription to ChatGPT Plus get exclusive access to GPT-4’s capabilities, early access to features and faster response times.</p>
<p>ChatGPT Plus is a special offering that was introduced in February 2023. For as much as $20 per month, it offers upgraded features, such as faster response times, early access to new features and improvements, and the ability to use ChatGPT even during peak times.</p>
<p>The launch of the ChatGPT application is an initiative that has been expected, considering the buzz around the chatbot introduced by OpenAI in November 2022. Initially, the chatbot was a kind of an experiment. However, its popularity surged, with ChatGPT&#8217;s user base rapidly expanding. Currently, ChatGPT has over 100 million users. The ChatGPT website generates 1.8 billion visitors per month. Notably, this number has been achieved within a three-month period from February to April 2023. Due to such growth, the need for the ChatGPT app has been obvious.</p>
<p>Previously, one of the simplest ways to access OpenAI’s software on a mobile device was to use Microsoft’s Bing app which offers access to ChatGPT. Now, with the app, using the chatbot will be easier and faster.</p>
<p>According to the ChatGPT team, the app will be upgraded based on user feedback, with more features coming later.</p>
<p>The first rumours about OpenAI launching the ChatGPT application appeared back in February. There were also reports about the company working on new software that would create videos with the help of artificial intelligence. Earlier this week, we also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/chatgpt-openai-open-source-ai-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> about ChatGPT preparing to release a new open-source language model.</p>
<h2>ChatGPT Leaving Rivals Behind</h2>
<p>The mobile ChatGPT app comes at a time when big tech players, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google LLC</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms Inc</a> (NASDAQ: META), are experimenting with artificial intelligence. For example, Google is integrating AI capabilities into its search engine. Its Bard uses Google’s own LaMDA language model. Launched in 2021, Google LaMDA is considered to be one of the biggest competitors of ChatGPT. LaMDA has the ability to comprehend complex inquiries and discussions that span a wide range of subjects, it has been honed with the use of 1.56 trillion words and a whopping 137 billion parameters.</p>
<p>With more research into AI taking place, many bet on ChatGPT, saying that it wins over its competitors. The key advantages offered by ChatGPT are options for free and paid access, as well as collecting user feedback in order to improve the chatbot&#8217;s functionality. As a result, ChatGPT has secured a significant competitive advantage in the AI market, leaving competitors struggling to keep up.</p>

<p>Streaming giant Netflix experienced a rise in stock value Thursday after pitching advertisers at its first Upfronts session.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/netflix-stock-jumps-ad-tier/">Netflix Stock Jumps 9% on Ad-Tier Growth, Currently Trading at $371</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix Inc</a> (NASDAQ: NFLX) recently saw its stock jump more than 9% on commendable ad-tier growth. On Wednesday, the entertainment and mass media company unveiled details about its new ad development to advertisers. Netflix said its new ad-supported tier is growing, as a quarter of its new subscribers chose the option. In addition, the streaming giant revealed that the cheaper ad-supported tier has a monthly active user base of 5 million.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s session marked the first time that Netflix would pitch to advertisers and was also the company’s inaugural participation in the industry’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/15/upfronts-media-writers-strike-soft-ad-market.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">‘Upfront presentations&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>Media companies that once relied on boosting subscribership numbers for their struggling streaming services are now leaning toward advertising models. For instance, other media platforms participating in this year’s Upfront presentations include NBCUniversal and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/warner-bros-discovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warner Bros. Discovery</a> (NASDAQ: WBD).</p>
<p>Netflix stock surged on Thursday and was up 9.22% as of press time at $371.29. The streaming and production company launched its ad-based option late last year following stagnated subscriber growth. Netflix’s quarterly subscriber growth struggles were underscored in <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nflx-stock-down-27-netflix-announces-loss-of-200k-paid-subscribers-in-q1-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q1 2022</a> when the company’s shares plummeted by over 25%. At the time, the popular streaming also lost subscribers for the first time in more than a decade.</p>
<h2>Netflix Stock Could Rise Further Following Userbase Growth &amp; Password-Sharing Crackdown</h2>
<p>Although Netflix’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/netflix-q1-2023-password-sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent quarterly outing</a> reflected mixed results, the company added 1.75 million subscribers. Meanwhile, Netflix’s bottom line for subsequent quarters could see even more revenue as the company prepares to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-college-students.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crack down on password-sharing</a>. Also, its ad tier agenda marks a U-turn from management’s previous stance that it would not prioritize ads. Netflix’s ad tier costs $6.99 monthly and features commercials up to 30 seconds in duration before and during a video.</p>
<p>Last December, Netflix’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company could offer multiple ad-based subscription plans in the future. At the time, Sarandos explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have multiple tiers today, so it’s likely we’ll have multiple ad tiers over time, but nothing to talk about yet. And the product itself will evolve, I suspect, pretty dramatically, but slowly, gradually.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2022, the co-CEO also addressed the upcoming password-sharing crackdown vis-à-vis increasing prices. Although he admitted that the development irks customers, Sarandos also pointed out:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There are folks who are enjoying Netflix, literally for free today. So, they’re getting a lot of value out of it. I think they’ll be happy to have their own account.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the Netflix executive added that Netflix remains committed to making customers see the value in its offerings.</p>
<h2>Changing of The Guard at Netflix Helm</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/netflix-subscribers-q4-2022-ceo-steps-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In January</a>, Sarandos took over the helm alongside then-COO Greg Peters after Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings stepped down to become Executive Chairman. At the time, the departing Hastings expressed confidence in his successors’ abilities and said they helped Netflix through challenging times. Despite the company’s inauspicious start to 2022, it was able to round off well.</p>
<p>After re-evaluating its operational agenda ahead, Netflix remains braced to reaccelerate revenue growth while providing premium services for customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-one-subscription/">Coinbase One: American Crypto Exchange to Roll Out Subscription Service in 35 Countries</a></p>
<p>American crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> is bracing up to roll out its subscription service &#8211; Coinbase One. According to a Thursday <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/new-updates-to-coinbase-one-zero-trading-fees-boosted-staking-rewards-and" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>, the zero trading fee subscription service will start out in Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. However, there are plans to extend the rollout to at least 32 other countries within the shortest time possible. A company statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Coinbase One is rolling out to full availability in the coming months, and we plan to expand to additional markets internationally.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase One, which has been in testing in the US since 2021, allows subscribers to pay a monthly fee of $29.99. With the subscription, users may trade for free throughout the month and also get amplified staking rewards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, subscribers will have exclusive access to industry insights and analytics from Messari and CoinTracker. And in addition to that, the subscription will also offer US members pre-filled tax return documents &#8211; Form 8949. That is, users do not have to go through the hassle of filing crypto taxes. Instead, they&#8217;ll enjoy the benefit of having their transactions organized automatically.</p>
<p>Coinbase also confirms that its new subscription service will give members round-the-clock access to its support team. That is, at any time of any day, members who need any form of assistance will get prompt help.</p>
<p>It might also be worth noting that Coinbase still has other plans to make the lives of subscribers much easier. Per its announcement, the exchange is also eyeing potential partnerships with the likes of Alto IRA (Individual Retirement Account) and Blockworks’ Permissionless and Lemonade.</p>
<h2>Coinbase One to Boost Exchange&#8217;s Global Reach</h2>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, the launch of the subscription service is part of Coinbase’s efforts to expand its global reach.  And with plans to offer the service in at least 35 countries, the exchange is looking to further deepen its roots across the globe.</p>
<p>It might be interesting to note that this launch comes after CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brian-armstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Armstrong</a> recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-uk-europe-market-us-regulatory/">suggested</a> that Coinbase might be moving out of the United States. At the time, Armstrong cited regulatory uncertainty in the country as the reason behind the company’s consideration. However, the CEO has since changed his earlier position, confirming that the exchange will no longer exit the US.</p>

<p>QuickSwap has become the latest DEX to integrate dTWAP for traders to cut down on the price impact of their orders. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/quickswap-orb-dtwap-dex-orders/">QuickSwap Integrates Orb-Powered dTWAP for Cheaper Price Impact on DEX Orders</a></p>
<p>Leading Polygon decentralized exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/quickswap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuickSwap</a> recently integrated dTWAP for DEXs. Powered by <a href="https://www.orbs.com/dtwap/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Orbs</a>, dTWAP, the fully permissionless and composable DeFi protocol, will grant QuickSwap dragons access to its algorithmic trading strategy. This means that traders can lower the price impact of their orders without incurring additional costs. Meanwhile, besides dTWAP, QuickSwap dragons will also deploy Orbs &#8211; infrastructure for Limit Swap orders.</p>
<h2>Closer Look at QuickSwap &#8211; dTWAP Development</h2>
<p>The QuickSwap-dTWAP development follows similar integrations by the Orbs-powered protocol with SpookySwap, Spirit, and Pangolin. Furthermore, the latest dTWAP integration underpins the technical working relationship between QuickSwaps and the separate decentralized execution layer Orbs. Both projects leveraged dTWAP&#8217;s smart contract audits and comprehensive developer documentation to integrate the protocol with QuickSwap.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://defillama.com/dexs/quickswap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DeFiLlama</a>, QuickSwap&#8217;s transaction volume for the past week exceeds $209 million. Furthermore, the decentralized layer-2 digital trading platform&#8217;s transaction volume in the last 24 hours exceeds $30 million. As a DEX automated market maker, QuickSwap&#8217;s offerings comprise multi-chain swaps, limit, order, and &#8216;best price trades&#8217;. However, the dTWAP integration will expand current offerings and increase transaction volumes from cost-conscious traders.</p>
<p>As an algorithmic trading strategy, TWAP also sees a lot of use cases in centralized finance (CeFi). The tool helps the protocol cut down the impact of large orders by reducing them into smaller portions.</p>
<p>Setting up a dTWAP order is relatively seamless and requires the specification of three parameters. These include the number of intervals, max duration, and the trade interval.</p>
<p>Users are also required to switch to the dTWAP UI to make the execution of trades easier and better manageable. The trade user interface features a customizable dashboard that updates changes in order in real time.</p>
<p>For instance, the &#8216;number of intervals&#8217; parameter lets the user choose the exact number of individual trades, after which the estimated trading interval is calculated. &#8216;Max duration&#8217; is the optimum time to execute the total amount of individual trades on the full dTWAP order. Lastly, &#8216;trade interval&#8217; establishes the time gap between each trade. However, users can edit this parameter to reflect the order sheet&#8217;s corresponding trade sizes and number changes.</p>
<h2>dTWAP</h2>
<p>The dTWAP protocol is the go-to tool in the decentralized finance space for algorithmic orders. Backed by the Orbs network L3 technology, the protocol is expected to experience substantial growth in usage as it adds support for additional DEXs. dTWAP is currently integrated with 4 DEXs across 3 different chains, accounting for its $200 million+ transaction volume in the past week.</p>
<h2>Orbs</h2>
<p>The Orbs Network is executed by secure permissionless validators that use the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. Founded in 2017, Orbs launched its mainnet and token in March 2019 and has a development team of more than 30 people. The backend staff of the open, decentralized, public blockchain infrastructure is based in offices in the Middle East (Tel Aviv), Europe (London), North America (New York), and Asia (Tokyo and Seoul).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/meta-details-ai-chips/">Meta Shares Details of Its AI Chips for First Time</a></p>
<p>For the very first time, Facebook parent <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms Inc</a> (NASDAQ: META) publicly announced that it is working on custom computer chips which will help the company with its artificial intelligence and video processing tasks.</p>
<p>Ahead of the virtual event on Thursday, May 18, Meta disclosed its internal silicon chip projects for the very first time while discussing the company&#8217;s AI technical infrastructure investments. Investors have been keen on knowing about Meta&#8217;s investments in AI along with the related data center hardware.</p>
<p>Over the last year, Meta has announced multiple layoffs as the company works on streamlining its operations while embarking on &#8220;a year of efficiency&#8221;. However, designing and building indigenous chips is always an expensive path for companies to undertake.</p>
<p>But Meta&#8217;s vice president of infrastructure Alexis Bjorlin believes that the improved performance will justify the investment. Recently, Meta has been overhauling its data center designs to focus on other energy-efficient techniques for reducing excess heat and liquid cooling.</p>
<p>For e.g. the company&#8217;s new computer chips, the Meta Scalable Video Processor, or MSVP, will process and transmit video to users while cutting down on energy requirements. Bjorlin said that there were no options available commercially to handle the task of processing and delivering 4 billion videos a day, as effectively as Meta wants.</p>
<p>Also, another processor Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA, is the first in Meta&#8217;s family of chips that will help with various AI-specific tasks. The new MTIA chip shall specifically handle &#8220;inference&#8221;, an already-trained AI model that makes a prediction or takes action.</p>
<p>This AI-powered &#8220;inference&#8221; chip will power Meta&#8217;s recommendation algorithm used to show content and ads in people&#8217;s news feeds. However, Bjorlin didn&#8217;t speak about who the manufacturer is, but the blog post shows a “fabricated in TSMC 7nm process”.</p>
<h2>Meta&#8217;s Multi-Generational Roadmap</h2>
<p>Bjorlin said that Meta has a &#8220;multi-generational roadmap&#8221; for its family of AI chips which will include processors used for training AI models. As per the Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/inside-metas-scramble-catch-up-ai-2023-04-25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> earlier, Meta canceled its AI inference chip project and started another one scheduled to roll out by 2025.</p>
<p>Bjorlin said that since Meta isn&#8217;t in the business of cloud computing, the company didn&#8217;t feel compelled to talk about the internal data center chip projects. She <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/18/meta-pulls-the-curtain-back-on-its-ai-chips-for-the-first-time.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you look at what we’re sharing &#8211; our first two chips that we developed &#8211; it’s definitely giving a little bit of a view into what are we doing internally. We haven’t had to advertise this, and we don’t need to advertise this, but you know, the world is interested.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meta&#8217;s new hardware works effectively with the company&#8217;s PyTorch software. This has become one of the most popular tools used by third-party developers in creating AI apps. The new hardware will eventually power several metaverse-related tasks, including augmented reality and virtual reality.</p>
<p>Additionally, Meta has also created a generative AI-powered coding assistant which will help the company&#8217;s developers to easily create and develop software. Meta said that it will continue to contribute to open-source technologies and AI research driving technological innovation ahead.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/youtube-40b-revenue-ceo/">Google’s YouTube Generated About $40B in Revenue in Past Year, CEO Neal Mohan Says</a></p>
<p>YouTube LLC, a product of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google LLC</a>, which is under <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alphabet Inc</a> (NASDAQ: GOOGL), reported a revenue of nearly $40 billion in the past 12 months according to its Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan. The American online video-sharing and social media platform, however, recorded a decline in revenue for the third consecutive time. According to Mohan, the increased competition in the social media industry has reduced the volume of advertising. Furthermore, the company noted that there was an overall decline in digital advertising compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, GOOGL shares edged 1.65 percent higher on Thursday to close the day trading around $122.83. The $1.5 trillion valued tech behemoth has seen its stock rise about 40 percent YTD to trade around $123.24 during the after-hours session.</p>
<p>YouTube remains heavily reliant on the advertisement sector to collect revenue for its shareholders.</p>
<p>“Monetization for us, first and foremost, is driven by advertising,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-18/youtube-generated-40-billion-in-sales-in-past-year-ceo-says" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Mohan.</p>
<p>Speaking at the MoffettNathanson technology conference on Thursday, Mohan, noted that YouTube will continue to take emerging opportunities in advertising including YouTube Shorts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the company offers a premium subscription platform for users who do not want to have ads in their videos. Dubbed YouTube Premium and formerly referred to as YouTube Red, has millions of subscribers but the company has not recently released its detailed financial results. The company has other revenue collection avenues including YouTube TV which is available in the United States for a subscription of about $65.</p>
<h2>Closer Look at YouTube Parent Company</h2>
<p>Earlier last month, Alphabet announced the financial results for the first quarter of 2023. During the first quarter, the company announced an expenditure of about $2.6 billion related to reductions in its workforce. As the company narrowed down to the artificial intelligence (AI) industry through its cloud sector. In total, Alphabet reported a revenue of about $69.78 billion during the first quarter.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, YouTube ads generated a revenue of about $6.69 billion during the first quarter of 2023 compared to $6.869 billion reported during the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>The company announced huge progress in deep computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) in its bid to revolutionize internet searches.</p>
<p>Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Resilience in Search and momentum in Cloud resulted in Q1 consolidated revenues of $69.8 billion, up 3% year over year, or up 6% in constant currency. We remain committed to delivering long-term growth and creating capacity to invest in our most compelling growth areas by re-engineering our cost base.”</p></blockquote>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-mixed-q4-full-year-2023/">Alibaba Group Announces Mixed Q4 and Full Year 2023 Financial Results, BABA Shares Drop 5.41%</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alibaba-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alibaba Group Holding Ltd</a> (NYSE: BABA) announced the financial results for the quarter that ended on March 31 ( fiscal Q4) and the full fiscal year 2023 on Thursday, May 18. The Chinese multinational technology company with a huge presence in the e-commerce industry announced revenue of RMB 208.200 billion, about $30.316 billion, during the quarter that ended on March 31.  While the revenue in the quarter increased by about 2 percent year-over-year, analysts surveyed by REFINITIV expected the company to report revenue of about 210.2 billion yuan in the quarter.</p>
<h2>Alibaba in Its Fiscal Q4 2023</h2>
<p>As for the Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, Alibaba posted about RMB1.34, which is around $0.20. Although the company’s Non-GAAP EPS increased by approximately 35 percent year-over-year, analysts surveyed by REFINITIV expected the tech giant to post 2.08 yuan. The company’s Non-GAAP net income was RMB 27.375 billion, about $3.986 billion, thus representing an increase of about 38 percent year-over-year during the quarter.</p>
<p>Valued at around $231.13 billion, the Chinese tech giant continued to separate its businesses to ensure independence and greater service output.</p>
<p>“In an increasingly complex world, we have proactively transformed our organization to strengthen the competitiveness of our businesses through greater independence to address the evolving needs of different customers and capture new opportunities,” said Daniel Zhang, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.</p>
<p>For instance, Alibaba announced a full spin-off of its Cloud Intelligence Group through a stock dividend distribution to existing shareholders to ensure its independence as a publicly traded company.</p>
<h2>Alibaba Full-Year Results</h2>
<p>For the full fiscal year 2023, Alibaba reported a revenue of about RMB 868.687 billion, around $126.491 billion, representing an increase of approximately 2 percent YoY. As a result, the company posted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of RMB 6.82, or about $0.99, thereby representing an increase of approximately 4 percent YoY basis.</p>
<p>“We have established a capital management committee at the Alibaba board level to undertake a comprehensive capital management plan to enhance shareholder value. Alibaba is committed to improving shareholders’ return through the implementation of a robust capital allocation framework,” <a href="https://data.alibabagroup.com/ecms-files/1532295521/e6f712b2-580c-4adf-ae1b-77c15c1ac262/Alibaba%20Group%20Announces%20March%20Quarter%20and%20Full%20Fiscal%20Year%202023%20Results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Toby Xu, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba Group.</p>
<p>For instance, the company announced its board approved the process to start exploring an <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-initial-public-offering-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPO</a> for the Cainiao Smart Logistics Group and Freshippo. Furthermore, the company announced a restructuring plan to ensure all its major business groups are headed by a different Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>As the Chinese market slowly recovers from the Covid-19 restrictions that affected businesses&#8217; supply chains, Alibaba is optimistic about posting better financial results amid the automation of its operations through AI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-spot-trading-tradingview/">Binance Integrates Its Spot Trading Platform with TradingView</a></p>
<p>The Binance Spot market trading platform has been <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/binance-integrates-with-tradingview-to-enhance-trading-capabilities-301828343.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">integrated</a> with TradingView, a leading charting platform that offers traders a greater insight into the markets. The news broke via a press release seen on Thursday, May 18.</p>
<h2>Providing Greater Insight into the Market via Tools and Data</h2>
<p>With the integration, users of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> will have access to a wide range of tools featured on TradingView, enabling them to approach their trades with greater insight into the market and deploy a wider range of strategies in their trades. They’ll also be able to access TradingView tools via the Binance interface without a secondary log-in.</p>
<p>Binance had earlier integrated its derivatives offering with the charting platform, and the latest initiative is a reflection of an ongoing effort to give users of the platform more analytical trading tools, a press release from the company said.</p>
<h2>Conferring Legitimacy on Tokens among Traditional Investors</h2>
<p>The latest integration will give more exposure to Binance’s high liquidity products to existing TradingView users, who mostly invest in traditional financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. The press release said that the TradingView integration will attract traditional investors who rely on technical tools provided by TradingView to access opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>It added that the availability of advanced charting tools will further confer legitimacy on digital asset tokens as investable instruments, despite the traditional skepticism of conservative investors.</p>
<h2>Creating Exposure to Traditional Investors</h2>
<p>Catherine Chen, who heads Binance’s VIP and Institutional divisions, said that the availability of level 1 and level 2 market data and advanced charting in Tradingview will act as a boost that will help in driving development in the growing cryptocurrency market. She added that these tools will engender the confidence of mainstream investors in the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Chen said that institutional investors that have shown interest in cryptocurrency investment have made demands for these data and analytical tools and that with the integration with TradingView, this class of investors will be able to navigate the market with a higher sense of confidence and assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users now have the convenience of a single sign-on to utilize TradingView&#8217;s interface to trade directly on Binance, the largest and most liquid digital asset exchange,&#8221; Chen said.</p>
<h2>Binance Futures Already Supports TradingView</h2>
<p>Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges and has listed more than 350 tokens. There are currently 1400 pairs available for trading on its spot market listing and 260 pairs available on its futures trading platform. The exchange boasts high liquidity, depth, and low fees.</p>
<p>Last December, Binance announced the integration of its Binance Futures with Tradingview. It gave users of its futures platform access to technical analysis tools. The latest spot market integration is a result of the success of the futures platform integration.</p>

<p>The CBDC Private Ledger, according to Ripple, will handle tens of thousands of transactions per second.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-cbdc-central-banks/">Ripple Labs Debuts CBDC Platform for Central Banks</a></p>
<p>Popular blockchain payments firm <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple Labs Inc</a> is set to launch its own Central Bank Digital Currency <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(CBDC)</a> platform, which will allow central banks, governments, and financial institutions to issue digital currencies.</p>
<p>The news comes shortly after Ripple and the Central Bank of Montenegro <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/montenegro-ripple-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> to collaborate on the development of a pilot project for a national digital currency.</p>
<p>This platform&#8217;s goal is to equip Central Banks with the technology and infrastructure required to issue and operate their own CBDCs. Through Ripple’s CBDC platform, government agencies will be permitted to manage and customize the entire CBDC lifecycle including minting, distribution, redemption, and token burning.</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform will enable financial institutions to administer and engage in CBDC-related inter-institutional settlement and distribution functions. This could involve facilitating the secure and efficient transfer of CBDCs between financial institutions, enabling interoperability and settlement finality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Central banks can issue both wholesale and retail CBDCs, which can also be used to conduct offline transactions. This would enable users to perform transactions with their CBDCs even if they did not have an active internet connection.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that the specific features and capabilities of CBDCs, including offline transaction support, would be determined by each central bank&#8217;s design choices and requirements.</p>
<p>Ripple said it would demonstrate use cases for the platform as part of the e-HKD pilot, a program of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the de facto Central bank. Additionally, it is also <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/press-release/2023/20230518e4a1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with Taiwan&#8217;s Fubon Bank</a> to tokenize real estate assets and develop stock trading products as part of the e-HKD trial.</p>
<h2>CBDC Platform Enhanced by Ripple’s Private Ledger</h2>
<p>Notably, the CBDC platform is an improved version of Ripple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-cbdcs-private-ledger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private ledger</a>, launched in 2021 to issue CBDCs. It is built on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripples-xrp-8-price-pump-court-twist/">XRP</a> Ledger but on a new private ledger.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ripple has been leveraging the XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain protocol, in its existing technology solutions. The firm has utilized the XRP Ledger for various applications, including facilitating fast and efficient transaction settlement.</p>
<p>The CBDC Private Ledger would leverage Ripple&#8217;s existing blockchain technology, specifically the XRP Ledger, to enable Central banks to create and distribute their digital currencies securely and efficiently. The goal is to deliver a holistic solution that meets the unique needs of Central banks, such as scalability, security, and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>The CBDC Private Ledger, according to Ripple, will handle tens of thousands of transactions per second. This compares to the previous hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. By collaborating with central banks to develop CBDCs, Ripple aimed to support the modernization of the global financial system and promote the adoption of digital currencies.</p>
<p>In a bid to advance its business reach, Ripple has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-acquires-metaco-250m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid</a> $250 million to Switzerland-based firm, Metaco in order to expand its remittance network into institutional Bitcoin custody.</p>
