However, my journey has also revealed the true costs of overlooking privacy in bitcoin transactions. </p><p>Through firsthand experiences and lessons learned, I've come to appreciate the paramount importance of protecting personal information and maximizing privacy levels. In this article, I will share my insights on the perils of sacrificing privacy in Bitcoin transactions and the steps I've taken to reclaim control over my financial freedom.</p><h2>The Price Of Transparent Transactions</h2><p>My initial enthusiasm for Bitcoin's privacy potential was met with a harsh reality: without the appropriate privacy measures, my transactions were anything but anonymous. I felt that this made the risk of theft loom large, as hackers could identify and target wallets holding substantial sums of bitcoin. Witnessing others<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/18/history-of-bitcoin-hacks-alternative-currency"> fall victim to these attacks</a> made me realize the grave financial losses that could result from a lack of privacy.</p><p>And beyond my individual concerns, I began to feel that neglecting privacy in bitcoin transactions held broader societal implications. When transactions lack anonymity, they can become tools for profiling and targeting individuals for various purposes. This erosion of privacy could in turn breed a loss of trust in Bitcoin, as users are likely seeking a more secure and permissionless alternative to the fiat monetary system. Bitcoin's true potential can only be realized when privacy is given the importance it deserves.</p><h2>Reclaiming Privacy And Financial Freedom</h2><p>Awakening to the costs of negligence, I made a conscious decision to reclaim control over my financial privacy. I took some proactive steps to protect my personal information and enhance my privacy levels. Here are the strategies I adopted:</p><ol><li>Embracing privacy-enhancing technologies: I employed a virtual private network (VPN) and Tor to encrypt my internet traffic and shield my identity, making it more challenging for prying eyes to track my online activity.</li><li>Harnessing <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-are-bitcoin-mixers">CoinJoin and Whirlpool</a>: CoinJoin technology, particularly through solutions like Whirlpool, allowed me to mix my bitcoin transactions with those of others, significantly bolstering my privacy and making it arduous for outsiders to trace my bitcoin activity.</li><li>Labeling and management: By meticulously managing my unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), I decoupled my transaction history, embraced stealth addresses and exercised coin control, enhancing my overall privacy.</li><li>Breaking the address reuse habit: I committed myself to avoiding address reuse, opting for unique addresses for each bitcoin transaction that I conduct. This simple yet crucial practice minimized the ability of others to track and monitor my bitcoin transactions.</li><li>Peer-to-peer purchases: To minimize the exposure of my personal information and transaction details, I shifted towards peer-to-peer transactions instead of relying solely on exchanges.</li><li>Mindful information sharing: I became vigilant about the personal information I shared online, understanding that every piece of data could be exploited to identify and track my financial activities. Utilizing pseudonyms and aliases whenever possible shielded my identity.</li></ol><h2>Reclaiming Control</h2><p>Through my own experiences, I've witnessed the true cost of sacrificing privacy in bitcoin transactions. However, by taking proactive measures to protect my personal information and enhance my privacy levels, I've reclaimed control over my financial freedom. </p><p>Bitcoin's promise of decentralization, security and pseudonymity can only be fully realized when we prioritize and safeguard our privacy. Let us stand together, empowered by the knowledge that protecting our assets and privacy leads to a more secure and liberated future.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Prasad Prabhakaran.

Captains had been struggling with poor navigation since the onset of global trade. Though sailors could easily measure latitude by gauging the sun’s height, longitude was very hard to determine and inapt techniques veered vessels of course. Without visual bearings, humans were sailing blind on the open seas. The increased travel time led to scurvy, delays and ships smashing on the rocks — losing crew and cargo forever to the deep.<br><br>Fortunately, a genius Brit came up with the solution — the <em>chronometer</em>, a clock that could keep its beat on the volatile seas. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison">John Harrison</a> was this genius and his invention outperformed crude astronomical techniques that relied on clear skies, number tables and hours of calculation. There was no second best. <br><br>But his innovation wasn’t adopted!<br><br>According to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_(book)">Longitude</a>” by Dava Sobel, it took until 1828 for the Board of Longitude to be disbanded and the chronometer to reach mass adoption.<br><br>Why on Earth did it take so long?</p><h2>Going Beyond The S Curve</h2><blockquote><p>“...the diffusion of innovations is a social process, even more than a technical one.”<br></p><p>–Everett M. Rogers, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9U1K5LjUOwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Diffusion Of Innovations</a>”</p></blockquote><p>Another timekeeping device was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is a decentralized clock in cyberspace enabling accurate economic calculation and financial navigation in the uncertain waters of life. Though its properties are superior in the eyes of its users, the rate of adoption is not as spectacular.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Many claim it’s at the brink of crossing the chasm: “This is the internet of 1995!” But in our bullishness, we expected an <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-iphone-users#:~:text=Statista%2C%20The%20Verge-,What%20Percentage%20of%20People%20Have%20iPhones%3F,at%207.33%20billion%20in%202023.">iPhone-like adoption</a>. Certainly, ideas spread faster than ever before, but to consider this trend as the sole variable governing adoption rate is oversimplifying it. The longitude story shows us that, even when an innovation is a complete no-brainer, it may take longer than you think to catch on.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Rogers’ adopter categories (blue) and the S curve of cumulative adoption (orange). </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations"><em>Source</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Everett Rogers was the social scientist who popularized the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations">observation of how innovations diffuse across the social medium by a normal distribution</a>. By aggregating adopters over time, the uptake looks like an S curve that hockey-sticks upward after a <em>critical mass</em> of users has been reached. This model gained popularity early this century as it explained the exponential growth of mobile phones and the internet.</p><p>But Rogers’ research encompasses more than just this memorable model. In his book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Diffusion-Innovations-5th-Everett-Rogers/dp/0743222091">Diffusion Of Innovations</a>,” he discerned five parameters that govern a technology’s adoption rate.</p><h2>The Five Perceived Attributes Of Bitcoin</h2><h3>One: Relative Advantage</h3><blockquote><p>“Diffusion is a particular type of communication in which the message content that is exchanged is concerned with a new idea.”</p><p>–Rogers, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9U1K5LjUOwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Diffusion Of Innovations</a>”</p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin’s perceived value is determined by two things: needs and price. <br><br>In order to have a need, one has to experience a problem. The issues with fiat money have long been recognized within the cypherpunk and sound money communities, and they were the first to adopt. But outside of these social cliques, the awareness of dollar debasement is low. A lack of financial education and fiat immersion leads people not to seek solutions. Without a <a href="https://bitcoin-graffiti.medium.com/emerald-city-syndrome-b554ee43945c">proper diagnosis</a>, nobody needs a cure. <br><br>Bitcoin’s price is slowing adoption and unit bias makes the coin look expensive. People don’t know it's subdividable. The price is also volatile, obfuscating its store-of-value function. You can contrast this with other adoption cases. For example, mobile phone users perceive value instantly — calling anyone, anytime, anywhere. But with Bitcoin, 80% drawdowns and “number go down” for years are not uncommon. It takes a high level of abstraction to see Bitcoin's value and high conviction not to be shaken out of the market.<br></p><h3>Two: Compatibility</h3><blockquote><p>“Potential adopters may not recognize that they have a need for an innovation until they become aware of the new idea or its consequences.”<br></p><p>–Rogers, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9U1K5LjUOwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Diffusion Of Innovations</a>”</p></blockquote><p>The first version of a new technology is rarely a perfect match for the entire market, catering only to a niche group of innovators. According to Rogers, an innovation needs to be <em>reinvented</em> to find product-market fit. <br><br>Bitcoin is currently compatible with the financially educated. But beyond this group, Bitcoin is not perceived to be in line with people’s value and belief systems. It’s still a niche product in the innovator stage.<br><br>For Bitcoin to reach more early adopters, it has to be reinvented for different global markets. Currently, two distinct paths are emerging: its narrative and medium-of-exchange (MoE) usage. Here are three examples:</p><ol><li>“Banking the unbanked”: Bitcoin can help people in developing countries to leapfrog the legacy banking system. <a href="https://www.starlink.com/">Starlink</a> and smartphones enable adoption where an MoE, system for remittances and a bank account in your pocket have high value. Leaders in countries like <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1526029996787216387?lang=en">El Salvador</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKydH0bLA0k&amp;t=45s">Mexico</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUU8ms63-e4&amp;t=1463s">Indonesia</a> use such narratives to explain Nakamoto’s invention.</li><li>“Cyber warfare”: In his book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Softwar-Projection-National-Strategic-Significance/dp/B0BW358F37">Softwar</a>,” <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery">Jason Lowery</a> uses military language to reinvent bitcoin as a geopolitical asset to be fought over by states in cyberspace, creating a new domain of war. Through the military lens, he recoins Bitcoin as “Bitpower,” creating a vision in which ASICs convert energy to raise a cryptographic wall, increasing the cost of attack on financial data. Lowery is a change agent, someone who translates Bitcoin to make it compatible with the U.S. army.</li><li>“Grid balancing”: This is the language for the energy sector clique. Proof-of-work mining can be used to make energy grids more resilient, balance supply and demand and turn a profit out of stranded energy sources.</li></ol><p>These narratives are designed to make Bitcoin more compatible with specific social groups that speak different languages. With increased understanding, these groups will drive the creation of new uses and applications.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Three: Complexity</h3><p>The chronometer was far ahead of its time and it took years before crafty entrepreneurs copied and manufactured the device. Similarly, Nakamoto had to introduce his invention to its first adopters on the <a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/">Bitcoin Talk forum</a>. Since then, entrepreneurs have had to join and build services on top of the protocol, including cold storage solutions, mnemonic seed phrases and exchanges. These upgrades improved the user experience, but compared to the mobile phone, Bitcoin’s still relatively complicated.<br><br>This also holds true at Bitcoin’s development level. New software developers experience a steep barrier of entry implementing Bitcoin in applications — the ecosystem is not as well developed as regular web development. And while it’s true that Bitcoin is not what it was back in 2008, and upgrades continue to make it more accessible — with groups like <a href="https://lightningdevkit.org/">Spiral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk">Breeze</a> having recently launched software development kits to make integration easier, for instance — where is the Steve Jobs “boom” moment? </p><p>We are still waiting for the out-of-the-box killer app.&nbsp;</p><h3>Four: Trialability</h3><blockquote><p>“One must learn by doing the thing, for though you think you know it, you have no certainty until you try.</p><p>–Sophocles, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FylP8XOYd8oC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=%E2%80%9COne+must+learn+by+doing+the+thing,+for+though+you+think+you+know+it,+you+have+no+certainty+until+you+try.%22+sophocles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FjCEN6bW6Q&amp;sig=ACfU3U2Vw_aWYOdY6weUoGyotX2vP5jjOw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjsse6_36z_AhV8j4kEHdl5BKAQ6AF6BAgGEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9COne%20must%20learn%20by%20doing%20the%20thing%2C%20for%20though%20you%20think%20you%20know%20it%2C%20you%20have%20no%20certainty%20until%20you%20try.%22%20sophocles&amp;f=false">The Trachiniae</a>”</p></blockquote><p>The chronometer had a long trial period. By the time captains could update their peers on improved navigation, months of trial and travel had passed. The device was deemed good only if it was accurate along the full sailing journey. On top of that, a ship was underway for months, retarding the word of mouth.<br><br>The Bitcoin journey takes time, too. Since price is volatile, it is not uncommon to be "under water" for some time. This can have an effect on the advantages perceived by the user, but may also deter peers from adopting. The trial period may be as long as the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769">reward halving</a>, and true advocates are only minted after enough time in the market.<br><br>Though trialability of Bitcoin is easy — one can just buy a little — the overall net benefit is only great with a larger purchase, proving the point that the full trial period might be as long as one halving.</p><h3>Five: Observability</h3><p>Bitcoin is digital and thus poorly visible. It is not like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T">Ford Model T</a> racing over the roads with its advantages on display. Most people only learn about Bitcoin in news reports when it has broken through its all-time highs, which can last only for a relatively-short duration.</p><p>Adoption speeds up with more visible applications. Perhaps in the not too distant future, Bitcoin miners may be integral parts of power plants and homes. People might send Bitcoin with their phones to friends on the street. Or they see the Lightning buttons on a <a href="http://iris.to/">Nostr client</a> and discover it’s possible to zap satoshis to their favorite influencers.<br><br>Also, increased wealth through bitcoin is hard to spot. Unless Bitcoiners start wearing Gucci and driving orange Lambos, rich HODLers are hard to observe. But wearing a giga-chad t-shirt might not be in vain and could potentially speed up the spread.</p><h2>Reward</h2><p>Harrison slaved away at his timekeeper alone for 20 years. His invention got blocked and retarded by bureaucracy, but he finally got his £20,000 bounty. Smart entrepreneurs were able to scale his ingenious design to mass production, bringing chronometers aboard ships where they saved time, cargo and lives. It took a long time, but the chronometer eventually floated to the top.<br><br>Today, the people of Earth are financially adrift. Like ships ignorant of longitude, they sail blindly through the treacherous waters of life, unable to financially calculate. We are barbarians living in the pre-science Stone Age of money. Future generations will look at us in dismay.<br><br>But this is about human psychology and how people embrace new ideas. In hindsight, world-changing technologies all appear self-evident. You’re right in the middle of a paradigm shift, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ignites-a-scientific-revolution">the ignition of scientific revolution</a>, and it is hard to see where things are going.<br><br>Bitcoin won’t diffuse rapidly like Facebook, the internet or the iPhone. Much needs to be built, reinvented and translated before the masses get onboard. Like with electricity, base layers are hard to grok without the actual appliances.<br><br>We will get there.<br><br>But it will take longer than you think.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Bitcoin Graffiti.

Among the concerning trends I have observed is the growing number of patients who not only suffer from poor health but also find themselves trapped in a cycle of financial struggle and dependency.</p><p>In this article, I will explore the connection between fiat currency and the emergence of what can be called "fiat people" — individuals with high time preferences, unhealthy lifestyles, poverty and an increasing inability to care for themselves. Additionally, I will delve into how Bitcoin offers a potential solution to these challenges. </p><h2>The Health Impacts Of Fiat Currency</h2><p>“Fiat currency” refers to a form of money that is not backed by a physical commodity such as gold or silver but is instead declared as legal tender by a government. This system allows for the creation of money by central banks and is based on trust in the issuing authority. While fiat currency has its advantages, such as flexibility and ease of transactions, its inherent characteristics have unintended consequences that impact individual behavior and society as a whole, including manufactured inflation and monetary debasement.</p><p>Fiat currency, with its characteristics that can be easily manipulated and inflated, fosters a culture of instant gratification and short-term thinking. When the value of money becomes uncertain, individuals are incentivized to spend rather than save. Consequently, people develop a high time preference, prioritizing immediate consumption over long-term planning and investment.</p><p>This mindset leads to detrimental effects on personal health and well-being. People are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors such as excessive consumption of processed foods, lack of exercise and neglect of preventive healthcare measures. The consequences of these choices manifest in a rise in chronic illnesses, obesity rates, mental health issues and substance abuse problems. Individuals who cannot afford to regularly eat local whole foods often rely on processed foods made with seed oils and other unnatural ingredients, leading to a downward spiral of obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, renal failure, stroke and ultimately a complete dependence on the rest of society to care for them. </p><p>The prevalence of a high time preference perpetuated by fiat currency creates an environment where individuals fail to accumulate wealth and secure their financial futures. Continuous spending without proper savings leaves people vulnerable to unexpected expenses and economic downturns. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of their incomes, further exacerbating financial struggles. </p><p>Without the means to invest in education, acquire assets or start businesses, individuals are trapped in a cycle of poverty and limited economic mobility. Poverty, in turn, restricts access to quality healthcare, education and resources necessary for personal development, leading to a decline in overall well-being and increased dependence on external assistance.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is A Healthier Choice</h2><p>Recognizing the detrimental effects of fiat currency on individuals and society is crucial in paving the way towards positive change. Bitcoin offers a potential solution. Bitcoin operates outside the control of central banks, with a limited supply and a transparent nature that encourages responsible financial behavior and personal empowerment.</p><p>By returning to a form of hard money, individuals can regain control over their financial future. The fixed supply of bitcoin encourages savings and investment, fostering a culture of long-term thinking and responsible financial behavior. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin removes the dependence on centralized authorities and reduces the risk of inflationary practices, providing stability and transparency. </p><p>Embracing Bitcoin and decentralized financial systems can provide individuals with the means to break free from the cycle of high time preference, poor health and financial dependence. Bitcoin empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their finances, allocate resources efficiently and invest in their personal well-beings and futures. </p><p>The link between fiat currency and the emergence of fiat society cannot be overlooked. As an emergency medicine physician, witnessing the consequences firsthand, it is clear that a shift towards alternative monetary systems like Bitcoin, combined with financial education and personal responsibility, can pave the way for a healthier, more financially-stable society. </p><p>Bitcoin offers a path to personal empowerment and financial stability by breaking free from the grip of fiat currency. By regaining control over their lives and finances, individuals can improve their well-beings, escape the cycle of poverty and create a more prosperous future. However, it is important to approach this transition with thoughtful consideration, education and accessibility to ensure inclusivity. Through embracing  Bitcoin, we can strive toward a society where people are not mere products of fiat currency but rather creators of their own destiny.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Travis Headley.

When crypto exchanges, stablecoins and banks are collapsing left and right, it looks suspiciously like we are already in the “suddenly” portion. And it is suddenly that currencies of the past have moved from the pocketbooks to the history books. </p><p>Hyperinflation is a general increase in prices by 50% or more in a single month. <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Hyperinflation-A-World-History/Liping/p/book/9780367529208">Alternatively</a>, sometimes economists and journalists use a lower rate of monthly inflation sustained over a year (but that still amounts to 100%, 500% or 1,000%). The imprecision leads to some confusion in what does or does not constitute a hyperinflation.</p><p>Definitional quibbles aside, the main point is to illustrate the ultimate death of a fiat currency. Hyperinflation of whichever caliber is a situation where money holders rush for the exits, like depositors in a bank run rush for their funds. Literally <em>anything</em> is better to hold on to than the melting ice cube that is a hyperinflating currency. </p><p>A hyperinflating currency is often accompanied by collapsing economies, lawlessness and widespread poverty; and is usually preceded by extremely large money printing in service of covering equally vast government deficits. Double- or triple-digit increases in general prices cannot happen without a massive expansion of the money supply; and that generally doesn’t take place unless a country’s fiscal authority has difficulty financing itself and leans on the monetary authority to run the printing presses.</p><h2>BACKGROUND: What Hyperinflation is and how it happens</h2><p>In 1956, the economist <a href="https://www.bu.edu/econ/files/2011/01/Cagan1.pdf">Phillip Cagan</a> wanted to study extreme cases of monetary dysfunction. As we’ve learned over the past few years, whenever prices go berserk there is a big kerfuffle about who’s to blame — greedy capitalists, vague supply chain bottlenecks, unprecedented money printing by the Fed and fiscal deficits by the Treasury or that evil-looking dictator halfway around the world.</p><p>Cagan wanted to abstract away from any changes in “real” incomes and prices, and therefore placed his threshold at 50% price rises <em>in a single month</em>; any offsetting or competing changes in real factors, said Cagan, can then be safely disregarded. The threshold stuck, even though 50% a month makes for <em>astronomically </em>high rates of inflation (equal to about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#:~:text=Economists%20usually%20follow%20Cagan's%20description,yearly%20rate%20of%2012974.63%25">13,000%</a> annually). The good news is that such an extreme collapse and mismanagement of fiat money is rare — so rare, in fact, that the Hanke-Krus World Hyperinflation Table, often considered the official list of all documented hyperinflation, contains “only” <a href="https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2017/04/Venezuela_Enters_the_Record_Book.pdf">57 entries</a>. (Updated for the last few years, its authors <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1452017414250500096">now claim</a> 62.) </p><p>The bad news is that inflation rates well below that very demanding threshold have destroyed many more societies and wreaked just as much havoc in their economic lives. Inflation “bites” at much, much lower rates than that required for going into “hyper.”</p><p>Nobody does inflation like us moderns. Even the most disastrous monetary collapses in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4981448_Modern_Hyper-_and_High_Inflations">centuries past</a> have been rather mild compared to the inflations and hyperinflations of the fiat age.</p><h2>What Hyperinflation Looks like</h2><p>“Hyperinflation very rarely occurs all of a sudden, without any early warning signs,” writes He Liping in his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperinflation-World-History-China-Perspectives/dp/1138560081"><em>Hyperinflation: A World History</em></a>. Rather, they stem from earlier episodes of high inflation that escalate into the hyper variety. </p><p>But it’s not particularly predictive, since most episodes of <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/022/0040/002/article-A007-en.xml">high inflation</a> do <em>not </em>descend into hyperinflation. So what causes general periods of high inflation in the tens or twenties of percent that most Western countries experienced in the aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic in 2021-22 is different from what causes some of those episodes to devolve into hyperinflation.</p><p>The list of culprits for <em>high </em>inflation regimes include</p><ul><li>Extreme supply shocks that cause prices of key commodities to rise rapidly for a sustained time.</li><li>Expansionary monetary policy that a) involves central bank printing a lot of new money, and/or b) commercial banks lending freely, without restraint. </li><li>Fiscal authorities run fiscal deficits and ensure that aggregate demand runs hot (above trend or above the economy’s capacity).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;For high inflations to turn into <em>hyperinflations</em>, more extreme events must take place. Usually, the nation-state itself is at risk such as during or after wars, a dominant national industry collapses or the public loses trust in the government entirely. More extreme versions of the above are usually involve</p><ul><li>A fiscal authority running extremely large deficits in response to nation-wide or dependent industry shocks (pandemics, war, systemic bank failures). </li><li>The debt is monetized by the central bank and forced upon the population, often through the use of laws that mandate payments in the nation’s currency or bans the use of foreign currencies. </li><li>Complete institutional decay; efforts to stabilize the money supply or the fiscal deficits fail. </li></ul><p>In a hyperinflation event, holding cash or cash balances becomes the most irrational of economic actions, yet the one thing a government needs its citizens to do. </p><p>There is only so much printing you can — or would — do if there weren’t underlying problems or fiscal authorities breathing down your neck; there are only so much additional money the public wishes to hold, and when you start up the presses, the seigniorage profit you can extract becomes smaller and smaller when they ditch your currency for literally anything else. (“People are exchanging their dollars for <a href="https://youtu.be/cbI31x3FpS0?t=122"><em>dog money</em></a>.”)</p><p>Everybody wants to transact, often trying to get their wages paid several times a day and head to the store to purchase <em>anything</em>. Everybody wants to borrow or consume on credit — since one’s debt will disappear in real terms — yet nobody wants to lend: banks usually <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-banks-idUSKBN1HV1GO">curtail lending</a>, and credit runs dry. Prior debts are completely wiped out, as they were fixed in nominal terms. A hyperinflation event closely resembles a “clean slate,” a way for collapsed nation-states to restart, monetarily speaking. They reshuffle the net ownership of hard assets like property, machinery, precious metals or foreign currency. Nothing of financial consequence remains: all credit ties are inflated into nothingness. Financial ties no longer exist. It’s the ultimate weapon of mass financial destruction.</p><h2>History of hyperinflations</h2><p>Though the first cited instance is usually revolutionary France, the modern times contain four clusters of hyperinflations. First, the 1920s when the losers of WWI printed away their debts and wartime reparations. This is where we get the wheelbarrow imagery and which Adam Fergusson’s classic <em>When Money Dies</em> so expertly chronicles.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Second, after the end of World War II, we have another bout of war-related regime collapses leading rulers to print away their unsustainable obligations — Greece, Philippines, Hungary, China, and Taiwan. </p><p>Third, around the year 1990 when the Soviet sphere of influence imploded, the Russian ruble as well as several Central Asian and Eastern European countries saw their defunct currencies inflate away into nothingness. Soviet-connected Angola followed suit, and, in the years before Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Peru again. </p><p>Fourth, the more recent economic basket cases of <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/why-dollarization-doesnt-work-in-zimbabwe/">Zimbabwe</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-tragedy-of-venezuela-1527177202">Venezuela</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/07/life-in-lebanon-under-hyperinflation/">Lebanon</a>. They all present stories of obscene mismanagement and state failure that while not exactly mirroring the previous clusters of hyperinflations, at least share their core features. </p><p>Egypt, Turkey and Sri Lanka are other nations whose currency debasements in 2022 were so stunningly bad as to merit a dishonorable mention. Though disastrous for these countries’ economies and tragic for the holders of their currencies — with head-spinning high inflation rates of 80% (<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/21/lessons-from-turkey-on-the-evils-of-high-inflation">Turkey</a>), 50%-ish (<a href="about:blank">Sri Lanka</a>) or over 100% (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/154bcd8c-a2ee-461f-83e4-dce1c8269171">Argentina</a>) — it is scant relief that their runaway monetary systems are long ways off to formally qualify as hyperinflations. You get terrible outcomes way before runaway inflation crosses the “hyper” threshold.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>High inflation episodes (double digits or more) are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188905001946">not stable</a>. The printing by authorities and monetary flight by users either accelerate or slow down; there is no such thing as a “stable” 20% inflation year after year. </p><p>What’s clear from the historical record is that <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/002205102760273805">hyperinflations</a> “are a modern phenomenon related to the need to print paper money to finance large fiscal deficits caused by wars, revolutions, the end of empires, and the establishment of new states.”</p><h3>They end in two ways: </h3><ol><li>Money becomes so worthless and dysfunctional that all its users have moved to another currency. Even viable governments that keep forcing their hyperinflating currencies onto the citizenry through legal tender and public receivability laws, receive only minor benefits from printing. Currency holders have left for harder monies or foreign cash; there is precious little seigniorage left to extract. Example: Zimbabwe 2007-2008, or Venezuela 2017-18. </li><li>Hyperinflation ends by fiscal and monetary reform of some sort. A new currency, often new rulers or constitution, as well as support from international organizations. In some cases, rulers seeing the writing on the wall purposefully hyperinflate their collapsing currency while preparing to jump to a new, stable one. Example: Brazil in the 1990s or Hungary in the 1940s. </li></ol><p>While currency collapses are a most painful reminder of monetary excesses, their ultimate causes are almost always <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/02/11/the-roots-of-hyperinflation">fiscal problems and political disarray</a> — a chronic weakness, a flailing dominant industry, a runaway fiscal spending regime. </p><p>The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">three basic functions of money</a> — <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a> — are impacted differently by instances of very high inflation or hyperinflation. Store of value is the <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Hyperinflation-A-World-History/Liping/p/book/9780367529208">first to go</a>, as evidenced by pictures of wheelbarrow inflation; the money becomes too unusable a vehicle through which to move value across time. The unit of account role seems remarkably resilient in that money users can <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2008/10/15/day-life-hyperinflation">change price tags</a> and adjust mental models to the ever-shifting nominal prices. Accounts from Zimbabwe, Lebanon or South America indicate that money users can keep “thinking” in a currency unit (keep performing economic calculation) even though the rapid changes in daily value makes it harder to do this well.</p><p>Both hyperinflation and high inflation are severe headwinds on economic output and a wasteful use of human efforts, but money’s “<a href="https://bitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-monetary-metric/">metric role</a>” doesn't immediately go away. The medium of exchange role, which economists have long held to be the <a href="https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/spring/summer-2019/money-debt-trust-central-banking">foundational monetary role</a> from which the other functions stem, seems to be the most resilient. You can transact, hot potato-style, even with hyperinflating money. </p><p>Read More &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">What is Money?</a></p><h2>What happens: The few winners and many losers </h2><p>The natural reaction of Germans and Austrians and Hungarians, wrote Adam Fergusson in his classic account of the hyperinflations in the 1920s <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/adam-fergusson/when-money-dies/9781586489953/"><em>When Money Dies</em></a>, was “to assume not so much that their money was falling in value as that the goods which it bought were becoming more expensive in absolute terms.” When prices rose, “people demanded not a stable purchasing power for the marks they had, but more marks to buy what they needed.” </p><p>Hundred years later — a different time in different lands with a different money — the same doubts go through people’s minds. Inflation, of its hyper-variety or the ones we’re living through in the 2020s, muddies people’s ability to make economic decisions. It gets harder to know how much something “costs,” if a business is making a real profit or if a household is adding to or depleting its savings.</p><p><em>The Economist’s</em> account of the effects of Turkey’s inflation last year summarized the economy-wide consequences of inflation running amok. Under high (or hyper-)inflation, time horizons shrink and decision-making collapses to day-to-day cash management. Like all inflations there are arbitrary redistributions of wealth: </p><ol><li>The economic cost of high inflation is the unpredictability of the price system, the volatility of prices themselves. If you think bitcoin’s exchange rate to the USD is “volatile,” you haven’t seen basic prices in hyperinflating countries — wages, assets, grocery stores, rents. It undermines consumers’ ability to plan or make economic choices. Production gets delayed, investment decisions postponed and the economy squeezed since spending decisions are brought forward to the present. </li><li>In a similar vein, price signals don’t work as well anymore. It’s harder to see through the nominal prices to the real economic factors of supply and demand — like the car window into the economy suddenly becoming foggy. Haggling over exact prices makes transaction costs shoot up, which benefit nobody; partially substituting the failing money for foreign currency adds a second layer of (often black-market) exchange rates to juggle. </li><li>It’s unfair. Those best placed to play the inflation game, to shelter their wealth through property, hard assets or foreign currencies, can protect themselves. It causes a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-two-realities-people-with-dollars-and-those-without-11553511600">rift</a> between those who can access foreign currency or hard assets, and those who cannot. </li></ol><p>While most people’s economic lives are disrupted by (hyper)inflation and in aggregate everyone loses, some people benefit along the way. </p><ul><li>The most obvious losers are those holding cash or cash balances, since these are straight away worth less. </li><li>The most direct beneficiaries are debtors, whose debt gets inflated away; insofar as they can have their incomes keep pace with the fast rises in prices, the real <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/who-bears-the-burden-of-dollars-falling-purchasing-power/">financial burden</a> of the debt disappears. The flipside of that is the creditor, who loses purchasing power when their fixed-value asset deflates into nothingness.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Do governments benefit from high or hyperinflation?</h3><p>There is a lot of nuance to whether governments benefit from high inflation. The government itself usually benefits, since seigniorage accrues to the issuer of the currency. But general tax collection doesn’t happen instantly and so taxes on past incomes may be paid later in less valuable, inflated money. Besides, a poorer real economy usually makes for less economic resources that a government can tax. </p><p>Another way governments benefit is that their expenses are usually capped in nominal terms while tax receipts rise in proportion to prices and incomes. </p><p>As a large debtor, a government all else equal, has an easier time nominally servicing its debt — indeed, large government debts and financial obligations are major reasons to hyperinflate the currency in the first place. On the other hand, international creditors quickly catch on and refuse to lend to a hyperinflating government, or demand that they borrow in foreign currency and at additional interest rates. </p><p>Some institutional features matter too. To take two recent examples from the U.S.: Social Security indexation and the loss of income from the Fed. While the debt that gets inflated away involves a government’s pension obligation to retirees, there may be indexed compensation when prices rise. In December 2022, Social Security payments were adjusted upwards by <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/latestCOLA.html">8.7%</a> to account for the inflation captured in CPI over the last year. In more extreme cases of inflation or hyperinflation, such compensation might be delayed, or less stable governmental institutions may lack such features altogether, which would result in cuts in financial welfare for the elderly.</p><p>Similarly, when the Fed hiked rates aggressively during 2022, it exposed itself to accounting losses. For the foreseeable future it has therefore suspended its <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/broke-federal-reserve/">$100 billion in annual remittances</a> to the Treasury. While a drop in the 6 trillion <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58946">federal outlay</a> bucket, it nevertheless shows how prior money printing can cause a loss of fiscal income in the future.</p><p>When a monetary authority has lost enough credibility (the money users give up a rapidly deteriorating money for precisely anything) it doesn’t much matter how one moves the small levers left under the monetary authority’s control. Hyperinflation, therefore, can be seen as a high inflation where the monetary authorities have lost control.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bottom line:</h2><p>Hyperinflations happen when the nation-state backers of a currency go out of business — as in the Balkan states and former Soviet Bloc countries in the early 1990s. They also happen from extreme mismanagement, from the Weimar Republic in the 1920s to the South American episodes in the 1980s and 1990s, or Venezuela and Zimbabwe more recently. </p><p>Remember that the German hyperinflation took place between 1922 and 1923, after wartime inflation (1914-1918) and postwar reparations debacle had gradually degraded the country’s finances and industrial capacity. Much like today’s monetary struggles, there was plenty of blame to go around but the point remains: it takes a long time for a thriving and monetary stable empire to devolve into the jaws of hyperinflationary chaos. </p><p>Every currency regime ends, gradually then suddenly. Perhaps things move faster today, but spotting a USD hyperinflation on the horizon (like <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636822077775941633">Balaji did</a> in March 2023) might be too early yet. While we might not have reached the “suddenly” part yet, we can’t be sure that the “gradually” hasn’t already begun.</p><p>America in 2023 features many of the ingredients often involved in hyperinflations: domestic turmoil, runaway fiscal deficits, a central bank unable to imbue credibility or manage its price stabilization goals, grave doubts about the banks’ solvency. </p><p>The history of hyperinflation is vast but mostly confined to the modern age of fiat. If it’s any guide for the future, a descent into hyperinflation happens much more slowly and takes a lot longer than a few months.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4NjYyNTY5MDA5OTQ4NDIz/what-is-hyperinflation-feature-image-no-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NjYyNTIwNDIzMDY1MzUx/what-is-hyperinflation-graph.png" height="542" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NjYyNTI4MjA3NjkzNTc1/hanke-krus-hyperinflation.png" height="312" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey’s #startsmall Pledges $5 Million Over 5 Years To Bitcoin Nonprofit Brink]]></title><description><![CDATA[The funding will provide a steady foundation for Brink to continue its mission of supporting Bitcoin development.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/startsmall-pledges-5-million-over-5-years-to-bitcoin-nonprofit-brink</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/startsmall-pledges-5-million-over-5-years-to-bitcoin-nonprofit-brink</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[brink]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Donations]]></category><category><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU3NjUwNDM3/bitcoin-tree.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin development nonprofit, Brink, has received a significant financial boost with a pledge of $5 million from Jack Dorsey's #startsmall organization.

Strike has partnered with Relampago in Mexico to enable transfers from U.S. dollars that are received as local currency in a recipient's bank account.</p><p>Immanuel Joy, CEO of Relampago, expressed pride in the partnership, stating, "By harnessing the Lightning Network, we enable instant, low-cost, cross-border payments and are transforming the financial landscape for millions of Latin American individuals."</p><p>Since its launch in December 2022, Strike has expanded Send Globally to over a dozen countries, including the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/strike-launches-remittances-to-philippines">Philippines</a>, Vietnam, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/strike-launches-instant-african-remittances">Nigeria</a>, and now Mexico. These countries are among the top 10 largest cross-border markets in the world.</p><p>Strike's expansion of Send Globally to Mexico demonstrates its commitment to providing accessible and efficient cross-border payment solutions. With the rising importance of remittances and the demand for faster and cheaper transfers, Strike's innovative approach has the potential to positively impact millions of people in Mexico and other countries around the world.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODA5NDM0MDkzMjA3/mexicos-proposed-crypto-laws-create-new-barriers-for-exchanges.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Investors Can Learn From The Bitcoin Maximalist Strategy]]></title><description><![CDATA[Many so-called “Bitcoin Maximalists” ascribe to certain strategies that can help more casual investors as well.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/lessons-from-the-bitcoin-maximalist-investment-strategy</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/lessons-from-the-bitcoin-maximalist-investment-strategy</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Maximalism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investing]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicholas Otieno]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Nicholas Otieno, a freelance writer focused on fintech and Bitcoin.</em></p><p>I’m aware that Bitcoin has become of great interest to many investors. But despite growing enthusiasm, sharp price volatility continues to worry and confuse many less-experienced investors.</p><p>A key way that I believe can help these investors beat their issues with bitcoin volatility is to begin following the principles of<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-maximalism.asp"> Bitcoin Maximalists</a>. Below, I’ve highlighted my key takeaways from this philosophy that I think can help more investors find the right path.</p><h2>Bitcoin Maxis Invest In What They Understand</h2><p>Maximalists are a group of investors who believe that bitcoin is the only digital asset needed and that its demand will grow into the future. They believe that all other cryptocurrencies are not worth anyone’s energy or time. From my interpretation, this group includes significant names like Jack Dorsey, Adam Back, Robert Kiyosaki, Michael Saylor and others.</p><p>The maxi only invests in what they understand (bitcoin) now and into the future. According to most maximalists, investing in a proven digital asset is safer than doing so for altcoins, which put investors’ money at greater risk. With the recent rise of bitcoin’s value, many people seek ways to profit from this asset class without understanding how it works. While investors can make fiat returns with bitcoin in<a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/crypto/how-to-make-money-fast-with-cryptocurrency/"> several ways</a> (like trading, staking, lending, mining and gaming), maxis prefer to hold the asset.</p><p>Most maximalists are successful in their investment journeys because they understand their financial goals, inherent risks and the overall market. These contrarian investors don’t always don’t the crowd but instead<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/646701c97459d877fe161adc/"> look</a> for opportunities in places where others may not. Their advocacy for Bitcoin is rooted in a deep understanding of the cryptocurrency and the role it plays in preserving and growing wealth. The maxis’ endorsement of Bitcoin is a reminder for other investors to think outside the box. The asset provides unique benefits that can help diversify investors’ portfolios and increase their wealth.</p><h2>Focus On The Process</h2><p>The maxis’ investing model is simple: Buy and hold bitcoin in<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rufaskamau/2022/05/30/how-to-safely-self-custody-your-bitcoin/?sh=56ccbe0b6431"> self-custody wallets</a> and let it accumulate value over time. The maximalists achieve this through discipline, solid intellectual frameworks and sticking to an investment process. Following one’s process and staying disciplined minimizes the likelihood of any potential emotion affecting one’s investment decisions. Maxis’ most essential but difficult trait is to have discipline. They look at an investment with a long-term horizon, which requires patience but avoids hasty decisions.</p><p>A true Bitcoin Maximalist’s mind state is not about trading in and out of an investment. This is likely true for other types of investors. But for the maxi, following the process and having discipline means<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/technology/crypto-bitcoin-maximalists.html"> buying bitcoin</a> when prices dip. Instead of trading out after making a quick return, they hold bitcoin over a longer period and, as a result, believe they will accumulate massive gains.</p><p>The maxi believes holding bitcoin is the best way investors can increase their purchasing power due to the crypto’s growing user adoption and its<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/bitcoin-s-limited-supply-increases-its-9855926/"> hard-capped supply</a> of 21 million BTC. </p><h2>The Long-Term Approach</h2><p>Many maximalists would say that their investment time frame goes for at least 10 to 20 years. This<a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/buying-stocks/articles/if-you-invested-1000-in-bitcoin-10-years-ago-heres-how-much-youd-have-today/"> long-term approach</a> is the only way aspiring investors can make significant money with bitcoin. After all, Bitcoin is never about the short term. The maxis don’t change their minds simply because the entire market is acting in the opposite direction. It is with this conviction within themselves that they hold their investment, no matter what.</p><p>Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor<a href="https://cfi.co/finance/2022/08/michael-saylor-bitcoin-secrets/"> has described</a> his bitcoin ownership as the “family farm” — something an investor should never sell. Last year, the crypto market suffered a significant meltdown, triggered by geopolitical and macroeconomic turmoil. Saylor expressed his disappointment for those who rushed to sell their bitcoin. Maxis’ long-term approach to bitcoin investing reminds me of the saying that people who achieve great things are the ones who set their minds to it.</p><p>So long as an investor can purchase bitcoin at reasonable prices, they can create wealth over the long term. The sooner you invest in bitcoin, the more time you have to earn returns. And the more time you have, the more returns are earned by your returns. The concept is popularly known as the “power of compounding,” which<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/04/compounding-and-saving-in-bitcoin-the-power-of-a-dollar-cost-averaging-strategy/"> works</a> perfectly in the case of Bitcoin. It is one of the core premises of the maxis’ investment philosophy.</p><p>Bitcoin Maximalists firmly hold the above-mentioned fundamental principles in their investment journey. When Bitcoin investors follow these investing lessons, they are guaranteed to deliver consistently good results.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Nicholas Otieno.

Apple claims that Damus violates their guidelines by allowing users to send "tips" (zaps) associated with receiving content from digital content creators through a mechanism other than in-app purchase. This violation of Guideline 3.1.1 - Business - Payments - In-App Purchase has prompted Apple to take action, according to the message sent to Damus creator William Casarin.</p><p>The news comes at a critical time for Damus and its creator, who was set to give a talk at the Oslo Freedom Forum on how decentralized social networks, integrated with lightning technology, can bring financial freedom to the masses. The impending removal from the App Store raises concerns about the freedom to transact peer-to-peer on the platform and has broader implications for apps that rely on Lightning integration and value-for-value models on the app store.</p><p>In an official communication from Apple's App Review, Damus received notice that an update compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines must be submitted within 14 days to ensure the app's availability. Failure to comply within the given timeframe will result in the app being removed from sale. Additionally, if Damus is found to be out of compliance and rejected even after the 14-day period, it will remain unavailable until a compliant update is submitted, approved, and released.</p><p>The removal of Damus from the App Store would not only impact its current users but also affect external and internal testing through the TestFlight version. All public TestFlight links will cease to function if the app is taken down.</p><p>This development raises questions about the future of apps with Lightning integration and the potential limitations on peer-to-peer transactions on Apple's platform. It remains to be seen how Damus and its creator will respond to this setback and whether they can find a solution that aligns with Apple's guidelines while maintaining the core principles of decentralization and financial freedom. <br><br>One interesting note is that Twitter allows for “tips” through the Lightning Network if enabled on a profile, which <a href="https://twitter.com/zubymusic">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cwt_news">large</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/shannenpill">accounts</a> do have. It is unclear how this function differs from the zap feature within Damus, as both utilize Lightning and do not rely on in-app purchases.</p><p>In the face of uncertainty, Casarin <a href="https://damus.io/note14vfvfnt8ynlp4qj2fcdt5t28judjypdnth83swmdhlythryw2seq2nuuh6">expressed his concerns</a>, stating, "If people can't transact freely p2p on their platform, this has huge implications for the entire ecosystem of apps with lightning integration and v4v." The statement reflects the gravity of the situation and the potential ramifications for the broader ecosystem of decentralized social networking apps.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In another note posted to Nostr, Casarin said that “Its been an honour zapping with y’all,” implying that the most likely next step is the removal of zaps in order to comply with the App Store regulations. Responses to the note expressed support and appreciation for the creation of the app, and hope that zaps will at some point return.</p><p>U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1668643286003638277?s=20">released a statement</a> on Twitter that read in part, “Permission-less peer-to-peer payments are essential to defending freedom.” In addition, Twitter Founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1668648607661056000?s=20">tweeted at Apple CEO Tim Cook</a> saying the function “has the capacity to bring people around the world into the economy without the traditional gatekeepers.

In fact, many seed phrases are stored on pieces of paper, carved and/or stamped into pieces of metal or are typewritten… with vintage typewriters. </p><p>Even <a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/magazines">Bitcoin Magazine</a>, while having a massive online presence, sells out of their physical publications.</p><p>The analog aspect of humanity isn’t a trend — analog defines us. </p><p>For many, something deeper occurs when they place a record onto a player. The act of moving a physical arm, which houses a delicate needle onto pressed vinyl, and then hearing the scratches, pops and subtle noises of the system at work is not listening, it’s feeling.</p><p>Similarly, the physical task of manually winding a watch involves touch. The act of twisting the crown provides feedback to not only the fingers, but the ears as well. Some even might argue, the heart is engaged. In regard to wearing an automatic watch, some owners can “feel” the rotor within the micro-mechanical system as it spins on their wrist.</p><h2>Improbable Correlations, Experiments And Errors</h2><p>The earliest mechanical (automatic) watch dates back to the early 1500s. <a href="https://art.thewalters.org/detail/27471/spherical-table-watch-melanchthons-watch/#item-moda">A spherical timepiece</a> that, when manually wound, ran for upwards of 16 hours. </p><p>The piece, which was reported to have been created by <a href="https://www.artsandcollections.com/article/horology-a-brief-history/">horologist</a> <a href="http://www.historyofwatch.com/clock-inventors/peter-henlein/">Peter Henlein</a> (a German clockmaker) for Philipp Melanchthon (the patron), was accurate to the nearest half hour. </p><p>Within 100 years, <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_856876">Galileo Galilei</a> was tinkering with the concept of “pendulum clocks”; however, while Galileo’s sketches illustrated a profound interest in the potential of creating a pendulum clock, he <a href="https://museum.seiko.co.jp/en/knowledge/MechanicalTimepieces03/#:~:text=Galileo%20conceived%20of%20an%20isochronous,inventing%20the%20first%20pendulum%20clock.">did not construct one before his death</a>. </p><p>The development of the first pendulum clock is credited to horologist <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Huygens/">Christiaan Huygens</a> in the mid-1600s. Huygens’ earlier works purported accuracy of approximately <a href="https://www2.vobs.at/ball-online/topics/TIME/history_of_time_mechanical_clock.htm">one minute per day</a>, but iterations pushed the clock-maker to error’s less than 10 seconds per day. Fast forward another 75 years or so, and clockmakers had refined the craft to an accuracy of plus or minus 1 second per day into the 1700s. </p><p>A fun experiment for readers if you want to understand Huygens’ physics: Create your own crude pendulum by tethering a weight to a string. Once the weight is hanging freely, grab the string in one hand and then use the other hand to pull the weight to one side, then let go.</p><p>You’ll notice the weight swing from one side to another… not very fascinating, right? But then, grab the weight and pull it from a higher distance and let go. Repeat from a lower distance.</p><p>What you’ll find is exactly what Huygens <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.170777">theorized and then proved</a>; that the stored potential energy of the weights plays no role in how fast the pendulum swings — the time the pendulum takes to pass through the center is constant; no matter how far you drop the pendulum from. </p><p>The <em>only</em> way to adjust the speed of the pendulum is to either increase or decrease the actual length of the string; a longer string length equates to a slower pendulum rate (pulse); and a shorter length, thus results in a faster pulse or tick as the weight swings back and forth. </p><p>This, for all intents and purposes, is how mechanical watches are adjusted, except without a string, a tiny piece of metal (a spring) is wound. If a watch is running slow or fast, adjustments are made within the system. Not much has changed in the past 150 years or so. It's beautiful because it’s simple.</p><p>I correlate the accuracy errors of mechanical timepieces to my Bitcoin discovery phase. Initially, I believed that every 10 minutes, a new Bitcoin block was created; however, as I surrounded myself with more experienced community members, technical personnel and cypherpunks, I learned that block times vary, or “oscillate,” between a few seconds in deviation to a few days in some cases. The protocol adjusts the length of the pendulum string automatically based on the needs of the network.</p><p>The mechanical aspects of time deviation that Satoshi Nakamoto coded into Bitcoin, unlike watchmaking, are features, not bugs.</p><h2>Tick Tock, Next Clock</h2><p><a href="https://thewatchcollectorsclub.com/blog/we-explore-which-watches-are-counted-as-high-horology/">High horology</a>, also known as the more precise, meticulous and highly-time-consuming task of creating bespoke and, in many instances, the most exceptionally accurate mechanical timepieces known to man, often turn a blind eye toward quartz, digital, solar or hybrid movements. </p><p>While many may not realize this, a typical quartz Timex or Casio is <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/watch-movements">more accurate than many high-end mechanical watches</a>. Additionally, some watch connoisseurs do not regard many of the “expensive” brands as constituting “high horology” simply because of their brand names. The devil is in the details.</p><p>Collectors might, however, consider a bespoke offering from a watchmaker that they may have never heard of, assuming that the horologist created something remarkable, such as the quad-layer, guillochéd <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-05-22/la-watchmaker-joshua-shapiro-resurgence">Resurgence</a> timepiece that Joshua Shapiro has prototyped in Southern California.</p><p>The irony is that many watch collectors typically also have a $40 to $100 Casio G-Shock (or equivalent) wristwatch in their collections. There are various reasons why, but in truth, different tasks require different tools.</p><p>Regarding Bitcoin, the tool of BTC awaits tasks, layers and adoption. Bitcoin is both high horology and a $40 Casio. The application adapts based on the user and the network; but most significantly, upon the developers who dedicate their lives to bettering the network. </p><h2>Jewels </h2><p>When considering the number of gears, wheels, pinions, springs, etc., in a mechanical watch movement, a lot of friction is generated between the micro-metallic components, not unlike the friction caused by some within the BTC community. </p><p>As such, <a href="https://teddybaldassarre.com/blogs/watches/watch-jewels">jewels</a> in a mechanical watch can be more commonly referred to as “bearings.” As such, a jewel does not represent “jewelry,” but rather a precise gem-bearing implemented to reduce friction. </p><p>If you own a mechanical, automatic or any variation of a modern self-winding watch, odds are, there is a “jewel” number on the back of the timepiece. </p><p>Quartz timepieces may not have a single jewel in their mechanism, while others may have a handful. </p><p>Implementing a battery, generators and capacitors into quartz movements has reduced or removed the need for traditional “jeweling.” </p><p>Most mechanical watches <a href="https://www.prestigetime.com/blog/what-are-the-jewels-in-a-watch-for.html#:~:text=Around%2017%20stones%20are%20used,positional%20errors%20as%20mentioned%20above">have 17 jewels</a>, while more complex timepieces implement more.</p><p>Initially, diamonds, rubies and sapphires were implemented as bearings in these complex timepieces. Today, even the most well-known watchmakers utilize <a href="https://www.livwatches.com/blogs/everything-about-watches/watch-jewels-101#:~:text=Eventually%2C%20the%20economics%20and%20characteristic,properties%20of%20their%20natural%20counterparts">synthetic sapphires or rubies</a>.</p><p>In Bitcoin, horology matters. </p><p>Whether one has caught the bug of watch collecting or has zero knowledge of that space is irrelevant to the field of horology; the space drives forward without them. The mechanics of automatic watches haven’t changed in hundreds of years and, in truth, perhaps this is why the field is so endearing.</p><p>Bitcoin is on the same trajectory. </p><p>While many believe Bitcoin is too complex to understand, these same critics use other technologies daily and, ironically, could never articulate how the technology they use every day actually functions. </p><p>Some members of the same community view Bitcoin as archaic technology; everything revolves around perspective. </p><p>If you asked most of the population how a mechanical watch “tells time,” could they tell you? Even many watch collectors could not identify all of the parts in a movement, and that’s okay. </p><p>Adoption is adoption. </p><p>With or without them, the Bitcoin protocol ticks on in a similar fashion. </p><p>My mechanical watch may sit idly by; however, once I pick it up and put it on my wrist, the second hand begins to sweep, and the inner workings spring back to life.</p><p>Bitcoin in cold storage is akin to an automatic watch waiting to be worn. </p><p>Within the Bitcoin community, there are friction points, not within the software per se, but within the community itself. </p><p>Jewels in the Bitcoin community might exemplify friction-reducing individuals, programmers, node operators and the like, who are often downplayed at conferences, online and in the real world. </p><p>Most recently, some programmers have <a href="https://decrypt.co/139259/bitcoin-ddos-ordinals-inscriptions-attack?amp=1">attempted to introduce friction</a> into the mechanics of the Bitcoin protocol. </p><p>The friction reduction aspects (jewels) of the Bitcoin community are under-appreciated but play a critical role in the protocol. </p><p>I encourage the cypherpunk community to be on guard for continued attacks in an attempt to create friction within the protocol and to be prepared with additional jewels in hand, ready for deployment. </p><p>In previous <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/riste-simnjanovski">articles</a> and a <a href="https://a.co/d/1zWdzxJ">book</a>, I hinted at the quiet Bitcoin community (QBCs) and its significance; perhaps I should refer to them as “jewels”<em> </em>in our protocol moving forward.</p><p>Stay strong and continue to do good work — you are appreciated. </p><p><em>Author’s note: Special thanks to Bitcoin Magazine, Peter Chawaga and company; to Third Man Records, especially Jack White and his crew; to Drs.

The event aimed to showcase the technology's ability to mobilize people in defense of monetary freedom, privacy, and other values of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The human ₿, sitting at a massive 40 meters, became the world's largest bitcoin symbol. Jimena Vallone, director of Bitcoin Argentina, expressed hopes that this would be the first of many attempts to break the record.</p><figure>

Generationally speaking, one could make the argument that it is the job of the younger generation to essentially tell us older folks to go fly a kite (perhaps in more raw terms, and metaphorically of course) when it comes to our values, our norms, our advice, etc. Music provides an apt cultural landscape on which to view this tension.</p><h2>The Same Old Song</h2><p>In every generation, emerging and evolving musical forms have been decried by the older, traditional set as being bad music, noise, even not music at all. In the late 1950s, Walter Cronkite <a href="https://www.exberliner.com/film/miles-davis-birth-of-the-cool/">referred to jazz as “musical noise,”</a> and his words were not offered as praise. Rockabilly of the 1950s was surely detested by many in the traditional country community. The music of the Summer Of Love was rejected by many parents who likely embraced jazz and bebop. Punk rockers were undoubtedly met with blank stares and utter contempt by their hippie parents, and rap continues to be the object of musical scorn the world over. The point is clear: Tradition hates innovation, mostly because tradition doesn’t understand innovation and feels threatened by this new iteration. And yet, the truth remains; it’s all just music.</p><p>Here's where things get a bit complicated.</p><p>It’s one thing to not understand, dislike, even personally reject something new. It’s another thing entirely to discredit the new, to actively fight against the new, to try and destroy the new. And within that effort to destroy and to bury the new form of expression, those seeking to kill off the new thing will, in their rather tired and sad desperation, create false narratives and stories to rationalize their adherence to traditional ways. Unfortunately, these narratives can become so powerful, that they lead to the development of institutions and movements guided entirely by falsehood, led by self-serving and power-hungry zealots, armed with all of the cultural weaponry that tradition has at its disposal; shameless and conscienceless, these forces will often go to extreme lengths to kill the thing that they have decided, in their self-concerned ignorance, is evil.</p><p>As much as I hope that, somewhere far in the future, such destructive and reductive forces can be disempowered by truth-informed mechanisms like the Bitcoin protocol, I am not holding my breath. But in the present, the power of <em>verification </em>— that very thing that makes Bitcoin such a revolutionary moment — can be leveraged by the Bitcoin community as a way to bridge the generational gap, to push back against the narratives that baby boomers and others embrace in their rejection of Bitcoin, and to move the protocol adoption curve forward.</p><h2>My Bitcoin Pitch To Fellow Boomers</h2><p>Here’s my point:</p><p>My generation (I’m a youthful 61) has many qualms with Bitcoin. Some of these concerns are valid (old people hate volatility), while others are informed by entirely false narratives and prejudices. And just like with the musical examples above, so many of these false narratives are incredibly difficult to disarm; for embedded within these rejections of something new there exists a desperate clinging to something understandable, something empowering, something unifying in its self-righteous disgust and self-concentered defensiveness. </p><p>Now granted, I’m a boomer, so I have a little more natural validity when I speak with my peers about Bitcoin. I’m not the AirPods-wearing, yoga-mat-toting, entirely-self-absorbed and personal-development-obsessed millennial who my generation loathes so very much (wry smile). But even such affinity does not get me far with Bitcoin. Rejection narratives come hot and they come quickly: environmental degradation, dark web currency, gambling casinos that make TikTok’ers rich, etc. </p><p>My strategy in pushing back against these arguments goes back to music: </p><blockquote><p>“Look,” I say “You may be right. Bitcoin may be energy intensive and not helpful to the environment. Bitcoin may be used by scammers and defrauders as part of their schemes to get rich. Bitcoin may be the currency, or one of the currencies, of a generation of social-media heads, people who you hold in such contempt. This may all be true. But I would argue three things: One, that you are embracing arguments that you have heard but have not investigated yourself; Two, that you are basing your hatred and rejection of Bitcoin not on the merits of Bitcoin, but on the way Bitcoin shows up in the world (just like our parents rejected our music, because it came with long hair and blue jean jackets); And three, that you are rejecting Bitcoin because you don’t understand it, which is so very much what all older generations do about shit they don’t get.”</p></blockquote><p>And then I say this:</p><blockquote><p>“There’s one thing about Bitcoin that makes it different from anything else in the world, and that is the dynamic of verification. Ignore all of the other stuff just for a second, if you can. I am entirely willing to stipulate that, after you do your own research and after you challenge your own prejudices toward those yucky millennials (another wry smile) that you may still reject Bitcoin, but hear me out on this one thing, this one really cool and rather revolutionary element of Bitcoin: Unlike every other human interaction in the world, Bitcoin does not ask us to put our blind trust in anyone else. No one owns it or controls it, so we’re not being asked to trust the words and deeds of bankers or government officials or scammers or anyone; no one can hack it (take some time to learn about why), so it is, even in its volatility as an investment, the most secure network of all time; and no can destroy it, because it is software that runs on millions of computers, all of which are verifying each and every transaction that takes place.”</p></blockquote><p>And then this:</p><blockquote><p>“Look, I’m not saying you should invest in bitcoin. And lord knows that in a world replete with greedy people and liars, bitcoin is just as apt to be used by these people as are dollars or gold or real estate or whatever gets them rich. And truth be known, millennials make me roll my eyes as well. But you know what, that’s my generational B.S. It’s my own crap. Just like my parents shook their heads at my Grateful Deadness and my punk rockness, I shake my head toward millennials. But that rigidity and silliness shouldn’t inform my views about an emerging monetary technology and protocol. If it does, then I am guilty of the very thing that we blamed our parents for being guilty of 40 years ago. I don’t want to be part of yet another anti-intellectual generation that rejects stuff it doesn’t understand, or that embraces false narratives about things because those are the narratives we are exposed to the most.”</p></blockquote><p>And then my closing:</p><blockquote><p>“All I’m asking is that you take a moment and consider what a world in which verification of truth, rather than trusting someone else’s words, might look like. For example, bitcoin and the Bitcoin network could have totally ended all of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/trump-election-denials-and-the-need-for-bitcoin-verification">stuff about stolen elections</a>, because within this realm of verification there exists the ability to validate and verify each and every transaction (every vote) beyond any doubt. Also, with the Bitcoin network and protocol, you can say goodbye to things like identity theft and credit card scams and being double charged for stuff you didn’t buy; because with Bitcoin every, every, <em>every</em> transaction is verified on an entirely secure network by tens of thousands of computers running unhackable software. And the thing is, there are so many examples of how verification could make the world in which we live so much better, because when we can verify stuff then we end up trusting the whole process. So all I’m asking is to do a little investigation about this thing before you reject it; you may find, despite yourself, that as you <em>get </em>it more, your appreciation for it changes.”</p></blockquote><p>We live in a world in which trust is an ever-diminishing construct. As I noted in my <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/as-trust-erodes-bitcoin-is-verifiable">first</a> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/trump-election-denials-and-the-need-for-bitcoin-verification">two</a> pieces in this series, as trust continues to erode, we, as a species, are in increasing trouble and distress. I totally grok why my generation doesn't trust Bitcoin. But I also get that our mistrust is informed by false narratives, by petty prejudices, and by a tenacious adherence to things we understand and know. The thing about Bitcoin that makes it so novel, and so elegant, is that the protocol, by way of example, cuts through all of the falsehood. This I feel is the most powerful thing about Bitcoin, and this I feel is a route toward bringing more and more people into the fold.</p><p>Virtually everyone on the planet, boomers included, is concerned about the direction we are heading as a species. And at the heart of this fear is the fact that we can’t trust anything anymore. Bitcoin changes this through its inviolable verification mechanism. It begins with money, property, assets. Who knows where it ends. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dan Weintraub.

Therefore, using PGP is good for preserving democracy. If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy… PGP empowers people to take their privacy into their own hands. There has been a growing social need for it. That's why I wrote it.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>–</em>Phil Zimmerman, “<a href="https://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html">Why I Wrote PGP</a>”</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/ITiUyFuk1vA">case</a> of Roman Sterlingov, who stands accused of running the custodial Bitcoin mixer, "Bitcoin Fog," is indicative of the many situations in which individuals are targeted by law enforcement for safeguarding their financial privacy. </p><p>As outlined in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITiUyFuk1vA">What Bitcoin Did</a>,” the U.S. Department of Justice relied on Chainalysis' Reactor software to trace the purchase of the Bitcoin Fog domain back to an address linked to Sterlingov’s Mt. Gox account, establishing him as its operator. Reactor was designed to tie cryptocurrency addresses with real-world identities. Despite the various irregularities present in this <a href="https://twitter.com/JackTracante/status/1661114322469134362?s=20">ongoing case</a>, one could draw the conclusion that it sends a clear message of “thou shalt not have financial privacy.”</p><h2>Introducing Ark</h2><p>Given this growing hostility toward financial privacy for Bitcoin transactions, there is a pressing need for the development of superior tools. At the recently concluded Bitcoin 2023 conference, a potentially game-changing tool, called the <a href="https://www.arkpill.me/">Ark Protocol</a>, was introduced. </p><p>Announced during one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/mn9Xhp5QLjo?t=10285">keynote sessions </a>on the open-source stage by developer <a href="https://twitter.com/brqgoo">Burak,</a> Ark is a Layer 2 scaling solution that enables cheap, anonymous and off-chain Bitcoin transactions. The protocol also has a minimal on-chain footprint, which further protects user privacy while keeping transaction costs low. In what can be described as an “accidental invention” that occurred when Burak was trying to develop a Lightning wallet, Ark is a distinct protocol that could potentially scale non-custodial bitcoin use. </p><p>Burak named the protocol "Ark" in reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark">Noah's Ark</a>, which acts as a lifeboat that provides refuge from predatory blockchain surveillance firms and custodians.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>During his presentation, Burak highlighted one of the most concerning trends with the Lightning Network today, which is that there are currently more custodial users of Lightning than there are non-custodial ones. This is mainly due to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/sourcing-bitcoin-lightning-liquidity">liquidity constraints</a> on Lightning that require non-custodial users to first receive liquidity from someone else’s node before they can receive funds. Custodial wallets like Wallet Of Satoshi abstract this problem away from the user but at the expense of the user not being 100% in control of their funds, as well as their financial privacy. </p><h2>An Alternative Layer 2 Protocol</h2><p>I interviewed Burak to gain a deeper understanding of Ark and the inspiration behind its development. When I quizzed him on what led him to develop an alternative Layer 2 protocol, he said:</p><p>“I have always been a critic of Lightning mainly because of inbound liquidity issues, async receiving as well as its on-chain footprint. Inbound liquidity always felt like a bug to me, which made the user experience anything but pleasant. In addition to that, it would take more than a century to onboard the entire global population in a non-custodial fashion onto the Lightning Network, assuming each person has four channels that each consume a few hundred vbytes.” </p><p>As he set out to address these and other issues, his Lightning wallet idea eventually morphed into Ark.</p><p>“Ark can be best defined as trustless e-cash or a liquidity network similar to the Lightning Network but with a UTXO set that lives entirely off-chain and it’s neither a statechain nor a rollup,” Burak said. “These UTXOs are called ‘virtual UTXOs’ or ‘vTXOs,’ which have a ‘lifespan’ of four weeks. The core of Ark's anonymous off-chain payments is driven by the vTXOs.”</p><p>Throughout the conversation, Burak continued to emphasize his obsession with a frictionless experience for the end user, his view being that sending sats should be as easy as pushing a button. This is one of the reasons why Ark users do not need to have channels or liquidity, as this is delegated to a network of untrusted intermediaries known as Ark service providers (ASPs). These are always-on servers that provide liquidity to the network, similarly to how <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/introducing-lightning-service-providers-fe9fb1665d5f">Lightning service providers</a> operate, but with an added benefit: ASPs are unable to link senders with receivers, which adds another layer of privacy for users. </p><p>This is made possible by the fact that every payment on Ark takes place within a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin">CoinJoin</a> round which obfuscates the connection between sender and receiver. The best part about this is that the CoinJoin happens entirely off-chain while settling payments every five seconds, which not only drastically reduces on-chain footprints but also fortifies the users’ privacy. The anonymity set is every party involved in a transaction and, theoretically, this creates a greater degree of privacy than what’s possible on the Lightning Network. Furthermore, Ark mimics on-chain user experiences in that users have a dedicated address for sending and receiving payments, but the difference is that it’s a reusable address that doesn’t compromise the user’s privacy, made possible in a way that’s similar to how <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-silent-payments-secret-keys">silent payments</a> work. </p><h2>Trade-Offs</h2><p>However, like any other system, Ark does have its own trade-offs. Although it may not offer instant settlements as rapidly as Lightning does, it provides immediate accessibility to funds without having to wait for confirmations in what Burak described as “immediate availability with delayed finality.” </p><p>For vendors, Lightning is still the better option when it comes to receiving payments. Additionally, liquidity providers are required, but based on the assumption that individuals will be motivated to offer liquidity to earn yield in bitcoin, Burak also thinks this challenge can be easily overcome in the long term. This novel proposition addresses certain shortcomings in Lightning, yet also comes with its own set of challenges.</p><h2>The Road Ahead</h2><p>In summary, the Ark protocol is a unique, second-layer scaling solution with unilateral exit capability that enables seamless transactions without imposing any liquidity constraints or interactivity, nor necessitating a direct connection between sender and receiver. Therefore, recipients can easily receive payments without the hassle of any onboarding setup, maintaining a continuous server presence or compromising their anonymity to third parties. Designed to be a scalable, non-custodial solution, Ark allows users complete control over their funds and gives everyone the option to self custody their money.</p><p>Ark is interoperable with Lightning, but also serves as a complement to it. However, due to the complicated process of self-custodial Lightning and varying levels of privacy for senders and receivers, along with the imminent danger posed by blockchain surveillance firms, scaling solutions that prioritize privacy, like Ark, have become essential. The various attempts to attack Bitcoin through malicious prosecution, like in the case of Sterlingov, and predatory legislation such as the EU's <a href="https://decrypt.co/138713/what-is-mica-eu-crypto-regulation-explained">MiCA</a>, demonstrate the need for scalable, efficient, privacy-preserving tools in order to prevent future issues. </p><p>It’s against this background that I think Ark is an interesting concept worth keeping an eye on as development of the protocol unfolds. Of course, without code to review at the moment or a battle-tested, working prototype, it’s still a long road ahead. Despite the unforeseen challenges ahead, Burak is optimistic about Ark’s potential and is convinced that it’s a breakthrough that strikes the balance between private Bitcoin transactions and scalability, in a user-friendly manner. A sentiment that I also share, given the vital need for non-custodial, privacy-preserving tools. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

Does anyone remember these? FitFlops sold for some $100 and promised to work your legs into shape just by walking. Seeing them made me recall the time I spent traveling across Asia from around 2008 onward. </p><p>In those years and into the early 2010s, I was busy managing a company based in Hong Kong while accompanying my then boyfriend/fiancé around Asia. He worked on various finance projects with governments in the region, flashing his MBA, two master’s degrees and finance background while I occupied my days, and some nights, with corporate matters and adding to my investment portfolio. In those days, that meant investing in various equities, some Asian venture capital funds and an occasional seed funding opportunity.</p><p>Apart from that, I also did some modeling for advertisements and through this I earned my “play” money. And, what did I intend to do with my “play” money? I wanted to invest in bitcoin.</p><h2>My First Steps</h2><p>In 2010, with Bitcoin’s <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block">genesis block</a> having been mined just one year prior, I came across some stories about this wonder-currency. I was intrigued and interested in investing. I struggled trying to find enough information and to sort through the comments for and against it. The challenges were massive. It seemed easier just to forget about it and go drink another espresso. </p><p>How could I invest? How could I sort through the many technical aspects? I felt like I needed to have a degree in programming. Moreover, I had concerns that if I did figure out where to buy it and how to hold it, then was I going to get some virus on my PC as a result or be pursued by someone from the dark side after I did? Could I be subjected to the many scams or hacks that I was reading about? </p><p>It is sad to think, however, that even 14 years since the genesis block, some of these impediments remain for many people, stifling greater Bitcoin adoption. </p><h2>Asking The ‘Expert’</h2><p>As I mentioned earlier, my then boyfriend/fiancé was apparently a financial expert. I mean, he was advising governments on their finances and economic development. He had been investing in stock markets since he was a teenager. So, why not ask him for help and his thoughts? </p><p>One weekend while in Singapore, I sprung the news and my questions. I recall that day so vividly. I mentioned Bitcoin and my desire to buy $100 worth and sell it after it grew to $1,000 worth. I thought it was fine to gamble a small amount because, even if I lost it all, I would somehow survive the loss… perhaps with only a few hours spent at a therapist. </p><p>Anyway, this is what I heard: </p><p>“What? Bitcoin? That’s just for use by scammers and prostitutes.” </p><p>OK, I forgot to ask how he knew that but, anyway, the discussion continued. I chalked his abrupt comment up to the fact that he had just finished drinking a double-shot, tall cappuccino with one pump of hazelnut syrup and was hyped full of caffeine and sugar. </p><p>I replied that I have researched it and understood that it is a token for the gaming sector, an industry that was growing fast. It can increase in value, I added. It can maybe reach $10 someday! I then also reminded him that he promised to buy me a gift — yes, the elusive FitFlops — when next in Singapore. I said that, rather than buying me those magic shoes, I will just use the money to buy bitcoin instead. Now, I could have easily bought bitcoin with my own money, but I wanted to do this as a mutual decision, for the future. And I was not a financial expert, so I thought it still best to seek his input. The discussion continued and I finally got him to agree to research Bitcoin further with me. </p><h2>Boyfriend/Expert/Panicked Investor</h2><p>Over the next few days, we both tried to find more information on Bitcoin and possible on-ramps. I found one small and seemingly-elusive Bitcoin group in Singapore. It seemed at that time that to buy some bitcoin, you had to know the right people. </p><p>I felt that, at least since this group was in Singapore, a highly-policed and -regulated state, that I would not be subject to the many scam sales and post-purchase hacks to steal the coins that existed back then. </p><p>I wondered how to get in touch with the group and even if I did, how could I know that they were for real? Nonetheless, I was willing to take a chance since I would only put in around $100, just my FitFlop money. My boyfriend/fiancé/expert had a different view. He was old-style, a conservative investor. He was one who followed the Warren Buffett approach. Remember, Warren Buffett <a href="https://financialpost.com/investing/buffetts-apple-losses-make-his-track-record-in-tech-even-worse">didn’t invest in any technology stocks until relatively late</a>. The potential to lose $100 sent him into a panic, even if the upside could turn that into $1,000!</p><h2>Wearing Bitcoin On My Feet</h2><p>After finally breaking down my Warren Buffett protégé/panicked boyfriend into agreeing to consider Bitcoin, I tried to reach the elusive Bitcoin group. No email replies, no phone numbers, no address to visit. It seemed that the only outcome of my Singaporean Bitcoin adventure would be to own a pair of FitFlops. My outreach and research continued over the next few days but to no avail. It appeared that Bitcoin, and the potential to make big returns, would have to be saved for a select few techies or traditional wealthy insiders. I left Singapore wearing what should have been my bitcoin on my feet. </p><h2>My First Bitcoin And My Last FitFlops</h2><p>The years passed. I tried to occasionally catch an article or other news about Bitcoin. Even as I learned more about how to buy and hold it, I was busy working and traveling and found it impossible to find any trustworthy Bitcoin sources to invest in across developing Asia. The region was not the best place to do such research. Even after the founding of some crypto exchanges, they did not serve customers outside the U.S. </p><p>The start of my Bitcoin journey had to wait until around 2019. While I missed out on the early days of Bitcoin, I can at least take solace that my feet have been happy and comfortable over the decade. </p><p>Finally, you might now ask what happened to my then boyfriend-slash-fiancé? Well, that’s for another article…</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Enza Coin.

Assange, who is wanted on 18 charges related to the release of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables, will, however, renew his appeal next week according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/julian-assange-loses-us-extradition-challenge-will-renew-appeal-next-week-2023-06-09/">report by Reuters</a>. The British High Court ruled that Assange had no legal grounds to challenge the extradition decision.</p><p>Previously, a British judge ruled against Assange's extradition, citing concerns about his mental health and the risk of suicide if held in a maximum security prison. However, the decision was overturned on appeal after the U.S. authorities provided assurances, including the possibility of transferring Assange to Australia to serve any sentence.</p><p>WikiLeaks gained prominence in 2010 for releasing classified files and diplomatic cables, marking one of the largest security breaches in U.S. military history. As a journalist, Assange’s platform highlighted war crimes and incredible breaches of public trust by the U.S. military. His efforts to bring crimes and actions committed by the government to light have been met with furious retaliation despite the protections journalists should receive, even when reporting on sensitive information. To punish Assange for his work is to set the precedent that journalists who delve too deeply into government affairs will be made an example of. </p><p>Assange's case has drawn international attention and sparked debates regarding freedom of the press and the potential implications for whistleblowers. The renewed appeal next week will be a crucial moment in determining Assange's fate as he continues to fight against extradition to the United States.</p><figure>

In 2000, he launched Echovox, which he spun out into Zong in 2008 — a mobile platform that let users pay for things online directly through their mobile phone bills. When this venture was acquired by PayPal in 2011, Marcus joined the digital payments giant, becoming its president the next year.</p><p>He’d read the Bitcoin white paper shortly after it was published, but “didn’t fall into the rabbit hole” at first, he recalled in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. Then, in 2012, Argentina ordered PayPal to stop all transactions that would send money out of the country as it grappled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_fiscal_austerity_in_Argentina">currency inflation and a fiscal austerity effort</a>, and the real value of this peer-to-peer electronic cash system started to resonate with him.</p><p>“We had to (comply), we were a regulated entity,” Marcus explained. “The day that happened, bitcoin prices went up significantly and I was like, ‘Whoa.’ Like, this is something where consumers in a place like Argentina are actually rushing into bitcoin as a way to move money that they’ve earned — it’s their money — in a way that they saw fit. So, I felt that was a very eye-opening moment for me in terms of Bitcoin being an escape valve to certain behaviors that weren’t aligned with my views of self sovereignty, of money … so that was kind of a turning point for me in 2013, where it really solidified my conviction.”</p><p>Shortly afterward, in May 2013, he attended the <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/5/prweb10692708.htm">Bitcoin 2013 conference</a> in San Jose and, despite its relatively small community, he was intrigued by the breakthrough Bitcoin had made in how digital payments could be facilitated. </p><p>“It was really a handful, like two handfuls of people basically, it was so incredibly early,” he said. “I was fascinated by this general idea that you move value in a completely self-sovereign way without any intermediaries whatsoever. And during that same time period, I remember sending and receiving bitcoins, and I was setting up wallets for friends to show them what was possible: ‘Look, this is me sending you money and there’s no one in between, right?’ And I was really fascinated by it.”</p><h2>To The Best Of Our Abilities</h2><p>But Marcus was not yet ready to give up on the possibility of institutionalized yet open payments for the internet. In June 2014, he joined Meta (then Facebook) as its vice president of messaging products, developing the Facebook Messenger mobile app. Marcus released <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/fb-better-have-my-money">Messenger P2P Payments</a> in 2015, which allowed users to send each other money from their synced checking accounts via the app. </p><p>By mid-2019, Marcus had begun leading Facebook’s cryptocurrency project, Libra, which was later renamed Diem before being abandoned altogether. Libra was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/facebooks-libra-is-here-but-it-might-not-be-what-you-think">almost instantly dismissed by Bitcoiners</a> as offering nothing particularly valuable compared to other centralized digital currency projects. And Marcus found himself defending the project before <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/libra-congress-chance-define-bitcoin-libra-isnt">the House Financial Services Committee</a> as well as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/senate-hearing-facebooks-iffy-reputation-looms-libra-plans">the U.S. Senate’s banking committee</a>, forced to answer questions that were often more broadly focused on Meta’s history of invading user privacy.</p><p>But before Libra settled on the permissioned, oligarchical node model <a href="https://sls.gmu.edu/pfrt/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/LibraWhitePaper_en_US-Rev0723.pdf">outlined in its white paper</a>, Marcus had actually considered leveraging the Lightning Network for his project.</p><p>“I remember meeting with Elizabeth Stark (CEO of Lightning Network development firm Lightning Labs) in early 2018 and trying to figure out whether Lightning was actually the way to go, because if there was a way to actually use Bitcoin, I really wanted to do that,” Marcus said. “At the time, we thought, OK, maybe we can use Lightning and then build a world-class wallet that we can embed across all of the Meta products, WhatsApp and Messenger and others, and then enable people to move value around.”</p><p>Ultimately, he decided the protocol wasn’t robust enough to fulfill Meta’s vision due to some of the insufficiencies that it has yet to overcome, including limited nodes and liquidity.</p><p>“Even today, it would be challenging, and it will be challenging, to actually get to billions of consumers on the Lightning Network,” Marcus pointed out. “Even Layer 1 won’t have enough HTLCs (<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hash_Time_Locked_Contracts">hash time locked contracts</a>) to actually do that. So, we’ll have to find solutions as we get there. But our view was that it won’t scale… And as such, we came to the conclusion that we need to go build this proprietary technology that we will then do whatever we can to decentralize to the best of our abilities.”</p><p>In the end, Marcus’ ability to decentralize a payments project under Meta proved insufficient and he has since come to the realization that attempting to do so on any other network aside from Bitcoin is an exercise in futility.</p><p>“We’ve built the unshakeable conviction at this point that the only blockchain and the only underlying assets that can support a truly open protocol for payments on the internet is Bitcoin and nothing else,” he said.</p><p>In 2021, Marcus left Meta and the next year he launched Lightspark to pursue that conviction.</p><h2>The Reason Bitcoin And Lightning Are Better</h2><p>Lightspark builds software and development tools meant to make accessing the Lightning Network easier, such as its <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lightspark-introduces-lightspark-wallet-sdk">software development kit</a> to help businesses offer Lightning wallets to their customers and <a href="https://www.lightspark.com/products">Lightspark Predict</a>, which identifies the best-performing Lightning nodes and can route transactions to them.</p><p>Rather than building a centralized platform to enable digital payments, Lightspark is focused on building tools to help customers access this existing, decentralized one. And while Lightning Network adoption is still far from rivaling the user base of something like PayPal, Marcus is optimistic about its potential to scale if companies like his are successful.</p><p>“Lightning still has issues, but I feel very confident that we’re in a position to address these issues,” he said. “You’ll see that for companies to integrate on Lightning using Lightspark services, you don’t even need to worry about channels. You don’t need to worry about liquidity. You don’t need to worry about channel rebalancing and distributing liquidity. You don’t need to worry about what routes you’re going to use and which minimum fee or maximum fee you’re going to set. All of that complexity is being completely taken away from the equation of a company deciding whether they’re going to implement Lightning for their consumers or not.”</p><p>When asked if abstracting users so far away from managing their own liquidity, channel balances and routing could in a sense recreate the issues with centralized, trusted financial middlemen, Marcus responded with an analogy.</p><p>“In the early days of the web, if you wanted a website and you wanted to be on the internet, you had to go build your own server, find a rack, put it in a rack, buy a router, configure your router, get an E1 or a T1 line, plug that router into your E1 or T1 line and then maintain that whole thing all the time, and it was like, OK, no one does that,” he explained. “But the reason Lightning and Bitcoin are better is because there are companies like Lightspark that will make things easier for mass market adoption, but if you are in a random country anywhere, and you just have internet connectivity, you can run a node on your phone yourself and be a participant in this network. And I think that’s what makes it amazing.”</p><p>And he went further to underscore that his intention now is to enable a certain kind of Lightning adoption, rather than roll out a solution that minimizes the need for independent participants. </p><p>“We don’t expect everyone to use our software,” he continued. “That would actually be a bad thing, right? We think that everyone should run their own thing and we’re going to cater to a certain segment of the market that is going to tend to be larger, enterprise-types of customers.”</p><p>Of all the executives actively working on Bitcoin projects, Marcus probably has the most legacy experience to inform him on what Bitcoin needs to succeed as well as what it must avoid in order not to fail. And, declaring that building on Lightning is the culmination of his life’s work, he’s determined to succeed.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4NTQ0NDMzNTE4NDg2OTc5/david-marcus.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[If We’re Not Careful, The AI Revolution Could Become The ‘Great Homogenization’]]></title><description><![CDATA[As artificial intelligence grows, so do attempts to control it.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a paradigm-shifting technological breakthrough, but probably not for the reasons you might think or imagine.</p><p>You’ve probably heard something along the lines of, “Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is around the corner,” or, “Now that language is solved, the next step is conscious AI.”</p><p>Well… I’m here to tell you that those concepts are both <em>red herrings</em>. They are either the naive delusions of technologists who believe God is in the circuits, or the deliberate incitement of fear and hysteria by more malevolent people with ulterior motives.</p><p>I <em>do not</em> think AGI is a threat or that we have an “AI safety problem,” or that we’re around the corner from some singularity with machines. </p><p><em>But…</em></p><p>I do believe this technological paradigm shift poses a significant threat to humanity — which is in fact, about the <em>only</em> thing I can somewhat agree on with the mainstream — but for completely different reasons. </p><p>To learn what they are, let’s first try to understand what's really happening here.</p><h2>Introducing… The Stochastic Parrot!</h2><p>Technology is an amplifier. It makes the good better, and the bad worse.</p><p>Just as a hammer is technology that can be used to build a house or beat someone over the head, computers can be used to document ideas that change the world, or they can be used to operate central bank digital currencies (CDBCs) that enslave you into crazy, communist cat ladies working at the European Central Bank.</p><p>The same goes for AI. It is a tool. It is a technology. It is <em>not</em> a new lifeform, despite what the lonely nerds who <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">are calling for progress to shut down</a> so desperately want to believe. </p><p>What makes generative AI so interesting is not that it is sentient, but that it’s the first time in our history that we are “speaking” or communicating with something other than a human being, in a coherent fashion. The closest we’ve been to that before this point has been with… parrots. </p><p>Yes: <em>parrots</em>!</p><p>You can train a parrot to kind of talk and talk back, and you can kind of understand it, but because we know it’s not really a human and doesn’t really understand anything, we’re not so impressed.</p><p>But generative AI… well, that’s a different story. We’ve been acquainted with it for six months now (in the mainstream) and we have no real idea how it works under the hood. We type some words, and it responds like that annoying, politically-correct, midwit nerd who you know from class… or your average Netflix show.</p><p>In fact, you’ve probably even spoken with someone like this during support calls to Booking.com, or any other service in which you’ve had to dial in or web chat. As such, you’re immediately shocked by the responses. </p><p>“Holy shit,” you tell yourself. “This thing speaks like a real person!”</p><p>The English is immaculate. No spelling mistakes. Sentences make sense. It is not only grammatically accurate, but semantically so, too.</p><p><em>Holy shit! It must be alive!</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>Little do you realize that you are speaking to a highly-sophisticated, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot">stochastic parrot</a>. As it turns out, language is a little more rules-based than what we all thought, and probability engines can actually do an excellent job of <em>emulating</em> intelligence through the frame or conduit of language.</p><p>The law of large numbers strikes again, and math achieves another victory!</p><p>But… what does this mean? What the hell is my point? </p><p>That this is not useful? That it’s proof it’s not a path to AGI?</p><p>Not necessarily, on both counts.</p><p>There is lots of utility in such a tool. In fact, the greatest utility probably lies in its application as “MOT,” or “Midwit Obsolescence Technology.” Woke journalists and the countless “content creators” who have for years been talking a lot but saying nothing, are now like dinosaurs watching the comet incinerate everything around them. It’s a beautiful thing. Life wins again.</p><p>Of course, these tools are also great for ideating, coding faster, doing some high-level learning, etc.</p><p>But from an AGI and consciousness standpoint, <em>who knows?</em> There mayyyyyyyyyyy be a pathway there, but my spidey sense tells me we’re way off, so I’m not holding my breath. I think consciousness is so much more complex, and to think we’ve conjured it up with probability machines is some strange blend of ignorant, arrogant, naive and… well… empty.</p><p>So, what the hell is my problem and what’s the risk?</p><h2>Enter The Age Of The LUI</h2><p>Remember what I said about tools.</p><p>Computers are arguably the most powerful tool mankind has built. And computers have gone through the following evolution:</p><ol><li>Punch cards</li><li>Command line</li><li>Graphical user interface, i.e., point and click</li><li>Mobile, i.e., thumbs and tapping</li></ol><figure>

    </figure><p>And now, we’re moving into the age of the LUI, or “Language User Interface.”</p><p><em>This</em> is the big paradigm shift. It’s not AGI, but LUI. Moving forward, every app we interact with will have a conversational interface, and we will no longer be limited by the bandwidth of how fast our fingers can tap on keys or screens. </p><p>Speaking “language” is orders of magnitude faster than typing and tapping. Thinking is probably another level higher, but I’m not putting any electrodes into my head anytime soon. In fact, LUIs probably obsolete the need for Neuralink-type tech because the risks associated with implanting chips into your brain will outweigh any marginal benefit over just speaking.</p><p>In any case, this decade we will go from tapping on graphical user interfaces, to talking to our apps.</p><p>And therein lies the danger.</p><p>In the same way Google today determines what we see in searches, and Twitter, Facebook, Tik Tok and Instagram all “feed us” through their feeds; generative AI will tomorrow determine the answers to every question we have.</p><p>The screen not only becomes the lens through which you ingest everything about the world. The screen becomes your model of the world.</p><p>Mark Bisone <a href="https://markbisone.substack.com/p/screen-grab">wrote a fantastic article</a> about this recently, which I urge you to read:</p><blockquote><p>“The problem of ‘screens’ is actually a very old one. In many ways it goes back to Plato’s cave, and perhaps is so deeply embedded in the human condition that it precedes written languages. That’s because when we talk about a screen, we’re really talking about the transmission of an illusory model in an editorialized form.</p><p>“The trick works like this: You are presented with the image of a thing (and these days, with the sound of it), which its presenter either explicitly tells you or strongly implies is a window to the Real. The shadow and the form are the same, in other words, and the former is to be trusted as much as any fragment of reality that you can directly observe with your sensory organs.”</p></blockquote><p>And, for those thinking that “this won’t happen for a while,” well <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/g7-leaders-confirm-need-governance-generative-ai-technology-2023-05-19/">here are the bumbling fools making a good attempt at it</a>.</p><h2>The ‘Great Homogenization’</h2><p>Imagine every question you ask, every image you request, every video you conjure up, every bit of data you seek, being returned in such a way that is deemed “safe,” “responsible” or “acceptable” by some faceless “safety police.”</p><p>Imagine every bit of information you consume has been transformed into some lukewarm, middle version of the truth, that every opinion you ask for is not really an opinion or a viewpoint, but some inoffensive, apologetic response that doesn’t actually tell you anything (this is the benign, annoying version) or worse, is some ideology wrapped in a response so that everything you know becomes some variation of what the manufacturers of said “safe AI” want you to think and know.</p><p>Imagine you had modern Disney characters, like those clowns from “The Eternals” movie, as your ever-present intellectual assistants. It would make you “dumb squared.”</p><p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/UnCommunist-Manifesto-Message-Responsibility-Liberty/dp/0578396300">The UnCommunist Manifesto</a>” outlined the utopian communist dream as the grand homogenization of man:<em> </em></p><p><em>If only everyone were a series of numbers on a spreadsheet, or automatons with the same opinion, it would be so much easier to have paradise on earth. You could ration out just enough for everyone, and then we’d be all equally miserable proletariats.</em></p><p>This is like George Orwell’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Police">thought police</a> crossed with “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception">Inception</a>,” because every question you had would be perfectly captured and monitored, and every response from the AI could incept an ideology in your mind. In fact, when you think about it, that’s what information does. It plants seeds in your mind.</p><p>This is why you need a diverse set of ideas in the minds of men! You want a flourishing rainforest in your mind, not some mono-crop field of wheat, with deteriorated soil, that is susceptible to weather and insects, and completely dependent on Monsanto (or Open AI or Pfizer) for its survival. You want your mind to flourish and for that <em>you need idea-versity</em><em>.</em></p><p>This was the promise of the internet. A place where anyone can say anything. The internet has been a force for good, but it is under attack. Whether that’s been the de-anonymization of social profiles like those on Twitter and Facebook, and the creeping KYC across all sorts of online platforms, through to the algorithmic vomit that is spewed forth from the platforms themselves. We tasted that in <em>all</em> its glory from 2020. And it seems to be only getting worse.</p><p>The push by WEF-like organizations to institute KYC for online identities, and tie it to a CBDC and your iris is one alternative, but it’s a bit overt and explicit. After the pushback on medical experimentation of late, such a move may be harder to pull off. An easier move could be to allow LUIs to take over (as they will, because they’re a superior user experience) and in the meantime create an “AI safety council” that will institute “safety” filters on all major large language models (LLMs).</p><p>Don’t believe me? <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/g7-leaders-confirm-need-governance-generative-ai-technology-2023-05-19/">Our G7 overlords are discussing it already</a>.</p><p>Today, the web is still made up of webpages, and if you’re curious enough, you can find the deep, dark corners and crevices of dissidence. You can still surf the web. Mostly. But when everything becomes accessible only through these models, you’re not surfing anything anymore. You’re simply being given a synthesis of a response that has been run through all the necessary filters and censors. </p><p>There will probably be a sprinkle of truth somewhere in there, but it will be wrapped up in so much “safety” that 99.9% of people won’t hear or know of it. The truth will become that which the model says it is.</p><p>I’m not sure what happens to much of the internet when discoverability of information fundamentally transforms. I can imagine that, as most applications transition to some form of language interface, it’s going to be very hard to find things that the “portal” you’re using doesn’t deem safe or approved.</p><p>One could, of course, make the argument that in the same way you need the tenacity and curiosity to find the dissident crevices on the web, you’ll need to learn to prompt and hack your way into better answers on these platforms. </p><p>And that may be true, but it seems to me that for each time you find something “unsafe,” the route shall be patched or blocked.</p><p>You could then argue that “this could backfire on them, by diminishing the utility of the tool.” </p><p>And once again, I would probably agree. In a free market, such stupidity would make way for better tools.</p><p>But of course, the free market is becoming a thing of the past. What we are seeing with these hysterical attempts to push for “safety” is that they are either knowingly or unknowingly paving the way for squashing possible alternatives.</p><p>In creating “safety” committees that “regulate” these platforms (read: regulate speech), new models that are not run through such “safety or toxicity filters” will not be available for consumer usage, or they may be made illegal, or hard to discover. How many people still use Tor? Or DuckDuckGo?</p><p>And if you think this isn’t happening, <a href="https://medium.com/jigsaw/reducing-toxicity-in-large-language-models-with-perspective-api-c31c39b7a4d7">here’s</a> some information on the current toxicity filters that most LLMs already plug into. It’s only a matter of time before such filters become like KYC mandates on financial applications. A new compliance appendage, strapped onto language models like tits on a bull.</p><p>Whatever the counter-argument to this homogenization attempt, both actually support my point that we need to build alternatives, and we need to begin that process now.</p><p>For those who still tend to believe that AGI is around the corner and that LLMs are a significant step in that direction, by all means, you’re free to believe what you want, but that doesn’t negate the point of this essay.</p><p>If language is the new “screen” and all the language we see or hear must be run through approved filters, the information we consume, the way we learn, the very thoughts we have, will all be narrowed into a very small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton window</a>.</p><p>I think that’s a massive risk for humanity.</p><p>We’ve become dumb enough with social media algorithms serving us what the platforms think we should know. And when they wanted to turn on the hysteria, it was easy. Language user interfaces are social media times 100.</p><p>Imagine what they can do with that, the next time a so-called “crisis” hits?</p><p>It won’t be pretty.</p><p>The marketplace of ideas is necessary to a healthy and functional society. That’s what I want.</p><p>Their narrowing of thought won’t work long term, because it’s anti-life. In the end, it will fail, just like every other attempt to bottle up truth and ignore it. But each attempt comes with unnecessary damage, pain, loss and catastrophe. That’s what I am trying to avoid and help ring the bell for.</p><h2>What To Do About All This?</h2><p>If we’re not proactive here, this whole AI revolution could become the “great homogenization.” To avoid that, we have to do <em>two</em> main things: </p><ol><li>Push back against the “AI safety” narratives: These might look like safety committees on the surface, but when you dig a little deeper, you realize they are speech and thought regulators.</li><li>Build alternatives, now: Build many and open source them. The sooner we do this, and the sooner they can run more locally, the better chance we have to avoid a world in which everything trends toward homogenization.</li></ol><p>If we do this, we can have a world with real diversity — not the woke kind of bullshit. I mean diversity of thought, diversity of ideas, diversity of viewpoints and a true marketplace of ideas.</p><p><em>An idea-versity.</em> What the original promise of the internet was. And not bound by the low bandwidth of typing and tapping. Couple that with Bitcoin, the internet of money, and you have the ingredients for a bright new future.</p><p>This is what the team and I are doing at Laier Two Labs. We’re building smaller, narrow models that people can use as substitutes to these large language models.</p><p>We are going to open source all our models, and in time, aim to have them be compact enough to run locally on your own machines, while retaining a degree of depth, character and unique bias for use when and where you need it most.</p><p>We will announce our first model in the coming weeks. The goal is to make it the go-to model for a topic and industry I hold very dear to my heart: Bitcoin. I also believe it’s here that we must start to build a suite of alternative AI models and tools.</p><p>I will unveil it on the next blog.

Kennedy Jr., took to Twitter to express his support for Bitcoin. <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1654304979207815174?s=20">In a tweet</a>, he stated that “Bitcoin has been a lifesaver for people’s movements around the world, particularly in Burma.”</p><p>Myanmar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar">also known as Burma</a>, is a country located in Southeast Asia, bordering China, India, Thailand, Laos and Bangladesh. The country has stunning natural beauty, including untouched beaches, vast forests and a rich culture of Buddhism. Despite these attractions, Myanmar has <a href="https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/capstones/2603/">been tortured by the world's longest civil war</a>, which has been ongoing for more than 70 years, since it achieved <a href="https://asiangeo.com/articles/the-road-to-independence-burma-1945-1962/">independence in 1945</a>. The country has also experienced multiple military coups throughout its history, leading to political instability and economic turmoil. Additionally, the <a href="https://rpl.hds.harvard.edu/religion-context/country-profiles/myanmar/economic-policies-and-ideologies">government has a history of demonetizing the local currency</a>, and there have been frequent banking crises. </p><p>One of Myanmar's most notable instances of demonetization occurred in 1987, leading to the historic "8888 Uprising." On September 5, 1987, the military dictator Ne Win <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-09-12-mn-1980-story.html">announced the demonetization of Myanmar's 25, 35, and 75 kyat notes</a> without providing prior notice or replacing them for citizens. At that time, these notes accounted for <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/specials/on-this-day/day-three-myanmar-banknotes-suddenly-became-worthless.html">80% of the circulation in the economy</a>. Previous demonetization efforts in 1964 and 1985 <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/specials/on-this-day/day-three-myanmar-banknotes-suddenly-became-worthless.html">had compensated noteholders</a>, making this move in 1987 especially unexpected and devastating for the people of Myanmar. The choice to demonetize these particular, odd denominations sparked significant speculation, as they were believed to hold special status. It is widely held that Ne Win, who was highly superstitious, considered these numbers to be propitious both for the country and himself on a personal level. </p><p>Myanmar's transformation era commenced with the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-obama-myanmar/obama-offers-praise-pressure-on-historic-myanmar-trip-idUSBRE8AI04320121119">visit of U.S. President Barack Obama to the country in 2012</a>, followed by its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/asia/myanmar-elections/index.html">first civilian election in 2015</a>, which marked a significant milestone in the country's path toward democracy. However, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Myanmar_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">2021 Myanmar military coup</a> has set the country back by a decade. The military's seizure of power in February 2021 has sparked widespread protests and violence across the country, with thousands of people taking to the streets to demand the release of detained political leaders, including the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/1/timeline-two-years-since-the-myanmar-military-coup">State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and President U Win Myint</a> and the restoration of democracy.</p><p>But following the military coup in February 2021, the military has brutally cracked down on civilians who are protesting against the regime. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57380237">Reports indicate</a> that the military has resorted to extreme measures to suppress dissent, including shooting protesters on the spot and arresting individuals, some of whom have been found dead the following day. The military junta has also taken steps to silence activists and journalists who have spoken out against the coup on social media by <a href="https://coconuts.co/yangon/news/myanmar-bank-faces-boycott-after-freezing-accounts-to-block-donations-to-anti-coup-forces/">freezing their bank accounts</a>, making it difficult for them to access their funds and personal savings. These actions have led to widespread condemnation from the international community and have raised concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in Myanmar.</p><p>A source from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ANTSforPeople">ANTS</a>, a group that raises funds for the democracy movement in Myanmar, revealed to me that many of their members and their friends had their bank accounts frozen by the military regime since they started fundraising efforts in October 2021. These efforts have also led to the arrests and questioning of the family members of activists. In response to the situation, a 22-year-old activist from ANTS told me, "To overcome getting their bank accounts frozen, ANTS changed its fundraising strategy to take bank information privately and instruct donors to write online shopping payment in the note section to reduce the risk of exposure." </p><p>Assisting resistance groups in Myanmar poses a significant danger for individuals irrespective of social hierarchy. Even a donation of less than $10 to these groups <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/prison-terms-04062022170714.html">has led to ten years of prison sentences for some individuals</a>. In one instance, a well-known jeweler in the Mandalay region was arrested for allegedly supporting the resistance, resulting in the seizure of his assets, including properties, businesses and an <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-gems-boss-arrested-for-alleged-resistance-support.html">astounding 193 tons of raw jade</a> valued at approximately 12 billion kyat (equivalent to roughly $5.7 million).</p><h2>Alternatives, But Not Solutions</h2><p>Furthermore, the group revealed that they have explored alternative digital payment options such as <a href="https://nugpay.app/">NUGPay</a>, a pilot digital currency platform launched by Myanmar's parallel government, the <a href="https://www.nugmyanmar.org/en/">National Unity Government </a>(NUG). However, as one of their members explained, "Our donors are hesitant to use the platform because it requires opening a bank account with an agent who is either inside Myanmar or outside of Myanmar. Who can guarantee that it is purely safe for the agent and users in terms of data security? It looks like having a double risk than using the traditional banking system.”</p><p>But NUGPay, a digital currency platform built on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_(payment_network)#:~:text=Stellar%20is%20an%20open%2Dsource,communicate%20with%20other%20Stellar%20servers.">open-source Stellar network</a>, has faced concerns over data security from many people. </p><p>As of May 28, 2023, the <a href="https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/DMMK-GDMMKKNI5KTQWFEI57ZTCAPFUJFGQSW5YUN5AJ4O2I25JXEU3IL2DZXD-1?filter=payments">Stellar blockchain had recorded 26,950 trustlines using the platform</a>.

Not to mention senior citizens."</p><p>He added, "Many people in our community came to the Bitcoin and crypto trading industry because they are kind of rich in cash but they don’t know what to do in this economic fallout."</p><p>Regarding NUGPay, Feliz expressed concerns about its limited adoption, saying, "I think the problem of NUGPay is limited adoption. You can’t use it as a currency outside of the revolution group. I think it needs widespread adoption everywhere to make it as an effective currency. Even some people who trade bitcoin and crypto don’t use or hesitate to use the NUGPay due to its limited acceptance. Even (a) user not under military reach doesn’t know what to use NUGPay for other than supporting the resistance.”</p><h2>How Bitcoin Can Help Those Resisting The Military In Myanmar</h2><p>But Bitcoin could serve as a better alternative for those in Myanmar who are being cut off from traditional banking services or fear currency devaluation.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MizzimaDaily/posts/pfbid02E3XzCQ2qoLcGoe5q5Wvnsh2YuSb4QamR49yjB95iqjNE4eeQEwTxA3XaLFTJbB4jl?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr">Research</a> conducted by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bitcoin.MM.Initiative/">Bitcoin Myanmar Initiative</a> shows that, while the value of the kyat has fallen by over 35% since the military coup, the price of bitcoin has doubled in the same period. Prior to the coup, the price of 1 BTC was approximately 500 million kyat, but it is hovering around 1 billion kyat on <a href="https://p2p.binance.com/en/trade/all-payments/BTC?fiat=MMK">Binance’s peer-to-peer exchange</a> as of this writing. </p><p>"We believe that the adoption of bitcoin and other digital currencies in Myanmar will be a gradual process, given the current economic environment and the fragile risk tolerance of the majority of people," a representative of the Bitcoin Myanmar Initiative told me. "However, we see the potential for growth due to the country's previous experiences with technology leapfrogging. With a smartphone penetration rate of 78% and only 36% of the population having a bank account, many people in Myanmar are looking for an alternative to traditional banking. By promoting a form of currency that no one can control, we aim to help people reclaim their property rights in a digital way and unleash themselves from the military regime's monetary policy. We believe that it's just a matter of time before more people in Myanmar recognize the benefits of Bitcoin."</p><p>Highlighting another powerful example of how Bitcoin can help those in Myanmar in “<a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books/products/check-your-financial-privilege">Check Your Financial Privilege</a>,” author Alex Gladstein wrote that:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“As a personal example, someone reached out to me at the beginning of the Myanmar revolution in February 2021. They wanted to provide aid to the democracy movement, but the banking system was practically shuttered, and there was no easy way to wire dollars. After doing some digging, we were introduced to an aid worker-turned-activist who was also a Bitcoin user. He could easily accept a donation, save it in BTC, and then sell it on the peer-to-peer markets when he needed to spend the collapsing local kyat currency on goods. An address was sent over Signal, and a gift was made in minutes. No barriers, no middlemen, and no possibility for corruption along the way. It is just one small example, but it is a glimpse of what the future could hold.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><em>This is a guest post by Win Ko Ko Aung.

Jor Law, Prime Trust's Interim CEO and President, said he believes that the combination of Prime Trust and BitGo will be a game-changer for the industry, stating, "No other company will have the breadth of product and services nor depth of experience that this combined company would have. We are excited to offer our world-class infrastructure within a broader ecosystem and revolutionize the future of crypto."</p><p>The blog posting listed the benefits the acquisition could hold for both companies. First, it noted that Prime Trust's Nevada Trust Company will join BitGo's global network of regulated trust companies, which already includes entities in South Dakota, New York, Germany and Switzerland. In addition, the expansion would enhance BitGo's presence and regulatory reach. Furthermore, the blog described how Prime Trust's fintech API infrastructure and exchange network will reinforce BitGo's existing services, including custody, liquidity, settlement and compliance capabilities.</p><p>Mike Belshe, CEO and Co-Founder of BitGo, views the acquisition as a milestone transaction that will contribute to a more secure and sustainable future for the digital asset landscape. Belshe stated, "With the expected acquisition of Prime Trust, BitGo is well positioned to enhance its best-in-class, trusted solutions and to service the combined customer base."</p><p>The deal is still subject to regulatory approval, and further details regarding the transaction are yet to be disclosed.</p><p>Just recently, bitcoin-only exchanges <a href="https://twitter.com/brianleejackson/status/1666583718256054272?s=20">Strike</a> and <a href="https://help.swanbitcoin.com/hc/en-us/articles/14874253038743">Swan</a> both announced that they would be moving away from custody through Prime Trust. Strike announced that it will be utilizing its own custody services, while Swan is moving to Fortress Trust and BitGo, Fortress Trust being founded by the former founder of Prime Trust, Scott Purcell. The acquisition announcement did not address or confirm rumors that Prime Trust is facing insolvency, which has been the center of speculation on Bitcoin Twitter.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMjI5NzEy/markets-price-chart.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[SatoshiLabs Introduces Vexl Foundation With KYC-Free P2P Bitcoin App And Financial Tyranny Index]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Foundation, supported by the company behind Trezor Wallet, is supposed to be an embodiment of the ideals of Bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/satoshilabs-introduces-vexl-foundation-with-bitcoin-app-and-financial-tyranny-index</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/satoshilabs-introduces-vexl-foundation-with-bitcoin-app-and-financial-tyranny-index</guid><category><![CDATA[Vexl Foundation]]></category><category><![CDATA[KYC]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[app]]></category><category><![CDATA[P2P]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[peer to peer]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 18:43:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNTM3MTYyODg3OTk2OTY0/individual-challenge-climb-peak-flag-mountain-top-photo.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=SatoshiLabs&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">SatoshiLabs</a>, the creator of the Trezor hardware wallet, has announced the launch of the Vexl Foundation at the BTC Prague conference.

    </figure><p>What if I told you that the largest pension fund in the United States could be rescued by Bitcoin? Furthermore, what if it could happen in a way that maintains 100% of its primary portfolio investments in traditional markets? I know. For those who don’t “Bitcoin,” many of you will stop here. But I urge you to read on a bit further. And for those who do Bitcoin, there is likely a pension near you facing a similar dilemma.</p><p>By incorporating bitcoin into the <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/benefit-programs/ceppt">California Employers Pension Prefunding Trust Fund</a> (CEPPT), California could continue to deliver on its commitment to its workforce and retirees, without having to make employees work longer years while paying more into the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/">CalPERS</a>) fund. Additionally, if California doesn’t want to do this, municipalities could and should do it on their own regardless by funding what I call a “Bitcoin Municipal Employers Pension Prefunding Trust (MEPPT).” In doing so, cities and public agencies could escape the redundant fate of unfunded liability payments.</p><p>Why bitcoin? Unlike other assets, “Bitcoin has no risk of liquidation,” as explained by Mickey Koss in a recent article, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/pension-funds-must-adopt-bitcoin">“Pension Funds Must Adopt Bitcoin or Risk Insolvency.”</a> “Bitcoin does not require leverage. Instead of making risky bets, perpetuating the culture of moral hazard and socialized losses, pension funds can use bitcoin as an asymmetric opportunity in order to bolster their returns.”</p><h2>The CalPERS Crisis</h2><p>With a total value of roughly $440 billion dollars, CalPERS is the largest “defined benefit” public pension in the nation, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1314998/public-pension-funds-worldwide-based-on-assets-under-management/#:~:text=Leading%20global%20public%20pension%20funds%202022%2C%20by%20assets%20under%20management&amp;text=Japan's%20Government%20Pension%20Investment%20Fund,worth%201.32%20trillion%20U.S.%20dollars.">fifth-largest public pension in the world</a> as of 2022. Holding in its hands the financial fates of public employees, municipalities and public agencies in California, CalPERS’ main priority is to grow and maintain its fund. By doing so, it can deliver on its commitments, which are payments to retirees.</p><p>The funded status of any pension takes the form of a percentage. It is the total estimated value of the assets on hand as a percentage of the total obligation to pay retirees (its liabilities). As reported most recently in June 2022, <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/board-agendas/202211/financeadmin/item-6a-01_a.pdf">CalPERS holds an estimated funded status of 72%</a>. This is below the traditionally accepted “healthy” funded status <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundedstatus.asp">which is at least 80%</a>. Most simply, this means that the fund currently has the ability to liquidate its assets to obtain 72% of the funds needed to make all of its payments. Thus, 28% of its overall liabilities are unfunded.</p><p>California has a larger unfunded pension liability than any other state in the nation. A report released earlier last year by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), found that unfunded pension liabilities nationwide have <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/california/article_b77e67bc-e842-11ec-ba2b-83e39b9717cd.html">climbed to $8.28 trillion</a>, “or just under $25,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States,” with California holding the nation’s largest public pension debt load.</p><p>CalPERS’ unfunded pension liability comes on the tail end of <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/about/laws-legislation-regulations/public-employees-pension-reform-act">major pension reform in 2013</a>. The reform extended the retirement age of new employees and increased employee contributions into the fund. Additionally, the fund benefited from a massive injection of liquidity in the past few years. </p><p>Governor Newsom’s 2022 to 2023 “<a href="https://ebudget.ca.gov/2022-23/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf">Governor's Budget Summary</a>” noted that “from 2017-18 through 2021-22, the state has made supplemental pension payments of $12.7 billion to CalPERS and CalSTRS (the California State Teachers Retirement System), with the goal of improving the funded status of both systems and reducing the state’s long-term retirement obligations.”</p><p>Despite both of these efforts over the past decade, a sustained improvement in CalPERS’ funded status has not arrived. On the eve of the next reporting period, all eyes are on the funded status and unfunded liability report that should arrive in June 2023. Fingers crossed.</p><h2>Unfunded Liabilities And Their Impacts</h2><p>An unfunded liability, quite simply, is the amount owed to keep a pension fund on pace to meet its obligations. Unfunded liabilities lead to extra payments, on top of the regular, annually-required payments to the pension, made by municipalities and public agencies. If you are scratching your head at this point, that’s normal. Pensions are complex with tons of variables, including the number of active employees/retirees, predicted life expectancy of retirees, cost-of-living adjustments, portfolio performance and more.</p><p>Unfunded liabilities don’t just disappear. They force CalPERS to request additional payments from municipalities and public agencies, on top of the normal payments made by those cities and agencies, as well as the contributions made by the employees into the pension fund.</p><p>These “extra” payments take a significant toll on cities. If unpaid, they accrue interest, and become looming burdens. I learned this after sitting on the pension advisory committee in my own city — a city with a long tradition of having an incredible public workforce. High-quality employees are so important. While this view is widely accepted in the private sector, it isn’t always so in the public sector. But some of the best-run and highest-revenue-earning cities understand and prioritize this. A dedicated public workforce is a tremendous benefit for the citizens of a city and visitors who receive city services. In the field of emergency services, that level of service can be the difference between life and death.</p><p>When municipalities have to pay unfunded liabilities on top of their normal pension payments, they either have to be extremely well off, or take away services from somewhere else to make the payments. </p><p>But luckily, we have an opportunity to escape this dilemma.</p><h2>How Bitcoin Can Fill The Unfunded Gap</h2><p>Enter Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an innovation with increasing global adoption, use and value. While the price has fluctuated greatly since its inception, Bitcoin’s network and community trajectory has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/btc-adoption-vs-internet-kevin-maraj?trk=articles_directory">outpaced many comparable technological revolutions in their early years</a>. That includes the internet, cell phones and other major technological breakthroughs. Additionally, as an asset, when zooming out, its performance trends up.</p><p>Despite its upward trajectory, Bitcoin is still new and, therefore, turbulent and constantly adapting. It also has yet to be clearly defined by the legacy financial system and regulatory agencies, providing barriers to entry.</p><p>CalPERS could add bitcoin to its balance sheets. But an easier, more realistic course of action would be to utilize a tool it already created: the CEPPT. </p><p>The CEPPT is a separate, “<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/benefit-programs/ceppt">Section 115 trust fund dedicated to prefunding employer contributions to defined benefit pension systems for eligible California public agencies</a>.” Think of it as a side fund to cover the shortfalls of the main fund. The flaw with the current, non-Bitcoin CEPPT, is that the fund is based in the same system that brought about the need for a new side fund to begin with. Eventually, that fund will succumb to the same structural vulnerabilities as the CalPERS main pension portfolio. And then what? A pre-, pre-funding trust to pay the pre-funding trust?</p><p>CalPERS’ <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/benefit-programs/ceppt">CEPPT webpage</a> says that, since its inception, “more than 75 California public employers” are participating. My recommendation: Pivot, or if you are an elected city official, reconsider this strategy. Instead, establish a Bitcoin MEPPT. </p><p>The long-term returns of bitcoin represent the only asset class that can fill the holes, currently un-fillable, in the CalPERS pension fund. The cities that implement this will find themselves the beneficiaries of a healthy workforce and financial stability. They will bypass the painful dilemma of cutting key services to taxpayers in order to pay endless unfunded liabilities. They can avoid downgrading their workforce to the point that they are unable to recruit and retain high-quality personnel.</p><h2>Bitcoin CEPPT Or MEPPT: Easy First Step And Added Benefits</h2><p>With a Bitcoin CEPPT or MEPPT, public employers, cities, employees and CalPERS can safely enter the world of Bitcoin without moving funds out of its portfolio, which we know is very difficult.</p><p>A Bitcoin CEPPT run by the state could free California from its value-based investment dichotomy. That dichotomy: being a state that simultaneously funds and prioritizes renewable energy, while condemning <em>yet</em> financially supporting fossil fuels and big oil through its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobeccles/2023/02/01/california-dreamin-calpers-and-calstrs-caught-in-climate-crossfire/?sh=1a93c1492b1c">roughly $42 billion</a> investment. The largest public fund investor of fossil fuels in the U.S. is CalPERS. It truly has one foot into the future while propping up the past.</p><p>A Bitcoin CEPPT could also include infrastructure components. A potential structure could allow California to further tap its <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=CA">abundant and steady renewable energy</a>, providing Bitcoin miners an opportunity to become even more climate friendly than they already are. In fact, a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-uses-mostly-sustainable-energy">majority of Bitcoin mining captures either wasted energy sources or renewable energy</a>. Bitcoin miners that have proven useful as a grid-balancing partner, could take the place of household energy consumers in California during times when the power is often shut off, such as during its frequent <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/lmk/pdf/what_is_a_red_flag_warning.pdf">red-flag warning, fire-weather days</a>. During these times, Southern California Edison is <a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/outage-information/psps">forced to balance the grid and shut off power to peoples’ homes</a>. </p><p>In these ways, and many more unmentioned ones, Bitcoin is a far better partner for <a href="https://batcoinz.com/BEEST/">California’s renewable energy goals</a>, then the big oil and fossil fuel Industry, currently capturing $42 billion, nearly 10% of CalPERS invested money!</p><p>For other states with similar issues, there are many exciting ways in which a Bitcoin CEPPT or MEPPT could be configured. There is even a tool called “<a href="https://nakamotoportfolio.com/">Nakamoto Portfolio</a>,” which was developed by Raphael Zagury, the CIO of Swan Financial. This tool allows funds to explore different configurations of how bitcoin could positively affect their portfolios based on past and predicted performances.</p><p>Despite its volatility, many legacy financial institutions predict the long-term value of bitcoin will continue to rise. Fidelity has even called for 1 Bitcoin to be valued at <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-worth-1-billion-2038-fidelity/">$1 million dollars by 2038</a>. That’s conservative, among some other long-term predictions. Many have compared Bitcoin to Apple, however it is much more than Apple. Apple changed the way in which the world interacts with technology. Bitcoin is simply going to change the world, and for the better and in ways we have yet to imagine.</p><p>In the likely event that Bitcoin is here to stay, this is a vehicle in which CalPERS can responsibly and slowly enter into the world of Bitcoin. Who knows, perhaps a Bitcoin CEPPT could prove worthy of primary portfolio contributions, to a point where it takes on a greater portion of CalPERS funds? </p><p>I’d like to see both ride off together into the California sunset: The CalPERS fund and Bitcoin CEPPT, giving California options to invest in ways truer to its core values, while supporting a vibrant and committed workforce.</p><p>To the cities and agencies who scoff at the idea of a Bitcoin CEPPT or MEPPT, I ask you an important question: If not Bitcoin, then what’s the plan to avoid bankruptcy or a declining workforce in your city due to runaway unfunded liabilities? To the unions and workers, how much longer are you willing to work and for how much less money, until we become more involved in the oversight of our own pension funds? And to CalPERS and the California legislature, you have a fiduciary obligation to those workers who built our state, to protect their funds and futures. Without another plan, cities, public employers and states owe it to the taxpayers and employees to explore Bitcoin and its promising future.</p><p>I am eager and happy to work with any union, city or elected official in the state to explore this as an option, at no cost. Why? Because I care about workers. As a firefighter and union leader, I’ve worked alongside a committed and amazing workforce, and I believe that when humans commit their most precious years to building something for their cities and states, they deserve the retirement that was promised on signup day.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dom Bei.

This is the second <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/crypto-winter-6504445">“crypto winter</a>” for my company, which produces Bitcoin mining containers.</p><p>In this article, I will share the story of how our Bitcoin mining company survived its first crypto winter, and is now surviving its second (as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932023_global_energy_crisis">world’s ongoing energy crisis</a>), and what we think will happen with the energy and crypto mining industries in the future.</p><h2>Our First Crypto Winter</h2><p><a href="https://ezblockchain.net/cases/">Our company</a> was launched in the first quarter of 2017 as a data center hosting solution with a mission to bring the best technology to Bitcoin miners.</p><p>We suffered a knock-on effect and initiated widespread redundancies as we struggled amid the looming cryptocurrency crash of the time. But we were still young, so our company had little to lose. We had only five employees and we had to learn to survive, mainly by managing cost and operating in a lean and mean way.</p><h2>Surviving Our Second Crypto Winter</h2><p>We arrived at the second crypto winter as one of the world's largest Bitcoin mining container producers (producing 10 containers every week). We have been one of the pioneers in utilizing wasted flared gas energy for Bitcoin mining and had built 10 cryptocurrency mining facilities across eight states and Canada, operating with more than 200 megawatts (MWs) of power. </p><p>But 2022 was among the most challenging years for us and the entire Bitcoin mining industry. It was characterized by declining bitcoin prices and rising energy costs, influenced by the energy crisis provoked by the war in Ukraine. Many mining <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-miner-capitulation-could-set-price-bottom">companies declared bankruptcy</a>, and those that survived had to reconsider their operations.</p><p>Some companies managed to survive in a year-long crypto winter, one that is arguably not over yet, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/record-bitcoin-mining-despite-bear-market">record mining difficulty</a> and completely-frozen funding. From my six years of experience running a Bitcoin infrastructure company, there are a few solutions I can share that I hope will help others or offer insight into how resilient Bitcoin mining can be. This should not be considered a panacea for market downturns or managerial advice, but simply what I have learned for myself. </p><h2>First, We Called Our Power Providers </h2><p>The bull run over the last few years has shown that Bitcoin miners prioritize acquiring miners over securing relationships with utilities.</p><p>But we believe that prioritizing the securing of power, and all of the infrastructure behind it, is critical. Last year, the bankruptcies of mining companies taught us just that. Having open communications with power providers on realistic expectations always helps sketch a clear plan for getting power flowing safely and on time. </p><p>There are multiple reasons why utilities are incentivized to sell power to Bitcoin mining companies: First, they make a profit on every kilowatt-hour (kWh) sold. However, giving more incentives to the electricity supplier, such as load flexibility, the high-capacity factor and controlled load increase, helps build a stronger foundation among integral partners in the Bitcoin mining industry. From my experience, power providers do not see Bitcoin miners any differently than other electricity consumers, as long as the bills are paid on time. </p><p>When the energy crisis hit us, the first thing we did was to call our power company partners and tell them that all the bills would be paid. We started to run the extra mile, investing in relationships with them.</p><h2>Take A Hands-On Approach To Construction</h2><p>We all know that electricity bills often take up more than 90% of mining expenditures. However, the seed for a successful Bitcoin mining operation site is planted with the first conduit in the ground, even before the machines start buzzing. </p><p>Developing a Bitcoin mining farm is a tedious job, requiring many moving pieces to come together. Usually, we are so focused on the bitcoin price and mining difficulty that not enough time is spent on the design, site planning and construction of a well-run facility. This fundamental job is usually outsourced to a consulting firm, an engineering firm or someone else. </p><p>But the negligence in hands-on planning of an operation during the construction and development stage can cost a fortune going forward. Even the most professional construction firm most likely has yet to gain experience in building a Bitcoin mining farm. It must be guided by Bitcoin nerds who know about common power supply problems like ASIC overheating issues, firmware upgrades, etc. </p><p>We’ve learned that a well-built Bitcoin facility reduces operational, cooling, maintenance and uptime expenses for years. On the other hand, a poorly-designed site can lead to rebuilding a plane in the air. The worst nightmare can be when everything is set, and you realize that something crucial is wrong. It could be that the voltage on a transformer is incorrect, or the cable is not sized correctly to operate 24/7, 365 with a nearly-95% load factor, just to name a few potential issues. </p><p>Learning about transformers, substations and airflow during development helps avoid future mistakes. This type of involvement is more crucial than constantly negotiating the price of mining equipment online. From a simple business perspective, the depreciation rate on a mining farm project is more than a decade, relatively small compared to that of mining equipment which is only a couple of years. That is why we let the mining infrastructure sit and wait for ASICs. </p><p>Bitcoin mining operations are marathons, not sprints. They require hard work behind the scenes before the hash rate shows up in the pool. Therefore, when the second crypto winter hit us, our key company players rolled up their sleeves and put their best feet forward to ensure the business operations were set up for success. </p><h2>Think Creatively About Energy Consumption</h2><h3>Gas Flaring Mitigation </h3><p>As power demands and electricity costs continue to rise, miners must integrate their power generation vertically. They must find new ways to generate revenue that do not only depend on hash price. </p><p>In 2018, when the bitcoin price started to fall, we were looking for alternative and affordable power to stay afloat. The obvious idea was that to get the most affordable power, one needs to generate electricity to eliminate intermediaries. We then realized that there was no way we could generate hydro, wind or solar power with a limited budget. </p><p>However, gas and electric generation has been around for decades and is relatively simple. What about natural gas? We would not have to buy propane tanks to mine Bitcoin. There was no need when <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/report-oil-companies-are-burning-off-natural-gas-and-leaving-regulators-in-the-dark/">billions of cubic feet of natural gas are burned annually in oil fields</a>. While drilling for oil, natural gas is released from the same reservoir. Sadly, the gas is flared due to a lack of infrastructure or economic feasibility in capturing it. That’s when I first realized that Bitcoin mining could be a tool that supplements the inefficiencies of the energy industry. Since then, we started <a href="https://ezblockchain.net/smartgrid/">mining Bitcoin on natural gas</a>.</p><h3>Flexible Loads </h3><p>The energy sector is transitioning from a fossil-fuels-dominated era to one of renewable power. Specifically, wind and solar are intermittent, adding stress to the grid. Our solution to inconsistent supply has been mixing renewable energy with natural gas-peaking power plants. These power plants are flexible enough to fire up the turbines within a few minutes’ notice to respond to the undersupply. </p><p>Those operations that are heavily dependent on renewables power grids need to implement a demand-response program where the grid incentivizes the users to reduce the load. This has become a game changer in power grid operation. By lowering the peak demand for energy, demand response programs reduce the need to construct new, expensive peaking generation units. However, since the introduction of the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/FERC_NAPDR_-_final.pdf">National Action Plan On Demand Response</a> in 2010, more progress has yet to be achieved.</p><p>A decade since, Bitcoin mining is the game changer. It is the most flexible, efficient, financially-feasible and, most importantly, working solution to grid instability. It can dispatch enormous loads of power in minutes without requiring any subsidies. It is market driven because Bitcoin miners always search for lower-cost operating facilities. Interestingly, the demand-response industry attracted a lot of attention once it started working correctly at scale. But the hero happened to be a long-hated “villain”: Bitcoin. </p><h2>The Future </h2><p>Energy companies have worked with Bitcoin miners long enough to understand that this industry is here to stay. It is a matter of time until the entire energy industry grows enough hard skin to accept it. Bitcoin mining has flipped from being just a power consumer to a consumer with benefits. The mining companies that will adopt different mining strategies, including optimizing operational costs, partnering with energy providers and finding a way to earn additional revenues using Bitcoin mining as a tool for energy management, will prevail. </p><p>This halving cycle ending in less than a year means that electricity sourcing and power prices will be even more crucial for the long-term success of the Bitcoin mining community. The next era of mining winners will be technologically-adapted companies with versatile toolkits to manage crises on many levels, including technological solutions for updating existing and developing new solutions. </p><p>Winters will come and go, Bitcoin will stay. The question is, who remains along with it?</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Sergii Gerasymovych.

The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102">SEC also accused</a> Coinbase of failing to register its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. The complaint alleges that since 2019, Coinbase has facilitated the buying and selling of billions of dollars' worth of crypto asset securities without proper registration, combining the functions of an exchange, broker, and clearing agency.</p><p>The SEC claims that Coinbase's failure to register has deprived investors of essential protections such as SEC inspection, recordkeeping requirements, and safeguards against conflicts of interest. The charges also extend to Coinbase's holding company, Coinbase Global Inc., as it is considered a control person and thus liable for some of Coinbase's violations.</p><p>Additionally, the SEC alleges that Coinbase conducted an unregistered securities offering through its staking-as-a-service program. This program allows customers to earn profits through blockchain transaction validation services. Coinbase allegedly pooled customers' stakeable crypto assets, performed the necessary validations, and rewarded customers with a portion of the generated rewards. The SEC states that Coinbase failed to register these offers and sales as required by law.</p><p>Just yesterday, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sec-sues-cryptocurrency-exchange-binance-alleging-securities-laws-violations">SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance</a> and its CEO CZ, alleging that the exchange violated securities laws, brazenly dodged regulation by the SEC and did not properly inform their consumers. The combination of lawsuits within two days indicate a major effort by U.S. regulators to set a new tone for regulation and application of securities law to digital assets.</p><p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1666059466750541825?s=20">criticized</a> Coinbase's alleged deprivation of critical protections for investors. Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, accused Coinbase of deliberately refusing to follow the federal securities laws, noting that the consequences for the investing public are significant.</p><p>Like the SEC's complaint against Binance, the regulator seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, penalties and other equitable relief. The investigation was conducted by the SEC's Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, with the assistance of the San Francisco Regional Office and the multi-state task force of ten state securities regulators.</p><p>Coinbase has not yet responded publicly to the charges. The outcome of this case will have significant implications for the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States and could be a major shift for the growth of the industry in the country. It's important to note that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/28/secs-gensler-reiterates-bitcoin-alone-is-a-commodity-is-he-right/">SEC Chair Gary Gensler is on record</a> as differentiating Bitcoin from cryptocurrencies at large, saying that bitcoin alone is a commodity.

According to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, LINER serves as a benchmark interest rate for bitcoin without credit risk, similar to the traditional finance's LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). The index aims to provide an alternative to enterprises seeking exposure to bitcoin while avoiding the credit risk associated with CeFi yield platforms.</p><p>"By communicating real yield rates from bitcoin held on the LN, enterprises will recognize the strategic error in trusting CeFi yield platforms while capturing the benefits of payment network disruption that is decades overdue,” said Jesse Shrader, co-founder and CEO of Amboss. Nik Bhatia, creator of <a href="https://thebitcoinlayer.substack.com/">The Bitcoin Layer</a>, praised LINER as a first-of-its-kind reference rate derived from the Lightning Network, contributing to the establishment of unmanipulated money markets independent of a central authority.</p><p>Allen Farrington, a Bitcoin writer and investor, acknowledged the value of a reference rate like LINER for assessing the true cost of capital, highlighting the Lightning Network's growth as a self-sustaining financial ecosystem for both retail and enterprise needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Amboss also operates <a href="https://amboss.space/magma">Magma</a>, a marketplace facilitating the buying and selling of Lightning channels, enabling bitcoin holders to earn BTC from opening Lightning channels to various destinations. “Since Lightning channels are self-custodial ways to hold bitcoin, Magma enables novel bitcoin yield without custodial risk, avoiding the pitfalls of failed CeFi yield platforms like Celsius and BlockFi,” the press release stated.</p><p>LINER comprises two insightful metrics: LINER Cost and LINER Yield, which provide enterprises with valuable insights into the lightning market. These metrics allow for comparisons between LINER Cost and traditional payment card fees, empowering large bitcoin holders to make informed decisions regarding their bitcoin holdings.</p><p>Jonathan Bier, an author and investor, noted the potential future significance of the LINER index as a reference rate for Bitcoin-based investment decisions. The introduction of LINER opens up possibilities for portfolio managers, investors and businesses to leverage the index in their decision-making processes.</p><p>With LINER, Amboss aims to encourage enterprise adoption of the Lightning Network by demonstrating the cost savings and low-risk yield potential offered by Lightning-enabled payment infrastructure. The index provides a clear incentive for large bitcoin holders to utilize self-custodial strategies and earn higher returns while minimizing risk.

Bitcoin is seen by many as a sound store of value, independent from governments and banks, providing an attractive alternative to traditional financial investments.</p><p>But can it realistically replace fiat currencies to become the money of the future?</p><h2>Bitcoin Attitudes: Progress To Date</h2><p>Ten years ago, only a small niche community was interested in BTC. Now, it is <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022">estimated</a> that 425 million people across the world own cryptocurrency, following a 39% growth in digital asset holders in 2022.</p><p>Up until the last few years, it was the norm for many to deride Bitcoin and call it a fraud. But after 2020, a drastic change in attitudes has taken place, with BTC's perception evolving from a speculative investment to a legitimate store of value and medium of exchange.</p><p>The main reason behind this shift is the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Since 2020, institutional investors have entered the market en masse, fueling a major bull run and <a href="https://bitcointreasuries.net/">accumulating</a> more than 7.8% of the total BTC supply as of May 2023. Consequently, bitcoin has become a legitimate asset class that is taken more seriously by more people.</p><p>Moreover, a 2022 Deloitte survey <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/29/deloitte-75-percent-of-retailers-plan-to-accept-crypto-payments-in-2-years.html">revealed</a> that 75% of polled retailers are planning to accept cryptocurrency payments within the next two years.</p><p>Besides that, bitcoin has become legal tender in multiple jurisdictions including, most notably, El Salvador. </p><h2>Sustainable Bitcoin Mining Is Shifting The Narrative</h2><p>Due to the fact that they require significant computational power, Bitcoin mining operations are often associated with high energy consumption. And estimates that suggest these operations<a href="https://rmi.org/cryptocurrencys-energy-consumption-problem/"> consume enough power</a> to rival the annual electricity needs of some entire countries have resulted in Bitcoin facing harsh criticism in recent years, presenting a major barrier to mainstream adoption.</p><p>However, Bitcoin's inherent energy consumption can actually offer significant benefits by stabilizing electricity grids and reducing the cost of power for consumers by balancing supply and demand. </p><p>Monthly and yearly electricity consumption is spread unevenly throughout the day. Peak demand often occurs in the morning and evening hours, while at night and on weekends, it is significantly reduced. In many places, Bitcoin mining may consume only the spare electricity that is not used up by local residents, thus allowing power plants to operate at full capacity. Meanwhile, the average consumers are spared from greater expenses meant to cover the production of that “excess” electricity.</p><p>Moreover, the fierce competition among validators and Bitcoin's deflationary nature incentivize miners to find more efficient and sustainable ways to mine. As the mining process becomes more competitive, miners will likely continue investing in more advanced hardware and software to increase their chances of successfully mining new Bitcoin blocks. In addition, they will also take further steps to use renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, thus reducing mining’s environmental impact even more.</p><p>As a result, I expect the public perception of mining to become more positive in the next five years, and mining itself to become more sustainable as a business.</p><h2>Following the Salvadoran Example</h2><p>In recent years, there has been a growing trend toward accepting bitcoin as a legal payment method. Several countries have legalized using BTC for various purposes, such as buying goods and services or paying taxes.</p><p>In September 2021, El Salvador took this trend further by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-approves-first-law-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-06-09/">becoming</a> the first country to make bitcoin a legal tender currency. Despite a somewhat troubled start, the nation's experiment has come with many positive results, especially if we <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tourism-in-el-salvador-up-30-since-bitcoin-adoption-minister-says">consider</a> the Salvadoran GDP growth of over 10% in 2021 and the 30% increase in tourism since BTC’s adoption.</p><p>I believe more nations will follow El Salvador's footsteps to find an alternative solution to protect their economies against the current economic uncertainty. For example, similar plans to make BTC a legal tender have sprouted up in<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/mexican-senator-plans-to-introduce-bill-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender"> Mexico</a>,<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/arizona-bitcoin-legal-tender-bill-introduced"> Arizona</a> and<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lugano-switzerland-will-make-bitcoin-legal-tender"> Switzerland</a>. Meanwhile, Liechtenstein's upcoming legislation <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/liechtenstein-could-embrace-bitcoin-as-a-payment-method-for-gvmt-services-says-pm/">plans</a> to enable Bitcoin payments for government services.</p><p>However, while the legalization of Bitcoin as a payment method has many advantages, independent cryptocurrencies have always been seen as a threat to fiat. Crypto adoption increasing worldwide is surely the reason why many governments are committed to developing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These are essentially national currencies with state control over their issuance and payment networks.</p><p>Arguably, CBDCs stand a greater chance of gaining mainstream adoption than Bitcoin in the coming years. This is due to their potential for integration with existing financial systems and regulatory frameworks, as well as the backing and support of central banks around the world. However, both Bitcoin and CBDCs are still in the early stages of development, and their adoption will depend on a variety of factors.</p><h2>Is Bitcoin The Currency Of The Future?</h2><p>With a shift in consumer and business attitudes, growing use as a store of value and a medium of exchange, as well as positive developments in the mining industry and among national governments, Bitcoin is gradually progressing toward mainstream adoption.</p><p>As bitcoin use cases continue to expand, I believe more individuals and organizations will realize its potential as a long-term investment tool.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Didar Bekbauov.

The event witnessed notable participation from U.S. presidential candidates and generated enthusiasm, setting the stage for Bitcoin's mainstream adoption. Brandon Green, Head of Staff of Bitcoin Magazine, expressed his excitement, stating, "This year's Bitcoin Conference surpassed all my expectations, becoming a defining moment for the Bitcoin industry."</p><p>The conference also focused on fundraising efforts, with the organization <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/brink-million-dollar-bitcoin-donation-campaign">Brink successfully raising</a> $800,000 USD to support open-source Bitcoin protocol development. Samara Alpha Management and Bitcoin Magazine Pro announced a partnership for The Bitcoin Alpha Competition, offering a chance for startup managers and hedge funds to present their strategies to institutional allocators and potentially win $1 million in seed capital.</p><p>Art and commerce played a significant role at the conference. An art showcase and auction called <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/miami-bitcoin-conference-will-have-ordinals-alley-art-gallery">Ordinal Alley</a> sold 6.38 BTC worth of rare pieces, highlighting the growing interest in Bitcoin and the Ordinals protocol within the art world. The Bitcoin Bazaar facilitated transactions using Bitcoin, while the Bitcoin Magazine store reported that 21% of all transactions were made using Lightning bitcoin payments.</p><p>Keynotes and sessions addressed various aspects of Bitcoin. U.S. Presidential candidates <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/robert-kennedy-jr-debuts-campaign-at-bitcoin-2023">Robert F.

With the help of address tracking, public announcements and some estimation across data sources, we can get a sense of where nearly 47% of total bitcoin supply is today. A considerable portion of bitcoin’s 21-million supply is estimated to be lost, which includes Satoshi Nakamoto’s coins. There’s useful data from both <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=supply.ProvablyLost">Glassnode</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/">Chainalysis</a> to suggest that nearly 4 million bitcoin has been lost.</p><p>Other large amounts of bitcoin are on exchanges, in the Grayscale trust, or in bitcoin miners’ wallets. Swaths of bitcoin have been accumulated by the likes of MicroStrategy, and more recently Tether. Some 5,500 bitcoin are locked up on the Lightning Network, while other sums exist as wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) on blockchains besides Bitcoin.</p><p>Most bitcoin estimates can be tracked on a routine basis when looking at examples, like known U.S. government-associated on-chain addresses from various bitcoin seizures, or when analyzing monthly production updates from public bitcoin miners, while other holding details can be much harder to come by. A private institution may have indicated bitcoin holdings years ago, but isn’t required to publicly announce updates of their stash. Other instances include uncertainty around government holdings. China may have <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1587917712126144512?s=20">194,000 bitcoin</a> from seizure, but it’s difficult to verify if this number is current.</p><p>All that said, the below chart is a rough cut of available data that can be expanded upon and improved for better accuracy across different groups. These figures come from on-chain forensics, public SEC filings and balance sheet attestations.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin holdings separated by type of entity.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Of the 2.3 million of bitcoin on exchanges, the majority resides on Binance and Coinbase. This wouldn’t include bitcoin in investment custody products like Grayscale and Coinbase Custody, for example. Binance’s share of bitcoin on exchanges has risen from under 10% in 2019 up to 30% today. The company is estimated to have nearly 700,000 bitcoin on their platform, which can predominantly be attributed to their derivatives marketplace dominance and their international presence, whereas Coinbase is mainly a spot exchange with a heavy U.S. presence.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The percent share of exchanges' bitcoin balances.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Over time, the amount of circulating bitcoin supply on exchanges has reached 17.5% of circulating supply, reaching its peak in March 2020 before declining to just 11.89%. We suspect that the trend of declining bitcoin on exchanges as a percentage of circulating supply will continue as bitcoin distributes across an increased number of global adopters, thanks to sophisticated personal custody solutions becoming more mainstream and robust as time goes on.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>A little less than 12% of circulating bitcoin is held on exchanges.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>In absolute terms, there has never been this level of long-term holders in bitcoin. In relative terms, the only two times in history with a larger share of long-term holder coins is in 2009 before bitcoin had an exchange rate, and in the depths of the 2015 bear market. With so much of the supply off the market, sell-side pressure in the interim can result in large price adjustments to the downside, since many market participants are partaking in more of a passive role.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Long-term holders' percentage of circulating supply is growing.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>We can also look at bitcoin’s illiquid supply to quantify holder dynamics. The term “illiquid supply” refers to bitcoin that are held by entities that rarely sell, meaning these coins are not readily available for trading. To quantify this, an entity's bitcoin holdings are deemed illiquid if less than 25% of its received bitcoins have been spent, liquid if 25% to 75% have been spent, and highly liquid if over 75% have been spent.</p><p>In the post-2016 halving era, bitcoin’s illiquid supply as a percentage of circulating supply is at its highest level, with holder accumulation taking coins off the market faster than miner issuance can distribute them. </p><p>As of this April 2023, bitcoin’s illiquid supply surpassed 15,000,000 coins.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Illiquid bitcoin supply has trended upward since 2016.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>The trend is clear: Bitcoin continues to distribute into more hands, with a greater concentration of supply shifting from entities holding large amounts of bitcoin — balances of 1,000-10,000 BTC, 10,000-100,000 BTC, and greater than 100,000 BTC — to entities holding balances of 10 BTC or less.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin balances of less than 10 bitcoin has been growing for over a decade, meaning supply is getting distributed more evenly.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>It’s important to note that entities holding large amounts of bitcoin, particularly those with 10,000-plus BTC, are likely managing keys for thousands or even millions of users, exchanges being an obvious example. This is often a classic source of mischaracterization and misinformation when people make claims regarding a lack of wealth distribution of bitcoin. Yes, there are clumps of addresses with large holdings of bitcoin, but this is like claiming that one corporation owns 14% of all U.S. dollars in the commercial banking system. While JPMorgan Chase has $2.4 trillion out of $17.1 trillion of deposits in domestic banks and the deposits are a liability of JPMorgan, in actuality, they are custodied for millions of unique individuals and businesses. </p><p>The key difference — aside from the legal versus cryptographic ownership structure — is the fact that bitcoin’s ownership structure, the UTXO set, is much more transparent and easily auditable. This makes it easy for anyone to look at the data and make informed claims about bitcoin’s supply concentration. </p><h2>Final Note</h2><p>Bitcoin has been successful in attracting a broad spectrum of holders, from individuals to corporations, private entities and even nation-states. As evidenced by increasing retail ownership and historically high levels of long-term holders, it’s clear that bitcoin's supply is getting distributed more evenly across this vast array of adopters. This trend is further reinforced by a declining amount of bitcoin held on exchanges and an increasing illiquid supply.</p><p>Moving forward, we anticipate these trends of increased distribution and declining concentration to continue, as bitcoin’s 21,000,000 hard capped supply is divided up between the world’s individuals, institutions, corporations and nation states. </p><hr><p><em>That concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO. </em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/subscribe"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

Per the complaint, Binance engaged in unregistered offers and sales of securities and made false representations to investors regarding surveillance and controls over manipulative trading.</p><p>According to the SEC’s claim, Binance and its subsidiary, BAM Trading, operated as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearing agency without registering with the SEC. The commission also alleges that Binance conducted unregistered offers and sales of its own cryptocurrency assets, as well as profit-generating programs and investment schemes. Specifically, the charges focus on the BNB and BUSD cryptocurrencies launched by Binance, as well as the BNB Vault and Simple Earn programs, “and a so-called ‘staking’ investment scheme available on the Binance.US Platform.” The defendants are accused of depriving investors of material information about these securities and programs.</p><p>Furthermore, the complaint states that Binance and BAM Trading made misrepresentations about the controls implemented on the Binance.US platform, raising significant amounts of money from private investors. The SEC asserts that Binance evaded U.S. laws and regulation by implementing a plan to surreptitiously escape registration requirements. “As Zhao himself acknowledged—Binance did not want to ‘be held accountable’ for these actions,” the filed charges explain. “As the Binance CCO explained, ‘[o]n the surface we cannot be seen to have US users[,] but in reality, we should get them through other creative means.’”</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402">response</a> to the SEC's complaint, Binance expressed disappointment and emphasized its active cooperation with the SEC's investigations. Binance stated that it had engaged in extensive discussions to reach a settlement but that the SEC chose to act unilaterally. The company said it intends to vigorously defend its platform and criticized the SEC's enforcement approach, calling for more clarity and guidance for the digital asset industry. Binance also refuted allegations that user assets on the Binance.US platform were at risk, assuring customers of the safety and security of their funds.</p><p>The SEC seeks various remedies and resolutions, including a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties and equitable relief.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Over 400 Small Businesses In The Philippines Are Now Accepting Bitcoin Payments]]></title><description><![CDATA[Businesses are taking advantage of the unique benefits the Lightning Network offers through Pouch.ph’s payments platform.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/400-small-businesses-in-the-philippines-are-now-accepting-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/400-small-businesses-in-the-philippines-are-now-accepting-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Lightning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Philippines]]></category><category><![CDATA[Payments]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 16:52:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3NzA5OTE3/global-hyperbitcoinization.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://pouch.ph">Pouch.ph</a>, a bitcoin payment firm launched in 2021, has announced that it is enabling over 400 small businesses to accept and process Bitcoin payments in the Philippines. According to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, the platform aims to tap into the vast pool of merchants in the country, ranging from mom-and-pop stores to boutique hotels.</p><p>Pouch.ph utilizes the Lightning Network built on top of Bitcoin to facilitate faster, more affordable and user-friendly digital payments. With this payment protocol, customers can pay by scanning a merchant's QR code with any Bitcoin wallet, and Pouch.ph converts the bitcoin to pesos, transferring the funds directly to the merchant's bank or mobile money account.</p><p>According to Ethan Rose, CEO of Pouch.ph, one of the significant challenges faced by small businesses is the limited availability of payment methods, with credit cards charging fees of up to three percent. With the increasing number of internet and smartphone users in the Philippines, accepting bitcoin as a payment method opens up opportunities for those without credit cards or local fiat currency to make online or in-store purchases.</p><p>Some local businesses in Boracay, a popular tourist destination, have already embraced bitcoin payments through Pouch.ph. In the press release, Erielyn Gaston, owner of Kasbar restaurant, highlighted the advantages of accepting Bitcoin, stating that it has allowed her to attract a wider customer base and increase sales. Meanwhile, TIB Market manager Marcel Selfer praised the convenience of a fast and easily available payment service, noting that it provides an alternative to high fees charged by non-bank ATMs for credit card users.</p><p>Expanding its services beyond Boracay, Pouch.ph noted that it has successfully onboarded merchants in cities such as Cebu City, Dumaguete, Iloilo and Bacolod City. Additionally, in Metro Manila, establishments like URBN QC, Draper Startup House and KosneyLand have started accepting bitcoin payments through Pouch.ph. The company also offers a Batch Pay feature, enabling business owners to send payments instantly to employees, suppliers and other recipients, simplifying payment processes.</p><p>To facilitate bitcoin transactions, individuals can utilize <a href="http://btcmap.org/">BTCMap.org</a> to locate merchants that accept Bitcoin payments. Pouch.ph plans to extend its Batch Pay services for over-the-counter remittances through LBC, M Lhuillier and Palawan Pawnshop. By embracing bitcoin, small businesses in the Philippines are capitalizing on the increasing number of internet and smartphone users, while offering customers more diverse and convenient payment options.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3NzA5OTE3/global-hyperbitcoinization.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Salvador Unleashes "Volcano Energy" With 241 Megawatt Planned Bitcoin Mining Operation]]></title><description><![CDATA[The country of El Salvador is harnessing its energy resources and constructing a renewable power generation park to fuel the growth of Bitcoin mining.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/el-salvador-plans-241-megawatt-renewable-plant-for-bitcoin-mining</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/el-salvador-plans-241-megawatt-renewable-plant-for-bitcoin-mining</guid><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[el salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Solar]]></category><category><![CDATA[El Salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[Power Plant]]></category><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy]]></category><category><![CDATA[wind]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 13:32:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg0MDA2MjQxMTQ2NjQ0MTY5/volcano.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>The country of El Salvador is tapping into its abundant natural resources to create “<a href="https://twitter.com/Volcano_Energy">Volcano Energy</a>.” According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the aim is to position the country as a major global player in the Bitcoin mining industry while promoting energy competitiveness, diversification and geographic expansion for the Bitcoin network. Adopting a debt-free approach, El Salvador plans to construct a 241 megawatt (MW) renewable power generation park in the Metapán region, combining solar and wind projects.</p><p>"This project is a transformative journey that will establish one of the world's largest Bitcoin mining farms," the release said. “Located in the El Shiste hamlet, within the municipality of Metapán, Santa Ana, this chosen site boasts exceptional solar and wind energy yields in the country.” The park will have a capacity of 169MW of photovoltaic solar energy and 72MW of wind energy. The initial computational power is expected to surpass 1.3 EH/s, marking a significant milestone for the country and industry.</p><p>The release stated that “The total commitment for the project is $1 billion, beginning with a first investment of $250 million, bootstrapped by key Bitcoin industry leaders, with collaboration from top developers and manufacturers of renewable energy technology, as well as Bitcoin mining experts on a global scale.” The government of El Salvador will play a crucial role in the planning and execution of the initiative, securing a preferred participation equivalent to 23% of the revenue. The remaining ownership will be divided among investors and reinvested in expanding energy production capacity and advancing Bitcoin mining.</p><p>Robert Warren of Distributed Hash <a href="https://twitter.com/BikesandBitcoin/status/1665719174549626880?s=20">explained on Twitter</a> that the reasoning behind leveraging wind and solar is likely to monetize quicker to build upon a base set of geothermal expansion.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BikesandBitcoin/status/1665719174549626880"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>By leveraging Volcano Energy, El Salvador aims to create a prosperous future driven by sustainable energy and Bitcoin. As the country’s investment progresses volcanoes could serve as the backbone of this transformation, fostering economic growth and prosperity for future generations. The establishment of the renewable power generation park signifies a large step towards achieving these goals while cementing El Salvador's position in the global Bitcoin mining industry.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg0MDA2MjQxMTQ2NjQ0MTY5/volcano.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[We’ve Failed Gen Z, But Bitcoin Offers Hope For The Future]]></title><description><![CDATA[The members of Generation Z have had their futures stolen by monetary mismanagement, but they are poised to rebuild with Bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-might-save-gen-z</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-might-save-gen-z</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Zoomers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[debt]]></category><category><![CDATA[sound money]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[David Waugh,Dave Birnbaum]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNTQxOTQxNDY3Nzg0MzE2/silver-or-orange-lining-in-the-clouds-hope-freedom-storm.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by David Waugh, business development and communications specialist at bitcoin investing platform Coinbits, and Dave Birnbaum, the product director at Coinbits.</em></p><p>Every generation has bones to pick with those who came before. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">Generation Z</a>, those born between the late 1990s and early 2010s, have an especially valid complaint: Previous generations have stolen their future.</p><p>Also called “the Zoomers,” this group was forced by lockdowns and school closures to socialize through webcams during their formative years. These <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/gen-z-stats">68 million Americans</a> have had their lives disrupted by social upheaval, wealth destruction and cultural decline, all during the prime of their youth.</p><p>Many Zoomers do not yet realize the scale of the crime perpetrated against them. Some are waking up. Either way, all of them will soon need to chip in to pay the piper for decades of monetary and fiscal mismanagement by prior generations.</p><p>But the situation is not hopeless. There is a tool that Generation Z can use to achieve restitution. Instead of embarking on a dismal project to rebuild our ruined financial system, only to reinstate the rents and inequities that existed before, Zoomers can leave their mark upon history by using bitcoin to build a new system that is resilient, equitable and just. </p><p>Like the Greatest Generation, which rebuilt America on strong foundations after facing down the greatest threat to humanity that had ever manifested, Generation Z can channel their well-earned sense of betrayal and loss to create a world order worthy of being passed down to their own children and grandchildren.</p><h2>Backed Into A Corner</h2><p>Sometimes called “<a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/the-loneliest-generation/">the loneliest generation</a>,” Gen Z has been sold out by their elders, who have declined to make the necessary sacrifices to allow future generations to prosper. The psychological warfare waged against Zoomers is sometimes subtle, but often, it is not. In schools, mass media and online, they are assailed with doom about climate, race and exploitation, and told that their future has been stolen by evil people who selfishly refuse to fix those problems. </p><p>In fact, this is a half truth. The Zoomers' future has indeed been stolen, but not by polluters and racists. Instead, globalist elites, smart enough to see their system failing but not courageous enough to take responsibility for it, have looted the financial and cultural capital left to us by the Greatest Generation.</p><p>As part of the coverup for this crime, Zoomers have endured a constant onslaught of depressing propaganda. They are told the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/426353-ocasio-cortez-the-world-will-end-in-12-years-if-we-dont-address/">world will end</a> in 10 years. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-climate-change-keeping-you-up-at-night-you-may-have-climate-anxiety-202206132761">"Climate anxiety" is widespread</a> among a generation that is instructed to feel guilty for their existence rather than called to create new things and solve problems. Previous generations shot for the moon. <a href="https://time.com/6273065/space-travel-climate-impact/">Today’s elites disparage space exploration</a> out of concern that rockets might affect the weather.</p><p>All of this has yielded predictable results. Zoomers experience high rates of suicide, depression, anxiety and many <a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/the-loneliest-generation/">feel that life is meaningless.</a></p><p>Politicians are not likely to offer a solution. Appealing to the voting base of Generation Z is a shameful game of <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-gaslighting-of-the-american-people/">gaslighting</a>, <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/welcome-to-the-frankfurtian-world/">virtue signaling</a> and self-righteous <a href="https://mises.org/library/strange-liberty-politics-drops-its-pretenses">power grabs</a>. Political leaders <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-biden-budget-smoke-mirrors-and-class-warfare/">deny reality</a>, and claim that they can <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/13/remarks-on-executing-a-modern-american-industrial-strategy-by-nec-director-brian-deese/">engineer prosperity</a> using central planning. Government schools and universities generally fail to deliver a quality humanist education, depriving an entire generation of the necessary intellectual tools to notice this deception.</p><h2>Growing Awareness Of The Problem</h2><p>And yet, many members of Generation Z are coming to important realizations as they work their way through the rubble of the university system and join the workforce. We recently caught up with Jack Nicastro, a current Dartmouth College student, who believes he can see through politically motivated pessimism:</p><p>“Mainstream culture is hopelessly (and insupportably) pessimistic, particularly apropos technology,” Nicastro said. “Politicians capitalize on the populace's anxieties about technology, automation and AI with their usual demagoguery to advance illiberal policy agenda, as evidenced by the TikTok hearings.”</p><p>Sid Gundapaneni, a student at Binghamton University, offered a similar perspective, stating he is, “optimistic in a broad sense” regarding living standards, though less certain about the future of freedom:</p><p>“From a liberty standpoint, I'm unable to maintain such confidence — and I believe there are long-term consequences for this,” he said. “But right now, governments and their subsidized industries show no fatigue in their massive growth.”</p><h2>Coming To Terms With The Challenge</h2><p>The fiscal and monetary crises facing Gen Z are significant. The national debt is <a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/#">over $31 trillion</a>, and unfunded liabilities exceed $187 trillion. Thanks to a politicized and incompetent Federal Reserve, the American economy is <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-path-to-full-stagflation/">headed toward stagflation</a>, a nasty phenomenon where inflation and unemployment intensify at the same time.</p><p>Leaders from major political parties <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3953384-cassidy-says-biden-and-trump-have-same-plan-on-social-security-which-is-to-do-nothing/">claim</a> Social Security and Medicare reforms are off the table. Brian Riedl, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/04/social-security-and-medicare-insolvency-dates-are-a-distraction/">recently stated</a> that both programs “will drive $116 trillion in budget deficits over the next 30 years, according to CBO (Congressional Budget Office) data.”</p><p>Some Zoomers recognize the need for reform. In a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-gen-z-cash-in-on-social-security-reform-insolvency-retirement-savings-accounts-college-university-student-rick-scott-political-capital-e626edd1">Wall Street Journal article</a> featuring student commentary on Social Security, Mark Panjaitan, an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin, stated, “Instead of placing retirement dreams in the hands of a deadlocked Congress, I advise everyone to depend on the fruits of their own labor.”</p><p>Another, Ryan Callahan of the University of Virginia, claimed, “Regardless of the changes Congress makes, Social Security will be a ghost of its former self by the time my generation can collect.”</p><p>With the political process unable to address basic needs for change, let alone ambitious projects that require sacrifice for the sake of future generations, voting and activism cannot solve this problem alone. On our current trajectory, the amount of economic growth that would be needed to pay off our debt is almost mathematically impossible — barring a technology breakthrough that rearranges the chess board.</p><h2>A Generation Primed For Bitcoin</h2><p>A defining characteristic of Zoomers that makes them worthy of their name is that they move incredibly fast. Gen Z was brought up on a media diet of frenetic stimulation. Its members are quick to learn new technologies and good at using them to create novel content, apps and social experiences. </p><p>As McKinsey researchers <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/true-gen-generation-z-and-its-implications-for-companies">noted</a>, “Members of Gen Z… are true digital natives: from earliest youth, they have been exposed to the internet, to social networks, and to mobile systems.” </p><p>This fast-paced, technology-centric way of life primes the Zoomers for Bitcoin. While previous generations might balk at Bitcoin’s unfamiliarity, Zoomers are <em>more</em> comfortable with Bitcoin than they are with traditional banks and financial products. They are well positioned to build out the necessary infrastructure to bring Bitcoin to billions of people — and change the calculus confronting the problems of their time.</p><h2>The Journey Home</h2><p>Although Bitcoin offers hope for Zoomers, they must steel themselves for what is to come — a difficult journey to return to a balanced and free society. Preparing will require independent study, to make up for the miseducation prevalent in government schools and higher education. They will need to organize their own communities using encrypted communication networks in the face of censorship, intimidation and surveillance. They must permeate existing institutions, such as the legal and financial fields, public service and corporate leadership, with the means to impose tough reforms.</p><p>In addition, they will need to understand that Bitcoin provides a key part of these means. Bitcoin is leverage in a world where Gen Z has very little. They’ll need to reject the false promise of “crypto,” and relearn the ancient art of long-term thinking.</p><p>Every generation deals with crises, but some generations are called to especially tough challenges. The Greatest Generation went to war to protect humanity from totalitarian regimes. The Zoomers now must face the repercussions of decades of monetary and fiscal irresponsibility, and the downstream destruction it has wrought on their freedoms and their culture. </p><p>They did not ask for it, but for a generation of young people who struggle to believe that their lives have meaning, the calling to rebuild with Bitcoin is perhaps the greatest blessing they could have received. It won’t be easy, but it will be worth it.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by David Waugh and Dave Birnbaum.

But, much to their chagrin, their victory lap ended up being premature. Bitcoin has come roaring back in 2023, ending these premature celebrations and taking back some of its 2022 losses with a massive <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">year-to-date gain of over 60%</a> as of this writing so far in 2023. </p><p>Here are three reasons behind Bitcoin’s 2023 resurgence: </p><h2>One: Banking Sector Turmoil And A Timely Reminder Of Bitcoin’s Value </h2><p>In March 2023, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/recap-of-last-weeks-banking-contagion-and-bitcoin">turmoil from the banking sector</a> in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse rocked the market with the types of issues that it hadn’t experienced since the Great Recession. This was no fly-by-night operation; at the time, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/13/1163155347/svb-silicon-valley-bank-collapse-bailout-failure#:~:text=via%20Getty%20Images-,Silicon%20Valley%20Bank%20was%20the%2016th%20largest%20bank%20in%20America,group%20texts%20and%20Twitter%20posts.">sixteenth-largest bank in the United States</a> and the bank of choice for many venture capitalists and startups.</p><p>This high-profile implosion and the lack of proper risk management in place at SVB led many individuals to question how safe their money was. Ultimately, the Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/2023/03/22/what-did-the-fed-do-after-silicon-valley-bank-and-signature-bank-failed/">stepped in to make the bank’s depositors whole</a>, but the event still called the health of the banking system into question. </p><p>While not everyone is rushing to take their money out of banks, many more people are now at least aware of the risks of a single point of failure and are moving to diversify their assets by splitting them between multiple banks or even diversifying into alternatives like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for the first time. </p><p>The appeal of a fully decentralized asset like bitcoin is that there is no CEO or management team in charge that can endanger the solvency of the Bitcoin network by making a bad decision or poor judgment call. Bitcoin users don’t have to trust a company or management team to use Bitcoin; they can instead verify the open-source code that governs the Bitcoin network. Anyone can view any transaction ever made on the Bitcoin blockchain, giving the network unmatched transparency.</p><p>The price of bitcoin surged in March in the wake of the crisis, and in late April, renewed troubles at First Republic Bank, which reported that it <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3959401-first-republic-stock-slides-7-after-deposits-sank-by-more-than-70b-in-q1?hasComeFromMpArticle=false">lost over $70 billion in deposits during the previous quarter</a> propelled bitcoin prices higher yet again, showing that investors and savers clearly view it as a port in the storm amidst the current uncertainty. </p><h2>Two: Dedollarization At A Global Scale</h2><p>In addition to the specific troubles highlighted by the banking crisis, faith in the dollar itself seems to be dwindling globally. Bitcoin isn’t the only indicator here; precious metals like <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-gold-and-silver-prices-surged-today-51667953747">gold and silver are surging</a> while USD reserve currency held by other countries is at its lowest level in decades: from 73% in 2001 to 55% 20 later, in 2021, and down to 47% by April 2022, <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-04-19/USD-is-suffering-stunning-collapse-as-world-s-reserve-currency-warns-Eurizon-SLJ-Capital-s-Jen.html">according to economist Stephen Jen</a>. The yuan is now the <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-04-19/USD-is-suffering-stunning-collapse-as-world-s-reserve-currency-warns-Eurizon-SLJ-Capital-s-Jen.html">most-traded currency in Russia</a> while China and Brazil recently struck an agreement to settle trades in the yuan and real instead of in dollars. Meanwhile, Malaysia is making similar deals with both India and China. </p><p>Former Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jim O’Neill — <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/06/jim-oneill-revisits-brics-emerging-markets.htm">who originated the BRICS acronym</a>, referring to then-emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — recently called on these countries to <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-03-30/Ex-Goldman-chief-economist-calls-on-BRICS-to-challenge-USD-s-dominance-as-China-leads-de-dollarization-trend.html">challenge dollar hegemony</a> with a new native currency. This ambition is likely a bridge too far at this point in time. As a commodity importer, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/02d6ab99-ea36-41c4-9ad3-9658bb1894a7">China’s economic goals</a> aren’t aligned with commodity exporters like Brazil and Russia. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53062484">tensions between China and India</a> call the likelihood of this coming together into question. Nevertheless, it is another signpost on the road towards global dedollarization. It’s not just BRICs countries that are exploring their options — U.S. allies like French president Emmanuel Macron recently warned that Europe should <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-president-emmanuel-macron-states-europe-must-reduce-its-dependence-on-the-us-dollar-to-avoid-becoming-vassals/">reduce its dependence on the U.S. dollar</a> to avoid becoming “vassals.” </p><p>While none of this means that the end of the dollar’s reign as the global reserve currency is guaranteed or imminent, it does paint the picture that individuals and nations are clearly looking for non-dollar alternatives to diversify into. </p><p>The long-term effects of dedollarization and the banking crisis’ effect on Bitcoin is still being written, but it has made more people aware of Bitcoin as a viable alternative to the current system, and it has certainly served as a catalyst for the price of bitcoin. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, bitcoin climbed from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">just under $20,000 on March 10, 2023 to over $30,000 barely a month later on April 13, 2023,</a> gaining 50% and adding $200 billion to its market capitalization in the process. </p><h2>Three: Development Of The Layer 2 Ecosystem</h2><p>Along with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinal-concerns-bitcoin-decentralization-and-block-space">the rise of Ordinals</a>, Bitcoin has benefitted from the further development of its Layer 2 ecosystem, through projects such as Stacks and the Lightning Network. Stacks is a “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/27/allure-of-bitcoin-ordinals-defi-drives-crypto-funds-to-bitcoin-layer-2-token-stacks/">Layer 2 companion chain for smart contracts</a> focused on bitcoin (BTC) … allowing for the creation of related financial products.” At the time of this writing, Stacks <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/">has a market value of nearly $1 billion</a> and is approaching the top-50 cryptocurrencies in market capitalizaiton. </p><p>Recent upgrades to Stacks enable Stacks users to pledge their tokens to secure the network to earn rewards in a manner similar to how networks like Ethereum enable participants to earn rewards by staking their holdings. In this way, Stacks could ultimately end up bringing DeFi to Bitcoin. </p><p>In addition to Stacks, other Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols like Lightning continue to grow. Lightning is focused on making Bitcoin more scalable. Recent research from Glassnode found that Lightning is <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">1,000-times cheaper than using legacy payment processors</a> like Visa and Mastercard. Glassnode’s James Check found that the fee for sending 1 BTC across the Lightning Network was 3,000 satoshis (the smallest unit of bitcoin), which was the equivalent of an $0.84 fee to send $28,000 in dollar terms, or a miniscule fee of just 0.0029%. Payment application Strike uses the Lightning Network to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-growth-is-organic-coming-from-real-world-adoption">facilitate no-fee transfers</a> from the United States to other countries, including Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana and will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/bitcoin-based-app-strike-expands-in-philippines-to-grow-cross-border-payment-solutions/">soon offer it to the Philippines</a>. </p><h2>Bitcoin's Best Days Are Ahead</h2><p>In addition to these macroeconomic factors, the next Bitcoin halving is coming up in 2024. Halvings occur roughly every four years and reduce the rewards for mining new BTC by 50%, essentially increasing the degree of mining difficulty and reducing the supply of bitcoin over time. Halvings have historically been bullish catalysts for bitcoin. </p><p>In 2023, between a changing macroeconomic landscape and the technical and developmental advances surrounding the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin has proven that, not only is it back from the dead, but its best days are likely still ahead of it. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Chen Fang.

History may not repeat itself per se, but as an endless record of follower-humans following leader-humans off of proverbial cliffs demonstrates (and for no other reason than the leader-humans were/are really skilled at lying), it certainly feels like déjà vu all over again. </p><p>Worry not! This is not an article about Trump or about ideological disaffection. Trump is just one man in a human melodrama that spans millennia. The focus of this piece is about the role Bitcoin can play in restoring belief and in ending human somnambulance; it is about how we disempower the disinformationalists. And it is a warning, for those in power will go to any lengths to maintain their hypnotic grip on humanity. </p><h2>Why Governments Fear Bitcoin</h2><p>So, the first question we must examine is this: Why are governments seemingly so afraid of Bitcoin? Interestingly, it’s not simply because Bitcoin has the potential to end governments’ monopoly on money (which is admittedly a pretty big deal in and of itself). No. The underlying reason actually indicates something far more fundamental: Governments are afraid of Bitcoin as a construct because governments can only govern through deceit and dishonesty. </p><p>You see, the most powerful and successful governments throughout history have been (and remain) the ones that are the most adroit and accomplished at lying. The United States government, that bastion of supposed democratic righteousness, is in fact a compelling example of this principle. From Vietnam to Iraq, Joseph McCarthy to Lyndon Johnson to Jerome Powell and beyond, U.S. history is replete with examples of the power of lies, and of the malleability of the minds of well-intentioned, patriotic, innocent, hopeful, lost citizens.</p><h2>Bitcoin Outs The Lies</h2><p>Back to Trump for a moment. This from the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37673797">BBC</a>: </p><p>“Mr. Trump has questioned the legitimacy of the election process in a series of tweets, the latest of which said on Monday: ‘Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day… Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!’ “ </p><p>The above quote is <em>not</em> from the fall of 2020. This is from 2016, when then-candidate Trump was facing then-candidate Hilary Clinton in the general election. Lest we forget, Trump has been making claims of rigged elections for years. A masterful and, in fact, quite sophisticated practitioner in the art of exploiting human neurological frailty, Trump brilliantly leveraged (and <em>continues</em> to leverage) his skills as a purveyor of disinformation. Indeed, tens of millions of Americans <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/40-americans-think-2020-election-stolen-days-before-midterms-1756218">continue to believe</a> that Trump’s claims of election fraud in 2020 are correct, and that the presidency was stolen from him and from his followers. </p><p>I find this entirely fascinating and frightening at the same time.</p><p>The point is not whether Trump’s claims are accurate. And, if I am being honest, I must admit to having no way of knowing whether or not Trump’s claims are true. (The fact is, if I reject his claims, I may simply be choosing to believe the narrative that has been proffered by the other side. Both sides adhere tenaciously to their data. Both sides dwell in echo chambers that reinforce their narratives. Both sides suffer from the anti-intellectual effects caused by the frailties of human neuroplasticity. And both sides are composed of millions of follower-humans, unaware of the power that the leader-humans wield through their manipulations, through their theater, through their deceits.) </p><p>The point here is that, without the capacity to verify Trump’s claims, we are all potential prey; without the ability to know beyond any doubt what really happened in the last election cycle, there is no way to trust the election results — indeed, there is no way to trust our political process at all. </p><h2>Bitcoin And Neuroplasticity</h2><p>Neuroscience 101: Hear something enough and you will believe it to be true. Get on your knees and pray to God every day for an hour, and within months, perhaps weeks, even dyed-in-the-wool atheists will believe in God. Read only articles on Breitbart and The Gateway Pundit, listen only to podcasts by Tucker Carlson and Glenn Beck, and you will, beyond any doubt in your mind, believe the election was stolen. Read only articles on Mother Jones and HuffPost and Slate Magazine, and you will believe beyond any doubt in your mind that the election was valid. Listen only to YouTube channels broadcasting the views of Michael Saylor, Balaji Srinivasan, Mark Moss and Jeff Booth and you will believe that bitcoin to $1 million dollars is inevitable, that hyperinflation is coming and that the banks are all going to collapse. Listen only to YouTube channels touting the views of Warren Buffet and Peter Schiff and you will believe Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme and a scam. </p><p>Humans are sheep because we are wired to be sheep. We believe that we are critical thinkers and great discerners of truth, but we are all of us just ingesting and internalizing the narratives that we hear, over and over and over again.</p><p>Without verification, we are all potential victims to the lies told by those in power. </p><p>Again, enter Bitcoin.</p><p>As I posited in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/as-trust-erodes-bitcoin-is-verifiable">my previous article</a>, we need to have some imagination. We need to have the willingness to see that, in time, the Bitcoin network could act as the foundational layer to all digital interactions. And in time, there is every possibility that such a network could have the capacity to verify beyond any possible doubt each transaction, each interaction, each news story, each claim by the government, each tweet, etc. </p><p>But here’s the thing: We actually do <em>not</em> need to have much imagination at all to recognize that elections and blockchain technology are present tense, not future tense, considerations.</p><p>Imagine a system in which every ballot is imprinted with a digital private key/signature. All voting records live on an immutable ledger. While this will not disempower those who employ lies and disinformation as a way to manipulate the neurologically susceptible, it will move us in a direction in which claims of voter fraud, like those touted by Trump, have no teeth. And perhaps in time, as Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network proliferates, more such forms of verification have the potential to undercut the liars’ superpower.</p><p>I recognize that at <em>this</em> moment, Bitcoin is feared more for its ability to circumvent monetary control than it is for its inherently truthful nature. U.S. leaders are frightened at the prospect of the dollar losing its status as the world’s reserve currency, and as such, they will do pretty much anything to question and undermine the legitimacy and accessibility of anything that furthers such a possibility. (For example, right now we hear far more about the evils of China and of RNB ascendancy than we do about Bitcoin.) </p><p>But <em>can you see, in a possible future in which lying becomes increasingly difficult, why our leaders might fear Bitcoin so very much? And can you see why our leaders will do anything to stop the ascendency of truth and verification? </em>I have little doubt that, as the Bitcoin network becomes increasingly capable of vetting any and all forms of data, of verifying any and all forms and claims upon truth, that leaders the world over will do everything — <em>everything!</em> — in their power to destroy this network — because without the ability to lie, to manipulate we the sheep, all governments, all centralized power brokers, must by their very nature fail.</p><p>In time, Bitcoin can become so much more than a monetary network. It can become so much more than a store of monetary value. It can become so much more than property. In time, The Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin network can become the very thing that those in power fear most: <em>the truth</em>. </p><p>Where there is truth, the sheep awaken.</p><h2>The Trumps Of The World Must Be Held To Account</h2><p>As I said at the beginning of this piece, this is not a political screed. Politicians lie, regardless of ideology. Leaders on the left are just as apt, just as skilled, at employing disinformation and dishonesty as are those on the right. The point is, without the ability to objectively verify the truth, humans will continue to hurl their mindless selves into the fray, believing to their core the lies proffered by those who benefit from such duplicity. </p><p>I know that many of you reading this will see my views about the evolution of the Bitcoin network as the stuff of fantasy. I ask you though: Throughout human history, hasn’t every advancement at once been thought of as fantastic? Bitcoin is only just beginning. Once our leaders come to realize that, in the not-so-distant future, the Bitcoin network and protocol could morph into a global and inviolable lie detector, they will go to any length to kill it. For they are only as powerful as are the believability of the lies they tell.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dan Weintraub.

Larson shared his personal journey with digital assets, starting in 2016, and his realization of the need for accessible resources and education for individuals interested in Bitcoin. He joined the credit union in 2021 and focused on education and connecting people with resources related to cryptocurrency.</p><p>Meyer emphasized the importance of understanding the material need for Bitcoin services in their community and outlined a strategic four-step approach that prioritizes education and storage, then transactional ability and banking products. Meyer highlighted their focus on education as a way to change the narrative around Bitcoin and address the risks and concerns associated with it.</p><p>Regarding the bitcoin custody solution, Larson stated that they have been working on developing a product that is currently operational but not yet ready for launch to their 25,000 members. The credit union has been prioritizing education both internally and externally, ensuring that their employees and members understand the intricacies and risks of cryptocurrencies. They aim to be a reliable partner for their members, offering safe storage options and guidance without advising specific investments.</p><p>“From an educational perspective, we said, let's really start foundational from the ground floor,” Larson explained. “We're going to walk our members through this high level of education, in an effort to, one, help them become more informed, regardless if they own it today, plan to own it or not, we want our members to be well informed. And then two for those that choose to get into the space, hopefully, they make more informed decisions and understand the risks.” </p><p>The interview also touched on their collaborative approach with regulators to ensure responsible implementation of their Bitcoin services. Larson and Meyer believe that education and storage are areas where they can make a significant impact while working within regulatory frameworks. They have engaged with regulators and are in ongoing discussions to incorporate their feedback into the development of policies and procedures.</p><p>Speaking on the future impact that Bitcoin could have on the traditional finance realm, Meyer said that “If you do nothing, I think you're taking more risk as to where this industry is actually headed in the future, and how it will actually impact us to a significant degree. And if you don't want to be on the receiving end of how others have developed this, you should probably get involved now.” </p><p>Overall, St. Cloud Financial Credit Union's approach to Bitcoin reflects a commitment to educating their members and working collaboratively with regulators to navigate the evolving landscape of Bitcoin. While <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/self-custody">self-custody</a> is inherently the most safe method of storing bitcoin, in a world where education on Bitcoin is lacking credit unions can serve in an educational role. In addition, innovations like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fediment-evolution-of-bitcoin-custody">Fedimints</a> could help create custodial solutions that help retain the properties of Bitcoin that make it sovereign money, while still ensuring a level of distributed responsibility that makes those involved more comfortable.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMTczNDY5NTEyNTc0NjIy/bitcoin-blockchain.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Breaking Barriers: How Bitcoin Can Transform The Real Estate Industry]]></title><description><![CDATA[By eliminating middlemen and giving buyers a better form of money, Bitcoin can bring distinct advantages to the real estate industry.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-makes-real-estate-transactions-faster-more-secure</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-makes-real-estate-transactions-faster-more-secure</guid><category><![CDATA[Payments]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Real estate]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transactions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Collateral]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jenna Hall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5MTk5ODkzNTczNjc0Nzc2/20220501_btcfinal_best-jimmy-song---property-rights-bitcoin-songsheet-custom-art_-v2.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jenna Hall, a content marketing specialist with residential real estate brokerage Redfin.</em></p><p>You may have heard about how you can use bitcoin to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/can-you-buy-a-house-with-bitcoin">buy a house</a>, rent an apartment or save your wealth in an inflation-resistant way to make a down payment.

However, Bitcoin has the potential to play a significant role in addressing traditional real estate fraud.</p><p>Bitcoin transactions are secured by cryptography, and once completed, are highly resistant to fraud. The cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin provide robust security measures against double spends, ensuring that transaction records on the blockchain remain tamper proof and protected. This added layer of security significantly reduces the risk of fraudulent alterations to payment or property records. And because all parties involved in a Bitcoin transaction — including a home buyer, seller, real estate agent and other relevant parties in a real estate transaction — would have access to the blockchain, they can collectively validate the property ownership and transaction details.</p><p>With Bitcoin, property ownership could also be verified through the world’s most robust blockchain, which can serve as a comprehensive and auditable record of ownership transfers. This feature could help establish a clear chain of title, allowing buyers to ensure the legitimacy of the property's ownership history before making a purchase. By eliminating ambiguity and providing verified ownership records, Bitcoin can prevent title fraud — a scam whereby criminals sell properties that they do not rightfully own.</p><h2>No More Middlemen </h2><p>Buying a home is complicated enough, and it can get even more complicated when you have to communicate with several parties to facilitate the transaction. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. Bitcoin is capable of facilitating secure digital real estate deals, which can eliminate the need for intermediaries like lawyers and bankers.</p><p>Traditionally, multiple parties handle listings, payment transactions and legal documentation, leading to complexity and additional costs. Bitcoin could theoretically take the place of the verification or payments services that these middlemen provide, streamlining the transaction experience. Buyers and sellers would benefit from reduced commissions and fees usually charged by lawyers and banks. Additionally, cutting out intermediaries accelerates the home buying or selling process, which provides a more cost-effective, efficient and competitive approach for both the buyer and seller.</p><h2>New Luxury Real Estate Investors</h2><p>Bitcoin has also opened up new opportunities in the luxury real estate market. High-end real estate properties, such as mansions, penthouses and vacation homes, are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petertaylor/2022/05/07/crypto-just-became-real-estates-hottest-new-thing-heres-what-the-bitcoin-revolution-means-for-buyers-sellers-and-developers/?sh=7cb7800f388b">increasingly</a> being listed for sale in bitcoin or other digital currencies. This provides an alternative payment option for high-net-worth individuals who may hold significant amounts of bitcoin and would like to use it to invest in real estate. Additionally, the use of bitcoin in luxury real estate can attract international buyers, as it offers a faster and more secure cross-border transaction option compared to <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/global/real-estate-practices-around-the-world">traditional</a> overseas buying methods.</p><p>Newly-minted bitcoin millionaires and billionaires are showing a love for real estate, flooding the luxury market and driving some of the most expensive transactions over the past several years. Among the most notable include Olaf Carlson-Wee, the first employee of Coinbase and the founder of Polychain Capital, who bought a mansion in Hollywood Hills for <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/crypto-kingpin-olaf-carlson-wee-200452491.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACeKjjkndDF4c9MSaQARRyAEYe2MkZLNQkzq-akn_nevrMIKiACqtddwDpELMZhsXALRhoIdyTIY10CVxQlK3YzMLZo9Zx5esne83bX6axZqnPghtijCqpIgbBJ98soeirOePTEQU_EUQStB8qHuadoogoQkFGDRVswWtLF6jDhs">$28.5 million</a> and Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, who bought a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-ceo-brian-armstrong-buys-los-angeles-home-for-133-million-11641249787">$133 million</a> estate in Bel Air, California. Armstrong’s massive purchase still ranks in the top five most-expensive single-family homes ever sold in the <a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/11203/CA/Los-Angeles/apartments-for-rent">Los Angeles</a> area.</p><h2>A Better Payment Option</h2><p>One of the most intriguing developments in the real estate industry is the ability to purchase homes using bitcoin. While many Bitcoin users prefer to hold onto their BTC as a long-term investment, others choose to realize the distinct advantages that Bitcoin payments offer over fiat ones.</p><p>In fact, a <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/real-estate/2023/04/20/500k-or-175-bitcoin-texas-startup-lets-people-buy-real-estate-with-cryptocurrency/">Texas startup</a> recently made headlines by allowing Texans to buy homes with bitcoin. Buyers can choose to pay in dollars or their bitcoin equivalent for a property, highlighting the growing acceptance of bitcoin as a legitimate form of payment in the real estate market.</p><h2>Unique Collateral Opportunities</h2><p>Bitcoin could also be used as a new form of collateral in real estate transactions. According to the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions">IRS</a>, bitcoin holdings are considered property. At many banks, borrowers can use their holdings as collateral to secure loans for property investments, providing an alternative financing option for real estate purchases or developments. </p><p>This can be particularly useful for investors who hold significant amounts of bitcoin, but don’t want to sell their holdings to finance a real estate transaction. Lenders, on the other hand, can benefit from a wider addressable market when accepting cryptocurrency as collateral.</p><h2>The Evolving Landscape</h2><p>So, what does the future look like?</p><p>As Bitcoin continues to draw attention, regulatory frameworks are likely to evolve. Governments and regulatory bodies around the world are grappling with the implications of Bitcoin in real estate, including issues related to property rights, taxation and anti-money laundering regulations. The future could see increased regulation and standardization, which could provide more stability and confidence to buyers, sellers and investors.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jenna Hall.

Additionally, the study indicated a strong intention among non-owners to enter the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>Speaking about the application, Gemini leadership expressed their vision of providing a safe, secure, and user-friendly platform for customers in the UAE and beyond. The company stated that it is eager to serve the rapidly growing and vibrant crypto community in the region. </p><p>In January, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/gemini-alleges-dcg-genesis-defrauded-users">wrote a letter to its parent company</a> Digital Currency Group (DCG) alleging that DCG defrauded Gemini customers in relation to Gemini Earn.

The purchase agreement states that 6,000 of the machines will be shipped in June, with the remaining 6,500 set for shipping in August.</p><p>Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, expressed his confidence in the purchase, stating, "This purchase ensures that we are prepared to meet and potentially exceed our year-end target of 16 EH/s and also positions us to be one of the most power-efficient miners on an energy-per-hashrate basis." He further highlighted the optionality provided by the additional machines, allowing the company to replace less efficient units if the economics support it.</p><p>CleanSpark reported that it has been taking advantage of discounted machine purchases during the crypto bear market. In February, the company acquired <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-acquires-20000-bitcoin-miners">20,000 Antminer S19j Pro+ units,</a> followed by the purchase of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-to-nearly-double-bitcoin-mining-capacity">45,000 Antminer S19 XP units in April</a>. <br><br>Gary A. Vecchiarelli, CFO at CleanSpark, emphasized the importance of these purchases in preparation for the upcoming bitcoin halving, stating, "the efficiency of these machines also results in less power consumed per bitcoin mined compared to older generation miners, which should translate to higher margins."</p><p>CleanSpark's recent purchases of bitcoin mining machines demonstrate the company's commitment to expanding their mining capacity and staying competitive in the market. With fees from Ordinals inscriptions boosting the revenue for miners, it is expected that large players like CleanSpark will continue to bolster their miner inventory.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgwODA0OTg3MjcyODMyMDg4/mining-rigs.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Should A Bitcoin Wallet Have Rights?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Like corporate entities or intelligent robots, Bitcoin wallets are poised to gain legal rights of their own.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/why-bitcoin-wallets-should-have-legal-rights</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/why-bitcoin-wallets-should-have-legal-rights</guid><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Regulation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Wallets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Artem Afian]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Artem Afian, a lawyer and “legal futurist” at Hiveon, a crypto mining ecosystem that offers services for Bitcoin mining hardware.</em></p><p>I want to draw your attention to the fact that Bitcoin transactions <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-are-bitcoin-wallets">ultimately occur between wallets</a>. There are humans behind wallets, but this connection is not really what’s important. The pseudonymity of Bitcoin is thanks to the fact that there is no direct connection between the wallet and the person who owns it. It is what distinguishes a Bitcoin wallet from any other financial instrument. No matter how much regulators try to change this, the core of the technology remains the same. </p><p>What does this mean? It means that, soon, wallets will be recognized as entities deserving of legal rights.</p><p>First, humanity <a href="https://aldf.org/article/laws-that-protect-animals/">began to recognize animal rights</a>. Now, there is talk about <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robots-ai-legal-rights-3c47ef40">the legal rights of a robot</a>. Soon, the rights of a Bitcoin wallet will come to the fray. </p><p>When one talks about the rights of robots, they usually refer to some imitation of human will that is deserving of legal recognition. We understand that a robot does not have a soul in the same way that a human does, but at the same time, it performs rather complex actions, which gives rise to legal consequences. For many of us, a robot or a Bitcoin wallet is something inanimate and devoid of a soul and, perhaps, therefore undeserving of legal protections. But we recognize the rights of companies and corporations and, of course, it is difficult to imagine more soulless forms than those. It turns out that the subjects of law can be inanimate.</p><p>So, what is the difference between a Bitcoin wallet and a legal entity? A legal entity is simply a set of files in a specific registry. Lawyers even have a theory of the “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_fiction#:~:text=Legal%20fiction%20is%20an%20assumption,letter%20of%20the%20law%20unchanged.">fiction of a legal entity</a>.” We will calmly confirm that the legal entity is an American corporation. We can quickly check this. But how to check that a legal entity was created, say, under the laws of the country of Swaziland? Even if I show you documents that prove it, they are unlikely to tell you anything. So, if I tell you that you are dealing with a foreign company, you most probably just have to believe it. </p><p>Nevertheless, this legal entity, displayed as it is only on paper, has some rights. So, the Bitcoin wallet that exists is even more tangible than many legally-protected entities. Therefore, one more conclusion: Since legal entities have rights, then a wallet may have rights. Just like legal entities, wallets perform transactions, and just like legal entities, wallets can change their owners. This fact never changes: if robots or legal entities are deserving of legal rights, so too are Bitcoin wallets.</p><p>I think Bitcoin is an exciting new space and that we still have a lot to explore. Now, my idea that Bitcoin wallets will inevitably receive legal rights of their own may seem crazy, but many more discoveries await us.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Artem Afian.

This term came about as a catchall when some people incorrectly used or purposefully misused opcodes to create inscriptions that were not able to be indexed by ord and would therefore be unrecognized and not given an inscription number. </p><p>This issue was first mentioned on April 25 in the <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/issues/2045">ord github</a> and the interim fix proposed by then lead developer Casey Rodarmor was to, “Modify ord to recognize the above currently invalid inscriptions, including retroactively in old blocks, but consider these new inscriptions ‘cursed’ and assign them negative inscription numbers.”</p><p>Funnily enough, the example inscription code on the Ordinals docs website would have been a cursed inscription.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/cbspears/status/1663292796306874369"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/cbspears/status/1663292796306874369">Link to embedded Tweet.</a></em></p><p>There are many ways cursed inscriptions can be created. Any inscription with multiple inputs/outputs would be considered cursed. As shown above, certain misuse of opcodes such as OP_1 can lead to cursed inscriptions. Alternatively, the introduction of OP_66 using a value of “cursed” intentionally made these types of inscriptions by having an even numbered opcode which is not indexed by ord. Unless already defined in the spec, even numbered opcodes are not recognized because they are reserved for future protocol development.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/issues/2045">Issue #2045</a>&nbsp;lists some of the ways it's possible to create cursed inscriptions:</p><ul><li>Multiple inscriptions per transaction, for efficient batching.</li><li>Inscriptions on inputs after the first, which is useful for collections.</li><li>Multiple inscriptions on the same sat, so that the entire history of a sat doesn’t need to be checked to determine if a new inscription is valid.</li><li>Inscriptions with unrecognized even headers, so that new even headers don't cause upgraded clients to disagree about inscription numbers.</li></ul><p>There are a couple specific debates around cursed inscriptions. One of the disputes comes from the way that these inscriptions are currently numbered. Cursed inscriptions are numbered negatively in the order of their creation. Because of this numbering system and naming convention, some people purposefully chose to create inscriptions and collections that appear “cursed” whether by flipping the image of a positively numbered inscription or using a more sinister image theme when inscribing. The question is: Should these be appended to the index of positively numbered inscriptions or should they keep their negative inscription number when the code is updated?</p><p>Additionally, another contentious conversation is what to do about the certain type of cursed inscriptions that used the OP_66 opcode in their creation. Because this opcode is not recognized by ord and even numbered opcodes are intentionally left out for future development use, it is debatable whether inscriptions using this opcode should be included in the cursed set or if they should be rejected.</p><p>At the present time, the <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/pull/2109">issue around the even number opcode</a> is listed in the ord github. There are many comments in support of including these inscriptions in the index, but the lead maintainers of the protocol seem to be against it. As of now, the current stance by the developers is that these inscriptions would be unbound, meaning that they would not be assigned to a specific satoshi.</p><p>Remember, ordinal theory works based on a first in, first out tracking system for satoshis. Each inscription is assigned to the first satoshi in the genesis transaction when the inscription is created. This type of lens for looking at bitcoin allows images, files, text, etc. to be tracked and transferred. If a cursed inscription is unbound, it would not be associated with a specific satoshi and therefore would be unable to be transferred to another address. Many people who are inscribing are hoping to be able to sell or transfer their inscription to another person. While the inscriptions using this opcode will live forever on the Bitcoin blockchain, if these inscriptions are classified as unbound and unassigned to a specific satoshi, users who minted cursed inscriptions using this opcode would be unable to sell or transfer them.</p><p>Herein lies one of the bigger concerns for people who are spending money on transaction fees to create cursed inscriptions. If they are unable to sell them in the future, significant funds would have been wasted on fees. Many users have responded to the github issue, expressing support for including these inscriptions, but the code’s maintainers are not in favor of recognizing cursed inscriptions using the OP_66 even numbered opcode.</p><p>On May 30, the new lead maintainer of ord, Raphjaph, <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/pull/2109#issuecomment-1568125568">wrote</a>, “As the protocol currently stands inscriptions are not valid if they use an unrecognized even tag, so this change already makes a concession by recognizing them. For now they are unbound but we might reconsider this and bind them in the future if there are strong reasons.”</p><p>This response is not what many inscribers were hoping to hear. Similar to Bitcoin, ord is open-source software so users can fork the code if they wish to recognize these specific types of cursed inscriptions. This contentious debate is ongoing and the path forward for ord remains to be seen. Users who spent significant sums on transaction fees may be willing to switch to a new version of ord that will recognize their cursed inscriptions, but this is only a theoretical path forward at this time.</p><p>Regardless, Ordinals are a new technology being built on Bitcoin. Whether inscriptions are a flash in the pan or if they have lasting power may depend on how this issue gets resolved.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMzM1ODc0ODQyNTAyNTQ4/fiat-morals-angel-devil.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Liquidators Of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research Have Scavenged $110 Million Of Bitcoin After Losing Billions]]></title><description><![CDATA[Analysis by Arkham Intelligence indicates that Alameda's liquidators have managed to acquire slightly more than 4,000 bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-frieds-alameda-research-has-scavenged-110-million-of-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-frieds-alameda-research-has-scavenged-110-million-of-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[FTX]]></category><category><![CDATA[chainanalysis]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sam Bankman-Fried]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bankruptcy]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 18:51:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3NzEwNDE2/markets-trade-analysis-of-bitcoin-price.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Liquidators in charge of the recovery of assets for the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-fried-and-ftx-largest-crypto-fraud-history">now-disgraced Alameda Research</a> hedge fund founded by Sam Bankman-Fried currently control over $110 million worth of bitcoin held in various wallets, according to a report supplied by blockchain analysis firm <a href="https://www.arkhamintelligence.com/">Arkham Intelligence</a>.

    </figure><p>The article featured a sweeping <a href="https://www.tributemedia.com/blog/what-is-a-hero-banner">hero video banner</a>, which was also used as a still image for social media sharing, <a href="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/03/27/107205_1_bitcoin_wg_1080p.mp4">showing smog-filled aerial drone footage</a> over operations run by Bitdeer, a Bitcoin mining company that occupies a previously-abandoned aluminum smelting plant on the outskirts of Rockdale. However, evidence suggests that the footage may have either been <a href="https://youtu.be/oN-dFfRPEkg?t=95">manipulated</a> or lacks the necessary color grading that would have maintained photojournalistic integrity and adhered to ethical standards.</p><h2>Color Histograms And Image Manipulation</h2><p>Color histograms are <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/how-to-read-your-cameras-histogram">useful for analyzing the exposure and color balance of an image</a>. A color histogram is essentially a bar chart where the left side of the x-axis is black and the right side is white. The y-axis represents the number of pixels found in the image, for each part of the tonal scale between black and white. A properly exposed photograph, where the full spectrum of tonal blacks and whites are naturally found in a scene, will have <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/histograms-your-guide-to-proper-exposure/">pixels that span across the entire x-axis, from left to right</a>. When color data fails to span the entire x-axis, it can show that either those tones were entirely unavailable to the camera sensor, or that manipulation was performed to purposefully omit those colors.</p><p>In the side-by-side comparison below, the color histogram in <a href="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/03/27/107205_1_bitcoin_wg_1080p.mp4">the aerial footage published by the Times</a> (left) has no pixels approaching the black point. This is particularly strange for footage that has bright sun and stark shadows that are clearly visible as the camera moves over the scene. When color parameters are enhanced and corrected (as shown below in the version on the right), a brighter and more stunning scene emerges.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The hazy footage used by the Times may give readers a false impression that rural Texas air has been polluted by Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mines are fully electrified and, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle">electric vehicles</a>, the mining facilities photographed by The Times have <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotPlatforms/status/1645473961004892162">zero Scope 1 carbon emissions. In other words,</a> there are <a href="https://youtu.be/JKXeeiCa5Wg?t=1266">no direct greenhouse (GHG) emissions</a> that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by the operators of the mines. Any indirect <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-1-and-scope-2-inventory-guidance">Scope 2 emissions</a> associated from mining’s energy use comes from the grid’s normal emissions.</p><h2>Reply Hazy, Try Again</h2><p><br>The alleged manipulation appears to have been indirectly confirmed by Jordan Vonderhaar, the freelance photographer who took the aerial footage in question. Vonderhaar published <a href="https://archive.ph/QVUQ9">another photo from the same drone</a> flight on his <a href="https://www.jordanvonderhaar.com">personal website</a>, showing that the weather was perfectly clear within moments of the hazy photo published by the Times. This clear photo, from a different angle, indicates that the missing color data in the hazy photo was not due to weather conditions.</p><figure>

Normalizing the black and white points on Vonderhaar's portfolio image reveals vibrant colors and a sunny morning in Rockdale. Notice in the side-by-side comparison below that the Times intentionally cropped out some of the blue skies when it published this particular shot:</p><figure>

Yet, the golden hues from the morning sunlight and blue skies are completely missing from the hazy hero footage. That a perfectly gorgeous moment in Rockdale could suddenly become hazy, at all altitudes and distances only nine minutes later, is nearly impossible.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Responding to allegations of manipulation, Vonderhaar — who described miners as “<a href="https://twitter.com/jordan_vondy/status/1645446668635058176">massive polluters</a>” — <a href="https://twitter.com/jordan_vondy/status/1645455851006640130">publicly stated on Twitter</a> that, “Nothing about the footage was doctored. It’s humid most mornings in Texas and when the sun rises you get low level haze. This is very common.”</p><p>Leaving aside for a moment that Vonderhaar appears to be admitting that he was perhaps intentionally seeking out hazy weather for his photojournalistic spread, the nearest <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/automated-surface-weather-observing-systems">automated weather observation station</a>, located at Hearne Municipal Airport — <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Alcoa+Lake,+Texas/Hearne+Municipal+Airport,+Crennan+Ln,+Hearne,+Texas+77859,+United+States+Crennan+Ln,+Hearne,+TX+77859/@30.7454462,-97.0029044,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x8644565ac202de19:0x7acb102f329d74aa!2m2!1d-97.0565663!2d30.5768948!1m5!1m1!1s0x8645cfa9fc4816af:0x37f2f4dc3c4a3e63!2m2!1d-96.6193961!2d30.8697362">40 miles to the Northeast</a> and well out of view of the aerial photography — <a href="https://weatherspark.com/h/d/145983/2023/2/28/Historical-Weather-on-Tuesday-February-28-2023-at-Hearne-Municipal-Airport-Texas-United-States">reported low-level fog</a> at that same moment. </p><p>Indeed, Vonderhaar's clear and sunny photo shows low-level fog on the distant horizon, many miles beyond Alcoa Lake. “Low-level” fog is not a high-altitude phenomenon, and sure enough, Vonderhaar's photo shows blue skies in the upper atmosphere and golden hues that are conspicuously missing in his smoggy footage, taken a few minutes later.</p><h2>Problems Uncovered</h2><p><br><a href="http://twitter.com/roryhighside">Rory Highside</a> — a VFX artist who has <a href="https://youtu.be/MT9PA5EvMuo">expertise in CGI video effects</a> — was among the first to notice problems with the footage that the Times had used. Analyzing the video and color histograms, Highside suspected that either the color grading was mishandled or the color balance <a href="https://twitter.com/roryhighside/status/1645726015233351680">had been manipulated</a>. One of the most noticeable issues was that the “black point” was extended, which is indicative of footage <a href="https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/18821/how-to-best-methods-to-correct-washed-out-jpegs">that is washed out</a>. This was evidenced by the fact that, as colors approached black, there was a noticeable and unnatural gap between pitch black and the available color data where darker colors should be. Vonderhaar did not respond to these allegations on Twitter, and did not respond to questions about them by email.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Hazy Truth Of Photojournalism</h2><p>Determining truth in photojournalism is a murky endeavor. The raw footage captured by professional-grade digital cameras can be thought of as the digital version of undeveloped film. Camera sensors capture raw data, which <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000241.shtml">retains maximum image information and flexibility</a> during post-processing, but requires processing and interpolation to produce an accurate final image. The photographer must adjust various parameters, such as contrast, white balance, exposure, and color saturation — meaning the photographer always has some artistic leeway in the final product. Color manipulations are trivial adjustments in post production. It only takes <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1646204720963371014">one slight adjustment</a> to wash out an image. Minor adjustments are very common, and typically not an issue. But, at the end of the process, photographers have to walk a fine line between ​​enhancing an image for visual impact and maintaining its authenticity.</p><h2>Unedited Raw Drone Footage Is Visibly Hazy</h2><p><br>There is perhaps an alternate explanation for why Vonderhaar’s video footage was so hazy and lacking in contrast, while his still photograph taken nine minutes earlier was sunny and cinematic. The FC220 camera on Vonderhaar’s DJI Mavic Pro drone is <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4978813437/how-to-shoot-log-video-using-dji-s-d-log-color-profile">capable of capturing video footage in a logarithmic (log) color profile</a>. Raw log footage is a flat and low-contrast format — not intended for publishing — that preserves a wide dynamic range of details, which allows for greater flexibility during post-processing. Much like how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)">negative film</a> has inverted colors that enable positive images to be developed, log video footage <a href="https://youtu.be/pI9vIUwqLO0">always appears hazy when its raw, unedited format isn’t properly color graded</a>. It would be the photojournalist’s responsibility, then, to accurately map to the colors they witnessed in real life.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4MzEzOTk0NTY0NDEyOTc0/color-grading.jpg" height="329" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>DJI drones can record in a logarithmic (log) color profile, </em><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4978813437/how-to-shoot-log-video-using-dji-s-d-log-color-profile"><em>which appears hazy if it isn’t color graded in post-processing</em></a><em>. Source: “</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccPJWVTdyA8"><em>Shooting In D-Log - DJI Mavic Pro</em>.”</a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>To convert log footage to an accurate color profile, a process called “<a href="https://youtu.be/o1m4LQu6BGQ">color grading” or “color correction” is typically performed</a>. This involves adjusting the image's color and tonal properties to achieve a more visually pleasing and accurate representation of the scene. <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4978813437/how-to-shoot-log-video-using-dji-s-d-log-color-profile">The proper conversion from log</a> involves mapping the tonal values in the log footage to their corresponding values, such as with lookup tables, or LUTS, to color grade the final footage.</p><p>Vonderhaar could very well have been telling the truth when he <a href="https://twitter.com/jordan_vondy/status/1645455851006640130">claimed</a> that “Nothing about the footage was doctored.” Indeed, publishing unedited log footage without proper color grading would quite literally result in a misleading smog effect, without having to do anything. Doing this deliberately, of course, would be unethical if it intentionally misleads viewers into seeing smog that did not exist.</p><p><a href="https://nppa.org/resources/code-ethics">Photojournalists have a duty</a> to maintain journalistic integrity and adhere to ethical standards to truthfully convey the events they witnessed. While there is no definitive "correct" color to any image, intentionally misleading readers by failing to color grade log footage is a breach of ethical standards. Photojournalists must depict the scene as faithfully as possible, avoiding anything that might distort reality. Publishing raw and uncorrected video footage, which actively removes colors from a scene and creates a misleading smog effect, is effectively a passive form of photographic manipulation. If not manipulation, then it is an egregious example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon’s razor</a>.</p><p>It should be noted that Vonderhaar’s lack of color grading may not be due to malice or even artistic bias. While a professional photographer <a href="http://jordanvonderhaar.com">who has expertise in color correcting raw still images</a> to JPEG may possess a solid foundation in color correction and a good understanding of color theory, it does not automatically mean they have the necessary skills to color grade log video footage. Color grading log video <a href="https://youtu.be/DBo3zsQq6mY">involves a different set of skills and considerations</a> compared to <a href="https://youtu.be/mPvJkhnB4xg">color correcting raw still images</a>. Expertise in video editing software and a specific understanding of the technical aspects of working with video formats — such as frame rates, codecs and color spaces — is a requirement to adeptly work with log footage. Managing temporal continuity and ensuring consistent color grading is critical to maintaining visual coherence. It’s entirely plausible that Vonderhaar was simply unable to color grade log video. But, whether it be malice or inability, the Times should issue a correction.</p><h2>The Signature Style Of The Times</h2><p><br>The Times has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/jz4ver/what_creates_a_new_york_timesstyle_photograph/">signature style for its photographs</a>, where it typically&nbsp;extends the white point to darken&nbsp;images when it wants to portray a somber or moody tone. However, an extended black point — resulting in washed out colors — is the direct opposite of this iconic style.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Ethics Of Photo Manipulation</h2><p>All photography requires some form of color correction. Minor stylistic choices aside, adjustments that actively mislead readers <a href="http://spj.org/ethicscode.asp">are unethical</a>. A <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/world-press-photo-manipulation-ethics-of-digital-photojournalism/">2015 article in the Times</a> about a World Press Photo research project, for instance, explained that photo editors cross an ethical line, which becomes explicit manipulation, when their processing obscures an image to create conditions that were not actually in the scene:</p><blockquote><p>“The only point at which processing becomes manipulation is when the toning is so great — usually by transforming significant parts of an image to opaque black or white — that it obscures substantial detail.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/world-press-photo-manipulation-ethics-of-digital-photojournalism/">Debating The Rules And Ethics Of Digital Photojournalism</a>,” The New York Times</p></blockquote><p>According to Highside, the extent of the manipulation and our ability to restore the full color potential will remain unknown unless Vonderhaar releases his original raw footage. The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) recommends in its <a href="http://spj.org/ethicscode.asp">code of ethics</a> that journalists need to be proactive about addressing concerns and allegations of improper conduct:</p><blockquote><p>“Ethical journalism means taking responsibility for one’s work and explaining one’s decisions to the public. Journalists should: Explain ethical choices and processes to audiences. Encourage a civil dialogue with the public about journalistic practices, coverage and news content. Respond quickly to questions about accuracy, clarity and fairness. Acknowledge mistakes and correct them promptly and prominently. Explain corrections and clarifications carefully and clearly. Expose unethical conduct in journalism, including within their organizations. Abide by the same high standards they expect of others.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="http://spj.org/ethicscode.asp">SPJ code of ethics</a></p></blockquote><p>Despite the missing color data, which can only be sourced from Vonderhaar’s unreleased raw footage, Highside was able to partially restore the washed out footage to demonstrate what the imaging could have looked like if a proper color grading had been applied. The results are striking when compared alongside the video that was published by the Times:</p><figure><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://content.jwplatform.com/players/J0dequ6B-6eHuiRBi.html" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>New York Times Color Profile Comparison (; 0:27) </figcaption></figure><p>Intentionally deciding not to color grade or fully correct log footage is a breach of ethical standards in photojournalism. However, if it was due to lack of ability, it can still be considered a breach of ethical standards, particularly if the Times fails to correct the misinformation or take appropriate action to rectify the situation. A <a href="https://nppa.org/resources/code-ethics">fundamental principle</a> of photojournalism is to provide an accurate and truthful representation of events. Misrepresenting the visual aspects of a scene goes against this principle and compromises the integrity of the profession. It undermines the credibility of photojournalists and the publication, it damages the reputation of the profession and erodes public trust in the media.</p><p>It should not go unnoticed that the actual substance of the Times article included <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/articles/the-absurdity-of-the-nyts-latest-bitcoin-hit-piece">significant misinformation</a>. Why the Times <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-the-new-york-times-attacks-bitcoin">is seemingly motivated</a> to deliberately portray Bitcoin mining in such a negative light is unclear. But it&nbsp;appears to fit <a href="https://www.thegrayladywinked.com">a long pattern of distortions and bias</a> from the newspaper, which has become more evident to readers in recent years. When the public is being misled by photojournalists into believing a small and rural Texas town has thick smog typically found in populated and polluted cities, it’s necessary and appropriate to question the paper’s ethical choices.</p><p>Vonderhaar could clear up suspicions over his work by releasing the original raw log footage. This would allow members of the public to <a href="https://youtu.be/fG95ikKV_AE">properly assess the color grading of the footage and reveal the true details that were present</a>. If indeed the log footage was intentionally left in a low contrast state, it would be an embarrassment for the Times. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Level39.
