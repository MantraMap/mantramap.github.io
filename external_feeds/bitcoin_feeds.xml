McHenry stated that if properly regulated, stablecoins &#8220;hold promise as a pillar of our 21st-century payments system,&#8221; calling on Congress to put clear rules on the sector by enacting stablecoin-specific regulation.</strong></p>
<h2>Representative McHenry States Stablecoins Might Become &#8216;Pillar&#8217; of Current Payment Systems</h2>
<p>U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry issued a statement on Monday, weighing in on the significance of the recent U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin launched by payments behemoth Paypal.</p>
<p>McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, viewed this development positively, stating that Paypal&#8217;s announcement was &#8220;a clear signal that stablecoins—if issued under a clear regulatory framework—hold promise as a pillar of our 21st-century payments system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paypal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the launch of an in-house managed stablecoin on Monday, dubbed &#8220;Paypal USD&#8221; (PYUSD). Paypal CEO Dan Schulman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the company&#8217;s vision was to integrate this stablecoin into its overall payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>McHenry also reinforced the need to bring clarity to the sector to grow the stablecoin industry in the country. He <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408945" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clear regulations and robust consumer protections are essential to enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential. That’s why it’s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Stablecoin Regulation Advances</h2>
<p>McHenry has been one of the supporters of bringing cryptocurrency and stablecoin-specific regulations to the U.S. In July, the House Financial Services Committee <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/4-crypto-bills-pass-us-house-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> four cryptocurrency bills. The Clarity for Stablecoins Act, a stablecoin-specific bill, was among these, having been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-house-financial-services-committee-passes-stablecoin-legislation-after-a-few-fireworks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> with bipartisan support.</p>
<p>McHenry also detailed that the Clarity for Stablecoins Act was built on top of the already existent crypto regimes that some states like New York have built, offering strong regulation to cryptocurrency companies.</p>
<p>Regulating digital assets and stablecoins is of significant importance for the U.S., McHenry detailed, declaring that the future of the leadership of the country in the digital asset industry was linked to the regulations. He concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation. Congress is making significant, bipartisan progress on legislation to ensure the U.S. leads the financial system of the future. We must finish the job.</p>

In a letter sent to the public auditor Satrunino Tewid, Rudimch reported the Palauan senate had concerns regarding the &#8220;constitutionality, security, accountability, statutory authority, and oversight of the program.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Palau&#8217;s Ripple-Backed Stablecoin Pilot Faces Senate Opposition</h2>
<p>Palau&#8217;s Ripple-backed stablecoin program, launched and announced in July, faces opposition from the Palauan senate. According to local reports, Senator Mark Rudimch, chairman of the Senate Resources, Commerce, Trade and Development Committee, has requested Public Auditor Satrunino Tewid audit the program, voicing various concerns regarding the ongoing test.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to Tewid, Rudimch <a href="https://twitter.com/JHX_1138/status/1688030747318276096?t=B0t2Voz08cJybHLd24fFaQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Senate has some concerns regarding the constitutionality, security, accountability, statutory authority, and oversight of the program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rudimch&#8217;s concerns point in two different directions. The first is related to the program&#8217;s legality, as he says the Ministry of Finance might not have the authority to run a program of this kind in Palau. &#8220;Is this a setup for an unconstitutional precedent?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The second aspect has to do with the use of government resources without following proper procedure. On this, Rudimch declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can this practice, if allowed under this discretionary &#8216;private partnering with government project,&#8217; be used on other experimental/ pilot programs for corporate profits such as this alternative payment system?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rudimch <a href="https://islandtimes.org/palau-launches-stable-coin-with-ripple-congress-seeks-audit-on-the-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that using Ripple&#8217;s research and development grant as collateral to secure 1:1 dollar stablecoin redemptions &#8220;supersedes or suspends existing laws and regulations&#8221; to fund the pilot program.</p>

<h2>Still a Small Program</h2>
<p>The Palau Stablecoin pilot program is currently ongoing on a small scale. The Ministry of Finance has only distributed a limited amount of PSC, Palau&#8217;s stablecoin, using the Ripple network for this purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is still a very small, secure, and controlled pilot to test the concept. Limited to 200 executive branch government employees only,&#8221; said Jay Hunter Anson, who leads Palau&#8217;s stablecoin project. Each one of the participants will get $100 to spend in qualified retailers in the country.</p>
<p>Palau&#8217;s president Surangel S. Whipps Jr. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripple-and-palau-announce-cbdc-stablecoin-pilot-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voiced</a> his support for the program last month, explaining that he hoped it could help Palau to &#8220;mobilize our economy and government processes to improve financial transactions and empower our citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pilot program will be evaluated for two months. After this period, the government will decide if it gets expanded.</p>

<h2>More Interest Rate Hikes Likely Needed, Says Fed Governor</h2>
<p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated in her remarks on Saturday at an event hosted by the Kansas Bankers Association in Colorado that the U.S. central bank may need to implement additional interest rate increases to completely restore price stability.</p>
<p>She also affirmed her endorsement of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-federal-funds-rate-by-25bps-amidst-moderate-economic-growth/">rate hike decision</a> made at last month&#8217;s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. In July, Fed officials raised the federal funds rate to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 22 years.</p>
<p>Governor Bowman stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Additional rate increases will likely be needed to get inflation on a path down to the FOMC’s 2% target.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The recent lower inflation reading was positive, but I will be looking for consistent evidence that inflation is on a meaningful path down toward our 2% goal as I consider further rate increases and how long the federal funds rate will need to remain at a restrictive level,” she detailed.</p>
<p>“I will also be watching for signs of slowing in consumer spending and signs that labor market conditions are loosening,” the Fed governor continued, noting that Fed policymakers will be monitoring incoming data and will be willing to raise interest rates in the future if inflation progress stalls.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on July 26 after the Fed announced its latest rate hike decision that prevailing economic conditions suggest that monetary policy will likely need to be restrictive for longer. “I would say that what our eyes are telling us is that policy has not been restrictive enough for long enough to have its full desired effects,” Powell stressed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>We intend to keep policy restrictive until we’re confident inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2% target, and we’re prepared to further tighten if that’s appropriate.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Do you think the Fed will raise interest rates again this year? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

He also revealed his stance on the expansion of the BRICS economic bloc ahead of the group&#8217;s upcoming summit. &#8220;I have said publicly, why does Brazil need the dollar to trade with China?&#8221; he stressed. &#8220;We can do it in our own currency.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>President of Brazil on De-Dollarization, BRICS Expansion</h2>
<p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva reiterated his call for the abandonment of the U.S. dollar in international trade during a press briefing with international journalists last week.</p>
<p>Lula has long been a vocal critic of the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance in international trade and has called on nations to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gofrom/most_popular/bolivias-president-calls-on-south-american-countries-to-ditch-us-dollar-bolster-alliances-with-china-and-brics">abandon the dollar</a> in favor of national currencies. He maintains that countries should opt for their respective currencies rather than relying on the USD. Regarding de-dollarization and using national currencies in trade settlements, the Brazilian president stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone knows that I defend the idea that we have our own currency to trade between countries. I have said publicly: why does Brazil need the dollar to trade with China? We can do it in our own currency. Why does Brazil need the dollar to trade with Argentina?</p></blockquote>
<p>The Brazilian leader also supports the idea of establishing a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-voices-support-for-brics-currency/">unified BRICS currency</a> that many expect to undermine the dominance of the U.S. dollar. However, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, said last month that the creation of anything alternative to the USD is &#8220;a medium to long-term ambition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lula additionally said: “I think the BRICS Bank needs to be more effective and more generous than the IMF [International Monetary Fund] — that is, the bank is there to help save countries and not to help sink countries, which the IMF often does.”</p>
<p>The Brazilian president also talked about BRICS expansion. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The bloc&#8217;s leaders&#8217; summit is scheduled for Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg. More than 40 countries have expressed interest in joining the BRICS group, with 22 nations having formally <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">applied for membership</a>. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-invites-69-leaders-to-august-summit-western-countries-omitted/">Sixty-nine countries</a> have been invited to the summit, including all African heads of state.</p>
<p>“We are going to discuss the entry of new countries” into BRICS, President Lula said. While there are reports that Brazil has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-faces-opposition-to-rapid-brics-expansion-from-india-and-brazil-report/">raised concerns</a> over the expansion of the economic bloc, Lula stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am of the opinion that as many countries want to enter, if they are in compliance with the rules we are establishing, we will accept the countries’ entrance.</p></blockquote>

According to the lawmakers, North Korea is using crypto &#8220;to evade harsh sanctions and support its ambitions to project geopolitical power through nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>US Lawmakers Concerned About &#8216;Serious National Security Threats’ Linked to North Korea, Crypto</h2>
<p>U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) have pressed the Biden administration for measures to counter crypto-related national security threats.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023.08.03%20Letter%20to%20Treasury%20and%20White%20House%20re%20North%20Korea%20crypto%20security%20threat.pdf">letter</a>, dated Aug. 3, to Brian E. Nelson, Treasury Department’s Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, and Jake Sullivan, the White House’s National Security Advisor, the lawmakers wrote: &#8220;We write to express concern about the national security threat posed by North Korea’s reliance on digital assets to circumvent international sanctions and embargoes and fund its illegal weapons programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter cites several sources detailing North Korea&#8217;s illicit use of crypto, including White House Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger who stated that about half of North Korea&#8217;s missile program has been funded by &#8220;cyberattacks and cryptocurrency theft.&#8221; The senators stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given the pressing nature of this threat, we ask the Administration to provide details on its plan to stop North Korea … from using digital assets to evade harsh sanctions and support its ambitions to project geopolitical power through nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.</p></blockquote>
<p>The lawmakers concluded their letter with five questions concerning the Treasury’s “plans to address the serious national security threats posed by North Korea’s dependence on cryptocurrency.” The senators requested the answers be delivered to them no later than Aug. 16.</p>
<p>A United Nations report revealed in February that North Korea <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/north-korea-stole-record-amount-of-crypto-assets-in-2022-un-report-unveils/">stole more crypto</a> assets in 2022 than in any other year. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis similarly found that <a class="sc-gYYNCg gOnnvV" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-seizes-cryptocurrency-worth-30-million-from-north-korean-hackers/">North Korea-linked hackers</a>, such as the members of the <a class="sc-gYYNCg gOnnvV" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/north-korean-lazarus-group-linked-to-new-cryptocurrency-hacking-scheme/">Lazarus Group</a>, were particularly active last year. They stole an estimated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hackers-stole-3-8-billion-from-crypto-firms-in-2022-says-chainalysis/">$1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency</a> across several hacks, according to the data firm.</p>

In this period, central banks added 55 tonnes of gold to their reserves after three months of net selling, with China purchasing the most gold (21 tonnes).</strong></p>
<h2>Central Banks Back to Purchasing Gold in June</h2>
<p>The world&#8217;s central banks reversed their three-month gold selling spree to make purchases during June. According to international financial statistics issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), net gold purchases during June reached 55 tonnes, with six central banks purchasing gold during this period.</p>
<p>One of the largest purchasers of gold was the Central Bank of Turkey, which also resumed purchases after having been a net seller during recent months due to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/turkey-suspend-some-gold-imports-after-earthquake-bloomberg-news-2023-02-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban</a> on gold imports after an earthquake in February. Nonetheless, the Central Bank of Turkey added 11 tonnes to its official reserves, which reached 440 tons by the end of June.</p>
<p>Krishan Gopaul, senior analyst for Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) at the World Gold Council, qualified Turkey&#8217;s activity as &#8220;<a href="https://www.gold.org/goldhub/gold-focus/2023/08/central-banks-return-net-buying-june#footnote-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pivotal</a>&#8221; for the global total, helping the trend in central bank demand to remain &#8220;steadfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six more banks also purchased gold, with only two selling during June, according to the statistics.</p>

<h2>China Continues Buying Spree</h2>
<p>The biggest gold buyer during June was China, with the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC) adding 21 tonnes to its reserves. Even when other banks turned sellers during the last three months, China kept buying gold, maintaining an eight-month buying <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-keeps-stockpiling-gold-adds-18-tons-in-march-to-reach-2068-tons-in-national-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spree</a>. China is the biggest gold buyer year-to-date, having added 103 tonnes during 2023.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Poland was also one of the largest gold purchasers in June, adding 14 tonnes to its reserves as part of a <a href="https://biznes.interia.pl/gospodarka/news-adam-glapinski-prezes-nbp-bede-namawiac-rpp-do-kolejnej-podw,nId,5823037" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government plan</a> that could lead the country to purchase up to 100 tonnes of gold. Poland has purchased gold in the last three months, adding 48 tonnes this year.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan, the Czech Republic, Qatar, and India also added to their gold reserves during June.</p>
<p>Only two countries sold significant amounts of the precious metal during June: Kazakhstan and Singapore. Kazakhstan sold 3 tonnes during the period, <a href="https://archive.li/7SiAZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signaling</a> that it might offload more in the rest of the year, as its central bank compromised to lower the share of gold in its reserves to an &#8220;optimal level&#8221; of 50% to 55%.</p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore also reduced its reserves by 1 tonne.</p>

The farm will be located in Paso Pe near Bitfarms&#8217; existing mining operations in Villarrica and is expected to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2024. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitfarms to Pioneer Hydro-Cooled Mining in Paraguay With New 50 MW Facility; Prepares for 2024 Bitcoin Halving</h2>
<p>The announcement comes just weeks after <a href="https://bitfarms.com">Bitfarms</a> (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TSX-BITF/">BITF</a>) secured 150 MW of hydropower contracts in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paraguay-to-become-top-bitcoin-mining-hub-in-latam-according-to-insight-group/">Paraguay.</a> According to Bitfarms CEO Geoff Morphy, the company chose Paraguay for expansion due to low building costs and fast construction timelines.</p>
<p>“Achieving high operating efficiencies while minimizing capex is an overarching goal in our global growth strategy heading into next year’s halving,” said Morphy. “Based on our experience in the jurisdiction, Paraguay affords both low building costs and fast time to completion.”</p>
<p>The new facility will consist of a 50 MW substation, a 30 MW air-cooled warehouse, and 20 MW of hydro-cooled mining containers from Microbt. Bitfarms will install 1,920 of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microbt-unveils-new-whatsminer-bitcoin-mining-rig-with-320-th-s-setting-new-standard-for-hashpower/">Microbt&#8217;s new M53S+</a> miners in the containers, which are specially designed for immersion cooling.</p>
<p>The miners and infrastructure are being purchased entirely with vendor credits, significantly reducing Bitfarms&#8217; cash outlay. According to Bitfarms Chief Mining Officer Ben Gagnon, the M53S+ miners will produce 675 PH/s at an efficiency of 28.5 W/TH, making them some of the most efficient miners in Bitfarms&#8217; fleet.</p>
<p>This marks Bitfarms&#8217; first foray into hydro-cooled mining, a technology that Gagnon says has the potential to be less expensive than traditional immersion cooling. The company believes <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-argentina-reaches-imf-agreement-bitfarms-to-open-new-mining-operations-in-paraguay/">rapid expansion</a> in Paraguay highlights Bitfarms&#8217; strategy of pursuing low-cost power sources to improve profitability, especially heading into the Bitcoin halving in 2024.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Volatility Low, Silver Faces Challenges: McGlone</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In a client communication dated August 2, 2023, the prominent Bloomberg Intelligence analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemcglone11/status/1686775853898739718?s=20">observed</a> that bitcoin&#x2019;s 180-day volatility, hovering near record lows around 46%, frequently heralds a favorable turn in price. However, he issued a cautionary note that the cryptocurrency&#x2019;s deviation from the Nasdaq 100 starting late in Q1 might signal more widespread frailty in risk assets, especially if stocks pull back amidst usual second-half market swings, continuing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-federal-funds-rate-by-25bps-amidst-moderate-economic-growth/">Fed tightening</a>, and receding fears of a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/poll-majority-of-americans-see-us-economy-in-decline/">recession</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> 180-day volatility is the lowest ever at about 46% at the start of August, which is typically bullish for prices.  My main concern is that divergent Bitcoin price weakness vs. equities since the end of 1Q may imply pressure on all risk assets. <a href="https://t.co/IJEd11tRjt">pic.twitter.com/IJEd11tRjt</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemcglone11/status/1686775853898739718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
McGlone envisions that as mainstream acceptance grows, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> will gradually reveal attributes more akin to gold or Treasuries. Yet in the immediate future, he anticipates its lagging returns relative to tech stocks could endure if the equity market falls victim to seasonal volatility following a remarkable <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-leaves-major-assets-in-the-dust-surges-80-in-the-first-half-of-2023-soars-to-12th-largest-global-asset/">first-half showing</a>. This could be exacerbated if the Federal Reserve persists with interest rate increases and the probability of a recession lessens after reaching a high point earlier this year, he explained.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Turning to precious metals, McGlone <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemcglone11/status/1687511150894751749?s=20">posited</a> that only a recession-driven surge in gold might propel silver past its stubborn $30 resistance level under current conditions. With gold finding stability near historical peaks around $2,000 an ounce and <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SILVER/">silver</a> oscillating between $23-$25, he asserts that the faltering economic indicators from China and the sharpest inversion in the U.S. yield curve in four decades lay the groundwork for silver to regress to its post-2008 average of approximately $20, instead of achieving fresh highs.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Highlighting a correlation of 0.80 between gold and silver prices since 1949, McGlone remarked that divergence is unusual and generally fleeting. In his estimation, only a marked gold upswing amidst escalating recession concerns seems poised to alter the present course of the white metal.&#13;</p>
<h2>McGlone: &#x2018;Bitcoin Is Riskier Now vs. the Dow&#x2019;</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Earlier, in March, McGlone had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-supercycle-may-be-happening-says-commodity-strategist-mike-mcglone/">projected</a> a potential bitcoin supercycle was in motion, as it overshadowed gold by nearly 10x in the year-to-date figures at that juncture. He anticipated that bitcoin&#x2019;s volatility would regain its footing and trend toward unprecedented levels, assuming historical patterns remained consistent.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
In an update on August 6, McGlone <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemcglone11/status/1688275154940342272?s=20">warned</a> bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) now looks riskier relative to stocks than in early 2021 when it first matched the Dow Jones Industrial Average. With crypto volatility triple the blue-chip index&#x2019;s, versus less than double in Q1 2021, McGlone sees little diversification incentive supporting bitcoin unless it can boost portfolio returns.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Moreover, the strategist sees the risk of a normal recession-driven stock retreat not priced into consensus forecasts. This could pressure bitcoin, given correlation is near a historical peak of around 0.3. McGlone believes the Dow 30,000 level, matched by bitcoin when it breached $30,000 in January 2021, may remain resistance for the cryptocurrency if equities decline.&#13;<br />

<h2>Crypto Community Has Yet to Verify Paypal’s Official Token Contract; Scam Tokens Proliferate</h2>
<p>On August 7, 2023, Paypal unveiled a new stablecoin, tethered to the value of the U.S. dollar. Both Paxos and Paypal have <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/manage-money/crypto/pyusd">disseminated information</a> about the stablecoin on their individual websites, although the token contract is conspicuously absent from these online portals.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Paxos has <a href="https://paxos.com/pyusd-transparency/">outlined</a> that the stablecoin&#8217;s inaugural attestation report is scheduled for publication in September 2023. Although no specific contract details are provided, it&#8217;s been disclosed that PYUSD will be an ERC20-based token, functioning on the Ethereum platform.</p>
<p>The absence of the PYUSD minting process at this juncture seems highly plausible. Some are <a href="https://twitter.com/y1tweets/status/1688570108837560320?s=20">speculating</a> that a specific contract, viewable on etherscan, could be the official one, but official confirmation remains pending.</p>
<p>This uncertainty has sparked a degree of confusion, as deceptive tokens branded “<a href="https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0xea30714c4a9207286ffd3de620dfababe86ea3df?utm_source=coingecko&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=searchresults">PYUSD</a> and Paypal Coin” have infiltrated dex markets like Uniswap. For example, an unauthorized and counterfeit token dubbed “<a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa1a1a809e1c166ed5d0e9ce54efc524b6f7f519e?a=0x36ce96ac6410d244e3c631a33c736cc8bf36a50b#tokenInfo">Paypal Coin</a>” has been drawing significant attention today, in the wake of the announcement.</p>
<p>A slew of these fraudulent Paypal tokens is circulating through dex protocols, likely swindling individuals out of their money. Several savvy members of the crypto community have alerted Paypal to this perplexing situation.</p>
<p>One individual <a href="https://twitter.com/rafdo/status/1688570999187324928?s=20">advised</a> Paypal on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), “You should list the ERC20 contract address for PYUSD on your landing page, this way we&#8217;re certain it&#8217;s the right token when trading outside of Paypal.” As of 12:00 p.m. (ET) on Monday, August 7, 2023, Paypal has yet to display PYUSD&#8217;s ERC20 token contract.</p>
<p>At 1:40 p.m. (ET), Paxos <a href="https://twitter.com/Paxos/status/1688606057197666304?s=20">shared the token contract</a> with the public via the social media platform X. Paxos shared both the <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8">official contract</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/paxosglobal/pyusd-contract">Github repository</a> as well. At the time of writing, there&#8217;s a max total supply of 26.9 million PYUSD according to etherscan stats.</p>

The global crypto market cap has been largely unchanged, with volatility mostly muted. Stellar also rose higher, avoiding a drop below a key support point. </strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>) rose by as much as 5% to start the week, despite the wider market mostly trading lower.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>/USD jumped to a peak of $242.29 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, following an earlier low of $219.27.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The move came after <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> briefly broke out of a support point at $220.00, with traders swooping in to buy the dip.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Another catalyst to the surge appears to be the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moving past a ceiling at 48.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, price strength is tracking at 49.48, which is marginally below the next point of resistance at 50.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the event this level is breached, there is a strong possibility that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> could move towards $260.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Additionally, stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>) was another token in the green on Monday, as it continued to move away from a floor of $0.1345.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low at $0.1380 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>/USD rallied to an intraday high of $0.1431 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This is the third straight session that stellar has traded higher, and comes despite a recent downward crossover of moving averages (MA).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As can be seen from the chart, the 10-day (red) MA moved below its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which is typically a bearish signal.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Even though momentum has shown signs of weakness, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a> bulls will likely continue to target exits at a ceiling of $0.1600.&#13;<br />
