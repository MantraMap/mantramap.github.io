<p>In its newest scare tactic, the SEC alleged Binance.US inflated its trading volumes through a practice known as &ldquo;wash trading.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly increased the regulatory pressure against Binance.US. Binance has become the subject of the US&rsquo;s efforts to eliminate crypto exchanges it deems to have acted improperly.</p>
SEC: Binance.US Engaged in &ldquo;Wash Trading&rdquo;
<p>US regulatory action this time comes as the SEC accused Binance&rsquo;s US arm, Binance.US, of inflating its trading volumes &ndash; a practice known as &ldquo;wash trading.&rdquo; The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) first reported the news and said some of the exchange&rsquo;s crypto trading was a &ldquo;mirage&rdquo;, according to SEC.</p>
<p>Most accusations levelled against the exchange and its CEO, Changpeng &lsquo;CZ&rsquo; Zhao, came after the SEC sued Binance, Binance.US, and CZ. In its claims against the exchange, the SEC alleged that trading volumes on Binance.US were inflated by a firm owned by Zhao.</p>
<p>The WSJ report says the securities agency alleges that Binance.US inflated trading volumes &ldquo;by using dozens of user accounts held by Sigma Chain, a Swiss trading company controlled by Zhao.&rdquo; The WSJ also cites an academic report and boldly claims that over 70% of trading volume on crypto exchanges is derived from wash trading.</p>
<p>Binance.US filed a lawsuit against the SEC for its claims of improper handling of customer funds and said the SEC were &ldquo;misleading: the public in its ongoing cases. The SEC accused Binance and CZ of commingling customer assets in a press release.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given that Changpeng Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms&rsquo; customers&rsquo; assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please, as we have alleged, these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;A spokesperson addressed the SEC&rsquo;s allegations of wash trading, saying they are &ldquo;entirely unfounded.&rdquo; The WSJ further reports the spokesperson said the claims are &ldquo;based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the facts and a misapplication of the relevant law.&rdquo;</p>
Binance.US Feels the Pressure
<p>The exchange naturally has felt the effects of the SEC&rsquo;s endless lawsuits and allegations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent reports indicated Binance&rsquo;s US affiliate laid off some of its staff following the agency&rsquo;s actions.</p>
Binance Seeks Dismissal of CFTC Complaint
<p>In a July 24 report, news agency Reuters said that Binance and its CEO are &ldquo;planning to seek dismissal of a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) complaint accusing the crypto exchange of violating the Commodity Exchange Act and certain related federal regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Binance has until July 27 to submit its response to the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint and will reportedly seek a dismissal. In March, the CFTC revealed it was suing Binance and its CEO, accusing the exchange of trading on its own platform and CZ of indulging in insider trading.</p>
