<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/european-market-q1-2023/">European Market Shakes Off Recession Fears but Misses Q1 2023 Growth Estimates</a></p>
<p>The European economy displayed market resilience during the first quarter despite being cut off from the Russian oil and gas supply since the invasion of Ukraine. The EU market was, however, marred by rising inflation amid bank deposits flight similar to the United States banking crisis. Nonetheless, the European Central Bank has continued to raise interest rates, with the recent update pushing by 50 basis points, to fight the high core inflation.</p>
<p>Notably, some ECB policymakers are working on further raising interest rates next week by about 25 basis points, which could push the core interest rate above 3 percent. The Euro Zone is currently fighting inflation of 6.9 percent and core inflation of about 5.7 percent.</p>
<h2>European Market Economic Outlook</h2>
<p>During the first quarter, the Euro Zone economy grew by 0.1 percent, according to preliminary figures released on Friday. The EU bloc missed analysts’ forecast on first quarter growth, which was expected at 0.2 percent, according to a poll conducted by Reuters. Nonetheless, the European economy expanded by approximately 1.3 percent on an annualized basis but still missed analysts&#8217; expectations of 1.4 percent.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2023/04/PE23_169_811.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">destatis</a>, the European market recorded a gross domestic product (GDP) of  0.0 percent in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, data from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) showed that the final consumption expenditure of both households and the government declined at the beginning of 2023 in the Eurozone. Reportedly, positive contributions came from capital formation and exports in the European market during the first quarter.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, data from Eurostat showed a revision downward in the fourth-quarter 2022 GDP estimate for the eurozone from 0.1 percent quarterly growth to no growth, following a 0.4 percent growth during the third quarter of last year.</p>
<p>The European market was able to evade a much-feared recession during the first quarter of 2023. According to Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at Dutch bank ING, the fall in wholesale energy prices, warmer-than-expected weather, and fiscal stimulus helped the European market dodge a widely-feared recession over the winter.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Brzeski indicated that the data from individual countries will be crucial for the bloc&#8217;s future growth prospects. Moreover, the ongoing race between positive momentum in European countries and wage growth on the other hand has pushed the ECB to further monetary tightening policies.</p>
<p>As a result, the European Union regulators could be looking at diversifying leading economies like Germany, and France amid the looming United States feared recession in the second half of 2023.</p>

<p>Analysts at H.C. Wainwright have said that the crypto winter of 2022 ceases to have any bearing on related stocks. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/h-c-wainwright-crypto-winter/">Investment Bank H.C. Wainwright Believes Crypto Winter Is Over, Rates Coinbase Stock as ‘Buy’ </a></p>
<p>H.C. Wainwright believes that the crypto winter is over and has called for a buy on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> (NASDAQ: COIN) stock. According to the New York-based investment bank, Coinbase stands to benefit from global digital asset economy growth sooner rather than later. H.C. Wainwright released a <a href="https://hcwco.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=2b411f55-2386-4e7f-8f86-4cf9037b824d&amp;mime=pdf&amp;co=Hcwco&amp;id=jayson.derrick@investoogroup.com&amp;source=mail" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement</a> on Wednesday that underscored its bullishness on the prices of crypto assets.</p>
<p>The investment banking platform wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Crypto asset prices have rallied 45% YTD, supported by a 67% increase in BTC prices, indicating to us that crypto winter is over and that we have likely now entered BTC’s next bull price cycle (not baked into current estimates), which has historically resulted in significant growth in total crypto market cap, incremental retail, and institutional adoption, and higher crypto trading volumes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Summing up these key metrics as a driver of Coinbase’s operating results, including transaction revenues, H.C. Wainwright also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[As a leading exchange in the US and the world], we believe Coinbase is uniquely positioned to benefit from the large and rapidly growing global crypto economy given its trusted brand, easy-to-use products, and focus on compliance and regulation, and we expect the company to gain market share in 2023.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the bank, Coinbase’s revenues would become more “durable” over time due to its increasingly alternate revenue sources. Besides generating income from transaction-based fees, Coinbase has started leaning toward subscription and service revenues.</p>
<h2>H.C. Wainwright Analyst Identifies Coinbase as Only Exchange Valued at Over $10 Billion in Light of Crypto Winter</h2>
<p>H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese posted a ‘Buy’ rating for Coinbase, explaining that “rewards outweigh risks at these prices.” Furthermore, the analyst stated that COIN, currently trading at $54.17, is a “scarce asset” unlikely to change over the near term. Colonnese also pointed out that the major crypto exchange is the only US publicly-listed crypto company with a market cap exceeding $10 billion. As a result, the analyst concluded that competition for investor capital remains extremely limited.</p>
<p>Although the Nasdaq-listed COIN closed 3% lower on Wednesday and at 85% lower than its November 2021 peak, Wainwright analysts opine the stock is still an attractive prospect. These analysts say Coinbase’s share price levels offer investors an attractive entry point because the stock trades at a 35% discount to historical highs.</p>
<h2>Coinbase vs SEC</h2>
<p>In other recent Coinbase news, the exchange sued the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) over crypto regulatory guideline differences. In its lawsuit, the American exchange asked the court to require crypto clarity from the securities regulator. Coinbase called for the SEC to respond to its July 2022 petition promptly. In the previous petition, the exchange suggested that the Commission propose and adopt more explicit regulatory guidelines for the US crypto space via its formal rulemaking process. More than 1,700 individuals and entities have since submitted comments on Coinbase’s petition, also calling for more regulatory clarity from the SEC.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Coinbase <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-sec-wells-notice-securities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firmly responded</a> to a Wells Notice from the SEC last month, claiming no violation of securities laws. The exchange’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal accused the regulator of refusing to engage in meaningful dialogue regarding crypto regulations. Furthermore, Coinbase also suggested that the SEC had been intimidating several other exchanges over securities law violations. However, Coinbase expressed its intent to remain unshaken as it has not committed any wrongdoings.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Also, as part of the partnership, Google will bring the Blockchain Node Engine, which is Google&#8217;s fully managed node hosting service, to the Polygon ecosystem. This will help developers to focus on building the protocol while retaining complete control over the nodes deployed. Also, developers will have no longer to worry about configuring and running their Polygon PoS nodes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Google Cloud marketplace is offering developers a simple one-click deployment of the Polygon PoS node for powering their dApps quickly and easily. Commenting on the development, Ryan Wyatt, President, Polygon Labs <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/04/27/google-cloud-partners-with-polygon-labs-adding-yet-again-to-its-growing-roster-of-web3-firms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Google Cloud supporting all of the Polygon protocols is a step in the right direction to help onboard more people into Web3. Today&#8217;s announcement with Google Cloud aims to increase transaction throughput enabling use cases in gaming, supply chain management, and DeFi. This will pave the way for even more businesses to embrace blockchain technology through Polygon.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Google Is Making Its Way Into the Web3 World with Polygon</h2>
<p>Google, which has dominated the Web2 market for a long, is now making to make a move into the rapidly emerging Web3 world. Much recently, Google launched its “Google for Startups Cloud Program” which will support startups and emerging projects in the Web3 space to scale their projects faster and even more securely.</p>
<p>Also, the Celo Foundation announced earlier this month that it would work with Google Cloud to offer workshops and other cloud computing services to developers and other Web3 founders building on Celo. Also, the tech powerhouse noted that its partnership with Polygon would help the protocol to take further its zero-knowledge innovation strategy. This will help in making the transactions even faster and cheaper.</p>
<p>The statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Initial tests to run Polygon zkEVM’s zero-knowledge proofs on Google Cloud, for instance, resulted in significantly faster and cheaper transactions as compared to the existing setup.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s just last month that Polygon has released its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) beta to the public.</p>
<p>Mitesh Agarwal, managing director of customer engineering and Web3 go-to-market, Asia Pacific of Google Cloud, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Google Cloud is helping the industry achieve escape velocity by directing our engineering efforts toward areas like improving data availability and enhancing the resilience and performance of scaling protocols like zero-knowledge proofs”.</p></blockquote>

<p>Innovative Layer-1 blockchain Findora has introduced a Triple Masking SDK privacy-preserving solution for Web3. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/findora-dapp-triple-masking-sdk/">Findora Launches dApp Transaction Privacy-Focused Triple Masking SDK</a></p>
<p><a href="https://findora.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Findora</a> has launched a Web3-focused Triple Masking SDK for developers to easily integrate zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs into their decentralized applications (dApps). According to the programmable privacy-enabled public blockchain, the Findora Triple Masking ZK SDK also enhances user transactions. For instance, users can now transact privately while remaining auditable and have multiple options regarding masked or transparent information.</p>
<p>Describing the development as a Web3 universal privacy-preserving solution, Findora added that the Triple Masking SDK offers plug-and-play privacy for dApps.</p>
<h2>Findora Developer CEO Sums Up Value Proposition of Triple Masking SDK</h2>
<p>Sam Harrison, chief executive officer of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ico/findora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Findora</a> developer Discreet Labs, weighed in on the decentralized application facilitator, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Triple Masking fulfills a promise that blockchain technology made years ago: your financial status, your financial future, is no longer in the hands of some unknown, so-called &#8220;trusted&#8221; third party. It&#8217;s in your hands. This SDK simplifies the developer experience of implementing complicated ZK-proofs, which in turn enables more decentralized applications to offer the benefits of these ZK-proofs to their users.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Harrison also added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Users tend to have to make a choice between privacy and convenience. And when they do, they usually pick convenience. I am excited to see what choices developers can offer their users when privacy and convenience are both attainable.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Discreet Labs CEO explained that Triple Masking goes beyond simply encrypting information. According to him, Findora&#8217;s new offering can also trace assets in a regulatory and analytically compliant manner. As a result, Harrison pointed out that Triple Masking meets a professional institution&#8217;s privacy and compliance requirements.</p>
<h2>Zero-Knowledge Proofs &amp; SDK Applicability</h2>
<p>Financial institutions&#8217; requirements to safeguard privacy have been codified by regulation for decades. This also means consumers retain the right to keep their personal financial data from prying eyes. Although regulations emphasize financial customers&#8217; need to consent to private information-sharing, ZKs enhance the experience.</p>
<p>As cryptographic techniques, zero-knowledge proofs enable decentralized networks to hide transaction data while permitting the validation of the inherent information. Although this solution poses a computationally complex scenario, it also allows blockchain verification of a digital asset&#8217;s movement without requiring additional sensitive information. Such information includes details about the digital asset as well as its sender and receiver. Ultimately, ZK proofs lack the essential element that provides digital asset private transactions while ensuring minimal expenditure of said assets. It is this lapse that Findora&#8217;s Triple Masking initiative seeks to adequately address.</p>
<p>Supported on Findora&#8217;s network, the Triple Masking SDK offers full-privacy protection and anonymity for transactions instead of mere pseudonymity. With the SDK, developers are privy to ZK enablement and can access added transaction privacy at three levels. Although users can protect transactions from the rest of the public <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/crypto/blockchain-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a>, Findora said the SDK can trace assets. This means that while everybody else is oblivious to transactions, backend auditors can still monitor them.</p>
<p>Findora&#8217;s Triple Masking processes thousands of transactions significantly faster than the industry benchmark. Furthermore, the application&#8217;s compatibility with the secp256k1 curve enables better transaction signing by standard EVM wallets like MetaMask.</p>

<p>Pinecone creates vector databases that serve as long-term memory for AI models. These databases are a critical component of AI-powered applications. Since introducing its database in 2021, the firm has gained ground in the $110B Generative AI market.</p>
<p>In Q1 2023, the company saw increased adoption of its innovative technology across industries including consumer apps, e-commerce, fintech, insurance, media, and AI/ML. It also recorded an 8x growth in paid customers, including companies like Shopify, Gong, and Zapier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/a16z/">A16z</a> General Partner, Peter Levine, noted how critical Pinecone has become to maintaining the AI stack. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We&#8217;re thrilled to be partnering with Pinecone to support their vision of becoming the memory layer for AI applications.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How AI Startup Pinecone Is Revolutionizing Machine Learning</h2>
<p>While current Large Language models (LLM) have been known to give wrong responses factually based on the vector embeddings they search through, the vector database company seeks to change all that.</p>
<p>“We created Pinecone and the vector database category to let all AI developers easily work with a scalable and cost-efficient database for this workload,” said Edo Liberty, CEO of Pinecone. Consequently, Pinecone provides an external database where developers can store relevant data for their LLM apps. These data can then be drawn on to improve the quality of AI search results</p>
<p>The investment from a16z is a strong vote of confidence in Pinecone’s technology. With the new funds raised, Pinecone will expand its reach and offer its technology to a wider range of customers. The firm will also hope to build more products.</p>
<p>According to Bob Wiederhold, President of Pinecone, the startup  “will capitalize on hypergrowth to transform every line of business and even create new ones, from AI search to AI chatbots and AI agents”.</p>

<p>The CyberConnect CYBER token initial coin offering takes place on CoinList on May 18th, three days after the registration deadline.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cyberconnect-token-sale-coinlist/">CyberConnect Community Token Sale &#038; Registration on CoinList Announced</a></p>
<p>CoinList recently announced the registration and sale of its CyberConnect Community tokens would soon be underway. In a <a href="https://blog.coinlist.co/announcing-the-cyberconnect-token-sale-on-coinlist/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>, the digital currency exchange said the sale of the user-empowering decentralized social network&#8217;s tokens begins on May 18th. The deadline for registration would be three days earlier on May 15th.</p>
<p>Priced at $1.80 per token, the CYBER tokens have an initial supply of 3,000,000 tokens, with an additional 2,000,000 that can be unlocked during the sale period. However, CoinList pointed out that unlocking the additional token supply would be at the team&#8217;s discretion.</p>
<p>The CyberConnect team <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberConnectHQ/status/1651633556123262979" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">took to Twitter</a> to announce the public sale of its native utility &amp; governance token.</p>
<h2>CyberConnect</h2>
<p>CyberConnect described itself as the biggest platform for users and developers since its 2021 launch as Web3&#8217;s earliest decentralized social network. It has challenged the Web2 status quo since inception, by establishing a community-owned platform that offers users control over their digital affairs. This includes ultimate ownership over their digital identity, data content, connections, and monetization channels.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a link between these digital assets, the decentralized social graph protocol offers a smart contract wallet. The CyberConnect Wallet securely stores the digital assets of users and developers and facilitates easy Web3 onboarding of these assets. This functionality sees CyberConnect&#8217;s decentralized data storage operate as a hybrid model combining on and off-chain advantages.</p>
<p>According to reports, over 50 projects already deploy CyberConnect&#8217;s decentralized social network infrastructure for numerous use cases. These include community-owned social networks, content curation, marketplaces, and discovery tools.</p>
<p>As of April, the CyberConnect protocol has over 875,000 CyberProfiles and roughly 327,000 monthly active wallets. These self-sovereign on-chain identities have completed more than 7.3 million cumulative transactions across numerous blockchains and decentralized protocols.</p>
<p>Currently on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/matic-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a>, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/binance-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BNB</a> Chain, CyberConnect is designed to be multi-chain and scalable. The decentralized social graph protocol seeks to expand to other chains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</p>
<h2>Besides CyberConnect Development, CoinList Lists SUI</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinlist-list-sui/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In other news</a>, CoinList appears set to list Sui Blockchain native token SUI on May 3rd, coinciding with the Sui network mainnet launch. In a <a href="https://blog.coinlist.co/sui-network-sui-launching-soon-on-coinlist/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>, CoinList said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our mission at CoinList is to empower builders at any stage in their journey and connect them with high-quality early adopters of their products. Today, we are excited to announce that CoinList will be listing SUI, the native token of the highly anticipated Sui Blockchain, on Day 1 of its launch.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of the announcement two days ago, the token launchpad and trading platform also said that &#8220;as part of the SUI launch, CoinList will offer 48 hours of free trading on all SUI pairs on CoinList Pro and 1 month of fee-free staking to all eligible CoinList users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ranked among the most functional token listing platforms in the decentralized space, CoinList has facilitated the popularity of several innovative blockchain protocols. These include  <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/solana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solana</a> (SOL), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/filecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filecoin</a> (FIL), Casper (CSPR), and Mina.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/south-african-firm-bitcoin-fraud-us/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/south-african-firm-bitcoin-fraud-us/">Head of South African Firm Slapped with $3.4B Fine for Bitcoin Fraud in US</a></p>
<p>The head of a South African firm has been slapped with a massive fine of $3.4 billion by a federal judge in Texas. The US commodities regulator claimed that this was the largest-ever fraud case revolving around <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> ever to be committed by a company.</p>
<p>The head, who goes by the name Cornelius Johannes Steynberg, was asked to pay $1.7 billion as a civil penalty, a record for any Commodity Futures Trading Commission case, according to the regulator. Steynberg, whose last known place of residing was in South Africa, hasn&#8217;t been responsive to the media.</p>
<h2>Details of This Bitcoin Fraud</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a> had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-cftc-charges-south-african-company-with-record-17-bln-bitcoin-fraud-2022-06-30/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reprimanded</a> Steynberg in July, claiming that the Mirror Trading demanded Bitcoin online from thousands of people to allegedly manage a commodity pool. The company also promised to trade off-exchange, retail foreign currency with users who were not allowed to trade. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed charges against Mirror Trading International Proprietary Limited.</p>
<p>Steynberg, who had been a fugitive from South African Law enforcement, was detained in Brazil last year on an INTERPOL arrest warrant.</p>
<p>Over a span of almost three years from 2018 to 2021, Steynberg received and stole at least 29,421 bitcoins worth more than $1.7 billion from over 23000 participants from the United States. The people of Texas were the worst affected by the heist that happened almost two years ago.</p>
<p>The judgment against Steynberg was rolled out by Judge Lee Yeakel in the Western District of Texas.</p>
<p>The CFTC claimed that the firm had proprietary software that was expected to recognize significant trading gains for investors who contributed to the Bitcoin pool, but in reality, there was no such &#8220;bot&#8221; in use. In reality, only a small portion of the pooled Bitcoin was invested, and that too at a loss. The remaining was &#8220;misappropriated&#8221;, according to the CFTC. The firm ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2021, closely after which South African regulatory official began its fraud investigation.</p>
<p>MTI is presently undergoing liquidation in South Africa. The order states that MTI is &#8220;liable for fraud in connection with retail foreign currency (forex) transactions, fraud by an associated person of a commodity pool operator (CPO), registration violations, and failure to comply with CPO regulations&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition to the fine, Steynberg is permanently denied registering with the CFTC and trading in any markets regulated by them.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/intel-q1-2023/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/intel-q1-2023/">Intel Sees Largest Quarterly Loss in Q1 2023, Revenue Down 36% YoY</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/intel/">Intel Corporation</a> (NASDAQ: INTC) <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_b67ed4d8c17197972c955fd107959e3b/intel/db/887/8943/earnings_release/Q1+23_EarningsRelease+%28004%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> its largest quarterly loss in its Q1 2023 financial results. The company’s shares initially rose on the report, after which it fluctuated in extended trading sessions. At premarket trading, Intel is up 3.95% to $31.04 after closing up 2.79%. The semiconductor chip maker has recorded both gains and declines over the past year. It has shed more than 31% in the last twelve months and plunged 8.60% over the past month. The company&#8217;s stock is also down 1.45% in the last five days.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Intel has been increasing since the beginning of the year, advancing almost 13%. It also popped 6.04% in the last three months.</p>
<h2>Intel Releases Q1 2023 Results</h2>
<p>According to the report, the company experienced a 133% annual reduction in its earnings per share for the quarter. Intel noted that Q1 GAAP loss per share was $0.66, and the non-GAAP per share loss was $0.04. Meanwhile, analysts had predicted a 15 cents loss per share. In Q1, Intel plunged to a net loss of $2.8 billion or 66 cents from a net profit of $8.1 billion or $1.98 per share recorded in the previous year.</p>
<p>Following Q1, Intel has seen its second consecutive quarter of losses and the largest loss in its history. Also, it is the fifth straight quarter of lower sales for the company.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s quarterly revenue also dropped 36% YoY to $11.7 billion. Notably, revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was $18.4 billion. Despite the declines, the loss per share was a little better than Wall Street predictions.</p>
<p>As for CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel had a solid financial performance in Q1. He said the quarterly results show the company’s steady progress with its transformation. Gelsinger continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We hit key execution milestones in our data center roadmap and demonstrated the health of the process technology underpinning it. While we remain cautious on the macroeconomic outlook, we are focused on what we can control as we deliver on IDM 2.0: driving consistent execution across process and product roadmaps and advancing our foundry business to best position us to capitalize on the $1 trillion market opportunity ahead.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The chief financial officer David Zinsner stated that Intel exceeded Q1 expectations on the top and bottom lines. He mentioned that the semiconductor chip manufacturer is committed to remaining disciplined on expense management. It plans to continue to drive efficiencies and cost savings. He added that Intel is “prioritizing the investments needed to advance our strategy and establish an internal foundry model, one of the most consequential steps we are taking to deliver on IDM 2.0”.</p>
<p>In forecasting the current quarter, Intel expects revenue to fall between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hong-kong-monetary-banks-crypto/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hong-kong-monetary-banks-crypto/">Hong Kong Monetary Authority Advises Banks to Offer Support to Crypto Firms</a></p>
<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is truly doubling down on its efforts to provide full support to the digital currency ecosystem with its <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/international/hong-kong-seeks-help-crypto-firms-escape-their-exile-banking-sector" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recent circular</a> to banks operating on the island. In the circular, the HKMA said banks should support exchanges or crypto platforms that have received the right license to operate in the country.</p>
<p>The support will notably be extended to outfits with a “legitimate need for accounts” in what may help bootstrap the confidence among the firms the regulator is trying to woo back that Hong Kong is truly ready for business.</p>
<p>The digital currency ecosystem has experienced a whole lot of strain in recent years and a growing scrutiny from the HKMA initially sent most of the thriving crypto exchanges packing. Last year, the apex banking regulator renewed its interest to revive the island that was once a safe haven for crypto entities.</p>
<p>One of the first moves from the regulator is to remove the trading limit or clause that the minimum trading balance must be $1 million, a sum that is only accessible to institutional investors. Though the desire to permit retail trading is now existent, attracting the right businesses to offer the services remains a hurdle. This new advice to banks may help to change the narrative in the near future.</p>
<p>Banks are very necessary as a conduit for crypto exchanges and their customers to thrive. Amid the growing regulatory scrutiny being faced by these Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), many prominent banks stopped granting access to exchanges, a trend <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/south-korea-security-tokens-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compounded by tough regulations</a> that fueled the exit of some trading platforms from the South Korean market.</p>
<p>While the laws differ from one region to the other, the Travel Rule ethics amongst banks is uniform, thus accounting for why Hong Kong banks are averse to supporting crypto firms.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Banks with Commitment to Crypto</h2>
<p>The push to support crypto is already gaining traction in Hong Kong as some banks are pledging support to the industry. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-28/hong-kong-seeks-to-help-crypto-firms-escape-their-exile-from-the-banking-sector?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">According</a> to a Bloomberg report, the Hong Kong arms of Bank of Communications, Bank of China and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank are either already providing services to crypto entities in the region or are actively making inquiries to guide their support in the near future.</p>
<p>Additionally, neobanks like ZA Bank have revealed their intentions to support on and off-ramp products on licensed exchanges in the near term.</p>
<p>Notably, the gravity of the strain in the global financial ecosystem, as it relates to the crypto ecosystem, was felt in the United States following the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/silvergate-shut-down-liquidate-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collapse</a> of Signature Bank and Silvergate Banks. The risk of supporting digital currencies thus got notably enhanced and has largely set the industry back by a huge mile.</p>
<p>Riding on this, the HKMA has advised the banks it supervises not to discriminate and to provide a safe harbor for crypto firms irrespective of their nationalities.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-officials-talks-first-republic-bank/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p>The banking crisis unfolds further, with the US officials trying to coordinate with the private sector to reach an agreement on the future of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/first-republic-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Republic Bank</a> (NYSE: FRC) which is under scrutiny as a result of a loss of almost $72 billion in deposits within three months. Currently, representatives of the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/federal-reserve-system-frs-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a>, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Treasury Department are running urgent <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-officials-lead-urgent-rescue-talks-first-republic-sources-2023-04-28/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">talks</a> to rescue First Republic Bank.</p>
<h2>What Happened to First Republic Bank?</h2>
<p>The events at San Francisco-based First Republic Bank followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. In the period from December 31, 2022, to March 31, 2023, First Republic Bank lost almost $72 billion in deposits. Major deposit outflows were followed by a number of credit rating downgrades, which led to the bank&#8217;s share price dropping by nearly 90% of its value over March. Besides, during the first quarter of this year, First Republic Bank reported revenue of $1.2 billion, down 13.4% compared to last year. The company’s diluted earnings per share for the quarter came in at $1.23, down about 39% in contrast with the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Since January, the shares of First Republic Bank have lost as much as 95% of their value, a market loss of more than $21 billion. The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nyse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Stock Exchange</a> (NYSE) has even halted trading its stock a few times because of volatility.</p>
<p>There have been fears that First Republic Bank could have the same destiny as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Therefore, rapid action from the government is expected.</p>
<h2>US Government&#8217;s Response</h2>
<p>Wall Street banks have been trying to find a solution for the First Republic Bank. Now, the private sector and the government need to coordinate in rescuing the San Francisco-based lender. According to one of the sources, the participation of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Treasury Department is fostering the involvement of more parties in the negotiations.</p>
<p>First Republic Bank said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are engaged in discussions with multiple parties about our strategic options while continuing to serve our clients.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The possible way out could be either selling the bank&#8217;s assets or the creation of a so-called &#8220;bad bank&#8221; that would isolate the underwater assets of First Republic Bank.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another source noted that the bank&#8217;s executives are willing to find a solution that would avoid a takeover by the US regulators.</p>
<p>In case of a scenario where the First Republic Bank fails, the FDIC will likely want to avoid systemic risk and offer insurance to all the bank&#8217;s depositors, even those not covered by insurance. That will cost quite a lot and will be funded mostly by large banks that will bear tens of billions of dollars in losses.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/meta-shares-up-170-since-november/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
