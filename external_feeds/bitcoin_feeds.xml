However, U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty stressed that the biggest threat to the USD dominance comes from within.</strong></p>
<h2>China Wants to See U.S. Dollar Losing World’s Reserve Currency Status, Says Bernstein</h2>
<p>White House economist Jared Bernstein answered some congressional questions about the U.S. dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday during a hearing on his nomination to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p>Bernstein, a current member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, previously served as chief economist to then-Vice President Joe Biden in the Obama-Biden Administration before joining the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, where he served as a senior fellow from 2011 to 2021.</p>
<p>During the hearing, Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) noted efforts by several countries that threaten the status of the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency, such as Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-urges-developing-countries-to-abandon-dollar-as-global-reserve-currency/">calling</a> for an end to the dollar trade dominance. Emphasizing that China applauded this, the senator from Tennessee asked Bernstein: “Do you agree that China wants to see this happen?” The White House economist promptly replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think there&#8217;s some evidence that it does.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on why China wants to see the USD dominance reduced, Bernstein detailed: “I think there are extremely important privileges, and even in the realm of security reasons, to have — the benefits from having — the reserve currency.” He added: “One of the most obvious is, of course, sanctions. If you control the reserve currency, you&#8217;re able to impost sanctions as we&#8217;ve done on Russia to considerable effect.”</p>
<h2>Debt Ceiling and the &#8216;Biggest Threat&#8217; to USD</h2>
<p>Senator Hagerty proceeded to raise concerns about &#8220;the incredible debt&#8221; the U.S. government &#8220;has piled up,&#8221; and &#8220;the interest rate cost, which the CBO [Congressional Budget Office] has projected to actually be greater than our entire defense budget.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, Bernstein said: &#8220;One thing we could really do to help both the dollar maintain its reserve currency status, but also to protect the value of the dollar, would be to raise the debt ceiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the U.S. dollar potentially losing its reserve currency status, Hagerty stressed the importance of getting fiscal policies in order. &#8220;The fiscal spending is, I think, going to let the market dictate what happens to the dollar as a reserve currency, and if we continue to allow deficit spending to get out of control, I very, very seriously am concerned that we do it to ourselves. I know China would like to do it to us.” He concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>China would like to see us lose our status as a reserve currency but I think the biggest threat is from within by allowing our spending to get out of control. That&#8217;s the path that we&#8217;re on now. We need to see it back under control.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Discuss Key Bilateral Issues, Including BRICS Collaboration</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud of Saudi Arabia discussed several important bilateral issues during a phone call on Friday, Russian news outlet Tass reported, citing a statement released by the Kremlin press service after the call.</p>
<p>The statement details that Russia and Saudi Arabia are satisfied with the level of coordination in the OPEC+ framework, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The parties expressed satisfaction with the level of coordination at OPEC Plus aimed at ensuring the global oil market stability.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus (OPEC+) members, which include Saudi Arabia and Russia, recently agreed to cut crude oil output. OPEC+ is a group of 23 oil-exporting countries that meet regularly to decide how much crude oil to sell on the world market.</p>

<p>The Kremlin press service further explains that the discussion between the Russian president and the Saudi Crown Prince included a range of key topics on their bilateral agenda, with a particular emphasis on strengthening their mutually advantageous connections in areas such as trade, economic cooperation, investment, and energy. The statement adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prospects for cooperation between Saudi Arabia and BRICS were also considered.</p></blockquote>
<p>Saudi Arabia has expressed interest to join the BRICS bloc which comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The BRICS nations have been ramping up efforts to reduce their dependence on the U.S. dollar. They are also reportedly working to create a new type of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">currency</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the BRICS countries are focusing on expanding their international influence to counter Western countries&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-push-to-expand-global-influence-to-counter-the-wests-destructive-actions/">destructive actions</a>,&#8221; a Russian official recently said. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has expressed concerns that a rising number of countries, including China, Russia, and the Middle East, are aligning themselves and gaining global influence, which is a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/growing-links-between-middle-east-russia-china-pose-huge-challenge-for-us-warns-former-treasury-secretary/">challenge</a> for the U.S. Fitch Solutions&#8217; analyst said BRICS&#8217; de-dollarization, China, and cryptocurrency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-de-dollarization-push-china-and-crypto-threaten-us-dollars-dominance-analyst/">threaten</a> the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance.</p>

The bitcoin support follows the wallet&#x2019;s recent tether integration, which enables users to transact with the stablecoin as well.</strong></p>
<h2>Over a Billion Telegram Users Can Now Transfer Bitcoin in Chats</h2>
<p>On Friday, April 21, the @wallet bot on Telegram announced the addition of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> support to its web interface. The development team explained that previously, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization was only accessible in the text bot. &#x201C;Now, all @wallet users will be able to take full advantage of our web interface,&#x201D; the <a href="https://t.me/wallet_news_en/92">announcement</a> on Telegram details.</p>
<p>Telegram is extremely popular among cryptocurrency users, and according to a <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-telegram-users/">report</a> from April 2023, the messaging app has an estimated 1.068 billion users. Bitcoin.com News confirmed that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has been added, as our publication tested the @wallet bot on Telegram. In addition to bitcoin, the cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/toncoin">toncoin (TON)</a> and the stablecoin <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT/">tether (USDT)</a> are also available.</p>
<p>To purchase, sell, and deposit cryptocurrencies using the Wallet bot application on Telegram, a phone number is required for account verification. The Wallet bot team also explained that the exchange interface has been upgraded in the latest update. &#x201C;One of the most significant new features for the platform is the updated exchange interface,&#x201D; the @wallet announcement notes. &#x201C;With this new wallet exchange, you can now instantly swap <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, and TON at favorable rates.&#x201D;</p>

<p>While TON was the only crypto asset that could be transferred to other Telegram users in April 2022, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> can now be leveraged. So far, Telegram users can send three types of cryptocurrencies via the @wallet bot. According to statistics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/19/telegram-tops-700-million-users-launches-premium-tier/">cited</a> by Techcrunch, as of June 2022, Telegram had over 700 million monthly active users, which is 200 million more than the 500 million monthly active users <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/telegram-statistics/">recorded</a> in January 2021.</p>

The peer-to-peer platform, called Mattel Creations Virtual Collectibles, will coincide with the Hot Wheels NFT Garage Series 5, featuring some of Hot Wheels&#8217; most popular car designs.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Mattel Creations Virtual Collectibles Platform to Launch Peer-to-Peer Market Feature</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The toy manufacturer Mattel, Inc. (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/MAT:NASDAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MAT</a>) is continuing to expand into the non-fungible token (NFT) realm with the latest update to its <a href="https://creations.mattel.com">Mattel Creations Virtual Collectibles</a> platform. The addition is a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace powered by the NFT company <a href="https://rarible.com">Rarible</a>. Mattel collaborated with the wallet-as-a-service provider <a href="https://magic.link">Magic</a> and its blockchain partner <a href="https://flow.com">Flow</a>. The P2P marketplace launch will coincide with the launch of the Hot Wheels NFT Garage Series 5, a collection of digital collectibles designed by the same team that created the Hot Wheels die-cast cars.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-584362 size-full" title="Toy Manufacturer Mattel to Launch P2P Marketplace for Virtual Collectibles on NFT Platform" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nftgar6666.jpg" alt="Toy Manufacturer Mattel to Launch P2P Marketplace for Virtual Collectibles on NFT Platform" width="1280" height="600" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nftgar6666-300x141.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nftgar6666-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nftgar6666-768x360.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nftgar6666.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Series 5 includes 40 different cars, and the digital collectibles will be sold in packs for $25 each. If a collector gets a premium or &#8220;Treasure Hunt&#8221; digital collectible, which includes the Porsche 911 GT3 RS, &#8217;55 Chevy Panel, Aston Martin Vulcan, McLaren F1, and Pagani Huayra Roadster, they will be eligible to receive a physical die-cast replica of the same car. The popular toy manufacturer, founded in 1945 and headquartered in El Segundo, California, is among a slew of toy companies attempting to break into the NFT industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/funko-plans-to-launch-jay-and-silent-bob-nft-collection-via-the-digital-collectibles-platform-droppp/">Funko</a>, Disney, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/retail-giant-walmart-enters-the-metaverse-with-walmart-land-and-universe-of-play-on-roblox/">Walmart</a>, Hasbro, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nft-collection-veefriends-physical-collectibles-to-debut-at-macys-and-toysrus/">Toys R Us</a>, and others have released NFT products in the last three years. In October of last year, Mattel <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/toy-manufacturer-mattel-and-cryptoys-announce-masters-of-the-universe-nft-collection/">launched</a> an official Masters of the Universe digital toy collection to celebrate the franchise&#8217;s 40th anniversary. Mattel also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nft-collection-veefriends-physical-collectibles-to-debut-at-macys-and-toysrus/">collaborated</a> with the Veefriends NFT project and released a limited edition UNO deck featuring Veefriends NFT characters. Ron Friedman, vice president of Mattel Future Lab, explained that the new P2P marketplace feature expands on the toy company&#8217;s virtual collectibles platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">“When we first set out to launch our own Virtual Collectibles Platform, we did so with the intention of creating an unrivaled, best-in-class experience for the fans of Mattel&#8217;s iconic brands,” Friedman said in a statement on Thursday. “In adding a marketplace feature to our easy-to-navigate platform that enables users to sell and trade their virtual collectibles, we’ve taken another step toward realizing that vision.” When the marketplace feature launches on April 27, owners of Mattel NFTs will be able to &#8220;display, trade, and sell their assets&#8221; in a peer-to-peer fashion.</p>

In particular, David Rojas and Ashissh Raichura have earned a reputation as industry leaders in blockchain and cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Buterin and Ethereum have been at the forefront of driving innovation and adoption in the industry. Along with other established players like Bitcoin and newer projects like Solana and Polkadot, Buterin and Ethereum are among some of the blockchain leaders disrupting the industry and pushing the boundaries of what is possible with decentralized technology.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry is still growing rapidly. Many innovative projects and solutions are being developed within the industry, with ambitious leaders pushing the boundaries of what is possible with decentralized technology.</p>
<p>David Rojas, CEO of <a href="https://bluecastleventures.ca/">Blue Castle Ventures LTD, </a>is a unique player in the blockchain industry, offering a new approach to digital asset trading. Rojas, &#8220;We are the only company in the market where &#8216;virtual meets real.&#8217; We use Blockchain technology, and we have our own marketplace. Instead of trading cryptocurrencies, we trade digital goods with real collateral.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blue Castle Ventures LTD differs from other companies in the space by offering products and services that generate real value and revenue rather than relying on speculation and volume. Rojas asserts that Blue Castle Ventures LTD is &#8220;the antithesis of all that is wrong with the blockchain industry and crypto world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashissh Raichura is the Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.scanbo.com">Scanbo</a>. Ashissh underscores the numerous challenges we currently face, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, financial upheaval, armed conflicts, joblessness, and increasing debt. In response to these difficulties and to manage our health information, Raichura advises embracing <a href="https://www.dequity.technology/">Dequity</a>, a decentralized healthcare Layer 1 protocol specifically designed as a foundation for the healthcare sector. This protocol is grounded in the principles of being &#8220;by the people and for the people,&#8221; with the ultimate aim of establishing a universal basic income for everyone.</p>
<p>According to Raichura, TRUST is a major issue in the current landscape. <a href="https://www.dequity.technology/">Dequity</a> is in the process of creating a fully decentralized healthcare Layer 1 protocol, founded on the concept of being &#8220;by the people and for the people,&#8221; with the overarching objective of offering a universal basic income for everyone.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry is still young and untested. However, there is hope for the future of the industry because of the forward-thinking initiatives and ambitious leaders within it. The industry is continuing to evolve and mature, and we are excited to see more innovative solutions arise in the next couple of years.</p>

During the launch announcement, SG-Forge&#8217;s CEO stated that a stablecoin &#8220;built under a robust banking-grade structure&#8221; will be a key element to increase trust and confidence in the native cryptocurrency ecosystem.</strong></p>
<h2>SG-Forge Reveals Institutional-Grade Stablecoin EURCV</h2>
<p>A new euro-denominated stablecoin is coming to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, issued by SG-Forge, a digital currency-focused subsidiary of the French multinational investment bank and financial services company Societe Generale. While the cryptocurrency industry already has a few euro-backed stablecoins issued by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/circle-launches-second-major-stablecoin-backed-11-by-the-euro/">Circle Financial</a> and Tether, SG-Forge&#8217;s euro stablecoin, EURCV, aims to be an institutional-grade, fiat-pegged token. SG-Forge&#8217;s Thursday announcement notes that the approach involves creating measures in the realm of digital assets that aim to add security and transparency for institutional investors.</p>
<p>The efforts are in harmony with banking, legal, and regulatory requirements as part of the group&#8217;s overall strategy, according to SG-Forge&#8217;s announcement. “Digital assets with stabilisation mechanisms – i.e. stablecoins – built under a robust banking-grade structure will be a key element to increase trust and confidence in the native crypto ecosystem,” said SG-Forge CEO Jean-Marc Stenger in a <a href="https://www.sgforge.com/societe-generale-forge-launches-coinvertible-the-first-institutional-stablecoin-deployed-on-a-public-blockchain/">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Stenger added:</p>
<blockquote><p>This issuance is a major step in [SG-Forge’s] roadmap to deliver innovative solutions to its clients, either real-money institutions and corporates or entities of the crypto industry, and to facilitate the emergence of new market infrastructures based on blockchain technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xf7790914Dc335B20Aa19D7c9C9171e14e278A134">etherscan.io data</a>, there is a maximum total supply of 10,000,000 EURCV as of today, with only one holder, suggesting that SG-Forge has not yet distributed the stablecoin. So far, only two transfers have been made since its creation 14 days ago on April 7, 2023. The contract hosted on etherscan shows that the coin is an &#8220;official institutional euro stablecoin issued by Societe Generale-Forge.&#8221; Societe Generale&#8217;s euro stablecoin is being discussed on social media, and claims show that SG-Forge&#8217;s EURCV contract admin <a href="https://twitter.com/0xCygaar/status/1649108182957178882?s=20">can take funds</a> from an owner and <a href="https://twitter.com/0xCygaar/status/1649108184102207488?s=20">burn their EURCV</a> as well.</p>

<p>The Web3 security startup Gopluslabs&#8217; <a href="https://gopluslabs.io/token-security/1/0xf7790914Dc335B20Aa19D7c9C9171e14e278A134">contract analyzer</a> indicates that there is a “risky item” added to the smart contract and three more items that people should be aware of. The risk assessment says &#8220;the contract owner has the authority to modify the balance of tokens at other addresses, which may result in a loss of assets.&#8221; The contract also contains a &#8220;whitelist function,&#8221; which means &#8220;some addresses may not be able to trade normally,&#8221; according to Gopluslabs&#8217; contract analyzer. Software engineer Cygaar, who discovered some of the issues with SG-Forge&#8217;s EURCV contract, questioned why the bank decided to issue an ERC20 in the first place.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s the point of making this an ERC20? Cygaar <a href="https://twitter.com/0xCygaar/status/1649109235685548055?s=20">asked</a>. “They&#8217;d be much better off using Onyx (JPM&#8217;s internal system) or some internal [database] since they&#8217;re looking for a centralized settlement layer. An ERC20 token does not fit their use case,” the blockchain programmer added.</p>

The whale, who acquired 1,129 bitcoins in 2012 and 2013, has transferred 464 bitcoins worth $13 million for the first time in nine years.</strong></p>
<h2>464 Bitcoin Move From an Old 2012-2013 Stash</h2>
<p>The price of bitcoin has fallen below the $29K zone and is struggling to hold above the $28K region. On Wednesday, a mysterious bitcoin whale <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dormant-bitcoin-wallet-linked-to-mt-gox-saga-moves-60-million-for-the-first-time-since-2013/">transferred</a> 2,071.5 bitcoins worth $60 million at the time of the transaction. This large stash of coins is associated with the Mt Gox saga and a strange bitcoin address (<a href="https://oxt.me/address/1McUC8D7gqUtfWW1tSjnz3QGNf2eu4JAJR">1McUC</a>) that was linked to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/whale-spends-10000-btc-worth-203m-bitcoins-stem-from-infamous-2011-mt-gox-hack/">two significantly large</a> <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-5000-bitcoin-sourced-from-mt-gox-wake-up-after-close-to-9-years-of-dormancy/">transfers</a> last year.</p>
<p>At 8:19 a.m. Eastern Time on April 21, the Twitter account @lookonchain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1649387289745977344?s=20">tweeted</a> about a new whale that sent old bitcoins dating back to 2012 and 2013. &#x201C;The whale received [1,129 bitcoin] in October 2012 and May 2013, when prices were $12 and $195,&#x201D; the social media account said. In response to the tweet, one individual <a href="https://twitter.com/DefiChad/status/1649389364487569409?s=20">speculated</a> that it was &#x201C;[probably an] OG Silk Road vendor just released.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Following the transfer of 278.89 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> by the aforementioned address and the subsequent tweet by the social media account, the address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/12At4GGP8J5p4MtdjNy1SPSkqKEM1mw2FS">12At4</a>&#x201D; sent another 184.23 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. So far, the address that once held 1,129 bitcoin has sent a total of 464 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> worth $13 million at current bitcoin exchange rates. Bitcoin blockchain parsers have been detecting old whales moving dormant coins for years, but statistics from Btcparser.com show that older bitcoins born in 2009, 2010, and 2011 are becoming rare spends.</p>

<p>According to Btcparser.com and further research, a significant number of older Bitcoin transactions have come from 2016 and 2017 in the past few months. The last known transactions from 2009 <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/250-bitcoin-from-2009-moved-after-12-4-years-rare-btc-mined-over-a-2-day-span/">occurred</a> just over a year ago on April 7 and 8, 2022, when around five Bitcoin block rewards mined in 2009 were spent in a series of transfers. Prior to that, the last time a 2009 block reward was spent was on March 20, 2020, which was nine days after the infamous <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/edward-snowden-buying-bitcoin-market-bottom/">&#x201C;Black Thursday&#x201D; event</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the &#x201C;12At4&#x201D; bitcoin address <a href="https://blockchair.com/search?q=12At4GGP8J5p4MtdjNy1SPSkqKEM1mw2FS">still holds 665.65 BTC</a> and the owner&#x2019;s corresponding bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) address still holds approximately 1,128.77 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>.</p>

This is because these coins are often associated with fun and accessible ways to invest in cryptocurrency. Moreover, they are easy to understand and trade, making them attractive to new investors, particularly millenials and Gen Z, who are attracted to the humour and online culture associated with meme coins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most popular meme tokens today is Shiba Inu ($SHIB). Several factors contribute to the token&#x2019;s popularity, including the efforts of a passionate community referred to as the Shib Army. With the help of social media campaigns, memes, and other forms of online activism, this decentralised group of SHIB enthusiasts has promoted the coin and increased its value. At press time, $SHIB has a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">total market capitalization</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of $6.4 billion, making it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies on the market.</span></p>
<p><strong>$SOV&#x2019;s strong debut</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karma DAO introduced Shib Original Vision ($SOV) to break down Shiba Inu&#x2019;s current structure and return to a community-centric strategy. The Inu Economic Forum, with more than 50 members, makes decisions about $SOV rather than relying on a single individual like Ryoshi. Additionally, to ensure the project&#x2019;s long-term viability and efficacy, its developers have gotten the platform&#x2019;s smart contract framework </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MetatrustLabs/status/1648316251863941127"><span style="font-weight: 400;">audited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by popular blockchain security providers MetaTrust and Veridise Inc.</span></p>
<p><strong>The numbers don&#x2019;t lie: Shib Original Vision gains traction among users</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ShibSOV/status/1641861561022046219"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a little over a month ago, $SOV has consistently reached new price peaks seemingly every other week. To elaborate: the currency has appreciated considerably over the last 21-days, achieving a </span><a href="https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0x0318170609141bfdb38d20d1f1c5b5197670ecee"><span style="font-weight: 400;">total valuation of over $20 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a fully diluted valuation exceeding $40 million. During the first day of its release, $SOV recorded $12 million in volume and has since consistently ranked among the top three most-viewed Uniswap V3 pairs on GeckoTerminal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, a growing forum of prominent crypto personalities appears to be getting behind $SOV. For example, it recently came to light that prominent digital asset investor Roger Lim, with over $500 million in AUM, has been HODLing $SOV, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ShibaInuHodler/status/1646865749376483329"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently possessing over $155k</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worth of the token.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, as per </span><a href="https://twitter.com/0xbatalanto/status/1644638740348825600/photo/1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available online, former Microsoft strategist Joe McCann&#x2014;who helms Asymmetric, a $1B crypto fund backed by a16z&#x2019;s Marc Andreessen and Solana cofounders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokan&#x2014;has also invested heavily in $SOV. According to Etherscan, he currently owns 1,250,000,000,000 $SOV tokens estimated to be worth nearly $350,000.</span></p>
<p><strong>What lies ahead for Shib Original Vision?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the world continues to move in a more decentralized direction, the future of $SOV looks promising. For starters, the project comes with an experienced team of developers behind it&#x2014;the same folks who created $SHIB. They have a proven track record of successfully developing and launching projects, and their strong track record lends credibility and confidence to the project. They are now channelling their tech prowess into $SOV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, $SOV&#x2019;s low market cap and solid fundamentals make it an attractive investment opportunity for those willing to assume the risk, as evidenced by the several high-volume investors who have purchased the token. Lastly, the $SOV community is not only passionate and engaged, but also expanding, with many $SHIB supporters now joining the $SOV ecosystem. In fact, on April 15, the project was </span><a href="https://twitter.com/SatoshiOwl/status/1646893750164004865"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trending #3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the top <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> projects on Dextools. This growing support is crucial to consider when evaluating $SOV&#x2019;s market potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are undoubtedly some risks associated with investing in $SOV, the combination of a strong development team and dedicated community makes it worth a closer look. As the project continues to evolve and gain momentum, the future of $SOV may hold significant opportunities for those willing to navigate the uncertainty-ridden global economy.</span></p>

<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, was deep in the red on Friday, as prices fell for a third consecutive session.</p>
<p>Following a high of $0.4838 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.4644 earlier today.</p>
<p>As a result of this drop, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> fell to its lowest point since March 27, when the token was at a bottom at $0.4428.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this recent shift in momentum coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) breaking out of a floor at 57.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 42.24, which is close to a support point at 41.00.</p>
<p>Should price strength reach this point, then there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> will hit a price floor at $0.4440.</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>) also fell to a multi-week low in today&#x2019;s session, as prices moved closer to a key price floor.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD dropped to a low of $0.3974 on Friday, less than 24 hours after trading at a peak of $0.4087.</p>
<p>This is the lowest level that cardano has hit since April 12, and comes following a three-day losing streak.</p>

<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>&#x2019;s decline came after the RSI moved below a floor at 52.00. It is currently at a reading of 49.18.</p>
<p>The next visible point of support appears to be at 45.00, and should sellers claim this zone, cardano will likely move to $0.3750.</p>
<p>This level is a long-term price floor, and was last hit on April 6.</p>

The legislators also backed the introduction of mechanisms allowing the tracing of cryptocurrency transactions which will also apply to private crypto wallets above a certain threshold.</strong></p>
<h2>European Lawmakers Endorse Groundbreaking Crypto Assets Legislation</h2>
<p>Europe’s new common rules for the crypto space were given the final green light by the European Union’s legislature. The set, known as Markets in Crypto Assets (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-market-in-crypto-assets-6751039">MiCA</a>), was passed with 517 votes in favor, 38 against, and 18 abstentions, the EU Parliament’s press service announced Thursday.</p>
<p>The legislation, designed to regulate the supervision, consumer protection and environmental safeguards of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, was informally <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-makes-deal-on-mica-legislation-to-regulate-crypto-markets/">agreed</a> upon with the Council, EU’s decision-making body, in June 2022.</p>
<p>The law, arguably the world’s first comprehensive crypto regulatory package, will cover the issue and trade of assets not regulated by existing financial services laws. “Consumers would be better informed about the risks, costs and charges linked to their operations,” the Parliament insisted.</p>

<p>MiCA introduces licensing for crypto service providers operating in the bloc and provides for the establishment of a register for non-compliant companies, with the stated goal of countering risks of market manipulation, money laundering, and terrorist financing. It also aims to reduce the carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies, obliging larger service providers to disclose their energy consumption.</p>
<p>Commenting on the adoption of the legal framework, the rapporteur for the legislation, Stefan Berger, said that MiCA will protect consumers against fraud and allow the sector, hurt by negative events such as the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">collapse</a> of crypto exchange FTX and other players, to regain trust. He emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>This puts the EU at the forefront of the token economy with 10,000 different crypto assets &#8230; This regulation brings a competitive advantage for the EU.</p></blockquote>
<p>Berger pointed out that the crypto industry in the European Union will have regulatory clarity that does not exist in other jurisdictions like the United States. MiCA will enter into force once formally endorsed by the Council and 20 days after its publication in the EU Official Journal.</p>
<h2>European Parliament Approves Rules for Tracing Crypto Transfers</h2>
<p>In a separate vote, a majority of 529 members of the Parliament approved additional legislation authorizing the tracing of crypto transactions. It’s meant to ensure that transfers of cryptocurrencies can “always be traced” and blocked, if they are found to be suspicious.</p>
<p>The decision applies the so-called “travel rule,” from traditional finance, to transfers of crypto assets. It implies that information on the source of the asset and its beneficiary must “travel” with the transaction and be stored on both sides.</p>
<p>These provisions will also cover transactions from crypto addresses of private users, the so-called “self-hosted wallets,” if they exceed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-lawmakers-vote-to-impose-e1000-limit-on-unidentified-crypto-transactions/">€1,000</a> (approx. $1,100) in fiat equivalent and when they transact with “hosted” wallets managed by service providers.</p>
<p>However, the rules will not apply to direct person-to-person transfers, those without the involvement of a provider, or transfers carried out among providers as long as they act on their own behalf, the European Parliament noted in the announcement.</p>
