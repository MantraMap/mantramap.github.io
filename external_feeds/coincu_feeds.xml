					<description><![CDATA[Hong Kong's financial regulators held a meeting on Monday to bring together banks, crypto platforms, and other industry participants to focus on solving the problems encountered.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Hong Kong regulators are still trying to promote the relationship between banks and companies providing services related to virtual assets.</em></li>



<li><em>This is the 2nd meeting in less than two months of regulators with banks with ambitions of becoming the new crypto hub.</em></li>



<li><em>Cryptocurrency companies have found it challenging to achieve banking services due to strict customer and anti-money laundering rules and a crackdown by US regulators.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Bloomberg News, people familiar with the matter said Hong Kong&#8217;s financial regulators held a meeting on Monday to bring together banks, crypto platforms, and other industry participants to focus on solving the problems encountered.</strong></h5>

<p>This will be the second conference since the end of April to promote greater banking participation, highlighting the difficulties crypto companies face when accessing banking services. About 20 banks and a similar number of crypto-related firms attended the roundtable addressing banking needs at that time, according to the HKMA. Next week&#8217;s meeting will cater to those absent from the opening chat.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195322-hong-kong-urges-hsbc-standard-chartered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</a> (HKMA) spokesman said the central bank had, in fact, &#8220;maintained close dialogue with the banking industry and stakeholders on various topics from time to time.&#8221; Still, he declined to comment discussion of the scheduled meeting. A spokesperson for the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, the regulator of cryptocurrency exchanges, declined to comment.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency companies have needed help achieving banking services due to strict customer and anti-money laundering rules. The crypto industry is under global criticism from regulators, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission, putting pressure on lenders while remaining more cautious than usual. Banks must now tighten their censorship of crypto companies to avoid legal risks.</p>



<p>Hong Kong this month rolled out a new licensing regime for paying crypto exchanges, but banking access. The talent shortage and crisis affecting the industry are hampering the city&#8217;s ambitions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Uniswap Foundation recently released a cross-chain bridge assessment report detailing the results of their analysis of various protocols.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Uniswap Foundation releases cross-chain bridge assessment report.</em></li>



<li><em>Wormhole and Axelar approved for Uniswap&#8217;s protocol governance.</em></li>



<li><em>LayerZero, Celer, DeBridge, and Multichain do not meet the current standards.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Uniswap Foundation recently <a href="https://uniswap.notion.site/Bridge-Assessment-Report-0c8477afadce425abac9c0bd175ca382" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://uniswap.notion.site/Bridge-Assessment-Report-0c8477afadce425abac9c0bd175ca382" rel="noreferrer noopener">released </a>a cross-chain bridge assessment report detailing the results of their analysis of various protocols. The report outlined approved use cases for Wormhole and Axelar for Uniswap’s protocol governance, while LayerZero, Celer, DeBridge, and Multichain did not meet the standards at the assessment time.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1201.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="250" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1201.png" alt="Uniswap Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment: Wormhole &amp; Axelar Pass, LayerZero, Celer Fail" class="wp-image-195607" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1201.png 500w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1201-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1201-360x180.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" title="Uniswap Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment: Wormhole &amp; Axelar Pass, LayerZero, Celer Fail 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The analysis of Wormhole concluded that it satisfies the requirements of Uniswap DAO&#8217;s cross-chain governance use case with a set of reputable validators and satisfactory security thresholds. The implementation of the protocol and its operational practices were well-considered, with significant improvements made since the exploit incident in February 2022. However, there are still areas for improvement that the Committee recommends periodic monitoring for. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1202.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1202.png" alt="Uniswap Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment: Wormhole &amp; Axelar Pass, LayerZero, Celer Fail" class="wp-image-195608" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1202.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1202-300x100.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1202-768x256.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1202-750x250.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Uniswap Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment: Wormhole &amp; Axelar Pass, LayerZero, Celer Fail 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Axelar, on the other hand, conditionally satisfies the requirements with its sound crypto economic guarantees, well-considered protocol design, and sufficient validator set and thresholds, although a 4-of-8 multisig governing key aspects of the protocol is still a source of concern. The Committee recommends that the Uniswap DAO adopt Axelar, conditional on a successful transition from the multisig.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1203.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1203.png" alt="Uniswap Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment: Wormhole &amp; Axelar Pass, LayerZero, Celer Fail" class="wp-image-195609" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1203.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1203-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1203-768x384.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1203-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1203-750x375.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Uniswap Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment: Wormhole &amp; Axelar Pass, LayerZero, Celer Fail 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>LayerZero was evaluated as not satisfying the full breadth of the requirements but is on a path to doing so with a planned upgrade to its Oracle and relayer set. The Committee encourages swift action from the LayerZero team in implementing this upgrade and recommends reassessment once the new configuration has been in operation for at least three months. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1204.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="950" height="400" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1204.png" alt="Uniswap Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment: Wormhole &amp; Axelar Pass, LayerZero, Celer Fail" class="wp-image-195610" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1204.png 950w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1204-300x126.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1204-768x323.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1204-750x316.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" title="Uniswap Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment: Wormhole &amp; Axelar Pass, LayerZero, Celer Fail 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Celer did not satisfy the requirements with its current distribution of stakes and the lack of a functioning slashing mechanism, among other concerns. The lack of transparency around the operations of the validator set and the operational processes that govern important protocol updates also highlighted areas for significant improvement. The Committee recommends reassessment after a period of at least six months, provided these issues are materially ameliorated.</p>

<p>The analysis of deBridge concluded that a thorough reassessment may be necessary as some of its security assurances are expected to change upon introducing the deBridge governance token and implementing its planned slashing and delegated staking system. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1206.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1206.png" alt="Uniswap Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment: Wormhole &amp; Axelar Pass, LayerZero, Celer Fail" class="wp-image-195612" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1206.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1206-300x180.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1206-768x461.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1206-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Uniswap Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment: Wormhole &amp; Axelar Pass, LayerZero, Celer Fail 8"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Multichain was evaluated as not satisfying the requirements due to its largely permissionless validator set, lack of disincentives for validators to collude, and limited technical documentation, among other concerns. The Committee advises the team to focus on clarifying the security model of the protocol and improving transparency before it should be considered for reassessment by the Uniswap Community.</p>

<p>A Montenegro court has ordered that Do Kwon, a former crypto fugitive, and his associate Han Chang-Joon remain incarcerated for six more months while judges consider an extradition request from South Korean prosecutors and one for Kwon alone from US authorities. </p>



<p>South Korea and US prosecutors have charged Kwon for defrauding investors in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain ecosystem in May 2022. The pair had been granted bail at €400,000 each by a higher court in Podgorica, which had kicked off an extradition detention. </p>



<p>The decision to grant them bail has underscored the confusing status of Kwon. They will stay in prison in Spuž, north of the capital Podgorica, while a higher court decides if they will be extradited to South Korea. Kwon and Han are also accused of falsifying documents in Montenegro, which is punishable by a prison sentence of three months to five years.</p>

<p>The case has upended the political arena in Montenegro just before local parliamentary elections. Kwon had sent a letter to authorities about his alleged relations with Milojko Spajić, a candidate for prime minister. Kwon was on the run from Interpol for about six months before hiding out in Serbia. </p>



<p>Kwon and Han had registered a company in Belgrade in October and purchased an apartment for €2 million in an elite district of the Serbian capital. Police seized the apartment after DL News reported the purchase. In May, it was reported that €7 million were moved from wallets connected to Do Kwon while he was detained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance.US has laid off several employees after authorities sued it for breaking securities laws and moved to seize its assets last week.</em></li>



<li><em>Around 50 employees were laid off.</em></li>



<li><em>Workers from the company&#8217;s legal, compliance, and risk departments were among those let go, with the request for anonymity since the case is confidential.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sec-binance-layoffs/crypto-giant-binances-us-affiliate-fires-staff-after-sec-charges-sources-idUSL4N3872DR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em>, citing two people familiar with the matter, Binance.US fired fifty people, spreading across the legal, compliance, and risk departments.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1195.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="593" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1195-1024x593.png" alt="image 1195" class="wp-image-195590" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1195-1024x593.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1195-300x174.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1195-768x445.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1195-750x434.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1195.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance.US Fires 50 Employees Amid Legal Difficulties With the SEC 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>Additionally, two Binance.US employees said on LinkedIn Wednesday that they were leaving, with one referring to a &#8220;round of layoffs.&#8221; According to the sources, around 50 individuals were laid off.</p>



<p>The SEC charged Binance and its founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao on June 5 with forming <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194507-binanceus-claims-sec-asset-freeze-cripple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US</a> as part of a &#8220;web of deception&#8221; to avoid rules designed to safeguard U.S. investors. Binance has said that it would defend itself vigorously. The world&#8217;s biggest exchange claims that it would do everything in its power to defend the platform. Binance also feels that the SEC&#8217;s failure to collaborate in good faith is a miscalculation in terms of establishing clear standards for the digital asset market.</p>



<p>The SEC also charged BAM Trading, Binance.US&#8217; operational firm, with misleading investors about non-existent trading restrictions on its platform.</p>



<p>The SEC then petitioned a federal court to seize Binance.US&#8217; assets, which included more than $2.2 billion in cryptocurrency and $377 million in bank accounts. The <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194533-the-sec-receives-no-positive-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> voiced worry that the exchange may cause such monies to be moved abroad.</p>

<p>The ambiguous definition of &#8220;security&#8221; was one of the SEC&#8217;s contentious points in the case. In February, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler indicated that, with the exception of Bitcoin, all cryptocurrencies are securities and are subject to SEC oversight.</p>



<p>Yet, both the crypto community and industry professionals criticized Gensler&#8217;s stance. Even the Commodities and Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) in the United States is divided. Binance might use the lack of agreement between the two agencies to its advantage in its struggle with the SEC. The community deemed the SEC&#8217;s rules for distinguishing securities to be excessively ambiguous during the argument over whether Ethereum is a commodity or a security. </p>

<p>In March, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194473-house-republicans-to-fire-sec-chair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gensler</a> claimed that Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) technology that should completely fulfill securities rules. Yet, at his hearing before the US Congress a month later, he declined to say if Ethereum is a security.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The correlation between Bitcoin, the biggest digital asset by market capitalization, and the Nasdaq 100 index has just reached its lowest level in five years.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 index has retreated to a five-year low as regulatory concerns around the cryptocurrency sector loom.</em></li>



<li><em>The recent drop in the <em>correlation</em> between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq index is definitely the result of US legislation aimed at the crypto company.</em></li>



<li><em>This is the biggest volatility after recent crises.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The link between the stock market and the cryptocurrency industry has long been a source of speculation, and the correlation between Bitcoin (BTC), the biggest digital asset by market capitalization, and the Nasdaq 100 index has just reached its lowest level in five years.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1193.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="959" height="620" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1193.png" alt="Bitcoin - Nasdaq Correlation Hits 5-Year Low Because Of Recent Market&#039;s Big Concerns" class="wp-image-195584" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1193.png 959w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1193-300x194.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1193-768x497.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1193-750x485.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" title="Bitcoin - Nasdaq Correlation Hits 5-Year Low Because Of Recent Market&#039;s Big Concerns 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Nasdaq index increased 10% in the last month, while <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195460-bitcoin-plummets-below-25k-top-10-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> plummeted over 9%, according to CoinJournal research chief Dan Ashmore.</p>



<p>As a consequence, the 60-Day Pearson correlation between the two assets fell to minus 0.66, the lowest since 2018. The previous low for the Bitcoin-Nasdaq correlation was negative 0.49, which was achieved during last November&#8217;s FTX crisis.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Even when the Luna, Celsius, and FTX crises arose, the Bitcoin-Nasdaq correlation exhibited a declining trend last year. However, this is the period that shows a marked difference.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Bitcoin correlation with stocks has broken trend and is now at a 5-year low. There have been a few notable episodes of decorrelation over past 18 months, but none bigger than what is currently happening,&#8221; Ashmore <a href="https://twitter.com/DanniiAshmore/status/1669347324039168009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Ashmore, the recent drop in the connection between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq index to a five-year low is certainly attributable to US cryptocurrency legislation. This week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Binance, the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, and Coinbase, the top U.S. exchange, with selling unregistered securities.</p>



<p>Fundamentally, Bitcoin traditionally tended to move in the same direction as the major corporations featured on the Nasdaq 100 index, prompting some financial experts to dismiss the digital asset&#8217;s usefulness as a diversifier. But, the current decorrelation may show them incorrect.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $25,112, and the Nasdaq 100 is at 15,152.12.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Marathon Digital Holdings, a crypto mining company, issued a warning about fraudulent activity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Marathon Digital Holdings has issued a warning about fraudulent activities.</em></li>



<li><em>Marathon does not provide individual investors with an account to participate in cryptocurrency mining, nor does it accept funds from individual investors.</em></li>



<li><em>Currently, in the market, there are unknown objects taking advantage of Marathon Digital&#8217;s name to call for investment from individual investors.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Marathon Digital Holdings, a crypto mining company, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/15/2689180/0/en/Marathon-Digital-Holdings-Issues-Warning-of-Fraudulent-Activity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> a warning about fraudulent activity.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1186.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1186-1024x538.png" alt="Marathon Digital Issued A Warning On Fraudulent Activities" class="wp-image-195574" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1186-1024x538.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1186-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1186-768x403.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1186-750x394.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1186-1140x599.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1186.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Marathon Digital Issued A Warning On Fraudulent Activities 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>Marathon indicated that it does not provide accounts for private investors to engage in cryptocurrency mining and does not take funds from individual investors.</p>



<p>The company has become aware of a number of bogus websites and applications pretending to be associated with Marathon Digital Holdings, as well as fraudulent contacts from persons posing as Marathon personnel. In addition, the corporation is aware of bogus stock certificates printed in other languages that are purportedly being sold by third parties in at least Russia, if not other international nations.</p>



<p>According to the company, this is financial fraud. If investors have made an investment, they should notify the police.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1187.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1187.png" alt="Marathon Digital Issued A Warning On Fraudulent Activities" class="wp-image-195575" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1187.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1187-300x225.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1187-768x576.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1187-750x563.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Marathon Digital Issued A Warning On Fraudulent Activities 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>Marathon said that it is cooperating with authorities and expects to take all necessary legal steps to protect its copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property.</p>



<p>According to Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, a variety of obstacles will effectively push certain Bitcoin miners out of the market.</p>



<p>Stagnant Bitcoin pricing, high power costs, ongoing rivalry, and a preprogrammed event that lowers mining rewards in half have constrained miners&#8217; profits and driven them to make their power-hungry operations more efficient, Thiel said during a <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-06-13/marathon-digital-ceo-expects-more-bitcoin-miner-deals-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg Television</a></em> interview.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The larger miners that have the most modern fleets, the best energy costs and the most efficient are going to thrive while the smaller miners that either can’t raise capital, can’t upgrade their machines and can’t get out of essentially more expensive energy contracts are either going to consolidate or essentially going away,” Thiel said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bitcoin miners are benefiting from a resurgence in Bitcoin prices this year, after a drop in digital assets in 2022 due to a spate of crypto meltdowns, including bankruptcy by companies such as Core Scientific. Despite this, increased rivalry among miners has countered some of the rebound.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The redemption of $64.5 million of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 has been agreed upon by Coinbase.</em></li>



<li><em>Due to the notes&#8217; 29% discount to par value, the company anticipates it will only require $45.5 million in cash to complete the deal.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase has just <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2023/Coinbase-Announces-Repurchase-of-0.50-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Due-2026/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed</a> to repurchase a large chunk of its 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026.</strong></h5>

<p>Due to the notes&#8217; 29% discount to par value, the company anticipates it will only require $45.5 million in cash to complete the deal.</p>



<p>The purchase agreements, which were privately negotiated with select note holders, are part of Coinbase&#8217;s continuous efforts to strategically deploy cash and generate value for its shareholders.</p>



<p>In a statement, Alesia Haas, Chief Financial Officer, stressed the significance of these repurchases:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We are always looking for the best opportunities to deploy capital to create shareholder value. This opportunistic repurchase reflects our confidence in our business, strong financial performance in the first quarter, and improved competitive positioning.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Investors&#8217; concerns were heightened by a May 2022 admission that if the company goes bankrupt, customers&#8217; digital assets housed on the platform may be subject to bankruptcy procedures and may be considered unsecured creditors.</p>



<p>Coinbase Global Inc. DL-Notes 2021(21/31) issued in September 2021, for example, are now trading at 54 cents on the dollar. This loan, worth over $1 billion, was issued with a coupon rate of 3.625% and a maturity date of October 2023. The current yield on the bond is 15.2%.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>In conjunction with the original issue of the notes, Coinbase had previously engaged in capped call transactions with select financial institutions. Notwithstanding the repurchases, these deals will remain in effect.</p>



<p>Coinbase has been working hard to become a more efficient and financially conservative corporation, as stated in its most recent shareholder letter. The first quarter of 2023 was a watershed moment for the firm, and these repurchases are consistent with the company&#8217;s goal of lowering outstanding debt and improving its capital structure.</p>



<p>Subject to normal closing conditions, the buyback transaction is scheduled to conclude on or around June 20, 2023. When these repurchases are completed, roughly $1.373 billion in the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes will remain outstanding.</p>



<p>Notwithstanding the current Securities and Exchange Commission securities investigation against Coinbase, it ensures that it will continue to manage the fast-expanding crypto company, remaining focused on capital deployment methods that produce long-term shareholder value. The SEC <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192708-breaking-sec-sues-coinbase-alleging-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> Coinbase of running an unregistered securities exchange and selling unregistered securities via its staking-as-a-service platform.</p>

<p>According to Tether, they have been in the news again lately due to their reporting obligations to the New York Attorney General&#8217;s Office. Earlier this year, Tether completed their reporting obligations under the terms of their 2021 settlement. This settlement called for reporting about Tether&#8217;s reserves each quarter for two years. Tether fully honored this obligation, and there has been no suggestion that the disclosures were incomplete or that the reserves were ever inadequate.</p>



<p>CoinDesk sought public disclosure of materials relating to the first of Tether&#8217;s quarterly reports under New York&#8217;s Freedom of Information Law. This morning, the New York Attorney General&#8217;s Office provided responsive documents to CoinDesk, which Tether has called on CoinDesk not to disclose information about its past and current customers. Tether initiated proceedings to prevent the public dissemination of confidential customer data and to prevent the use of sensitive commercial information that malicious actors could potentially exploit.</p>

<p>Among the documents disclosed are statements from Tether&#8217;s banks showing the full existence of their reserves, as demonstrated by their publicly-disclosed, independent, third-party assurance attestations. Tether has been applying best-in-class asset management concepts, short-term investments, and diversification.</p>



<p>As per the <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-on-FOIL-and-continued-commitment-to-transparency/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tether.to/en/tether-on-FOIL-and-continued-commitment-to-transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, these materials should debunk all that unfounded FUD. Furthermore, the materials are outdated and do not accurately reflect the present state of their reserves, nor do they account for the transformative changes in their ecosystem. Tether has reduced its commercial paper holdings to zero in mid-2022 and drastically reduced its secured loans portfolio, with the aim to bring it to zero in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>CoinEX has been banned in New York for fraudulently advertising itself as a reputable cryptocurrency exchange.</em></li>



<li><em>Authorities also confiscated $1.7 million in cryptocurrency assets. </em></li>



<li><em>Despite accepting the compensation, CoinEx, also known as Vino Global LLC, refused to admit any wrongdoing.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinEx <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-recovers-17-million-cryptocurrency-platform-operating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed</a> to pay over $1.7 million and be barred from operating in New York in order to resolve a lawsuit filed by state Attorney General Letitia James, accusing the cryptocurrency exchange of operating unlawfully due to a failure to register with the state.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1179.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="445" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1179.png" alt="CoinEx Agrees To Settlement To Pay Over $1.7 Million In Fines To New York Investors" class="wp-image-195552" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1179.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1179-300x167.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1179-768x427.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1179-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="CoinEx Agrees To Settlement To Pay Over $1.7 Million In Fines To New York Investors 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>A proposed settlement was filed in a New York state court in Manhattan on Wednesday, and it must be approved by a judge. It demands that CoinEx refrains from providing, selling, or purchasing securities and commodities in New York and from making its platform accessible in the state.</p>



<p>The deal settles a prior complaint filed against the exchange in February, in which the state of New York accused the company of fraudulently portraying itself as an exchange and failing to register with local authorities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As part of today’s consent order, CoinEx is banned from offering, selling, or purchasing securities and commodities in New York and is prohibited from making its platform available in the state,&#8221; according to the release.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>James alleged that the company&#8217;s refusal to register before purchasing and selling tokens such as AMP, LBRY, LUNA, and Rally violated the Martin Act, a strong state legislation used to combat financial fraud.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Unregistered crypto platforms pose a risk to investors, consumers, and the broader economy. Today&#8217;s agreement should serve as a warning to crypto companies that there are hefty consequences for ignoring New York&#8217;s laws,&#8221; James said in a statement.</p>

<p>According to the deal, nearly $1.1 million will be repaid to 4,691 New York investors, with the state receiving more than $600,000 in fines. CoinEx must also apply geo-blocking to prohibit access from New York IP addresses. The exchange is likewise prohibited from opening new accounts for US consumers.</p>



<p>In agreeing to settle, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190875-coinex-offers-bithk-trading-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinEx</a> did not acknowledge wrongdoing. Vino Global Limited is a Hong Kong-based platform that was created in 2017.</p>

<p>For the next 90 days, CoinEx consumers will be able to retrieve crypto money straight from the exchange. After this time, qualifying investors may request cash in fiat currency by contacting coinexrefund@ag.ny.gov. Investors would be repaid bitcoin or cash equivalents kept in accounts as of April 25, 2023, according to the release.</p>

<p>According to Celsius&#8217;s reorganization plan, it will sell all of its clients&#8217; altcoins, barring custody and account holdings. The proceeds from the altcoin sale, however, will be turned into Bitcoin and Ethereum. It said that the procedure would begin on July 1, 2023. If an objection is raised, the court will examine it during a hearing on June 28, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. ET. According to the document, the conversion will have no effect on any creditor&#8217;s claims. Debtors also make every effort to maximize fund exchange.</p>



<p>This move follows the insolvent crypto lender&#8217;s declaration that it has chosen Fahrenheit&#8217;s plan to manage a new company that has been selected to be owned by its creditors.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, David Adler, Bankruptcy Partner at McCarter &amp; English, warned that a group of borrowers he represents in the case might submit an objection to this proposal. Celsius is not likely to refund their collateral. According to Adler:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This proposed “treatment” violates every consumer lending law out there (state, federal) and the ad hoc Borrower group will be opposing this plan.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On Thursday, Celsius <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195387-celsius-new-bankruptcy-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a revised bankruptcy plan with the New York Bankruptcy Court to reflect the Fahrenheit consortium&#8217;s successful bid for its assets. Yet, creditors may object to the idea.</p>

<p>The new company will get between $450 and $500 million in liquid bitcoin as part of the Fahrenheit agreement, and US Bitcoin Corp will build a variety of crypto mining facilities, including a new 100-megawatt facility.</p>



<p>Fahrenheit secured the purchase of Celsius Network, an insolvent crypto lending business whose assets were once valued at almost $2 billion.</p>
