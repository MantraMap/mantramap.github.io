			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a conference speech last Friday, Commissioner Peirce gave a speech in which she recommended that the crypto industry take onboard the lessons learnt so far.</p>
<p>Commissioner Hester Peirce spoke at the Digital Assets at Duke Conference in Washington recently, and she had much advice for those who were building out the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
Lessons for crypto
<p>The main lesson she wanted to impart was to say that crypto shouldn&rsquo;t wait for the regulators to sort it out. Instead, people who promoted the industry would do better to &ldquo;root out harmful practices and encourage good behaviour&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Even as a regulating commissioner, Hester Peirce advised that regulatory solutions were more likely to be &ldquo;inflexible&rdquo;, and that they shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a first resort. She believed rather that voluntarily imposed solutions could be far more effective given that those imposing them understood their industry far better than the regulator.</p>
<p>Her second piece of advice was to remember the actual point of crypto, which wasn&rsquo;t trying to drive up prices or lending tokens to others to trade with. She said that the point was to solve various problems, and mentioned some of the multitude of use cases such as:</p>

<p>&ldquo;smart contracts, payments, provenance, identity, recordkeeping, data storage, prediction markets, tokenization of assets, and borderless human collaboration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thirdly, she suggested that each blockchain, crypto asset, or project should be taken on its own merits, and talking about it as just crypto obscured the important differences.</p>
<p>Fourth, she recommended that all new protocols be tested very carefully before release into public use, given that &ldquo;disastrous consequences&rdquo; could otherwise ensue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifth, the commissioner advised that people be extremely careful when dealing with any centralised crypto entities, and should take the same precautions as with any non-crypto company. By the same token, she suggested that crypto companies be careful to keep the trust that was invested in them by the public.</p>
<p>Sixth, Pierce laid out a list of lessons from traditional finance that were applicable to crypto. Doing due diligence on counterparties and the level of risk they would expose an investor to was highlighted as very important.</p>
An honest summation of the SEC
<p>While agreeing with Gary Gensler, chairman of the SEC on several important issues confronting the agency, one incredibly refreshing part of Commissioner Peirce&rsquo;s speech was her extremely candid summation of other issues that concern the SEC. She stated her view that the SEC interpretation of the Howey test was &ldquo;askew&rdquo;, and said the following on the SEC&rsquo;s general approach to crypto:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We tell people to come down to the office to talk to us about their projects, plug the information they give us into our proprietary security-identifying algorithms, and then send the people home with a court date. Hardly a reasonable way forward, and one that results in what one lawyer has dubbed &ldquo;regulation by anxiety.&rdquo; Operating in such an opaque environment is very stressful for law-abiding people.&rdquo;</p>

A counter-voice in the SEC
<p>It cannot be argued that Commissioner Pierce&rsquo;s views on crypto are very refreshing. She has always let it be known that she would retain her independent thought and therefore she is an excellent foil to Gary Gensler, the chairman of the SEC.</p>
<p>Given the importance of crypto, and the likelihood that solutions for many issues in many areas of industry can be found here, it is a relief that someone of Hester Peirce&rsquo;s neutrality and good sense can be found in the regulatory space.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Singpore, Singapore, 24th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Bunzz a web3 development platform for decentralized applications, has completed a $4.5M seed round. Investors included gjmp, DG Daiwa Ventures, Coincheck, and Ceres. Funding will be used to help build out Bunzz&rsquo;s Smart Contract Hub, which is already used by more than 8,000 dApp developers. (Product page: https://bunzz.dev/ )</p>
<p>Bunzz has established a strong track record since its launch 11 months ago. Over 8,000 DApp developers have been using the platform, and more than 3,000 DApp projects have been deployed on-chain, making it one of the largest DApp development infrastructures in Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform has been recognized by top-tier landmarks as a major infrastructure service in the smart contract development sector. It has been featured on the web3 development infrastructure chaos map published by Coinbase. Additionally, Bunzz was also a finalist in Icetea Lab, Singapore&rsquo;s largest web3 accelerator program.</p>

<p>Currently, engineers who can handle DApp development are very rare. The reason is that the barrier to developing smart contracts, which are web3-specific programs, is high. In other words, if web2 software engineers could handle contract development, it would be much easier to enter the web3 space.</p>
<p>Bunzz has succeeded in simplifying the previously complex development process by providing frequently used contracts as modules and wrapping the preparation of nodes and the launch of the development environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Bunzz's core feature &ldquo;Smart Contract Hub&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bunzz offers a modularized version of frequently used smart contracts. These are freely available to general users and can be reused by other DApp developers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a similar service called Open Zeppelin, an open-source library. The difference between this and Bunzz is convenience. While OZ's code is just a library and cannot be deployed right away as it requires a development environment and nodes, Bunzz's modules can be deployed with just a GUI. It is truly the "web3 version of Docker Hub".</p>
<p>Partial list of smart contract modules offered by Bunzz</p>
<p>NFT related modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>NFT (IPFS Mintable) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>NFT (Breedable) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>NFT (Custom-URI) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>NFT (Royalties) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Simple Marketplace (For NFT) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Auction Marketplace (NFT) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>NFT (ERC721) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Non-Tradable Token (ERC4671) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Simple Marketplace (For MultiToken) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Auction Marketplace (For Multi Token) &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>DeFi related modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Token (ERC20) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Token (ERC20 Capped) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>TokenERC20DAOToken&nbsp;</li>
  <li>ReflectionToken&nbsp;</li>
  <li>MultiToken (ERC1155) &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Kenta Akutsu, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Bunzz, explained: &ldquo;Bunzz ultimately aims to become web3's equivalent to Docker Hub. Immutable smart contracts on the blockchain are open programs, also called &lsquo;public goods,&rsquo; because anyone can access and use them without permission. However, the usage flow and the logic of their operation are difficult to understand, making it inconvenient for engineers who want to reuse them. Bunzz aims to solve this problem by incentivizing creators of smart contract modules to create more accurate coding and documentation. Please feel free to contact us via twitter or discord."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Rangebound in Sideways Activity:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 25 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to trade sideways early in the Asian session as the pair was capped around the 23180.55 area before depreciating to the 22713.60 area.&nbsp; Traders recently pushed BTC/USD as high as the 23375.60 area, its strongest print since August 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were elected above the 22042.59 area during the recent appreciation, an upside price objective related to buying pressure around the 16326.16 and 17927.36 areas.&nbsp; The fresh 5-month high represented a test of the 23300.64 area, an upside price objective related to buying pressure that strengthened around the 20333.33 area.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to buying pressure around the 16326.16 area include the 23544, 23808, 25455, 25774, 27609, and 28004 levels.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to buying pressure around the 15460 area include the 23980, 24224, 26612, 26931, 29244, and 29639 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the recent move higher to multi-month highs, technical support levels and areas of potential buying pressure are around the 21711, 20682, 19850, 19019, 17989, and 17834 levels.&nbsp; Stops are cited below the 21437, 20874, 20724, 20370, 20233, 20026, 19153, 18448, and 18253 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, technically significant areas include the 15900, 15512, 15313, 14500, 14364, 13369, 10727, 10432, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 21833.33 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 22868.33.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18390.99/ 16714.46/ 14500.15 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Miami, Florida, 24th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Genesis Coin Inc, the first and largest Bitcoin ATM software platform worldwide announced today that they have been acquired by early Bitcoin ATM pioneers Andrew Barnard and Doug Carrillo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Genesis Coin&rsquo;s technology powers approximately 35% of global Bitcoin ATM transactions. Barnard and Carrillo, who also founded Bitstop, built the first and largest private-label Bitcoin ATM platform based in Miami, FL with over 2,500+ Bitcoin ATMs worldwide. Genesis Coin and Bitstop represent over 75+ operators operating 12,000+ Bitcoin ATMs in the United States and international markets powering billions of dollars in annual sales volume.</p>
<p>As part of the acquisition, Andrew Barnard will become Chief Executive Officer and Doug Carrillo will become Chief Strategy Officer and both will join the Board of Directors of Genesis Coin. Evan Rose, Genesis Coin&rsquo;s founder, will stay on as a technical advisor and remain a member of the company&rsquo;s Board of Directors. The Genesis Coin headquarters will move to Miami, Florida.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Genesis Coin gave birth to the Bitcoin ATM industry,&rdquo; said Barnard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first and largest Bitcoin ATM software platform in The World. Evan built a platform trusted by some of the largest Bitcoin ATM operators in our industry, both domestically and internationally, including the Chivo network in partnership with the Government of El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our industry is now rapidly changing and Genesis Coin will lead the way into the future. Accomplishing this requires a solid team of world-class visionaries and developers. At Bitstop, we built an incredible software team and platform which has partnered with some of the largest companies both private and publicly traded from the traditional ATM industry. We plan to bring our background and expertise in building the best technology and team in the Bitcoin ATM industry to Genesis Coin. We believe this is a win-win for all stakeholders,&rdquo; furthered Barnard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrew, Doug, and I have been friends for a long time and have also been friendly competitors," commented Rose. &ldquo;They have a reputation for their innovative and creative thinking. In addition, they have been successful in establishing key relationships in the Bitcoin space and their technical expertise and knowledge of Bitcoin is very impressive. In turn, this has allowed them to attract and retain top-tier talent and build great products. This transaction represents the coming together of the two leading software platforms in the industry and creates value for both companies&rsquo; stakeholders. It combines the best product, engineering, and leadership teams in the space. I&rsquo;m thrilled to work alongside them and look forward to introducing very exciting new products and services we have planned for this year," commented Rose.</p>
<p>Barnard, Carrillo and Rose stressed the importance of continuing to provide stability to both platforms and continuing to service the needs of operators on both platforms. For the time being, both the Genesis Coin and Bitstop platforms will continue to run independently while exploring technical synergies. Genesis Coin has already made several key hires to its development team with a core focus on product development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This acquisition represents the most significant event in the Bitcoin ATM industry to date," said Carrillo. &ldquo;Our commitment is to provide Genesis Coin with the proper resources it needs to pave the way for continued growth and innovation. We truly believe that this new combination of the best minds in our space will be the catalyst for the Bitcoin ATM industry evolving into its next phase. We are hyper-focused on building the best software for Bitcoin ATMs in the world. Today, the most sophisticated operators in our industry rely on Genesis Coin and Bitstop technology to power their businesses. As a result, we have become &lsquo;The Standard&rsquo; in the Bitcoin ATM space where virtually all industry organic M&amp;A activity today is occurring on the Genesis Coin and Bitstop networks.&rdquo; concluded Carrillo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leverage dominated the entire cryptocurrency space over the last two years. Many other platforms in our industry couldn&rsquo;t resist the siren song,&rdquo; said Barnard. &ldquo;This is a capital-intensive industry where you do not want to be in a lot of debt. Genesis Coin is financially secure with a strong balance sheet, no debt, and strong cash flow. The company does not have external investors. The result of this is that operators can build their future on the Genesis Coin platform with confidence. In a volatile industry, we are a beacon of stability. We are bullish on the potential of this industry. We see significant market growth from here over the next 10 years. We believe we are in the best position in the industry to unite the very best operators and support their growth. Our goal is to listen to our operators and deliver the very best products and features to them so they can deliver maximum value to their customers at scale,&rdquo; concluded Barnard. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Many crypto enthusiasts are currently on an LSD trip. Not the drug but liquid staking derivatives, which have become the "hot trend" in cryptocurrency. However, the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade will likely disrupt these assets' liquidity and trading volume across all exchanges, for better or worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The LSD Journey Is In Full Effect
<p>Trading cryptocurrencies and exploring the many opportunities can provide a severe adrenaline rush. However, some users go one step further by exploring LSD options. Specifically, they use liquid staking derivatives, tokens tied to popular liquid staking providers like Lido, Rocket Pool, Marinade, Frax, and Ankr. Liquid staking's momentum comes from users being able to stake any amount of Ethereum/Solana/other assets to earn rewards rather than the "required amount".&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, users on an LSD journey can use their derivative tokens as liquidity across exchanges and decentralized finance. For instance, one can provide DEX liquidity as an LP with LSD assets. It is an excellent way to tap into another revenue stream while earning staking rewards. Even though Ethereum stakers cannot earn rewards yet - that will require a network upgrade - it has become a prominent option for those looking to make money.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for many users, the LSD journey may not last as long as they would like. Although the industry currently represents $8.3 billion in assets, the Ethereum Shanghai network upgrade will hit the network in a few months. Once it does, there is no immediate need to stake through a liquid staking provider unless they can provide much higher rewards and incentives. Instead, users can stake ETH directly without needing 32 ETH to become a validator. That will likely result in users removing liquidity from Lido, Rocket Pool, and consorts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As one would expect, the looming decline in the popularity of these assets will impact overall liquidity and volume. As demand for stETH and rETH dries up, users will have a harder time trading these tokens to buy or sell. In addition, the "appeal" of using these LSD assets in DeFi may dwindle, as single-sided ETH staking can provide more appealing rewards0. Unless liquid staking providers find ways to unlock new rewards, exchange-based activity for these assets will decrease rapidly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Higher LP Incentives To Thwart CEX Dominance
<p>It is also worth noting centralized exchanges provide Ethereum staking functionality today. Platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance hold tremendous liquidity. When users no longer need liquid staking providers, they become more likely to deposit their ETH on exchanges for staking and trading through one interface. That will, in turn, further reduce demand and liquidity for LSDs. Additionally, it will increase CEX liquidity for staking, which isn't necessarily the ideal outcome either.</p>
<p>If an LSD becomes illiquid, a problem ensues. One way to avoid more dominance by centralized exchanges is through a "network effect" for LSDs. Assets like stETH, cbETH, and wstETH are all compatible with Balancer. As a result, they are compatible with Aura Finance and can provide users with better rewards and incentives. Through Aura Finance, an LSD liquidity provider - with a Balancer-compatible asset - can increase trading fees from the pool and gain exposure to AURA token rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those users would earn multiple rewards without lifting a finger. The protocol already supports LSDs with rewards ranging from 7.11% to 22.19%, depending on the asset and paired currency. One pool supports wstETH, sfrxETH, and rETH at an APY of 8.32%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a viable alternative to cashing out liquidity staking derivatives in favor of depositing funds through a centralized exchange. More importantly, it would ensure LSDs remain "liquid" while providing liquidity providers with higher yields.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market is highly volatile, with prices often fluctuating rapidly. But few coins have seen the kind of meteoric rise that Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has experienced during the presale in the last few months. In fact, the rest of the market, including Flow (FLOW) and Chiliz (CHZ), are struggling to keep up with ORBN's 1400% price increase.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Flow (FLOW)</p>
<p>Dapper Labs, the masterminds behind CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shots, have created a powerful blockchain platform known as Flow (FLOW) &mdash; a powerful layer-1 blockchain for gaming and other interactive experiences, which has been steadily increasing in popularity.</p>
<p>By creating four separate consensus protocols, Flow (FLOW) ensures optimal efficiency and reduces reliance on a single chain. Flow (FLOW) embraces Resource Oriented Programming, an approach that streamlines the development process on Flow (FLOW).</p>
<p>These technology enhancements make Flow (FLOW) significantly faster than other protocols, with transactions occurring in seconds rather than minutes. Warner Music Group, NBA, and UFC are just a few of the organizations that have partnered with Flow (FLOW).</p>
<p>However, the price of Flow (FLOW) seems to be in a downturn, with Flow (FLOW) down more than 97% since hitting $46 in 2021.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Chiliz (CHZ)</p>
<p>Chiliz (CHZ) is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform for sports, entertainment, and gaming enthusiasts to engage with their favorite teams or artists like never before. Socios.com is powered by the Chiliz (CHZ) token, making it easy for fans to purchase exclusive fan tokens and access exclusive experiences.</p>
<p>Chiliz (CHZ) is already used by the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, and other top sports teams. In fact, the UFC has just started using Chiliz (CHZ) to reward and engage its fans, making Chiliz (CHZ) one of the most successful sports-related cryptos out there.</p>
<p>However, Chiliz (CHZ) has failed to keep up with the market, trading at just $0.13 &mdash; down from an all-time high of $0.89 in March 2021. This weak Chiliz (CHZ) performance may be due to the bearish markets, or it could be a sign of waning investor enthusiasm for Chiliz (CHZ).</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is here to reshape the crowdfunding industry with a platform that replaces startup equity with fractionalized NFTs. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) allows startups to access funding without having to beg banks or venture capitalists, while also allowing the everyday investor to join in on the action.</p>
<p>For example, if Tommy thinks XYZ TECH will become the next big thing and wants to get involved, he can log onto Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) and buy NFTs that represent fractional ownership of XYZ TECH. $1 is all it takes to get started, and the NFTs represent his direct ownership of the company.</p>
<p>Smart contracts take the decentralization of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) a step further by automating certain processes. For example, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)'s &ldquo;Fill or Kill" mechanism automatically refunds investors if a project fails to raise enough funds.</p>
<p>But to uncover the best features of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), the ORBN token is essential. The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) token was created to reduce friction, facilitate transactions, and provide liquidity within the platform.</p>
<p>To reward early Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) adopters, a presale of the ORBN token has been running since late 2022, and the results have been astounding &mdash; with an 1400% increase in price since its launch date. There's no reason for the price of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) to slow down anytime soon, either.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto fans and developers have struggled for some time to find a way to bridge the gap between the NFT and blockchain gaming spaces. Significant NFT collections try to include utility and provide value to their holders. However, developing a full-fledged game is frequently beyond the fiscal capacity of such initiatives.</p>
<p>MixMob Racer 1 is an ambitious racing game project developed by MixMob on the Solana blockchain that lets players battle for rewards, stream, and wager on racers and can be played at any time owing to mobile capabilities. Although blockchain technology is still relatively new to the gaming industry, it has significantly impacted the sector's development. There is no disputing that Web3 gaming is still in its infancy; multiple indicators point to a lengthy road ahead before it goes mainstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Web3 gaming is revolutionizing the industry by giving gamers myriad new ways to earn a living from their passion. Fungies' internal estimates place the global Web3 gaming industry at around $30 billion by 2030, up from a 2021 value of $5 billion.</p>
MixMob In-Game Economy Driving Stability
<p>According to an announcement on January 24th, users may use SUD$ to enter Arenas and compete for extra SUD$ in various gameplay modes, including Rookie, Hero, and Degen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the release of the mobile version of MixMob: Racer 1, powered by Solana, the developer anticipates a significant uptick in the game's user base. Non-racers can earn SUD$ thanks to the game's new and improved streaming and wagering features. Later on, users can trade in the SUD$ for digital collectibles, season game passes, and other cool perks.</p>
<p>According to the release, MixMob's in-house data scientists ran hundreds of simulations of the economy and came up with a model that works for the project and its players.</p>
<p>SUD$ is an abbreviation for Subdomain Dollars, the currency used in the MixMob universe and named after the Subdomain where all MixMob members live. The SUD$ are used in the game to enter racing contests, wager, purchase digital items, and more.</p>
<p>The major goal of SUD$ in this release is to improve the game's in-game economics; hence, they can only be won or purchased in packs via MixMob's MixLab. SUD$ may be won through playing the game, referring new players, or holding one of MixMob's Gen0 Masks. Those who have previously competed in MixMob competitions, staked their Masks, or battled to become MixMob MVPs have all earned SUD$ that they can use in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 24, 2022, the public will be given a URL to the game via which they can access it. Members of the community will also be given a referral link that they can use to challenge their friends and increase their chances of winning rewards. During Alpha V3, players can access PvP (Player vs. Player) and PvE (Player vs. Environment) modes.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Barcelona, Spain, 24th January, 2023: Games For A Living, a Web3 game development studio and a permissioned layer 1 gaming infrastructure platform, has announced it is entering into a strategic partnership with Enjinstarter in an initial dex offering (IDO) agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjinstarter and Games For A Living (G4AL) announced a strategic partnership with a $100,000 USD IDO agreement. The partnership will focus on enabling and providing quality Web3 games to the masses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built on JumpNet, Enjinstarter&rsquo;s core focus lies on Metaverse, GameFi, NFTs and music to mention a few. G4AL aims to capitalise on developers and creators within the Web3 gaming industry to build communities, games and more!&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an IDO partner for G4AL, Enjinstarter will work closely with the project ahead of its initial game offering on 20&ndash;02-2023 as well as the Play-to-Earn launch of the Elemental Raiders game, with the game already being live as Free-To-Play on Steam. The partnership aims to promote the many utilities that G4AL has to offer to onboard games developers to the blockchain with no difficulty. Additionally, Enjinstarter will also be working closely with teams at G4AL and all the games under its umbrella, alongside its partners such as DVerse towards partnerships, promotions, campaigns, AMAs and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>G4AL&rsquo;s core focus lies in developing a suite of services and offerings for blockchain games, with plug and deploy models integrated into game engines easing game studios&rsquo; developer pipelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About G4AL&nbsp;</p>
<p>Games for a Living (G4AL) was founded in 2021 by Manel Sort (CEO), the former FVP and GM of King Studio, Javier Le&oacute;n (Art Director), an Emmy Award Nominee, Christian Gascons and Marc Tormo (both ex-Blizzard Entertainment). The team has a combined 100 years of experience in building and growing startups. Games For A Living consists of a Web3 game development studio as well as a permissioned layer one blockchain infrastructure made to support gamers and developers. Under the G4AL blockchain, the first game is called Elemental Raiders, a free to play strategy RPG game with play and earn features to be released soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vision for the G4AL is driving mass adoption of blockchain gaming by building an infrastructure that game developers can use at no added cost so they can offer true ownership of assets to their players. And through the creation of games that showcase the infrastructure and our belief that blockchain games will drive greater engagement with users and will be the biggest revolution in gaming since the introduction of free-to-play models.</p>
<p>About Enjinstarter</p>
<p>EnjinStarter is a launchpad interested in providing support for blockchain games, NFTs, Metaverse. Their native token is $EJS and is also interested in facilitating the growth and development of Enjin and its Efinity blockchain. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Nayib Bukele, the President of El Salvador, took to Twitter to announce that an $800 billion bond was paid with interest, and that his country&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bitcoin bet&rdquo; continues.</p>
<p>President Bukele was more than a little surprised at what he called the &ldquo;Literally, hundreds of articles&rdquo; that were written by the mainstream media stating that El Salvador was going to default on its debt.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In the past year, almost every legacy international news outlet said that because of our &ldquo;#Bitcoin bet&rdquo;, El Salvador was going to default on its debt by January 2023 (since we had an 800 million dollar bond maturing today).Literally, hundreds of articles https://t.co/rEiK7K13U4</p>
&mdash; Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) January 24, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>The president highlighted just one of these articles as an example in his tweet. This was by the Spanish news platform El Pais, a highly respected news outlet which is the equivalent of the Washington Post for the US, or The Times, for the UK.</p>
<p>The article read that investors doubted that El Salvador would be able to meet its debt obligations, and tied this in with Bitcoin&rsquo;s price fall. The article covered the IMF&rsquo;s displeasure with Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador, and it also covered the Fitch credit rating downgrade.</p>
<p>In another Tweet, President Bukele also drew attention to a July full page spread in the NY Times which in his view helped to create the narrative that El Salvador would be going bust.</p>
<p>He wrote in the tweet:</p>

<p>Full page spreads on the @nytimes and all, creating the narrative that El Salvador was broke and going to default.</p>
<p>I called them out at the time, but of course, who was going to believe us and not every international news outlet and their &ldquo;economic geniuses&rdquo;?</p>

&mdash; Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) January 24, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>In yet another tweet he called out various news outlets that had stated that without an IMF deal, El Salvador would not be able to make its 2023 bond repayment because of the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bitcoin losses&rdquo;.</p>
<p>According to the president, in opposition to all the hundreds of news outlets that had stated that El Salvador would default, only one news outlet, the Colombian Semana.com, reported that his country had paid its debt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understood that the El Salvadoran expenditure on Bitcoin is only a very small percentage of its finances, but the country might need to expect one more pull back from the cryptocurrency in order to lay the base for the next bull market.</p>

<p>In yet another tweet he called out various news outlets that had stated that without an IMF deal, El Salvador would not be able to make its 2023 bond repayment because of the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bitcoin losses&rdquo;.</p>
<p>According to the president, in opposition to all the hundreds of news outlets that had stated that El Salvador would default, only one news outlet, the Colombian Semana.com, reported that his country had paid its debt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understood that the El Salvadoran expenditure on Bitcoin is only a very small percentage of its finances, but the country might need to expect one more pull back from the cryptocurrency in order to lay the base for the next bull market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Privacy-enhancing coins are a way to comply with GDPR as well as a protection of the innate right to privacy. Can they also comply 100% with regulatory requirements?</p>
<p>With TornadoCash being drawn into the public arena with the arrest of one of its founders under national security concerns, and with the even more public collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s FTX empire, lawmakers and regulators have been under pressure to do something about it.</p>
<p>Privacy-enhancing coins are already very much under the gaze of the regulators, and given the current political environment, governments just might seek to ban them.</p>
The role of privacy-enhancing coins
<p>Much against what many commentators are saying about the cryptocurrency sector, blockchain technology is transparent and open by definition. All transactions that were ever made are time stamped and logged on the blockchain.</p>
<p>However, that isn&rsquo;t always a good thing. Not everyone wants their entire history of transactions to be open to the seller when they pay for any goods, especially if they might include delicate financial transactions or payments for an embarrassing medical procedure for example. None of your bank transactions are public information either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple fact that one's entire transaction history is on view will surely lead to bad actors targeting individuals. It is for this reason that privacy protocols like Dusk Network have the dual focus of privacy for the individual on the one hand, and regulatory compliance on the other.</p>
<p>Dusk Network believes that regulated DeFi, together with the privacy system it is building, can become the building blocks of how finance is done going forward.</p>
Will the EU ban privacy-enhancing coins?
<p>It must be an extremely hard life for regulators and lawmakers in the current break-neck speed environment of crypto, blockchain, and other associated technologies. Keeping up with the technology would require far more than just an average understanding of the space.</p>
<p>Probably lacking the deep knowledge to engage with the technology, regulators seem to be inclining towards making it impossible for anyone to conceal their financial activities, whether they be legal or otherwise. Their argument is that privacy-enhancing protocols can hide money laundering and other such activities.</p>
<p>Fraudsters use cash for their illegal activities far more than they might use crypto, especially given the trail they can leave. But nobody is talking about banning cash, even though it is the main way to transact in drugs and just about any other illegal activity.</p>
What is known about the EU proposal?
<p>Part of the draft regulation includes the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Credit institutions, financial institutions, and crypto-asset service providers shall be prohibited from keeping &hellip;anonymity-enhancing coins&rdquo;</p>

<p>This suggests that centralised exchanges will not be able to list privacy-enhancing coins. The proposed regulation also states that any transaction under 1000 EUR would need to have a KYC, and that any transaction over 1000 EUR cannot remain private.</p>
<p>This would mean that even without the restrictions on privacy-enhancing coins, there would be no privacy, leading to user accounts being doxxed.</p>
Where Dusk Network comes in
<p>Dusk Network has its main goal to provide the financial ecosystem with a protocol that retains the privacy of the individual while at the same time complying 100% with regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>While using cutting edge zero-knowledge technology, Dusk Network is of the view that privacy is an innate right as well as a necessity if mass adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is to take place.</p>
<p>Dusk also posits that European GDPR rules currently make it impossible for blockchains to meet them, given that the ledgers are public, and the data on them is immutable. Therefore, the only way to meet GDPR compliance is to approve the type of privacy that Dusk Network can provide.</p>
<p>Dusk Network is building into its protocol regulated DeFi that is compliant with KYC rules. Those who use the protocol will have carried out KYC but this will be kept private during transactions thanks to the use of zero-knowledge cryptography.</p>
<p>How it works is that if an individual tries to transact with an entity that has particular sanctions against it, then the protocol will not allow the transaction to take place, so the only way for an individual to carry out transactions is by doing them in full compliance, and the protocol will mathematically ensure that this happens.</p>
What next for Dusk?
<p>From the standpoint of Dusk Network, the sooner that rules and regulations are in place, the better. Without hard and fast regulations the current environment is shifting beneath the feet of the entire crypto and blockchain sector.</p>
<p>Until that time Dusk Network has stated its aim of continuing to work on educating institutions and the authorities on the tech that it offers. The way that its technology is designed, auditors will have no problem in ensuring that full compliance is achieved.</p>
<p>Institutions will be able to use Dusk Network&rsquo;s platform in the full knowledge that they will be doing so in full compliance with the latest rules and with no danger of accumulating any penalties.</p>
<p>Individual users will have the same satisfaction of knowing that they retain full control over their assets and can transact with the knowledge that their transaction history is hidden from view.</p>
<p>Dusk Network is optimistic for the future and believes that RegDeFi is the way to go. Regulation will be applied across the crypto sector and Dusk Network means to continue building out its technology so that users can be fully compliant and take advantage of its innovations in order to fully retain their privacy.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum developers have successfully released the first &ldquo;Shadow Fork&rdquo; of the network&rsquo;s Shanghai upgrade.</p>
Shadow Fork Reveals Glitches
<p>A shadow fork is a test version of the actual mainnet, allowing developers to test the proposed upgrade's code on the blockchain. Ethereum developers launched the first shadow fork for the Shanghai upgrade to test if it worked properly on the Ethereum mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>News of the shadow fork was revealed when Ethereum core developer Marius Van Der Wijden tweeted about it:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1 is finalizing. It started out with a few issues because the config wasn't correctly applied on geth (we disallow overriding the mainnet config). The config is applied correctly and all nodes are in agreement. We will start some evil nodes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The testing did point out some minor technical glitches. Ethereum&rsquo;s nodes were using Geth clients after the fork, which the developers were able to address immediately. The system nodes are since then in agreement. However, the system will be further tested to establish that everything works properly without a shadow of a doubt.&nbsp;</p>
Shanghai To Allow Staked ETH Withdrawals
<p>The Shanghai upgrade will launch withdrawals on the mainnet in March. As a result of this upgrade, users will be able to access their staked coins, which they could not do since the Merge transition that took place in September 2022. In short, the upgrade will enable staked ETH withdrawals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than withdrawals, the developers are also focusing on optimizing gas costs through three specific improvements to the code. In order to test the upgrade, a public test network will be released before the end of February, which would onboard staking firms. Additionally, more shadow forks have been scheduled for the next few weeks as well.&nbsp;</p>
A New Era Of Staking
<p>The Merge introduced the Ethereum network to a proof-of-stake system, thus enabling users to deposit ETH with the network to become validators and play a role in on-chain transaction authentication. So far, since December 2020, users have staked almost $26.5 billion worth of ETH to earn staking rewards. However, the withdrawal capability will only be available once Shanghai is implemented. This means that users will have to wait until the Shanghai upgrade is fully launched on the mainnet (most likely in March 2023) to withdraw their newly-minted ETH rewards and their original ETH deposits. Experts have stated that allowing ETH stakers to withdraw funds as they please could introduce a new era of staking and significantly impact crypto.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini is laying off more employees, citing &lsquo;bad actors&rsquo; in the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>
Gemini&rsquo;s Third Round Of Layoffs
<p>The Winklevoss twins&rsquo; brainchild, Gemini, is bleeding employees left and right due to its exposure to the now-bankrupt crypto lending platform Genesis. The exchange is laying off 10% of its workforce, citing reasons of &lsquo;bad actors&rsquo; in the crypto industry. On top of that, this will be the third round of layoffs at Gemini within the last eight months. According to data accumulated by PitchBook and TechCrunch, the company had trimmed 10% of its staff in June, followed by another 7% being laid off a month later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, employees were briefed about the layoffs on a Slack channel by the company&rsquo;s president Cameron Winklevoss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was our hope to avoid further reductions after this summer, however, persistent negative macroeconomic conditions and unprecedented fraud perpetuated by bad actors in our industry have left us with no other choice but to revise our outlook and further reduce headcount.&rdquo;</p>

FTX Aftermath Spells Industry-Wide Layoffs&nbsp;
<p>Layoffs have been a part of the process for many crypto firms that were deeply affected by the FTX and Celsius catastrophes that wrecked 2022. Companies like Genesis, Crypto.com, Coinbase, Huobi, and Kraken have all had to eliminate positions to survive the severe nuclear winter in the industry that followed FTX&rsquo;s bankruptcy announcement in November of last year. Crypto.com had to lay off 264 employees, and Coinbase had to slash 20% of its workforce in January 2023 to preserve cash flow in a second round of its layoffs. Genesis also had to terminate 30% of its workforce in the first week of the year while it was preparing for bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>
Gemini vs Genesis Saga
<p>Gemini itself has been struggling over customer funds lately due to its long exposure to bankrupt crypto lender Genesis. The company has also been in trouble with the SEC due to its association with Genesis in connection with an alleged unregistered offering and sale of securities. The lending platform had previously generated high returns for Gemini clients through the high-yielding lending product Gemini Earn. however, once FTX filed for bankruptcy, Genesis abruptly froze lending. Customers were left with a shortfall of $900 million, forcing Gemini Earn to also freeze its accounts. The souring of relationships between the two crypto companies led to Cameron Winklevoss penning a harsh open letter addressing Genesis CEO Barry Silbert and accusing him of acting in bad faith.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Cardano Network encountered a brief outage on Sunday, occurring between block 8300569 and block 8300570. The outage impacted over 50% of the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the network was quick to recover, with the problem solved automatically, allowing the network to be back online within minutes.&nbsp;</p>
Cardano&rsquo;s Brief Outage&nbsp;
<p>The Cardano network suffered a brief outage on Sunday, impacting over 50% of the network&rsquo;s nodes. However, the outage barely caused any disruption and was automatically fixed within minutes. Rick McCracken, stake pool operator and developer building staking tools for Cardano, discussed the issue and assured the community that the entire network was not impacted. He gave the reason behind the outage as an &ldquo;anomaly,&rdquo; which caused over 50% of the nodes to disconnect from the network and restart. However, the cause of the outage has not been determined as yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several developers flagged the issue on GitHub, stating that block production was impacted for a few minutes. However, they added that all nodes disconnected and restarted automatically. McCracken tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a brief period of degradation. Most nodes impacted had gracefully recovered. No network restart was required.&rdquo;</p>

A Transient Anomaly&nbsp;
<p>The Telegram SPO for Input Output Global, the entity behind the Cardano blockchain, revealed that the outage appeared to have been triggered by a transient anomaly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This appears to have been triggered by a transient anomaly causing one of the two reactions in the node; some disconnected from a peer, and others threw an exception and restarted. Such transient issues (even if they were to affect all nodes) were considered in the design of the Cardano node and consensus. The systems behaved exactly as expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Input Output Global also stated that the impact of the outage was low, affecting only relay and block-producing nodes. It stated that Edge nodes appeared to be functioning as expected.&nbsp;</p>
Outages On Other Networks&nbsp;
<p>There have been several instances of blockchain nodes going offline on other networks as well. The most prominent example is that of Solana, which has suffered a considerable number of outages in the recent past. One such outage took the network down for over seven hours. In another such instance, the Solana network had to be restarted to address a network stoppage. There are several reasons why a node or several nodes could fail, ranging from an overload of activity and transactions on the network to a faulty code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A quick fix to such faults indicates robust fundamentals for the network, which was the case with the Cardano outage. The quick fix led several members of the Cardano community to point to the resilience of the blockchain and cite it as one of the reasons the Cardano blockchain is better than Solana, which had faced multiple outages in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
A Resilient Network&nbsp;
<p>This view was echoed by SundaeSwap CTO Pi Lanningham, who tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The real takeaway for me is how impressively resilient the Cardano network is. Something took down ~60% of nodes, and the network recovered in a few minutes and continued producing blocks throughout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>SundaeSwap is a Cardano-powered decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated liquidity provision protocol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a brief period of degradation. Most nodes impacted had gracefully recovered. No network restart was required.&rdquo;</p>

A Transient Anomaly&nbsp;
<p>The Telegram SPO for Input Output Global, the entity behind the Cardano blockchain, revealed that the outage appeared to have been triggered by a transient anomaly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This appears to have been triggered by a transient anomaly causing one of the two reactions in the node; some disconnected from a peer, and others threw an exception and restarted. Such transient issues (even if they were to affect all nodes) were considered in the design of the Cardano node and consensus. The systems behaved exactly as expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Input Output Global also stated that the impact of the outage was low, affecting only relay and block-producing nodes. It stated that Edge nodes appeared to be functioning as expected.&nbsp;</p>
Outages On Other Networks&nbsp;
<p>There have been several instances of blockchain nodes going offline on other networks as well. The most prominent example is that of Solana, which has suffered a considerable number of outages in the recent past. One such outage took the network down for over seven hours. In another such instance, the Solana network had to be restarted to address a network stoppage. There are several reasons why a node or several nodes could fail, ranging from an overload of activity and transactions on the network to a faulty code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A quick fix to such faults indicates robust fundamentals for the network, which was the case with the Cardano outage. The quick fix led several members of the Cardano community to point to the resilience of the blockchain and cite it as one of the reasons the Cardano blockchain is better than Solana, which had faced multiple outages in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
A Resilient Network&nbsp;
<p>This view was echoed by SundaeSwap CTO Pi Lanningham, who tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The real takeaway for me is how impressively resilient the Cardano network is. Something took down ~60% of nodes, and the network recovered in a few minutes and continued producing blocks throughout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>SundaeSwap is a Cardano-powered decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated liquidity provision protocol.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The IMF has published a blog post laying out its view on the perceived risks that crypto poses for the global financial system.</p>
<p>The IMF has warned time and time again of the dangers that the cryptocurrency sector poses for the legacy financial system. A recent blog post lays out its perception of how crypto collapses can spread contagion to banks and other financial institutions.</p>
<p>The blog post begins by stating that crypto &ldquo;has lost trillions in market value&rdquo;. At the height of the last crypto bull market the total market cap for crypto attained a value of $2.8 trillion. It is now at just over $1 trillion.</p>
<p>A new asset class is bound to see some volatility, especially given that the lack of regulation in the sector has allowed pump and dumps to thrive.</p>
<p>The IMF blog post also accused Bitcoin of losing money for three quarters of the investors who bought it. However, Bitcoin certainly isn&rsquo;t a digital asset for quick gains. It is an asset to be held over the long term, and retail investors would do well to be aware of this.</p>
<p>Had an investor held Bitcoin over the past few years then they would certainly have done a huge amount better than holding fiat currency in any bank or savings account.</p>
<p>Up until the last ten years in the traditional markets it was customary to see four-year boom and bust cycles, which is pretty much what has been seen in crypto in the last 14 years since its inception.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, massive printing of fiat currency by central banks has propped traditional markets up, not allowing them to fall, and adding gargantuan piles of debt onto the shoulders of taxpayers who will one day have to bail the banks out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IMF authors highlight the banks&rsquo; exposure to crypto and welcome the Basel recommendations that are about to be voted on by the European Parliament. However, this particular amendment requires banks to hold reserves equal to more than 100% of any crypto-related exposure, and this may have the effect of them not wanting to engage with any digital asset companies.</p>
<p>If the crypto space was honest, it would admit that yes, there is a need for regulations to protect consumers, but only if these regulations are fair and are not designed to suppress crypto so that central banks can force citizens to continue holding fiat currencies that are losing their purchasing power at an ever-increasing rate.</p>
<p>It might be argued that for the next monetary system to survive, it will have to be completely decentralised, managed by code that cannot be tampered with, rather than humans who can manipulate things to their own advantage. The IMF is very likely to disagree.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Seeks to Sustain Rally:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 24 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) looked to sustain recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair appreciated to the 23127.90 area after finding a bid around the 22298.15 area, a level reached after trading as high as the 23375.60 area, its strongest print since August 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were elected above the 22042.59 area during the recent appreciation, an upside price objective related to buying pressure around the 16326.16 and 17927.36 areas.&nbsp; The fresh 5-month high represented a test of the 23300.64 area, an upside price objective related to buying pressure that strengthened around the 20333.33 area.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to buying pressure around the 16326.16 area include the 23544, 23808, 25455, 25774, 27609, and 28004 levels.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to buying pressure around the 15460 area include the 23980, 24224, 26612, 26931, 29244, and 29639 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the recent move higher to multi-month highs, technical support levels and areas of potential buying pressure are around the 21711, 20682, 19850, 19019, 17989, and 17834 levels.&nbsp; Stops are cited below the 21437, 20874, 20724, 20370, 20233, 20026, 19153, 18448, and 18253 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, technically significant areas include the 15900, 15512, 15313, 14500, 14364, 13369, 10727, 10432, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 21528.73 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 22796.17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Analysts suggest keeping an eye on Binance (BNB) and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN),</p>
<p>Both platforms are making a significant impact in the industry. </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a revolutionary DeFi project that is revolutionizing the way crowdfunding and venture capital work, and the price of the native ORBN token has already skyrocketed 987% to $0.0435. Binance, on the other hand, is seen as the winner from FTX's recent crash, and analysts expect the platform's native Binance Coin (BNB) to rebound soon. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Binance (BNB) Set For A Massive Rebound</p>
<p>Binance Coin (BNB) is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange, and its global impact is vast. The gap between Binance Coin (BNB) and the second-largest exchange has grown since FTX went down. Binance Coin (BNB) also sells other things, such as the BNB Smart Chain and the Binance Coin (BNB).</p>
<p>Binance Coin (BNB) started trading in 2017, and based on the volume of daily trades, it is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Binance (BNB) is a unique ecosystem of a decentralized system, and developers of cryptocurrencies are using new technology to ensure that users have precise access.</p>
<p>BNB Smart Chain is a decentralized EVM network that can be used as an alternative to Ethereum because it can scale better than Ethereum. Binance Coin (BNB) is Binance's most important product and the fourth-largest stablecoin.</p>
<p>Even though the market crashed, Binance was one of the biggest winners when FTX went down. Binance Coin (BNB) has a huge amount of control over both the spot and the derivatives markets.</p>
<p>Analysts think Binance Coin (BNB) will go up and down a lot this year, with many ups and downs. It has to deal with headwinds, which could get stronger this year. Even so, Binance Coin (BNB) has a strong position in the market, which lets it take advantage of its size and popularity.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Set To Change The Future Of Investing</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is transforming the crowdfunding and venture capital sectors. This is made feasible by equity-based NFTs that have been fractionalized to allow firms to obtain funds and investors to participate in these early-stage prospects.</p>
<p>Investing in potential businesses becomes more transparent and secure for investors. Allowing investors to invest in fractions of tokens also allows for smaller-scale investments, allowing anybody to participate.</p>
<p>Retail investors can invest in these NFTs via the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) for as little as $1. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) provides everyone access to the venture capital market by utilizing these equity-backed NFTs.</p>
<p>A "Fill or Kill" method is in place to safeguard both parties engaged in the fundraising process by returning investors' money if a financing round fails. "Fill or Kill" is used in the smart contracts that Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses and has been audited by Solid Proof.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has already risen to $0.0435, a gain of more than 987% from its starting value. According to analysts, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) might generate returns of up to 6000% and reach $0.24. </p>
<p>ORBN is the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) ecosystem's native coin. The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) ecosystem will feature the Orbeon swap, exchange, wallet, and metaverse.</p>

Binance, on the other hand, is seen as the winner from FTX's recent crash, and analysts expect the platform's native Binance Coin (BNB) to rebound soon. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Binance (BNB) Set For A Massive Rebound</p>
<p>Binance Coin (BNB) is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange, and its global impact is vast. The gap between Binance Coin (BNB) and the second-largest exchange has grown since FTX went down. Binance Coin (BNB) also sells other things, such as the BNB Smart Chain and the Binance Coin (BNB).</p>
<p>Binance Coin (BNB) started trading in 2017, and based on the volume of daily trades, it is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Binance (BNB) is a unique ecosystem of a decentralized system, and developers of cryptocurrencies are using new technology to ensure that users have precise access.</p>
<p>BNB Smart Chain is a decentralized EVM network that can be used as an alternative to Ethereum because it can scale better than Ethereum. Binance Coin (BNB) is Binance's most important product and the fourth-largest stablecoin.</p>
<p>Even though the market crashed, Binance was one of the biggest winners when FTX went down. Binance Coin (BNB) has a huge amount of control over both the spot and the derivatives markets.</p>
<p>Analysts think Binance Coin (BNB) will go up and down a lot this year, with many ups and downs. It has to deal with headwinds, which could get stronger this year. Even so, Binance Coin (BNB) has a strong position in the market, which lets it take advantage of its size and popularity.</p>

<p class="s3">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Set To Change The Future Of Investing</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is transforming the crowdfunding and venture capital sectors. This is made feasible by equity-based NFTs that have been fractionalized to allow firms to obtain funds and investors to participate in these early-stage prospects.</p>
<p>Investing in potential businesses becomes more transparent and secure for investors. Allowing investors to invest in fractions of tokens also allows for smaller-scale investments, allowing anybody to participate.</p>
<p>Retail investors can invest in these NFTs via the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) for as little as $1. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) provides everyone access to the venture capital market by utilizing these equity-backed NFTs.</p>
<p>A "Fill or Kill" method is in place to safeguard both parties engaged in the fundraising process by returning investors' money if a financing round fails. "Fill or Kill" is used in the smart contracts that Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses and has been audited by Solid Proof.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has already risen to $0.0435, a gain of more than 987% from its starting value. According to analysts, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) might generate returns of up to 6000% and reach $0.24. </p>
<p>ORBN is the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) ecosystem's native coin. The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) ecosystem will feature the Orbeon swap, exchange, wallet, and metaverse.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The European Parliament will today vote on a draft law to oblige banks to hold enough reserves in order to cover all potential losses from their crypto clients.</p>
<p>In a move that could potentially cut the crypto sector adrift from banking and financing, the EU will vote on Tuesday on a draft law that would require banks to hold reserves that total more than 100% of any loss from crypto companies.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, one of the amendments up for the vote would require banks to set a risk-weighting of 1,250% to all capital that has exposure to crypto assets, which would mean that banks would be able to cover 100% of any potential losses.</p>
<p>The new law has been drafted in order to include the last elements of Basel III, which is a global agreement that requires banks to hold more capital so that they can deal with market shocks without having to put any reliance on taxpayers.</p>
Shadow banking
<p>The Reuters article also looks at how the amendments apply to the world&rsquo;s &lsquo;shadow banking&rsquo; sector. This is a term used for banking that typically goes on in a less regulated way, and applies to the &ldquo;insurers, hedge funds, and investment funds&rdquo; that are said to make up around half the world&rsquo;s banking sector.</p>
<p>An amendment would ask for a report from the European Commission which would look into the possibility of requiring banks to have a limited exposure to shadow banking.</p>
Opinion
<p>It might be argued that all laws and pronouncements coming out of Europe currently are designed to cut the arms and legs off of the crypto industry and severely curtail its ability to operate.</p>
<p>It could certainly be the case that some banks might have lost money by having exposure to this or that crypto company, but it could be argued that crypto has not had proper regulation for all the years of its existence, allowing some bad actors to operate in the space.</p>
<p>Attempting to cut the ground from under crypto projects in order to punish and suppress the industry isn&rsquo;t the best idea. The banking industry is in dire straits of its own making, and holding crypto up as a scapegoat isn&rsquo;t going to save it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto is a tiny asset class of around $1 trillion in value. The traditional finance industry holds hundreds of trillions in value, yet there aren&rsquo;t more than whispers out of Europe of the potential catastrophe of a wholescale financial collapse.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) is a relatively new industry that is disrupting how people earn rewards and how they interact with financial products. Token holders are given a derivative for their original token, which they can put to additional use, gaining rewards from two tokens instead of one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>unshETH.xyz is striving to take this industry a step further with a unified ERC-20 token (unshETH). All liquid staking derivative tokens on the Ethereum network can be swapped for this one token, increasing accessibility. Moreover, unshETH is taking a completely new approach to Liquid Staking Derivatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>unshETH is aiming to ensure decentralization of Ethereum validator nodes, y allowing users to delegate with whom their eth should be staked. The protocol will also be open source, so that any other LSD provider can copy their features. This will help to strengthen and improve the overall ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Decentralization of Ethereum Validator Nodes
<p>Ethereum runs on validator nodes. These nodes ensure that the industry is impervious to a 51% attack and that transactions are legitimate. To ensure the longevity and viability of the Ethereum ecosystem, it is important that Ethereum validators are decentralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, it costs nearly $50,000 (32 ETH) to run a validator node. This is not a flaw - the high price ensures that only those who are committed to the Ethereum ecosystem will invest for a long-time horizon. It also ensures that no single actor owns too many nodes, given the cost. The staked 32 ETH cannot be withdrawn, at least until the Shanghai Upgrade this March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But while the overall validator nodes on Ethereum are increasing in their decentralization via the overall numbers, this has not been the case for Liquid Staking Derivative validators. The unshETH team witnessed this firsthand, having developed some of the first LSD&rsquo;s themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this end, the core aim of unshETH is Ethereum validator node decentralization for liquid derivatives. One means they use to achieve this is that validator rewards decrease with the total amount staked. This should serve to greatly disincentivize centralization. The second is incentive engineering, whereby capital is distributed across the LSD ecosystem to promote decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
The Benefits of Liquid Staking Derivatives
<p>Liquid Staking provides multiple benefits for decentralized finance (DeFi) users. A derivative token is given to a user when the original token is staked. In this manner, the DeFi native gets staking rewards for the original token and can put the derivative token to a different use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use cases of liquid staking are innumerable. All traditional derivative products within the financial markets (such as futures and options) can be placed on a blockchain, with additional risk mitigation and transparency features. This would be done with a much smaller amount of red tape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all of these benefits can only come to fruition when the core network is sufficiently decentralized. unshETH provides a variety of mechanisms to restore decentralization for LSD nodes on Ethereum. It does this in an open source manner so that all other providers can assist with one of the most pressing issues of Web3 - node decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
Why unshETH is a Game Changer for Liquid Staking Derivatives
<p>unshETH allows liquid token holders to exchange their Liquid Staking Derivative assets (such as stETH or cbETH - built by Lido and Coinbase respectively) into one unified asset: unshETH. This is different from other providers that offer various derivatives for various tokens, resulting in a messy string of derivative pairs to keep track of. Moreover, they are focused on bringing back decentralization to the Ethereum LSD market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of the other LSD providers are not focused on assisting in decentralization of validators. They are interested in taking a profit through fees. unshETH is Ethereum-specific and takes a more streamlined approach with its unified token. This will restore integrity to the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>unshETH aims to restore validator decentralization to the Liquid Staking Derivatives industry through incentive engineering, an idea that was strongly endorsed by Vitalik Buterin, the original Ethereum founder. This alone sets it apart from other providers. unshETH further allows liquid holders to consolidate a variety of derivatives into one functional and tradable unified token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users will be able to withdraw tokens after the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade in March. This is when the full version of unshETH will be unlocked. The unshETH team will then roll out Validator Dominance Options, a brand new DeFi derivative designed to add another layer of enforcement of decentralization, by redistributing staking yield away from monopolistic LSD providers via a novel mechanism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About unshETH</p>
<p>UnshETH is a decentralized initiative for disrupting the dominance of a single Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) on the Ethereum network by incentivizing the diversification of validator ownership through the use of incentive engineering. The core mission of unshETH is to ensure decentralization of Ethereum validator nodes, restoring original design principles. The protocol increases LSD market accessibility and helps users unlock the power of liquid staking derivatives in a fully decentralized manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
