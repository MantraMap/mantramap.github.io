<p>Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Sam Bankman-Fried’s quantitative trading firm Alameda Research, made sensational claims during her plea hearing on 19 December. A transcript of the said hearing was unsealed earlier today. According to a report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/alamedas-ex-ceo-tells-judge-she-hid-billions-loans-ftx-execs-2022-12-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Ellison has confessed that FTX executives including former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, received secret loans worth billions of dollars from Alameda.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Caroline Ellison prepared fake balance sheets to mislead investors</strong></h2>



<p>The former Alameda chief revealed that the trading firm could borrow unlimited funds from the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. The transcript further revealed that Ellison and Bankman-Fried conspired to hide this crucial information from FTX’s investors, customers, and creditors.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We prepared certain quarterly balance sheets that concealed the extent of Alameda&#8217;s borrowing and the billions of dollars in loans that Alameda had made to FTX executives and to related parties,&#8221; </p><cite>Ellison told U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The United States Department of Justice put out a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/united-states-attorney-announces-extradition-ftx-founder-samuel-bankman-fried-united" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>&nbsp;yesterday which revealed that Caroline Ellison had reached a plea deal and will be cooperating with prosecutors in the investigation. FTX co-founder Gary Wang also pleaded guilty and secured a similar deal with the prosecutors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wang revealed during his plea hearing, which was also held on 19 December, that he was directed to alter FTX’s code to give Alameda exclusive access to the exchange. At the time, investors and customers of the exchange were being told that Alameda had no such privileges. Wang did not name the people who issued these directions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Ellison and Wang will likely be called upon to testify against former associate Sam Bankman-Fried whose next hearing is scheduled for 3 January 2023. SBF was&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-to-be-released-after-posting-250-million-bail/" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a>&nbsp;into the custody of his parents in Palo Alto, California yesterday after he posted a bail bond of $250 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>FTX was hacked for hundreds of millions in cryptocurrencies a few hours after filing for bankruptcy.</li><li>Paxos quickly froze 11,184 Paxos Gold (PAXG) tokens stolen from the crypto exchange following a request from  U.S. Federal authorities</li><li>The on-chain trust firm recovered roughly $20 million after tracking the assets to four Ethereum addresses. </li></ul>



<p>Paxos rescued $20 million in digital gold stolen from Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX, per The Block.</p>



<h2>11,184 PAXG Stolen From FTX</h2>



<p>An unknown hacker stole 11,184 PAXG tokens backed by real gold in Paxos’ custody from FTX shortly after the crypto exchange declared bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. Reports said the hacker drained over $400 million in other crypto assets like DAI and Ether (ETH) from the platform. </p>



<p>Paxos is a regulated crypto trust and blockchain company. The firm is also the issuer of Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin. After the hack, Paxos <a href="https://paxos.com/2022/11/12/paxos-freezes-paxg-tokens-related-to-ftx/" rel="nofollow noopener">tracked</a> the PAXG tokens to four Ethereum addresses and froze the assets in compliance with a request from U.S. Federal Law Enforcement.</p>



<p>Notably, the hacker swapped around $300 million in virtual currencies in ETH, becoming of the largest Ether holders. Ethereum&#8217;s community grew concerned that the attacker might tank ETH&#8217;s price in a bid to launder crypto.</p>



<p>The team reportedly “reclaimed the assets” and transferred $20 million in PAXG tokens from the “FTX Accounts Drainer” wallets to a null address. Paxos’s treasury burned the tokens and minted 11,184 new PAXG tokens into a separate crypto wallet.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2>FTX Users In Limbo&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Billions in assets from Sam Bankman-Fried’s flatlined exchange remain unaccounted for. The November hacker <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-hacker-becomes-35th-largest-holder-of-ethereum-after-panic-purchasing-approx-50m-of-eth/">stole</a> over $400 million in cryptocurrencies and digital assets. The CFTC, SEC, and Federal prosecutors allege $4 billion from customer funds were diverted to Alameda Research, under Bankman-Fried’s instructions.</p>



<p>SBF’s trading giant also hid $8 billion in liabilities on the crypto exchange, per reports. Court filing revealed tens of millions in personal loans to company executives including Bankman-Fried himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company recovered roughly $1 billion in crypto assets and cash equivalents, according to Bankruptcy CEO John Ray III as he testified before Congress in Washington DC. Ray also remarked recovering assets was a slow process due to a lack of proper accounting in SBF’s crypto empire.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>BlockFi and FTX are in contention over 56 million shares in trading giant Robinhood.</li><li>The shares are currently controlled by Emergent Fidelity Technologies, a company owned almost entirely by fallen crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried.</li><li>BlockFi argued ownership of the Robinhood stock as part of a deal with Bankman-Fried but FTX pushed for the assets to stay frozen.</li></ul>



<p>FTX filed a motion in a bid to freeze around $450 million in Robinhood shares as bankruptcy creditors battle over control for Sam Bankman-Fried’s massive investment in the trading giant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The assets in question are some 56 million shares in equity and crypto trading platform Robinhood. Bankman-Fried <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhoods-stocks-soar-20-after-sam-bankman-fried-confirms-his-stake-in-the-company/">bought</a> his stake in Robinhood for $600 million back in May 2022. According to the court filing, the shares are currently owned by Emergent Fidelity Technologies. Notably, SBF owns 90% of the company and controlled its operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BlockFi Sues For Robinhood Stock</p>



<p>BlockFi <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-ftx-ceo-over-robinhood-shares/">sued</a> the fallen exchange Founder over his Robinhood shares. The bankrupt crypto broker claimed that Bankman-Fried pledged his 56 million shares as part of a deal. BlockFi also claimed the agreement was reached FTX declared bankruptcy on November 11.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other claimants of SBF’s Robinhood stock include Yonathan Ben Shimon (creditor), and Sam Bankman-Fried himself, per the court filing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FTX Ask Judge To Freeze SBF’s Robinhood Stock</h2>



<p>The bankrupt crypto exchange <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.291.0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> to BlockFi and other claimants by asking the judge to freeze Bankman-Fried’s shares in Robinhood. Instead, lawyers representing the disgraced exchange argued to maintain the asset freeze until the bankruptcy court deliberate on the best resolution for all parties.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The fact that multiple prepetition creditors of different Debtors and Mr. Bankman-Fried are all seeking to obtain possession of the Robinhood Shares demonstrates that the asset should be frozen until this Court can resolve the issues in a manner that is fair to all creditors of the Debtors.</p></blockquote>



<p>BlockFi’s complaint is one of several against SBF’s shattered crypto empire. Court filing revealed at least $3 billion owed to the top 50 creditors. Over 1 million creditors also failed claims.&nbsp;The bankruptcy court <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-creditors-committee-wintermutre/">chose</a> crypto market maker Wintermute and Genesis entity GGC International as part of the Unsecured Creditors Committee.</p>

<ul><li>Sam Bankman-Fried will be released on a whopping $250 million pre-trial bail.&nbsp;</li><li>The former FTX CEO will move in with his parents in California.&nbsp;</li><li>Alameda Chief Caroline Ellison has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with law enforcement.&nbsp;</li><li>SBF previously claimed that he was down to his last $100,000.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former chief of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, is set to walk free following his&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-approved-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">extradition</a>&nbsp;to the United States. A federal magistrate judge in New York has ruled that the disgraced CEO is to be released on a $250 million bail designed by federal prosecutors and SBF’s attorneys. Nicholas Roos, the prosecutor, in this case, has described it as the “largest pre-trial bond ever”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried released into the custody of his parents</strong></h2>



<p>Per a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-make-us-court-appearance-after-extradition-2022-12-22/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Judge Gabriel Gorenstein has set strict terms for the release. SBF will be released into the custody of his parents, who are reportedly putting up the equity in their home to partially satisfy the bail conditions. Additionally, he will also be required to surrender his passport and undergo regular mental health treatment and evaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users on Twitter were infuriated with the judge’s ruling. Despite his parents putting up the equity in their $25 million California house, the general sentiment was that Sam Bankman-Fried would use customer funds to fund his bail. The former FTX CEO had previously stated that he was down to his last $100,000.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Caroline Ellison joins hands with prosecutors</strong></h2>



<p>Caroline Ellison, the former Chief Executive of SBF’s quantitative trading firm Alameda Research, has secured a plea deal with the prosecutors. According to a press release put out by the U.S. Department of Justice, Ellison, along with FTX co-founder Gary Wang, plead guilty to the fraud charges brought by the DOJ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to an unsealed&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23495436/crypto-cooperator-ftx-alamedas-caroline-ellisons-plea-agreement-inner-city-press-on-the-case.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">plea agreement</a>&nbsp;with the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Ellison will have to post a $250,000 personal recognizance bond. Terms of the agreement also include the clearing of any charges against Caroline Ellison except criminal tax violations, provided she fully cooperates with the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Sources said Sam Bankman-Fried could arrive in the U.S. as early as Wednesday afternoon.</li><li>Bankman-Fried was approved for extradition to face eight counts of criminal charges for fraud in FTX&#8217;s crash.</li><li>SBF waives his right to contest U.S. extradition after spending a week at the Bahamas Fox Hill prison. </li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried will be extradited to the United States to stand trial on fraud and money laundering charges over FTX’s crash, per reports from the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried could be arraigned in a Manhattan Federal District Court as early as Wednesday afternoon, NYT said. SBF was held at the Bahamas Fox Hill prison after his arrest earlier in December. However, no official timeline was disclosed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried was held in custody ahead of an extradition hearing after a judge <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-us-extradition/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-us-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied</a> his bail request. SBF seemingly planned to contest U.S. extradition pending a review of the Justice Department’s criminal indictment. Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York charged Bankman-Fried on eight counts including fraud and campaign finance violations. </p>



<p>The FTX founder <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-fried-expected-back-in-bahamas-court-11671581149?mod=e2tw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waived</a> his right to contest extradition during a hearing on Wednesday. SBF’s counsel Jerone Roberts submitted an affidavit with the decision and Bankman-Fried affirmed to the court saying “Yes, I do wish to waive my right to formal extradition proceedings.”</p>



<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried To Stand Trial For Fraud</h2>



<p>U.S. Attorneys charged Bankman-Fried with fraud over the collapse of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange comingled with trading giant Alameda research, another piece of SBF’s crippled crypto empire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prosecutors also accused the FTX Founder of violating campaign finance laws. Bankman-Fried reportedly donated tens of millions to bipartisan U.S. lawmakers. The CFTC and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-ftx-customers/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-ftx-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> also charged SBF with defrauding customers, lenders, and investors. </p>



<p>In short, Sam Bankman-Fried stands accused of stealing customers&#8217; assets on FTX to finance Alameda’s debts and trading capital. The charges argue that Bankman-Fried also instructed FTX employees to mask Alameda’s billions in liabilities on the crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankruptcy CEO John Ray testified to congress that FTX crashed due to a lack of corporate controls and risk management at the company. SBF admitted to loose control at the FTX but denied any criminal liability or intent</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Wintermute Founder Evgeny Gaevoy suggested that his crypto maker might move to fill in the created by FTX&#8217;s collapse.</li><li>Gaevoy and CEO Marina Gurevich said the company was considering rolling out a derivatives exchange built for professional traders, similar to FTX but with a few changes.</li><li>Gaevoy suggested segregated customer funds and third-party asset custody as some solutions to prevent another crash.</li></ul>



<p>Wintermute Founder Evgeny Gaevoy might launch a crypto exchange to cater to professional traders after FTX’s collapse in November left a void in the financial derivatives market, Forbes reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX rose to prominence partly due to Sam Bankman-Fried positioning the platform as a derivates exchange “built for traders by traders’. The angle propelled FTX towards crypto stardom, growing into one of the largest crypto trading venues with billions in transactions before SBF filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11. </p>



<h2>Gaevoy&#8217;s Derivatives Exchange Plans</h2>



<p>Gaevoy along with Wintermute CEO Marina Gurevich pointed to the intensified workload following FTX’s crash as the company moves to capture market share and fill the boots of Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaevoy <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2022/12/20/with-sam-bankman-frieds-hedge-fund-gone-crypto-trading-firm-wintermute-emerges/?sh=5ee639ed2bbb" rel="noopener">shared</a> thoughts on running a financial derivatives exchange with standard financial controls and risk management. According to FTX bankruptcy CEO John Ray, the crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-alameda-liabilities-korean-account/">imploded</a> largely due to a lack of risk management and corporate accounting practices,</p>



<p>Founder Gaevoy proposed segregating customer funds from company liquidity as part of an improved system for storing user deposits. Regarding asset custody, the veteran crypto trader said he would adopt a trading architecture similar to traditional financial exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means Gaevoy is a proponent of leveraging outside entities and third-party service providers to custody assets, as opposed to dedicating resources towards building in-house crypto asset custody solutions. Gaevoy disclosed his company’s approach to the current market conditions as well.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We’re basically preparing for the next 2021 at the moment. We don’t necessarily care about making the most now because it’ll be just a tiny fraction of the bull markets that can come.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Wintermute Granted Seat On FTX Creditors Committee</h2>



<p>The crypto market maker was appointed to the FTX Unsecured Creditors Committee by the bankruptcy court. Indeed, the judge named Winter, Genesis-backed entity GGC, and seven others to the committee.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Uniswap users can now purchase crypto using their credit and debit cards.</li><li>Crypto purchases through fiat will be available on Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.</li><li>The service will be provided with no minimum fees and zero spreads on USDC purchases.&nbsp;</li><li>The protocol is working on an option to convert crypto to fiat to send into bank accounts.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-nft-trading-airdrop-genie/">Uniswap</a>, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) by trading volume, has enabled crypto purchases through fiat. Users of Uniswap Protocol will now be able to buy crypto using their credit and debit cards as well as through a bank transfer. This feature has been developed in association with Moonpay.</p>



<h2><strong>Uniswap brings DeFi closer to users</strong></h2>



<p>The new feature has been <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/web-fiat-on-ramp" rel="nofollow noopener">described</a> by the DEX as “direct to DeFi”. The aim is to eliminate the need for a middleman and bring users directly to the DeFi experience through a seamless onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With self-custodial wallets, permissionless and immutable protocols, and a transparent public ledger, DEXs have built-in user protections.” the press release read.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>While card payments will be supported in 160+ countries, bank transfers will be available for most of the US, Brazil, Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), and the UK. As of now, users can purchase DAI, ETH, MATIC, USDC, USDT, WBTC, and WETH. However, WBTC and WETH will not be available for users in the US. As of now, Uniswap is only supporting four chains for this feature, namely Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>No minimum fees</strong></h2>



<p>Uniswap has clarified that this feature has been made available with zero minimum fees. Additionally, users can enjoy zero spreads on their USDC purchases. The protocol is also working to integrate an off-ramp so that users can send crypto back into their bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the feature has been marketed as a push towards DeFi, users who choose to go through Moonpay to purchase crypto will have to comply with its KYC/AML policy. Uniswap has clarified that the customer data acquired by Moonpay will not be shared with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>A South Korean court ruled in favor of a freeze on assets owned by early investors of Terra&#8217;s ecosystem.</li><li>Prosecutors filed to lockdown assets controlled by seven persons including Kernel Labs CEO Amugae Kim.</li><li>The news is the latest from South Korean investigations into Terra&#8217;s $40 billion wipeout in May 2022. </li></ul>



<p>South Korean prosecutors received permission to freeze $92 million in assets linked to early Terra backers as investigations into Luna and UST’s collapse ramp up. Authorities also seized $108 million in assets from Do Kwon’s co-founder Daniel Shin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Seoul Southern District Court passed a motion authorizing the freeze after investigators discovered illicit proceeds tied to Luna, the governance tokens developed by fugitive Do Kwon and his blockchain company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prosecutors argued that sevens persons illegally amassed assets by offering pre-issued Luna tokens for huge profits, local media reported. The filing said that Kernel Labs CEO Amugae Kim and six others profited from this scheme prior to May’s collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kernel Labs was founded in 2018 as a blockchain payments developer and on-chain consultancy company. Investigators said that Kernel Labs and Terra shared a relationship, with some Kernel staff like Kim contributing significantly to Kwon’s blockchain company. Kim’s frozen assets were valued at around $61 million, per <a href="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202212208809B" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do Kwon was also named by prosecutors as one of the seven persons with illegal gains from pre-issued Luna coins.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Terra Investigations Heat Up</h2>



<p>Terra’s $40 billion implosion sent shockwaves throughout the digital asset industry. Luna was previously a top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap. Do Kwon’s algorithmic stablecoin UST ranked third among stablecoins before the token crashed alongside its sister crypto Luna.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Local and international authorities responded with investigations on several fronts, including warrants for Kwon’s arrest from <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/interpol-issues-a-red-notice-against-terraform-labs-founder-do-kwon-report/">Interpol</a> and South Korean law enforcement. Sources claimed that Kwon fled to Serbia and currently lives there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engineers and developers who worked for Kwon were also barred from leaving South Korea at some point. Co-founder Danie Shin’s property was raided as investigators searched for clues into how Kwon’s company failed. Authorities also raided seven exchanges, confiscating transaction records in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawmakers also pledged to develop regulatory policies aimed at protecting investors without hampering innovation in South Korea’s digital asset economy.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A Bahamian magistrate has issued orders to extend the remand of Sam Bankman-Fried.</li><li>The former FTX CEO was expected to drop his extradition fight today in court.&nbsp;</li><li>SBF was reportedly shaking in the courtroom.</li><li>He will return to the Bahamas’ notorious Fox Hill prison.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Following a rather chaotic hearing today at the Nassau courthouse, Bahamian magistrate Shaka Serville ruled that Sam Bankman-Fried will not be extradited to the United States yet. The magistrate has issued orders to remand the former FTX CEO in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried intended to waive his extradition</strong></h2>



<p>The news comes as a surprise given the widespread reports of Sam Bankman-Fried’s intention to surrender himself to U.S custody. According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/19/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-sent-back-to-bahamas-jail-.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a>, even the Bahamian prosecutor acknowledged SBF’s intention to waive extradition. As per the report, Sam Bankman-Fried demanded to see a copy of his federal indictment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF was reportedly shaking in the courtroom. His defense attorney informed the court that Bankman-Fried’s presence in the court came as a “shock” to him. “I did not request him to be here this morning,” the attorney said. The former crypto billionaire will be taken away to Fox Hill prison in a heavily guarded convoy following the magistrate’s orders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>No relief in sight for Sam Bankman-Fried</strong></h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was first remanded to the notorious Fox Hill prison last week after the court&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-denied-bail-ftx-judge-bahamas-sbf-fraud-case/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rejected</a>&nbsp;his bail plea citing a flight risk. Given that he needed medical care, SBF was kept in the medical unit of the prison. The prison is known for its precarious condition. Lack of hygienic cells, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and medical care among other things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the rejection of SBF’s bail application, his attorneys indicated that they would fight extradition at today’s hearing. However,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-us-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>&nbsp;emerged over the weekend that signaled that the former FTX CEO was ready to drop his extradition fight.&nbsp;</p>
