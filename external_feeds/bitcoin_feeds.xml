U.S. authorities say the world&#x2019;s largest trading platform for digital assets was among Russian-owned Bitzlato&#x2019;s major counterparties.</strong></p>
<h2>Blockchain Data Indicates Binance Moved Over 20,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for Bitzlato Since 2018</h2>
<p>The global leader in the crypto trading sector, Binance, has allegedly transferred cryptocurrency worth almost $346 million for the Hong Kong-based Bitzlato, Reuters reported quoting data from Chainalysis. Bitzlato was a little known exchange until it was recently targeted in what U.S. authorities described as a &#x201C;significant blow to the crypto crime ecosystem.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Last week, the Justice Department <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitzlato-exchange-busted-as-us-deals-blow-to-crypto-crime-arrests-owner/">announced</a> that Bitzlato&#x2019;s co-founder and majority shareholder, Russian citizen Anatoly Legkodymov who lives in China, was arrested in Miami and charged with operating an unlicensed money exchange business that processed $700 million in illicit funds.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury&#x2019;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said that Binance was the only major crypto exchange that transacted with Bitzlato, and one of its top counterparties. Among the others were darknet marketplace <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/germany-shuts-down-hydra-market-seizes-servers-and-bitcoin/">Hydra</a>, peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange Localbitcoins, and the crypto investment scam <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-member-of-russian-crypto-pyramid-finiko-arrested-in-uae/">Finiko</a>, Russia&#x2019;s largest financial pyramid in recent years.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-registered Bitzlato, better known to Russian-speaking users, was a &#x201C;primary money laundering concern&#x201D; related to Russian illicit finance, according to FinCEN. The bureau did not reveal details about the scale of said platforms&#x2019; transactions with Bitzlato but said it will ban financial institutions from transferring funds to the exchange without specifying the entities it was referring to.</p>
<p>According to data compiled by the blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis and seen by Reuters, Binance moved over 20,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for Bitzlato, worth $345.8 million at the time the transactions took place, between May 2018 and its shutdown. Bitcoin for about $175 million was transferred to Binance from Bitzlato during the period, making Binance its largest receiving counterparty, the report also noted.</p>

<h2>Largest Crypto Exchange Says It Assisted Investigation Into Bitzlato</h2>
<p>Binance has &#x201C;provided substantial assistance&#x201D; to international law enforcement to support their investigation of Bitzlato, a spokesperson for the exchange told the news agency via email, while declining to provide further details about the crypto giant&#x2019;s dealings with Bitzlato or its cooperation with authorities.</p>
<p>The Finland-based Localbitcoins said it has never had &#x201C;any kind of cooperation or relationship&#x201D; with Bitzlato while admitting that some P2P traders at its platform &#x201C;would also have been trading in Bitzlato&#x2019;s P2P market&#x201D; but pointing out that there have been no transactions between the two exchanges since October, 2022.</p>
<p>Reuters remarked it has no evidence that the Binance, Localbitcoins or Finiko transactions with Bitzlato broke any laws or regulations. It was also unable to establish if Binance&#x2019;s dealings with Bitzlato are currently being reviewed. At the same time, the U.S.-led action against Bitzlato comes as the Justice Department probes Binance for possible money laundering and violations of sanctions.</p>
<p>A number of European countries are also involved in the investigation against Bitzlato. Last week&#x2019;s announcement revealed that French law enforcement authorities have dismantled the platform&#x2019;s digital infrastructure in the country and seized its website. On Monday, Europol <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/bitzlato-senior-management-arrested">informed</a> that four more members of the exchange&#x2019;s team have been arrested in Spain and Cyprus.</p>

Lido&#8217;s team is seeking community feedback on the proposal that would allow withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade is completed.</strong></p>
<h2>Lido Dominates Defi Economy With $7.9 Billion in Total Value Locked, Team Prepares for Shanghai Withdrawals</h2>
<p>As of the time of writing, the decentralized finance (defi) liquid staking protocol Lido is the most dominant defi protocol today, in terms of total value locked (TVL). <a href="https://defillama.com/">Statistics</a> from defillama.com show that Lido&#8217;s $7.92 billion TVL dominates the $46.56 billion TVL held in defi today by approximately 17.01%.</p>
<p>Lido is the largest holder of staked ethereum as the protocol commands around <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/ETH2-Deposits">29%</a> of the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa">staked ether supply</a>. Lido&#8217;s ethereum derivative token <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-staked-ether">STETH</a> is the 13th largest market valuation in the cryptocurrency economy with $7.73 billion. Furthermore, Lido has a governance token called <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao">lido dao (LDO)</a>, which has a market capitalization of around $1.96 billion on Jan. 25, 2023. The day prior, Lido&#8217;s development team published a <a href="https://research.lido.fi/t/withdrawals-for-lido-on-ethereum/3690">proposal</a> concerning withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade.</p>

<p>Ethereum developers are determined to make the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereums-shanghai-hard-fork-could-happen-in-march-2023-eth-dev-says-staking-withdrawals-is-the-highest-priority/">Shanghai hard fork</a> happen this March and the main focus is allowing staked withdrawals. &#8220;The design proposed by Lido on the Ethereum Protocol Engineering team addresses these challenges with the in-protocol withdrawal requests queue,&#8221; the Lido team explains in a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@lido/SyaJQsZoj">summary</a> of the withdrawals landscape via the Lido protocol. &#8220;The process has to be asynchronous, due to the asynchronous nature of ethereum withdrawals,&#8221; the Lido developers add.</p>

<p>The Lido developers explain there would be various modes of withdrawals including a &#8220;turbo&#8221; feature and a &#8220;bunker&#8221; feature. Further penalties and slashing would be codified for validators that break the rules. The summary explains how slashings affect a user&#8217;s withdrawal request fulfillment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeking the community&#8217;s feedback to make sure that our proposal takes all important considerations into account and to identify any potential improvements,&#8221; the Lido team details. &#8220;Your feedback is invaluable to create a proposal that is effective, efficient, and fair for all stakeholders.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts on Lido&#8217;s proposal for in-protocol withdrawal requests and the upcoming Shanghai hard fork? Do you think this feature will have a significant impact on the crypto and defi market? Share your opinions in the comments below.</strong></em></p>

This report also predicts the crypto trend in 2023.</p>
<p>According to the report, affected by factors such as the macro environment and bull-to-bear transition, the whole cryptocurrency industry became bearish in 2022. In particular, following the Terra meltdown in May, most cryptocurrency sectors were hit by the bearish impact. Below is the overview of each segment.<b></b></p>
<p><b>1. Bitcoin</b></p>
<p>In 2022, the overall performance of Bitcoin remained sluggish, with significant declines in price and trading volume compared to 2021. The price at the end of 2022 even fell below the peak of the last bull market. The price trend of Bitcoin throughout the year is obviously influenced by the pace of US interest rate hikes, but as the US interest rate hike policy continues to advance, its impact on the price of bitcoin is gradually diminished. Regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> mining, the network difficulty remained at a historic high. Meanwhile, the mining revenue plummeted, and miners have had to shut down their old models. Affected by multiple factors, the mining industry witnessed a strong crowding-out effect, which drove owners of small mining farms out of the market for various reasons. At the same time, long-established mining pools and mining farms managed to maintain a certain level of stability.</p>

<p><b>2. Ethereum</b></p>
<p>The primary statistics of Ethereum trended downward in 2022. In addition to the secondary market price and transaction volume, the on-chain data, including TVL, transaction cost, active address and burning volume also took a plunge. Despite that, the network did achieve a lot of progress in 2022. On September 15, Ethereum completed the historic transition from PoW to PoS. The Merge significantly cut the network&#x2019;s energy consumption and daily output, thereby reducing the dumping pressure from secondary markets. Meanwhile, Layer 2 projects such as Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and Starknet launched their mainnet either in whole or in part. Although their daily transaction volume was far less than Ethereum mainnet, the projects exceeded Ethereum in terms of the number of addresses. Moreover, their gas fee was generally 1/40 of that charged by Ethereum. At the same time, the network also saw an exponential increase in gas fees during 2022.</p>

<p><b>3. Stablecoins</b></p>
<p>The stablecoin market as a whole was stable in 2022. Specifically, throughout the year, the supply of stablecoins fell from $157 billion to $148 billion, a 6% drop. In this regard, the fall was not substantial. With respect to centralized stablecoins, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> maintained its dominance, while BUSD is growing rapidly on Binance&#x2019;s back. By contrast, algorithmic stablecoins were hit hard by the fall of LUNA, which shattered the faith in decentralized stablecoins and reduced trading volumes. As a result, there was a clear drop in the number of new decentralized stablecoins.</p>

<p><b>4. Public chains</b></p>
<p>Despite the rough market conditions in 2022, public chains remained a competitive sector. Due to the overflow of demand caused by the congestion of the Ethereum network, the new public chain with low fees maintained a bright performance before May. However, as various bad news brewed and fermented, a series of bankrupt occurred one after another. Many public chains were greatly impacted, and the decline was even worse than that of Ethereum. In May, Terra collapsed in only a few days, making it the first well-known public chain to fall. Furthermore, the Terra meltdown was also a signal that the market turned fully bearish. In November, hit by the fall of FTX and Alameda Research, Solana&#x2019;s token price and TVL took another plunge, and the projects within its ecosystem were also hurt. Other new chains such as Fantom and Avalanche were also struggling. At the same time, a number of new public chains, including Layer 2 projects like Arbitrum and Optimism and Meta-related chains such as Aptos and Sui, made their debut in 2022.</p>

<p><b>5. NFT</b></p>
<p>Last year, the NFT sector declined after its initial boom. In April, the market cap of the NFT reached $4.15 billion, a historic high; In May, driven by the boom of Otherside, a metaverse NFT collection developed by Yuga Labs, the trading volume of the sector hit a record high of $3.668 billion. But soon afterward, as the NFT market turned sluggish, the trading volume declined. Meanwhile, the price of blue-chip NFTs, as well as the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> price, plummeted, which both negatively affected the market. On the other hand, the number of NFT holders kept growing and reached a historic high in December.</p>

<p><b>6. DeFi</b></p>
<p>DeFi&#x2019;s TVL also trended downward in 2022. In particular, during the LUNA/UST meltdown in May, mainstream coins witnessed the most spectacular crash in the history of cryptocurrencies, which was followed by a TVL collapse. Additionally, over the year, DeFi also suffered frequent hacks, which raised security concerns for DeFi. In terms of innovation, although the first two quarters of 2022 saw trending hypes about DeFi 2.0 from time to time, along with the slump of OHM and the (3, 3) meme, DeFi 2.0 was almost proven to be a completely false narrative, and the market shifted its attention back to DeFi 1.0 infrastructure projects such as Uniswap, Aave, and MakerDAO. Despite the bearish conditions, mainstream DeFi projects including AAVE and Compound managed to maintain steady operations and attracted many new users from certain CeFi projects (e.g. Celsius and FTX).</p>

<p><b>7. SocialFi</b></p>
<p>In 2022, the blockchain industry continued to explore new possibilities for SocialFi. Over the year, we saw the appearance of iconic terms like Fan Token, Soulbound Token (SBT), Web3 Social, and Decentralized Identity (DID), but the PMF (Product- Market Fit) was never identified. Despite that, the SocialFi still managed to present us with a number of star projects, including Web3 lifestyle app STEPN featuring SocialFi elements, credential network Galxe, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain domain name service SPACE ID, social graph Lens Protocol, and Web3 gamified social learning platform Hooked Protocol. Apart from that, the 2022 Qatar World Cup also helped Fan Tokens attract extensive market attention. As a result, instead of plummeting due to the bearish impact, the Fan Tokens also performed slightly better in 2022 than in 2021.</p>

<p><b>8. GameFi</b></p>
<p>2022 was also the beginning of the GameFi bear. There was no significant innovation in P2E blockchain game model. As the growth of users and trading volumes dwindled, institutional investors looked away from the P2E model. In the first half of the year, the Move-2-Earn model created by STEPN captured the spotlight with its innovative dual tokenomics and marketing approach, bringing new dynamics to GameFi. Last year, blockchain projects raised the largest funds in April, with blockchain investments totalling $6.62 billion. However, the market didn&#x2019;t respond to other project teams focusing on the reality plus token model. As the multi-chain ecosystem gained growing popularity, Ethereum maintained its dominance in the GameFi ecosystem, but the growth rate of projects on Ethereum failed to match that of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain and Polygon. In addition, most chains relied heavily on their top projects, and there were still plenty of low-quality GameFi projects with a small user base, subpar interactions and low trading volumes.</p>

<p><b>9. Regulatory policies</b></p>
<p>Generally speaking, for the cryptocurrency industry, 2022 was full of ups and downs, but regulations are headed in the right direction. Over the past year, regulators in the developed world achieved a lot of progress. The United States released a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies; the European Union initially approved the MiCA Act and the TFR Act; the United Kingdom and South Korea made progress in the establishment of the relevant organizations; Russia and Hong Kong promoted the discussion and implementation of policies for cryptocurrency mining and virtual asset securities. The turbulence that happened in the cryptocurrency industry in 2022 was partially the result of the sharp drop in funds and partially the result of regulatory loopholes and crackdowns. Last year, the bankruptcy of Terra and FTX, two top cryptocurrency projects, prompted national regulators and law enforcement agencies to further enhance their cryptocurrency oversight and investigations.</p>

The plan would need to be approved by regulators, but if approved by the trustee and financial authorities, the debt token would be called an &#x201C;asset share token (AST).&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Celsius Proposes &#x2018;Asset Share Token&#x2019; as Plan to Repay Creditors, Subject to Regulatory Approval</h2>
<p>Various <a href="https://twitter.com/CelsiusFacts/status/1617919538628288515?s=20&t=H-Ww4ox0uHLS8DJuxJFWcA">reports</a>, including an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-24/celsius-may-issue-a-bankruptcy-crypto-token-to-repay-creditors?sref=323RPL5z&leadSource=uverify%20wall">editorial</a> about the subject published by Bloomberg on Jan. 24, reveal that Celsius lawyers have detailed that the bankrupt company would like to become a publicly traded recovery corporation that could issue a debt token in order to repay creditors.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/core-scientific-to-shut-down-37000-bitcoin-mining-rigs-belonging-to-bankrupt-crypto-lender-celsius/">Celsius</a> attorney Ross M. Kwasteniet, the plan and the new asset would be called an &#x201C;Asset Share Token&#x201D; (AST). More specifically, Celsius creditors who meet certain threshold requirements would be eligible to receive the AST. Reportedly, this is not the first time Celsius has thought about issuing an IOU token.</p>
<p>Executives allegedly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-leaked-audio-featuring-celsius-execs-uncovers-plans-to-create-an-iou-cryptocurrency/">floated the idea</a> to creditors back in September 2022. Leaked audio files summarizing a Celsius IOU token idea indicated that the IOU tokens would be similar to the AST concept. Tokens would essentially represent a ratio of what customers are owed and what the firm has left on its balance sheet.</p>
<p>The Asset Share Token (AST) won&#x2019;t give creditors full recovery and they would receive a haircut on what they are owed. According to Celsius attorney Ross M. Kwasteniet, while it may not be a complete recovery, the proposal would be beneficial to creditors looking for liquid assets. He mentioned that the AST would be readily tradable, similar to many of the crypto assets today.</p>

<h2>Bankruptcy Judge Approves Withdrawal Request</h2>
<p>The news follows New York Attorney General Letitia James <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-york-attorney-general-sues-celsius-co-founder-alex-mashinsky-for-crypto-fraud/">filing a lawsuit</a> against Alex Mashinsky, the co-founder and former CEO of Celsius, for allegedly misleading investors. The same day, the New York-based bankruptcy court ruled that Celsius <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-bankruptcy-court-rules-celsius-deposits-belong-to-the-firm/">owns the rights</a> to depositor funds.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#x2019;s <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/celsius/court-docket/">court filings</a> further show that Celsius has been approved to process a fraction of customer withdrawals. The bankruptcy court also gave Celsius <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174901242380000000158.pdf">permission</a> to distribute airdropped flare (FLR) tokens to customers who held <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>.</p>

The account posted a tweet promoting a Binance Smart Chain token listed on the Pancakeswap decentralized exchange. An analysis of the situation on the blockchain shows that the token received fewer than $1,000 in purchases before Robinhood removed the tweet.</strong></p>
<h2>Onchain Analysis Reveals Limited Impact of Scam Tweet Shared by Robinhood&#8217;s Twitter Account</h2>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon around 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time, Twitter users were <a href="https://twitter.com/innovation_maxi/status/1618296156211273730?s=20&amp;t=0oU-DwTbXKpEwpMy7Nlmtw">discussing</a> how Robinhood&#8217;s verified Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp">@Robinhoodapp</a>, which carries a gold checkmark, posted a scam tweet. Robinhood has since deleted the tweet, but it can be viewed via an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230125170216/https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp">archive.org snapshot</a> and the various screenshots being shared on Twitter.</p>
<p>The tweet read: &#8220;Reminder, we are launching our NEW TOKEN ($RBH) on the Binance Smart Chain. Will be live at 12 AM EST. You can be among the first to buy at a starting price of $0.0005.&#8221; The tweet, which originated from the @Robinhoodapp account, also included a link to the Pancakeswap platform, where the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token is listed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh my God,&#8221; one Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/imTkarmarkar/status/1618294052230926336?s=20&amp;t=0oU-DwTbXKpEwpMy7Nlmtw">wrote</a> on Wednesday. &#8220;Robinhood&#8217;s Twitter account has been hacked. They are posting links for a crypto giveaway sh**. Nobody is safe in this world,&#8221; the individual added. &#8220;Robinhood&#8217;s official Twitter account appears to have been hacked,&#8221; another account <a href="https://twitter.com/thetokenist/status/1618299935522422784?s=20&amp;t=0oU-DwTbXKpEwpMy7Nlmtw">remarked</a> on Twitter.</p>
<p>Conor Grogan, an employee at Coinbase who tweets about onchain movements as a hobby, also <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1618295142234091520?s=20&amp;t=wt9zeMkLyDZdFwUB-TnRpg">tweeted</a> about the scam. &#8220;Looks like Robinhood&#8217;s social media was hacked,&#8221; the onchain researcher noted on Twitter. &#8220;They only got ~10 people to bite on the scam token before the link was taken down.&#8221; Grogan added:</p>
<blockquote><p>So far the token has only seen [less than] $1000 in purchases. I imagine people crowding in now saw the volume spike and are looking for a thrill.</p></blockquote>

<p>The @Robinhoodapp Twitter account has not yet tweeted about the issue or confirmed whether or not the account was hacked. The account has a total of 1.1 million followers on the social media platform. This story is developing and may be updated at a later time.</p>

The tech giant&#x2019;s recent conference call was considered disappointing, and earnings from firms such as Boeing, Texas Instruments, and 3M were also lackluster. Gold and silver prices were down between 0.43% and 0.72% on Wednesday, and the cryptocurrency economy dropped 2.79% against the U.S. dollar in the past 24 hours.</strong></p>
<h2>Concerns of US Recession Mount as Corporate Earnings Disappoint</h2>
<p>After a couple of bullish weeks, stocks, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies were down on Jan. 25, 2023. As investors awaited the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/all-eyes-on-the-next-fed-meeting-market-trajectories-hinge-on-decision/">next</a> U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, the state of the U.S. economy showed a great deal of weakness. Earnings reports from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/24/microsoft-msft-earnings-q2-2023.html">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/earnings-2e5dab9775b1dbc17ac1987f7a956c79">Union Pacific</a>, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/texas-instruments-stock-rises-q4-144243565.html">Texas Instruments</a>, and others on Wednesday indicated that the economy was not improving and added to lingering concerns about a potential U.S. recession.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning into the afternoon, the four benchmark stock indexes the U.S. &#x2014; the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the S&P 500 (SPX), the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC), and the Russell 2000 (RUT) &#x2014; were all down between 1% and 2.05%. In addition to lackluster earnings reports from some of the country&#x2019;s largest firms, industrial production in the U.S. slipped roughly <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/current/default.htm">0.7% in December 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Industrial production also dropped in November 2022, falling 0.6% year-over-year. Another shocker was the fact that retail sales during the holiday season were also low in November and December 2022. Data indicates that retail sales slipped <a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/index.html">1.1% last month</a> and, while the holidays were in full effect, it was the largest drop of the year.</p>
<h2>Precious Metals and Crypto Assets Continue to Decline Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>
<p>Precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum all saw losses against the U.S. dollar in the last 24 hours as well. The <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">New York spot price</a> on Jan. 25, 2023, indicates that gold is trading for $1,931.70 per troy ounce, down 0.43%. An ounce of silver is down 0.72% and trading for $23.59 per unit on Wednesday at 11 a.m. Eastern Time. Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, says that escalating tensions in Ukraine, low corporate earnings, and recession fears are plaguing investors.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The market is definitely worried about slowing earnings growth, especially in tech, so there has been a sense the market wants to keep selling tech and the dollar,&#x201D; Broux <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/futures-slide-ugly-microsoft-outlook-renewed-war-escalation-fears">remarked</a> on Wednesday. &#x201C;But a huge tail risk now is what happens in Ukraine, if there is an escalation in the conflict and Europe gets drawn into the conflict,&#x201D; the strategist added.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency economy is hovering just above the $1 trillion mark at $1,019,712,653,474, according to Wednesday&#x2019;s recorded metrics. Crypto markets are down 2.79% as a whole, and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> has shed 1.49% on Wednesday. The second-leading cryptocurrency, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a>, has lost even more, with 4.66% erased from its value since Tuesday.</p>

<p>Global cryptocurrency trade volumes were above the $100 billion region per day not too long ago, but today, global trade volume is around $55.98 billion across the entire cryptocurrency economy. Despite the pullback on Wednesday, precious metals, equities, and cryptocurrency assets are still doing much better than they were last month. By 11:30 a.m. (ET) on Wednesday, gold increased against the U.S. dollar but is still down 0.2% and silver rose as well and is currently up 0.13%.</p>

The move saw prices drop by over 5%, edging closer towards a key price floor in the process. Polygon also extended recent declines, hitting its weakest point since January 19.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped to a five-day low on Wednesday, as the global cryptocurrency market cap fell by as much as 3% today.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.08919, DOGE/USD fell to an intraday low of $0.08245 earlier today.</p>
<p>The move saw dogecoin hit its lowest point since January 20, which is the last time prices were trading at a floor of $0.080.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, the decline took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) collided with a support level of its own at 55.00.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average has now shifted its direction, and appears to be on course for a downward trend.</p>
<p>Should this take place, and result in a crossover with the 25-day (blue) moving average, then DOGE will likely be trading below $0.080.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) was also in the red on hump day, with the token moving lower for a third consecutive day.</p>
<p>MATIC/USD fell below the $1.00 mark in today’s session, as prices slipped to a low of $0.938 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Similar to dogecoin, today’s decline has pushed polygon to its weakest point since last Thursday, when prices were trading at a floor of $0.940.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, price strength also edged lower, with the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a floor of 58.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is now tracking at 55.96, with a floor of 53.00 the next possible target for bears.</p>
<p>Bulls have so far rejected this advance, with MATIC rebounding from earlier lows, currently sitting at $0.9588, at the time of writing.</p>

The accidentally revealed documentation shows that Blockfi’s exposure to the bankrupt crypto firm FTX was more than what the company had previously disclosed.</strong></p>
<h2>Unredacted Documents Reveal Blockfi&#8217;s $1.2 Billion Exposure to FTX, Alameda Research</h2>
<p>It seems that Blockfi had a lot more money tied up with FTX and Alameda Research than what was originally suggested by the firm. A CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/24/blockfi-secret-financials-show-1point2-billion-tie-to-ftx-and-alameda.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard">report</a> indicates that unredacted documents were mistakenly sent to the bankruptcy court, revealing that Blockfi had $415.9 million connected to FTX, and roughly $831.3 million in loans to Alameda Research.</p>
<p>The latest Blockfi filing shows that $1.2 billion is allegedly tied up with both FTX and Alameda, both of which have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. When Blockfi&#8217;s bankruptcy case started in New Jersey, lawyers originally <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/29/blockfi-lawyer-tells-court-priority-is-to-maximize-client-recoveries.html">quoted</a> the loans to Alameda as being around $671 million, and another $355 million was said to be locked on the FTX exchange. Blockfi <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blockfi-pauses-customers-withdrawals-cites-lack-of-clarity-on-ftxs-status-as-cause/">paused</a> withdrawals on Nov. 10, 2022, one day before FTX filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>Two days before the pause, Blockfi co-founder Flori Marquez <a href="https://twitter.com/FounderFlori/status/1590030310787657729?s=20&amp;t=fSJs_vJc5GgIl_xLDfbYGw">told</a> the crypto community that &#8220;Blockfi is an independent business entity&#8221; amid the FTX drama. She further noted that Blockfi had a &#8220;$400 million line of credit from [FTX US] (not FTX.com) and will remain an independent entity until at least July 2023.&#8221; Less than a month later, Blockfi <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-lender-blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-to-maximize-value-for-all-clients/">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the state of New Jersey.</p>
<p>CNBC further reports that Blockfi has 125 staff members still on Blockfi&#8217;s payroll and a total of $11.9 million will be collected on an annualized basis. Furthermore, five top Blockfi executives are still earning $822,000 for the year, according to a presentation designed by M3 Partners. CNBC&#8217;s MacKenzie Sigalos reached out to Blockfi, but the company &#8220;did not respond to a request for comment.&#8221;</p>

After days of uncertainty, sentiment shifted in crypto markets, with a red wave washing away recent bulls. Bitcoin also dropped below $23,000 as a result of today&#x2019;s sell-off.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) fell below the $23,000 level on Wednesday, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets.</p>
<p>Following a high of $23,048.18 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD hit an intraday low of $22,406.08 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s drop in price, bitcoin fell to its weakest point since Sunday, breaking out of a floor at $22,500 in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the drop came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell to its lowest level since last Thursday.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a level of 79.93, which comes less than 24 hours after hovering at 85.09.</p>
<p>Since its earlier breakout, the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency has somewhat rebounded, and is currently trading at $22,614.62.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Sentiment in ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also shifted on Wednesday, with prices falling below a recent support point at $1,600.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,530.80 on Wednesday, following a peak of $1,630.47 during Tuesday&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Since breaking out of its $1,600 floor, ethereum appears to be heading towards a lower level of support at $1,500.</p>

<p>Like with bitcoin, today&#x2019;s red wave comes as bears have finally opted to reenter the market, as a result of prices being overbought.</p>
<p>Ethereum&#x2019;s 14-day RSI is currently sitting at 61.07, which is its lowest point since January 8, and this comes a day after breaking out of a floor at 74.00.</p>
<p>There appears to be an upcoming support area at 58.00, and if this remains firm, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> could manage to stay above $1,500.</p>

Lula Da Silva clarified that he believed this currency would be used to settle cross-border payments between the two countries and also countries from BRICS and Mercosur.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Lula Clarifies Latam Common Currency Intention</h2>
<p>Luis Inacio Lula Da Silva, president of Brazil, has clarified the facts surrounding the intention that Argentina and Brazil have of creating a Latam common currency, that would be later extended to all of Latam. Upon his arrival in Buenos Aires for the CELAC summit of chiefs of state, Lula explained that the discussion would circle around the launch of a currency for multilateral settlements amongst countries of different integration groups, including <a href="https://infobrics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRICS</a> and <a href="https://www.mercosur.int/en/about-mercosur/mercosur-in-brief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercosur</a>.</p>
<p>Lula Da Silva <a href="https://www.elmundo.es/economia/macroeconomia/2023/01/23/63ced5f021efa0e06b8b4590.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why not create a common currency with the Mercosur countries, with the BRICS countries? I think that is what is going to happen. You can establish a type of currency for trade that the central bank sets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lula also stated that he would prefer international trading transactions to be always settled in currencies native to their countries to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Fernando Haddad, minister of economy of Brazil, offered more insight into the objectives of the two countries, <a href="https://www.infobae.com/economia/2023/01/23/moneda-comun-como-piensa-el-gobierno-de-brasil-una-eventual-union-monetaria-con-la-argentina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explaining</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trade is very bad and the problem is precisely the foreign currency, right? So we are trying to find a solution, something in common that can grow the trade.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">More Details</h2>
<p>President of Argentina Alberto Fernandez also referred to the hypothetical currency in the same terms that Lula did. Fernandez clarified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The truth is that we don&#8217;t know how a common currency between Argentina and Brazil works, nor do we know how a common currency will work in the region. But what we do know is how the economy works with foreign currencies to trade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The joint statements of Fernandez and Lula Da Silva went against the expectations that some had on the retail and widespread character that this currency would have, fueled by the statements that the minister of economy of Argentina, Sergio Massa, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-and-argentina-to-start-working-on-creation-of-latam-common-currency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered</a> Financial Times.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://valor.globo.com/brasil/noticia/2023/01/23/memorando-de-moeda-comum-com-argentina-tem-clausula-contra-fim-do-real.ghtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> from O&#8217;Globo explain that a common currency memorandum to be signed by the two governments includes a clause to protect the fiat currencies of each country, the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso, from being substituted by this settlement-focused currency.</p>
