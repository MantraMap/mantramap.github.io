<ul>
<li>The price of Solana (SOL) has risen by more than 14% in the last 24 hours</li>
<li>SOL was trading at $11.77 at the time of writing</li>
<li>Solana ranks 16th largest cryptocurrency</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">CoinMarketCap</a> data, the price of the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) has risen by more than 14% in the last 24 hours. In a New Year&#8217;s price pump, the crypto asset reclaimed $11 following several days of trading below double digits. SOL was trading at $11.77 at the time of this writing. The increase comes after Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted in the past week that <em>&#8220;smart people&#8221;</em> told him there is an <em>&#8220;earnest smart developer community in Solana&#8221;</em> and that the chain has a <em>&#8220;bright future.&#8221;</em> Buterin also expressed his desire that the Solana community <em>&#8220;gets a fair chance to thrive.&#8221;</em> However, Solana&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s pump hasn&#8217;t stopped the battering the would-be <em>&#8220;Ethereum killer&#8221;</em> has taken in recent months. The SOL token is down nearly 20% since the previous month and has shed over 95% of its value since reaching a peak of nearly $260 in November 2021. Solana ranks as the 16th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $4.18 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $26.00, $20.00, $12.00<br />Support Levels: $8.00, $6.00, $4.00</p>
<h4>SOL/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p>SOL rises today following a 24-hour bounce at $9.81 and a three-day positive streak. On the daily timeframe, the fall to lows of $7.96 on Dec 29 paved the way for a positive structure. The RSI is rising towards a neutral level of 50. If the bulls maintain control, the price is poised to breach the $12.10 barrier before reaching the MA 50 at $13.88.<br /><br />After clearing this significant barrier, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/sol-price-analysis-solana-posts-3-gain-in-recent-hours-chipotle-mexican-grill-announces-solana-giveaway/">SOL/USD</a> pair may target the $20.00 level before advancing to the $26.00 level and the $38.78 all-time high set in November. Otherwise, a drop below the $9.81 low might push the bears toward the $5.0 critical level, where the bulls might re-attempt its upward trend.</p>
<h4>SOL/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63787 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SOLUSD-4-Hour-Jan-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SOLUSD-4-Hour-Jan-3.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SOLUSD-4-Hour-Jan-3-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SOLUSD-4-Hour-Jan-3-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SOLUSD-4-Hour-Jan-3-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SOLUSD-4-Hour-Jan-3-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SOLUSD-4-Hour-Jan-3-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">SOL/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>SOL&#8217;s price movement has so far rallied off lows of $7.96 and past the moving average (MA 50) at $10.40, but investors will need more before committing again. Buyers face early resistance from the $12.10 handle, which coincides with the MA 200, after breaking through the $11.50 handle. If this significant boundary is crossed, the SOL/USD pair may aim for the $20.00 level before resuming its descent toward the $8.00 level.<br /><br />If buyers win more ground, the bulls may revisit the $35.50 resistance zone. If sellers re-emerge and drive the price down, the MA 50 around $15.00 could provide early limits ahead of the $8.00 low. To summarize, SOL/USD looks to be neutrally biased between $8.00 and $12.00.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Santiment, an on-chain analytics firm, predicts that something big might be brewing for the XRP price. The year 2022 was a rough one for cryptocurrencies, in which most digital assets including XRP underperformed.</p>
<p>With 2023 upon us, some crypto enthusiasts are looking out for XRP price action.</p>
<h2>Here Are Five Positive Catalysts</h2>
<p>According to a Santiment community post, for the last six months, the price of XRP has generally fluctuated between $0.28 and $0.54. It has also been declining since 2021, however, this is part of a bigger ascending trend that might potentially complete a triangle formation.</p>
<p>The price is currently at the bottom of this triangle, which some investors may perceive as a favorable chance with both low risk and great gain.<br /><br />Second, the group of XRP holders who own between 1 million and 10 million XRP has added to their holdings by 25% over the last six months, bringing the total to 4.09 billion XRP. At market bottoms, this degree of accumulation is common. <br /><br />Furthermore, with the exception of the FUD event in December 2020, this group of holders normally has a substantial influence on the price of XRP.<br /><br />Third, Binance&#8217;s funding rate for XRP is currently slightly negative, indicating a bearish sentiment among traders. However, it is vital to highlight that ordinary traders on Binance may not be able to precisely predict an asset&#8217;s short-term price changes.<br /><br />Fourth, short-term traders are currently facing average losses of -7%, according to the MVRV 30-day for XRP, which evaluates their profit or loss. As a result, they may be hesitant to sell their coins at a loss, thus causing the price of XRP to rise.<br /><br />Last, if the MVRV Long/Short difference (the difference between the average profit or loss of long-term holders and short-term holdings) is heading upward while the price remains largely sideways, it could signal that long-term holders are getting more confident and increasing their positions. <br /><br />Long-term holders are frequently perceived as &#8220;steady&#8221; investors who are less inclined to sell their investments based on short-term price swings, which could contribute to an increase in price in the future. This has been the case with XRP in recent months.<br /><br />After evaluating XRP using numerous metrics and technical analyses, Santiment analysts conclude that investing in XRP is similar to playing roulette. The price has been pretty stagnant for the past six months, and most retail traders on Binance seem bearish on XRP.<br /><br />Long-term investors are optimistic, while short-term traders may be afraid to sell, so who knows what will happen? Maybe XRP will be the next big thing, or maybe it will fail miserably.</p>

<p><a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano">Cardano</a>&#8216;s decentralized finances were not the most robust component of the ecosystem, since it only started supplying convenient decentralized solutions in the second half of last year. This tendency was linked to the <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano">network</a>&#8216;s core technology of transaction bookkeeping. However, things could change dramatically in 2023. <br /><br />The network&#8217;s current TVL is $50 million, a substantial decrease from the ATH reached in 2022 when the overall value of assets on the network remained at $350 million. Given the scarcity of decentralized solutions in the Cardano ecosystem, such a large number is remarkable.<br /><br />The Cardano network will issue a slew of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/stablecoin-the-most-stable-valued-decentralised-cryptocurrency-usdt-audt-usdc-dai/">algorithmic stablecoins</a> in the new year, which should provide considerably more value to the network than decentralized exchanges or yield farming platforms, given the convenience, they bring to networks and DeFi.<br /><br />If the market recovers in 2023, Cardano&#8217;s TVL might hit new highs, significantly surpassing the relatively modest $350 million seen in 2022. <br /><br />In comparison, Solana&#8217;s TVL crossed the $1 billion barrier in July 2021 and reached the network&#8217;s greatest value of locked funds in November, surpassing the $10 billion mark.<br /><br />The present quantity of locked funds is not going to propel Cardano as an ecosystem to new heights, which is why developers are betting big on the DeFi sector as one of the most important and easiest ways to bring new cash to the network. <br /><br />At the time of writing, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ada-price-analysis-how-will-impressive-2022-development-in-cardano-blockchain-impact-price-going-forward/">ADA</a> is battling on the market, with a continuous slump despite the favorable end of 2022 and beginning of 2023. The lack of inflows into the cryptocurrency market, as well as the impasse in the DeFi and NFT industries, contributed to the decline of ADA in 2022 and will continue to be the coin&#8217;s main source of pressure in 2023.</p>

<p>The Dogecoin Foundation has<a href="https://foundation.dogecoin.com/announcements/2022-12-31-corefund/"> announced</a> a new fund for Dogecoin Core developers to better promote the Dogecoin ecosystem in the coming year. The foundation announced on December 31 that it is contributing 5 million Dogecoin, which is approximately $360,000 at the time of writing, to the new fund to assist in the development of the Dogecoin platform.<br /><br />The money, according to the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/doge-developers-publish-roadmap-for-the-first-time-in-tokens-history/"> Dogecoin foundation</a>, will be housed in a new multi-signature wallet administered by its members and will require three of five signatures from Dogecoin Core developers chromatic, Marshall Hayner, Michi Lumin, Patrick Lodder, and Ross Nicoll. Apart from supervising the release, these custodians will have no rights to the funds. The team wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The DOGE held in this wallet will disburse rewards to developers of Dogecoin Core for work on all contributions, no matter how big or small.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For each Dogecoin Core release, 500,000 DOGE will be distributed to developers that contributed to the release. To ensure openness, the team disclosed the wallet address where the funds are stored. The Dogecoin core team will also create blog posts for all expenditures, which will be publicized by the custodians via social media networks.<br /><br />Similarly, Dogecoin developers recently dismissed speculations that the network might switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism right away. The developers stressed that they simply want to issue a proposal on the subject. One of the developers, Lumin, chastised influencers who spread the notion and stated that they do not have the <em>&#8220;inside scoop&#8221;</em> on Dogecoin.<br /><br />On September 16, Dogecoin overtook Bitcoin as the second-largest proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency. After the Ethereum network moved to PoS consensus, the update was released. Some feel that Bitcoin&#8217;s proof-of-work consensus should be justified in light of the current development.<br /><br />Image Credit: Shutterstock</p>

<li>Ethereum (ETH) is marginally up in the last 24 hours at $1200</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-trading-at-this-juncture-implies-one-thing-this-is-what-on-chain-data-says/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> is marginally up in the last 24 hours at $1200, according to CoinMarketCap data. In a blog post, the Ethereum team says there is a lot around the corner for 2023. It says it is actively working on an implementation of sharding, which is EIP-4844, or <em>&#8220;Shard Blob Transactions,&#8221;</em> to be more precise. It highlights a merge of the EIP-4895 <em>&#8220;Beacon Chain Withdrawals&#8221;</em> code, with plans to complete the five Ethereum Object Format (EOF) EIPs that are being considered for mainnet by building on top of the initial EIP-3540 implementation. This would enable the joining of an early EOF-focused testnet, which is likely in January 2023. The team also says it will continue working on in 2023, but not limited to, first, the Scheduled and tentative protocol upgrades. Second, withdrawals functionality as this feature will enable stakers to withdraw their balances from the beacon chain to their execution layer accounts. The consensus-layer core specs are nearing completion, and client teams are actively implementing and testing the functionality. Then comes EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding. The much anticipated Shanghai hard fork is already semi-scheduled, although the exact contents are still a bit debated.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-ethereum-7-day-exchange-outflow-volume-drops-to-lowest-in-two-years-will-this-impact-price/">ETH/USD</a> pair remains in extended consolidation at the year&#8217;s close and in red as it continues to face headwinds around the $1,200 barrier. The pair&#8217;s action has failed to break higher in three consecutive attempts. While the price remains above $1,100, the expected rebound stance may be maintained.<br /><br />Technical studies on the daily chart show rising positive momentum on the relative strength index (RSI) while the moving average (MA 50 and 200) struggles to exit its bearish setup, underpinning the action. The pair&#8217;s ranging conditions may reduce the pace and keep the pair in extended consolidation.</p>

<p>Ethereum continues to trade within a narrow range for the umpteenth time, with the psychological $1,200 level offering solid support and keeping the downside protected for now, while the upside attempts have repeatedly struggled to register a daily close above the 4-hour moving average (MA 50).<br /><br />The end-of-year-thinned markets and lack of news keep the pair in a quiet mode, as mixed daily analysis adds to a directionless near-term mode. Following strong rejection at the MA 50, the pair is on track for a monthly close in a bearish candle, generating an initial signal that its consolidation and recovery rally may be stalling.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin is trading marginally up in the last 24 hours at $16,555</li>
<li>Shark and whale addresses holding 10 to 10,000 BTC have dumped a collective $10.75 billion worth</li>
<li>MicroStrategy stated it bought nearly 2,395 Bitcoin at about $42.8 million</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-is-down-63-in-2022-here-is-how-ethereum-solana-cardano-dogecoin-fared-these-are-predictions-for-2023/">Bitcoin</a> is trading marginally higher in the last 24 hours at $16,555. The leading crypto asset is down 3.6% in the last 30 days and 64.9% year to date. BTC’s decline this year puts it on pace for one of its worst annual stretches on record. According to Santiment, two weeks before Bitcoin&#8217;s all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, shark and whale addresses holding 10 to 10,000 BTC dumped a total of $10.75 billion. Per Santiment, this drop, combined with circulation drying up, has led to a sputtering end to 2022. It observes that such returns are reminiscent of the 2018 bear market, which followed a late-2017 Bitcoin rally to an all-time high of $19,800 and saw dip buyers pay dearly as prices fell the following year. The 3.6% decline recorded in December reflected the continued collapse seen throughout the year. In a recent filing, MicroStrategy stated it bought nearly 2,395 bitcoins for about $42.8 million between the start of November and Dec. 21 through its MacroStrategy subsidiary. It then sold 704 of the tokens on Dec. 22 for nearly $11.8 million, citing tax purposes, before buying 810 BTC two days later.</p>
<p><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $20,000, $18,500, $17,500<br />Support Levels: $15,500, $13,000, $11,000</p>
<h4>BTC/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63762 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">BTC/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>A U-turn from the sell-off point around $25,214 in mid-August was unsettling to see on the daily chart. The decline brought the pair to $15,460 in November. From this point, another rally took place where <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-btc-usd-is-at-bottom-of-current-cycle-as-large-scale-bitcoin-liquidations-end/">BTC/USD</a> struggled to reach another high point of $18,385 in December, which means the pair may be open to fresh selling. <br /><br />A persistent bear market would start if $15,500 was broken, which would confirm a dead cat bounce. Therefore, buyers could turn the situation around at $11,000, but the first barrier remains at $18,500 and $20,000, a crucial level to raise and overcome in the journey higher. This means that Bitcoin is at a critical level as a deeper fall might occur.</p>
<h4>BTC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p>Bitcoin attempted a recovery wave above the $17,500 resistance against the US dollar. BTC/USD even climbed above the $18,000 resistance zone. Looking at the 4-hour chart, the pair struggled to clear a major resistance zone near the $18,300 level. The pair formed a high near $18,385 and started a decline in mid-December.<br /><br />Earlier, there was a move below the $15,500 support zone. The pair even spiked below the level before starting an upward move from the $15,460 swing low to the $18,385 high. It is now trading well below the $17,000 level, the moving average (MA 50), and the moving average (MA 200). Any more losses might open the doors for a move toward the $13,000 support zone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The crypto market has had a particularly turbulent year, with several decentralized and centralized firms failing or trying to stay afloat. <br /><br />It appears that we are nearing the end of the bear market, with bad individuals and practices being cleansed in a dramatic and necessary process for the overall system&#8217;s maturation. <br /><br />Regardless, the Web3 innovations that emerge from this crypto winter will revolutionize the world. Following the events of 2022, the year 2023 is offered with a mixed perspective. Rather, the forecasts are mixed.</p>
<h2>Here Are Five Predictions</h2>
<p>1. Mark Connors, head of research for Canadian crypto asset manager, said he expects a price rebound in 2023 and TradFi businesses, among others, to take a more active role not just in finding applications for blockchain technology, but also in regulatory development.&#8221;Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side,&#8221; Alex Connors predicts.<br /><br />2. Second, 2023 will be a watershed moment for digital assets. It will be the fundamental Layer 1s, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and TradFi firms using NFTs. In 2022, the ecosystem consisted of alt-level coins such as Solana, Algorand, and others supplying the majority of the non-Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoin market cap.<br /><br />3. According to Connors, the Fed might stop quantitative tightening before the third quarter. They will halt because the Treasury market might fail as it did in September 2019. Money markets will crash, the Fed will print, and cryptocurrency will fall as precipitously as it did in March 2020. As a market, we&#8217;re still in our infancy. We do not control our own fate based on pricing and adoption.<br /><br />4. Fourth, stablecoins will find additional uses outside of crypto capital markets, resulting in greater mainstream adoption — particularly among enterprises — and innovation inside Web3. Governments and private blockchain developers will continue to do research and development, with some announcing centralized public infrastructure such as central bank digital currencies or marketplace infrastructure.<br /><br />5. While cryptocurrency venture capital funding will continue to fall through the first half of 2023, this is not necessarily a bad thing; rather, it is normalizing to a rational level. Investors don&#8217;t want to catch a falling knife, so they&#8217;re waiting for a bottom while also considering broader macroeconomic issues and the potential of a worldwide recession.<br /><br />At the same time, new settlements (layer 1s/2s), interoperability (layer 0/bridge), lending, and trading protocols will be funded to fill the void left by previous hacks, treasury shortfalls, regulatory changes, and exchange collapses.<br /><br /><strong>Overall, Web 3 will continue to grow</strong><br />&#8220;Larger macroeconomic downturn market conditions should hopefully drive crypto initiatives away from speculation and more towards utility &#8211; one big utility category just being meaningful, entertaining, social interactions,&#8221; Alex Zhang, the de facto leader of Friends with Benefits DAO, predicts. <br /><br />He anticipates growth in &#8220;interoperable identity, on-chain social graphs, and crypto-abstracted social experiences,&#8221; as well as &#8220;more meaningful Web3 social platforms and protocols.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 2022, cryptocurrencies experienced a tough year defined by industry failures and plummeting prices. The price decline began in late 2021. <br /><br />That&#8217;s when inflation rates began to rise, raising fears that the Federal Reserve might raise borrowing costs when the calendar flipped. Bitcoin fell 19% in December as investors shifted into assets deemed safer in an uncertain economy.<br /><br />The sell-off continued in January, with Bitcoin down 17% and Ethereum down 26%. The crypto winter did not arrive for several months. Markets even temporarily stabilized. Then, in May, stablecoins were formally declared unstable. A stablecoin is a sort of digital currency that is pegged to the US dollar one-to-one.<br /><br />When TerraUSD or UST fell below $1 and its sister token, LUNA tumbled, a different kind of fear ensued. The peg had gone. Confidence vanished. The fall of LUNA took the loss of more than $40 billion in wealth. Suddenly, it appeared that nothing in crypto was safe.<br /><br />The major cryptocurrencies plummeted, with bitcoin falling 16% in a single week, down by more than half from its peak six months earlier. On the macroeconomic front, inflation showed no signs of abating, and the central bank remained committed to raising rates to the extent necessary to halt the rise in consumer prices. The bottom fell out in June.<br /><br />Because of &#8220;extreme market conditions,&#8221; lending platform Celsius halted withdrawals. BlockFi, a crypto lender, also cut 20% of its personnel after more than quintupling since the end of 2020.<br /><br />Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, a prominent crypto hedge fund, defaulted on a debt worth more than $670 million, and FTX negotiated an agreement allowing it to buy BlockFi at a fraction of the company&#8217;s latest private valuation.<br /><br />In June, Bitcoin experienced its worst month on record, shedding about 38% of its value. Ethereum fell by more than 40%. Then there were the bankruptcies.<br /><br />3AC, based in Singapore, declared bankruptcy in July, just months after revealing that the company had $10 billion in assets.<br /><br />The firm&#8217;s risky strategy entailed borrowing money from throughout the industry and then investing it in other, typically fledgling, crypto businesses.<br /><br />Following the demise of 3AC, crypto brokerage Voyager Digital was not far behind. This is due to 3AC&#8217;s significant default on a Voyager loan.<br /><br />Celsius was the next to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in mid-July. Customers were being paid up to 17% interest to hold their cryptocurrency on the platform. It would lend those assets to counterparties prepared to pay exorbitant interest rates. <br /><br />As liquidity ran out, the framework crumbled. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried was portraying himself as an industry savior. Then came the most calamitous tumble: FTX&#8217;s precipitous fall in November, following Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s statement that his company was selling its FTT tokens, the native currency of FTX.</p>
<h2>83 Billion SHIB Burned While 572,000 BTC Left Exchanges</h2>
<p>83 billion Shiba Inu tokens were burned in 2022, according to SHIB Burn Tracker. This amount is comparable to $1.74 million at an annual arithmetic average SHIB price of $0.000021. Furthermore, at the start of the year, 83 billion SHIB represented 0.014% of the total token supply.<br /><br />According to a crypto analyst, Lark Davis, 572,000 bitcoin left exchanges in 2022. Only 11% of the total supply is left on exchanges, about 2.1 million coins.</p>

<p>According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, 2022 was arguably the most visible year in terms of crypto markets being influenced by news events.<br /><br />Santiment observes that as the year ends, traders are monitoring four major news events: the pandemic, second is the FTX collapse, and the arraignment of its cofounder, Sam Bankman-Fried. The third issue at hand has to do with getting clues on the Fed’s interest rate hikes to come in 2023. Then last is the Russia-Ukraine War news.<br /><br />Santiment predicts that as FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and doubt) eases on these four issues, prices might likely rise.</p>
<h2>2023 Predictions for Bitcoin, Ethereum, MANA, Enjin Coin, Augur</h2>
<p>Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation, comments on a Bitcoin conference held in Ghana. “I was blown away,” says Gladstein. “They’re all just building on bitcoin. <br /><br />It’s legitimately amazing,” he says, which is why he believes that “global adoption might probably be the number one story for 2023.”<br /><br />Analyst Michael van de Poppe predicts a target of $38,500 for Bitcoin. Coin bureau analyst ‘’Guy’’ rather doesn&#8217;t make a price prediction for Ethereum and believes that a flippening could happen and ETH might reach five digits. On the other hand, He believes that the cryptocurrency might trade sideways next year.<br /><br />According to Santiment, Quant, Decentraland, and Enjin are among the largest market cap assets that saw significant amounts of coins leaving exchanges in 2022. Though their respective prices are down big, as is the rest of crypto, it highlights that these are good signs for a better 2023.<br /><br />There is also a stable growth of daily active addresses for Augur (REP). Santiment analysts predict that a downward trend in the value of the token might be reversed and the reversal to growth will begin.<br /><br /><strong>Is the contagion over?</strong><br />&#8220;The contagion is far from done,&#8221; says Cas Piancey, co-host of the &#8220;Crypto Critics&#8217; Corner&#8221; podcast. Piancey believes that &#8220;businesses, banks, and funds are urgently hoping the market gets past the FTX and Alameda collapse or simply concentrates on their misconduct,&#8221; but whether individuals like it or not, &#8220;you can&#8217;t wish away a credit crunch and exposure to problematic counterparties.<br /><br />We will see the closure of funds and the failure of companies that we did not predict, largely because the contagion is too vast and too difficult for us all to estimate.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Harsh crypto regulation will be presented, and the community will wage an epic battle to combat the aspects of it that endanger decentralization,&#8221; says Laura Shin, host of the “Unchained” podcast.<br /><br />On the other hand, Santiment believes Bitcoin&#8217;s ranging prices have a lot to do with declining whale interest. If prices continue sliding and a spike in Whale interest occurs, this might be a historically bullish signal.</p>

<p>The crypto exchange revealed in its latest <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/141143">Binance Build update</a> that the platform had integrated the two payment systems.<br /><br />The Binance team confirmed on <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1608523244323147778">Twitter</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Apple Pay and Google Pay payment options are now available on Binance! Purchase crypto, with ease.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Customers can now purchase<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/50925-2/"> Bitcoins</a> using either Apple Pay or Google Pay. The upgrade has already been implemented, and preliminary feedback indicates that the new capability is functional.<br /><br />This strategy would be beneficial in attracting more clients to Binance, especially given Apple Pay&#8217;s 44 million and Google Pay&#8217;s 25 million user bases. Both of these payment platforms are the most popular in the world, with the first and second-most users, respectively. <br /><br />The move to embrace these two payment systems will make Binance and cryptocurrencies in general more accessible to a large number of potential customers. This update has the potential to bring in the newest crypto customers for Binance and the rest of the crypto sector. However, the truth remains that these two payment options are not available in every country. It remains to be seen how Binance will do.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-receives-clean-bill-of-health-from-cryptoquant/">Binance</a> is hardly the first cryptocurrency company to accept more mainstream payment methods. Apple Pay has been embraced by various cryptocurrency platforms, such as MetaMask. In March 2022, this crypto wallet, which is the main method of interacting with the Ethereum blockchain (DeFi, Web3 dApps, NFTs), integrated Apple Pay into its platform. Klever, another cryptocurrency wallet, implemented Apple Pay support in April 2021 to provide consumers with a more convenient payment alternative.<br /><br />The cryptocurrency exchange has recently made headlines after it was revealed that Binance.US intended to acquire Voyager Digital assets. The cryptocurrency exchange made a $1 billion bid and was successful in acquiring the Voyager assets just a few weeks ago.<br /><br />Binance had also temporarily halted USDC stablecoin withdrawals, causing some market-wide concern in mid-December. The stated reason for the pause was a lack of USDC reserves, which required a BUSD to USDC swap before the service could restart as usual.</p>
