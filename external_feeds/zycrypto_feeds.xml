<p>Amidst all the twists and turns in Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC), the XRP price recently plunged to where it was before the landmark ruling by Analisa Torres in July 2023.</p>



<p>CryptoLaw founder John Deaton, who is an XRP holders&#8217; attorney, wondered whether XRP would have been in a much better position if the lawsuit was not <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">instigated </a>by the SEC against Ripple and two of its top executives in 2020. He explained that the case definitely had a detrimental effect on XRP and development related to the XRP Ledger.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-immeasurable-damage-to-xrp"><strong>The Immeasurable Damage To XRP</strong></h2>



<p>In December 2020, the SEC initiated a complaint against Ripple, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Chris Larsen, alleging failure to register its token XRP as a security before selling around $1.3 billion worth.</p>



<p>Ripple, however, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">secured a partial victory</a> in the case in July when the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York proclaimed that the sale of its XRP token on exchanges and via algorithms did not constitute investment contracts — this was considered a milestone win for the crypto industry. While the ruling was a reassuring development for XRP holders, there is no doubt that XRP had already endured huge setbacks due to the suit.</p>



<p>In his latest X <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1693798238606811308">post</a>, XRP attorney John E. Deaton observed that the SEC spat hurt not only Ripple but also XRP. Deaton claimed the litigation had cost XRP three whopping years of adoption. In crypto, three years is a long time since that period saw noteworthy advances, innovations, and a parabolic bull rally.</p>



<p>The legal expert highlighted how Coinbase was a big proponent of XRP before the lawsuit forced the exchange to delist the token. In fact, Deaton disclosed that he doubled down on his XRP stash after Coinbase added XRP trading and boosted XRP&#8217;s utility.</p>



<p>Deaton recalled that Coinbase did its due diligence and even contacted the SEC to confirm the legal status of XRP before listing it. During a meeting in January 2019, Coinbase told the SEC that it assessed XRP based on its rigid framework for crypto assets, the same framework a top executive at the regulatory agency had publicly praised Coinbase for.</p>



<p>Deaton opined that the attorneys for “MoneyGram also determined, just like Coinbase’s lawyers, and just like the SEC enforcement lawyers in June 2018, that XRP was NOT a security.” However, despite all the steps Ripple partners took, SEC launched the suit against the San Franscisco-based fintech firm.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-would-coinbase-have-invested-in-ripple"><strong>Would Coinbase Have Invested In Ripple?</strong></h2>



<p>Just yesterday, Coinbase and stablecoin operator Circle <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/ushering-in-the-next-chapter-for-usdc">announced </a>they were expanding the USDC stablecoin networks. As part of the move, Coinbase acquired a minority stake in Circle and will be working to “unlock additional utilities and grow the USDC ecosystem.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You could NEVER underestimate the damage the SEC’s lawsuit has caused  &#8211; NOT ONLY AGAINST RIPPLE &#8211; BUT <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XRP</a>. THREE YEARS OF ADOPTION &#8211; that’s what it’s caused. <br><br>Just how long is 3 yrs &#8211; in crypto years? <br><br>People seem to forget how much Coinbase promoted <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XRP</a> before the lawsuit.… <a href="https://t.co/1fZ3r8WCSd">https://t.co/1fZ3r8WCSd</a> <a href="https://t.co/GLu4kFUU38">pic.twitter.com/GLu4kFUU38</a></p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1693798126371422237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Reacting to this news, Deaton reflected on how Ripple and XRP were on a pathway to tremendous adoption in the cross-border payment business, and if the SEC’s lawsuit never happened, Coinbase may have purchased an equity stake in Ripple instead.</p>



<p>Though Coinbase <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-overtakes-bnb-coin-as-fourth-most-valuable-crypto-as-coinbase-announces-relisting/">made XRP available again to U.S. users </a>after the historic verdict, MoneyGram did not renew its alliance with Ripple. Instead, the American remittance company forged a new partnership with Ripple competitor Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) in October 2021 to facilitate transfers with the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin.</p>



<p>This month, the Stellar Foundation became a minority investor in MoneyGram using money from its cash treasury.</p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/MarshallHayner/status/1693062205221052546?s=20">poll</a> asking the Dogecoin community whether they would be interested in staking their DOGE tokens ignited a fresh debate around a possible jumping to proof of stake.</p>



<p>Pseudonymous Dogecoin core developer Mishaboar made it known that he is vehemently opposed to such a move while highlighting several issues that could arise from the potential transition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogecoin-s-transition-to-pos-could-be-catastrophic-dev-mishaboar"><strong>Dogecoin’s Transition To PoS Could Be Catastrophic: Dev Mishaboar</strong></h2>



<p>Mishaboar took to X (formerly Twitter) on Aug. 20 to share his concerns about the possible impact a move to proof of stake (PoS) could have on Dogecoin’s network amid swirling rumours and suspicions concerning such a move.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If Dogecoin was stakeable, would you stake it? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DOGE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$DOGE</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f415.png" alt="🐕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>&mdash; Marshall Hayner (@MarshallHayner) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarshallHayner/status/1693062205221052546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Dogecoin currently uses the proof of work consensus algorithm, which is the same as Bitcoin’s. This mechanism uses mining to validate the network and requires miners to use specialized computers to solve difficult puzzles in order to ultimately add the latest block of transactions to the chain of record.</p>



<p>Prominent crypto pundits have previously advocated for Dogecoin’s migration from the energy-guzzling proof of work to proof of stake, including Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik Buterin set tongues wagging after the Ethereum network completed its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-merge-successful-will-fork-ethw-get-going-as-well/">merge </a>to PoS when he said he was “hopeful Dogecoin is going to evolve to proof of stake sometime soon.”</p>



<p>However, dev Mishaboar has indicated that if such a switch is made, he will leave the famous dog-depicting cryptocurrency for another crypto network with a PoW consensus.</p>



<p><em>“If this refers to a remote possibility of Doge ever switching to PoS, after what I have seen over the past two years, I would probably then move to another PoW crypto and customize the logo in my wallet to have a dog in it.”</em></p>



<p>He went on to discuss the implications further, pointing out that such a conversion might initiate the next Dogecoin blockchain fork, to preserve the old PoW-based DOGE. He noted there would be a major power imbalance that could come from a PoS switch as exchanges control a significant amount of a token’s supply. In other words, a shift to a PoS system could reduce governance and involvement in the DOGE holders’ community.</p>



<p>Mishaboar also noted that Dogecoin may face increased regulatory hurdles if PoS is deployed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the core developer explained that cryptocurrencies that have switched to PoS have been overhyped, with most of them failing to meet expectations and falling considerably or becoming so centralized that it conflicts with the fundamental tenets of cryptocurrency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-is-pos-decisively-better-for-doge"><strong>Proof-of-Work Vs. Proof-of-Stake: Is PoS Decisively Better For Doge?</strong></h2>



<p>Some crypto community members <a href="https://twitter.com/supremebeme/status/1693130905735569752">said </a>they support a Dogecoin migration to PoS as this consensus mechanism is way ahead of PoW when you consider parameters such as energy efficiency and better scalability. A strong argument in favour of PoS is that it “puts the power back in the hands of the people and away from the giant mining operations.” </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nonetheless-others-agree-with-mishaboar">Nonetheless, others <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilsner_Maxwell/status/1693255261216006275">agree </a>with Mishaboar.</h2>



<p>While the developer admits that a PoS consensus has some benefits, such as lower energy usage and a faster transaction output, he maintains that a transition from PoW does not align with Dogecoin’s future goals. According to Mishaboar, the Dogecoin network can integrate with payment channels and providers for faster transactions instead of switching.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu’s lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has announced that the Shibarium layer-2 network is almost ready to reopen to the public after tremendous engineering work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The protocol’s second attempt to relaunch comes only days after the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-token-falls-11-following-shibarium-deployment-heres-reason-why/">first debut faced challenges</a> as bridging issues resulted in millions of dollars worth of assets being stuck on-chain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shibarium-relaunch-tomorrow"><strong>Shibarium Relaunch Tomorrow?</strong></h2>



<p>According to pseudonymous Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama, the Shibarium network is “almost ready to reopen to the public” and the team has put key mechanisms in place to prevent another outage.</p>



<p>“After two days of testing and tweaking parameters to achieve ‘ready’ state Shibarium is now enhanced and optimized,” Kusama announced in an Aug. 22 official blog post, suggesting substantial progress in fixing the issues that forced the network to shut down. He confirmed that, while still undergoing testing, the network is “producing blocks.”</p>



<p>To accommodate the unprecedented demand that supposedly caused the earlier stoppage, the team behind Shibarium has implemented cutting-edge safety components. Kusama stated: <em>“We have enabled a new monitoring system and additional fail-safes, including rate limiting at the RPC level and auto server reset in case we get a huge level of traffic again.”</em></p>



<p>Last week, Shibarium entered a fail-safe mode and halted operations to safeguard assets due to unexpectedly high traffic after the mainnet roll-out. The SHIB price plummeted double digits as over $2 million got trapped between chains. Shytoshi, at the time, asserted that the bridge had no security-related issues and that Shibarium was poised for a swift restart.</p>



<p>At the moment, developers are already allowing validators to begin taking initial steps for the relaunch. “Tomorrow, additional validators will go live, giving even more options for you to stake your BONE for a share of the rewards earned for these two roles in our society,” Kusama revealed.</p>



<p>Shytoshi further cautioned the Shiba Inu community about FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), pushing holders to dump their bags. He declared that the SHIB ecosystem is dedicated to decentralization.</p>



<p>“One piece of fud is that Shibarium was never going to come. Kek. Fud ded. Another was that I am not focused on decentralization. This fud is now also laughable as I’ve presented what is, arguably, the most comprehensive decentralization document the world has ever seen.”</p>



<p>SHIB is currently trading hands at $0.00000802, or down 2% on the day, according to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu">CoinGecko</a> data. SHIB’s associated tokens, BONE and LEASH, are down 3.7% and 4.2%, respectively. If Shibarium’s second reactivation succeeds, the protocol can truly fulfil its potential. This would prompt the SHIB price to gather upside traction and possibly explore a move toward the elusive $0.001 mark.</p>

<p>Virtual currency custody solutions provider Prime Trust has <a href="https://twitter.com/MatriXBT/status/1691265367513956352?s=20">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following a liquidity crisis that community members say has been brewing for several months.</p>



<p>The company filed on August 14, noting that the bankruptcy procedure will “provide a transparent and value-maximizing process for the benefit of the Company’s clients and stakeholders.”</p>



<p>According to the filing document, Prime Trust says it currently has liabilities in excess of $500 million from 50,000 customers. The filing revealed gaping shortfalls in customer funds that led Nevada regulators to issue a cease-and-desist order against Prime Trust, placing the company into receivership in June.</p>



<p>Per the filing, Prime Trust disclosed that it is open to a range of options to make affected customers whole, including the sale of assets. Apart from grappling with settling customers, Prime Trust remarks that it will continue to pay remuneration for its employees in the hopes of emerging “as a going concern.”</p>



<p>Prime Trust’s liquidity issues do not surprise several industry participants, as the earliest cracks began appearing early in the year. Virtual currency service providers BitGO and CoinMetro raised alarm over Prime Trust’s operational issues in June. Still, others are pointing to the firm’s rocky partnership with Fireblocks in 2021 as the earliest signs of crisis.</p>



<p>As the firm’s troubles came to light, several pundits accused the firm of operating a Ponzi scheme, hinting at their theories on the financial troubles of its subsidiaries. The Nevada Financial Institutions Division (NFID) seemingly confirmed their fears following a June 22 announcement that it was investigating the firm for “breaching its fiduciary duties to its clients.”</p>



<p><em>“Looks like a bunch more people are going to be getting in line in bankruptcy court,” </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/1671884741128392704?s=20">predicted</a> an X user. <em>“Prime Trust is going Prime Bust. The real question is how long has the money been missing, and where did it go?”</em></p>



<p>Following the rough patch faced by Prime Trust, virtual currency service providers relying on the firm for custody solutions moved to withdraw assets while assuring customers of the safety of their funds. However, Coinbits raised the alarm over its inability to recover funds with Prime Trust, stating that claims of regular audits and strict regulatory compliance misled it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-avalanche-of-bankruptcies">An avalanche of bankruptcies</h2>



<p>The cryptoverse has gone through several high-profile bankruptcies in the last 12 months, triggering greater regulatory scrutiny and bearish sentiments. Celsius and Three Arrow Capital (3AC) triggered the wave of bankruptcies, dragging several entities underwater.</p>



<p>As the year wore on, Genesis, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bankruptcy-court-approves-blockfis-4-7m-sale-of-crypto-mining-rigs/">BlockFi</a>, Voyager Digital, and mining firm Core Scientific joined the list of digital asset companies with debilitating liquidity crises. The most poignant of bankruptcies was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-resumes-payments-to-employees-and-contractors-pending-bankruptcy-hearings/">FTX’s collapse</a> in November 2022 which led to losses running into billions for unsuspecting users.</p>

<p>Barely months after the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC), founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu&#8217;s new digital currency exchange OPNX have run into trouble with Dubai’s regulator.</p>



<p>In a public disclosure, the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) confirmed that it had placed fines on OPNX and its founders over violations of local rules. The virtual currency regulator announced a $2.6 million penalty against OPNX for engaging in promotional activities without seeking approvals.</p>



<p>Originally issued in May, VARA’s notice disclosed that the fine against OPNX remains unpaid. For their violations against the rules on advertising and marketing, VARA issued a $53,000 fine against OPNX’s key executives, including CEO Leslie Lamb, Mark Lamb, Davies, and Zhu.</p>



<p>VARA noted that the four individuals in question have paid the fines against them but with the fine against OPNX remaining unpaid, VARA says it will explore “consequential actions.” The regulator’s statement disclosed that it would consider imposing further fines or refer the matter to the courts.</p>



<p>The virtual currency watchdog remarked that the decision to impose the fines is in line with its regulatory powers, receiving approval from its Grievance Committee.</p>



<p><em>“All fines noted above were referred to VARA’s Grievance Committee in accordance with due governance requirements,”</em> said VARA.<em> “The Committee reviewed the referral of the grievance and determined that the enforcement actions taken be upheld in their entirety.”</em></p>



<p>In early 2023, 3AC founders <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-ftx-comes-gtx-failed-3ac-founders-set-to-float-new-exchange/">announced</a> the launch of OPNX, a platform allowing users to tokenize legal claims and trade virtual currency futures. Dubai’s regulators got wind of the plan to float a new exchange and issued a cease-and-desist order against the firm for allegedly soliciting customers from Dubai’s residents.</p>



<p>VARA’s order was allegedly ignored, forcing the regulator to issue a public warning against OPNX and impose steep fines.<br><br>Since VARA’s creation in 2022, the regulator has taken a proactive approach toward virtual currencies in Dubai. Virtual asset service providers seeking to operate in Dubai are expected to obtain VARA’s approval, and lured by regularity clarity, global firms are trooping to Dubai to set up operations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fall-of-3ac">The fall of 3AC</h2>



<p>At the height of its powers, Singaporean hedge fund 3AC controlled over $10 billion worth of assets before things began <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-weeks-of-hiding-3ac-founders-break-silence-blame-luna-for-hedge-fund-collapse/">tearing</a> at the seams. Experts have tagged the hedge fund’s implosion as “self-inflicted” rather than from market forces at play.</p>



<p>There is speculation that both founders used investors’ funds to purchase a $50 million yacht while dabbling in questionable investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“In reality, their model was always a ticking time bomb and would have imploded eventually no matter what,”</em> said Jonathan Zeppettini, an executive at Decred.</p>

<p>On Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged New York crypto asset manager Titan Global Capital Management with misleading investors over its cryptocurrency product.</p>



<p>Titan has agreed to a cease-and-desist order by the regulatory agency, alongside censure and penalties of over $1 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-titan-to-pay-over-1-million-to-settle-sec-charges"><strong>Titan To Pay Over $1 Million To Settle SEC Charges</strong></h2>



<p>The latest in a series of recent enforcement actions initiated by the SEC under chairman Gary Gensler involves fintech investment adviser Titan.</p>



<p>In a Monday <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1693637752460394562">announcement</a>, the securities watchdog indicated that the fintech firm made “conflicting disclosures to clients” about how it custodied cryptocurrency assets. According to the SEC, Titan made misleading claims on its website that were based on “hypothetical performance”. SEC senior enforcement officer Osman Nawaz opined in a statement:</p>



<p><em>“The Commission amended the marketing rule to allow for the use of hypothetical performance metrics but only if advisers comply with requirements reasonably designed to prevent fraud. […] This action serves as a warning for all advisers to ensure compliance.”</em></p>



<p>The SEC further argued that Titan promised investors “annualized” performance results as high as 2,700% for its Titan Crypto product but didn’t inform clients the returns were inferred from a hypothetical three-week period during which no trading transpired. Simply put: They were fabricated.</p>



<p>The regulator also claimed that Titan failed to adopt appropriate policies concerning employee personal trading in cryptocurrencies until October 2022.</p>



<p>The SEC has been more active in crypto law enforcement this year. In June, it sued both <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance </a>for allegedly allowing its customers to trade tokens it deemed unregistered securities.</p>



<p>But today’s charges marked the first time a firm had supposedly broken the SEC’s amended marketing rule of December 2020, which urges investment advisers to ensure the accuracy of disclosures made to existing and prospective clients.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cease-and-desist-order"><strong>Cease-And-Desist Order</strong></h2>



<p>Titan, which is SEC-registered and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, postulated in a statement:</p>



<p><em>“We fully cooperated with the SEC’s inquiry and are pleased to have reached a resolution of these issues. The SEC Order acknowledges Titan’s cooperation and remedial efforts since July 2022, including hiring a new Chief Legal and Chief Compliance Officer and additional legal and compliance staff. Titan continues to make significant investments to build and enhance its compliance program.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>The fintech firm cooperated with the SEC&#8217;s investigation and agreed to a cease-and-desist order. Titan has also agreed to pay a $850,000 civil penalty that will be distributed to affected customers and give back ill-gotten gains and interest of $192,454 — without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings.</p>

<p>Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin moved 600 ether, worth roughly $1 million, to crypto exchange Coinbase on Monday, according to data from Ethereum network explorer, Etherscan.</p>



<p>It’s unclear why Buterin deposited the ether, but transfers to centralized exchanges are typically interpreted as a desire to sell. And his movement might increase selling pressure on ether, whose price has recently plummeted amid a crypto market-wide downturn that saw traders<a href="https://zycrypto.com/did-spacex-news-trigger-bitcoins-soul-crashing-flash-crash-to-sub-26000/"> suffer over $1 billion in liquidations</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vitalik-transfers-600-ether-to-coinbase"><strong>Vitalik Transfers 600 Ether To Coinbase</strong></h2>



<p>Blockchain sleuths have <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1693541323532620159">identified</a> the transfer of $1 million of ETH belonging to a wallet address linked to Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin.</p>



<p>The Ethereum founder moved 600 ETH to Coinbase on August 21. Cryptically named “vitalik.eth”, the address still holds over 3,900 ETH valued at around $6.5 million as of press time, was created seven years ago. </p>



<p>The wallet also contains $84,000 in USD Coin (USDC) and $58,000 of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain data from on-chain tracker Lookonchain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1693550177863549268">shows </a>that Buterin repaid 251,000 RAI Reflex Index (RAI) tokens on Maker and proceeded to withdraw 1,000 ETH (worth around $1,67 million) shortly before the transfer of ETH to Coinbase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-eth-about-to-fall-to-1-000"><strong>Is ETH About To Fall To $1,000?</strong></h2>



<p>Vitalik’s transaction comes as ether, the industry’s second most valuable crypto endured a 9.9% slide over the past seven days as the broader market remains fragile.</p>



<p>Well-known crypto strategist Ali Martinez foresees a significant pullback in the Ethereum price if it drops below the $1,600- $1,550 zone. Ether is changing hands at $$1,664.79 at the time of writing. This means the crypto could soon see a 37%-45% drop from here, crashing to as low as $1000 — according to Martinez.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ethereum</a> | Slipping beneath the $1,600 &#8211; $1,550 bracket for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ETH</a> might set the stage for a significant 37% &#8211; 45% correction, targeting $1,000. <a href="https://t.co/Xmo7Mgfux5">pic.twitter.com/Xmo7Mgfux5</a></p>&mdash; Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1693507725169193156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Buterin’s latest transfer caused a stir on social media, with some crypto enthusiasts suggesting that the move could put additional strain on ETH. Their views are not entirely unwarranted, as the last time he sent ether to crypto exchanges between June 5 and 7, a 14% drop ensued, as per CoinGecko data.</p>



<p>However, in March, the Ethereum creator’s deposit to exchanges coincided with the local bottom of around $1,400, implying that the impact on price after these transfers is just a mere coincidence.</p>

<p>Crypto Educator and Analyst VirtualBacon has long been known for his contempt of XRP, claiming underperformance and centralization. But that narrative may have finally shifted because, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/VirtualBacon0x/status/1691275102254452737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">the analyst</a>, he now believes XRP can outperform most large networks in the coming bull run.</p>



<p>He said: <em>“I hated $XRP for years for its centralization and bad price performance. But now I truly believe $XRP will be one of the best performers in the next bull run. Most other large caps are either becoming irrelevant or have already pumped.”</em></p>



<p>As to the reasons why he believes this to be the case, the analyst lists three main reasons. He explains that XRP did not return to its all-time high for five years and had two cycles of price suppression. Additionally, he said, <em>“Tokenomics proved to be ok since 70-80% relocked in escrow in last 3 years, Ripple didn&#8217;t dump like I feared”.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-returned-to-escrow-reflecting-the-prudent-approach"><strong>XRP Returned to Escrow, Reflecting the Prudent Approach</strong></h2>



<p>This comes after Ripple returned 80% of its 1 billion XRP into escrow, which it released earlier in August. In 2017, Ripple introduced an escrow system to lock 55 billion XRP tokens, about 55% of its supply. These were split into 1 billion XRP each escrow, unlocked monthly to ensure supply control, predictability, and ecosystem stability while meeting holder demands and supporting XRP&#8217;s growth.</p>



<p>The final reason why VirtualBacon is bullish on XRP is that he believes the demand for XRP and others are continuously increasing with the advancement of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), FedNow.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the FedNow Service is a payment system the Federal Reserve offers to enable banks and credit unions to transfer funds for customers, similar to Fedwire and FedACH. Unlike a currency, it doesn&#8217;t replace any payment methods like cash. According to its website, the Federal Reserve hasn&#8217;t officially announced any decisions on issuing a CBDC and would require legal authorization for such a step.</p>



<p>In addition, investment focus for XRP-related assets under management (AuM) has surged by 127% this year, accounting for 12% AuM. The recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">favourable ruling</a> in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case against Ripple Labs, differentiating XRP from securities, increased investor interest. While this has prompted major exchanges to relist the token and boost liquidity, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/judge-in-ripple-court-fight-grants-secs-appeal-bid-bad-omen-for-xrp/">SEC&#8217;s plan to appeal</a> the decision on Ripple&#8217;s XRP sales raises new uncertainties.</p>



<p>XRP price trends downwards with the overall market at the time of writing, landing XRP below 60 cents again after it had experienced a rally to 84 cents post the court&#8217;s rejection of most of the SEC’s challenges.</p>

<ul>
<li>The BIP 324 upgrade will encrypt communications between several nodes, making it difficult for third parties to track.</li>



<li>Lead developer Dhruv Mehta explained that the philosophy of the update is centred on preserving the independence and permissionless nature of BTC.</li>



<li>In the market, BTC fell by 0.04% over the last 24 hours as the asset traded slightly above $26,100.</li>
</ul>



<p>The mainstream adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to grow amid pressure on some governments and centralized financial institutions to curtail its buzz with tight regulatory frameworks and taxes.</p>



<p>A new update, the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 324, seeks to improve the privacy of Bitcoin transactions making it a step harder for third parties to spy on the activities of users. Made <a href="https://twitter.com/spiralbtc/status/1397219302030331907?s=21&amp;t=YXlAj_aoNZNsDZY5872EMQ">mainstream</a> by Bitcoin Core developer Dhruv Mheta in 2021, the proposal will encrypt communications between nodes making data like transaction location difficult to track.</p>



<p>Presently, the update is nearing its completion as a greater part of the code has been written with tests ongoing. Censorship remains at the centre of this new update following growing threats by some governments and other third parties. </p>



<p>According to Mheta, the architecture of Bitcoin requires unencrypted traffic between nodes creating a vacuum that can be hijacked by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) causing huge problems.</p>



<p>“<em>If they can attack nodes, they can make it very hard for you to use Bitcoin. They can eclipse your node. They can identify that you are running a Bitcoin Core node. They can identify the source of the transactions. They can make it very very hard to run the node…” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With access to the communication traffic, the government will have access to information it needs to censor BTC transactions from certain locations defeating the primary purpose of the asset.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-step-toward-freedom"><strong>A step toward freedom</strong></h2>



<p>To Mheta, BIS 324 will not completely eliminate the risk of having a third-party attack but will make it a step more difficult. It makes gathering information harder, requiring the “<em>attacker</em> <em>to connect to every node it wants to spy on.”</em></p>



<p>Without the update, third parties can take this information without being noticed, leaving users at risk. BIS 324 is an added step because those third parties making an attempt at connecting to every node will be spotted.</p>



<p>The cost implications to connect with every node also reduce the risk of its occurrence.</p>



<p>“<em>If you raise the bar from passive to active, then it takes a lot more resources to do these things, so what then happens is, there has to be a bigger reason to do it. Today attackers could go after very small amounts of Bitcoin because they can potentially be targeted with it.&#8221;  </em>Mheta added.</p>

<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has issued a fresh warning to financial institutions about the increased and complex risks associated with crypto-related activities.</p>



<p>In its 2023 risk review report released Monday, the agency said that crypto-assets &#8220;pose novel and complex risks to the U.S. banking system that are difficult to fully assess.&#8221; Created in 1933, the FDIC is tasked with assessing risks facing financial institutions and saving struggling banks.</p>



<p>The report also highlighted <a href="https://zycrypto.com/banks-should-approach-crypto-investments-with-extra-caution-says-fdic-chairman/">various risks</a> associated with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants, including fraud, legal uncertainties, misleading disclosures and poor risk management practices among others, noting that banks ran the risk of suffering for engaging in crypto activities.</p>



<p><em>“Possible contagion risk within the crypto-asset sector resulting from interconnections among certain crypto-asset participants may present concentration risks for banks with exposure to the crypto-asset sector,” </em>the FDIC wrote adding, ”<em>Susceptibility of stablecoins to run risk can create the potential for deposit outflows for banks that hold stablecoin reserves.”</em></p>



<p>The agency urged financial institutions to carefully consider the risks associated with crypto-related activities before engaging in them. It also said that it will continue to monitor crypto-asset risks and take steps to mitigate them noting that it was working with other federal banking agencies to closely monitor crypto-asset-related activities of banking organizations.</p>



<p>FDIC&#8217;s warning comes even as the crypto market continues to face increased scrutiny from regulators around the world. Last year the crypto sector experienced significant market volatility, exposing several vulnerabilities to banks such as the Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate, prompting the FDIC to come to their aid.</p>



<p>These risks have prompted <a href="https://zycrypto.com/fdic-issues-cease-and-desist-order-to-okcoin-crypto-exchange/">the FDIC</a> to become increasingly vocal about cryptocurrencies even as more banks angle towards that direction. In April last year, the agency issued a letter requiring all FDIC-supervised institutions requiring them to report any involvement in crypto-related activities to enable it to assess their soundness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July 2022, the FDIC issued a fact sheet to crypto companies, detailing the risks and concerns associated with misrepresentations and misconceptions about deposit insurance coverage in the context of crypto assets. The fact sheet also provided guidance on risk management and governance considerations for crypto companies.</p>



<p>More recently in January, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the OCC released a joint statement reminding banks to ensure that crypto-asset-related activities are conducted safely and soundly, are legally permissible, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, since 2022, the FDIC has taken action against more than 85 entities that were misrepresenting the nature, extent, or availability of deposit insurance, including various crypto entities.</p>

<p>Tom Lee, co-founder of research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, has expressed his belief that the approval of a Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) could <a href="https://zycrypto.com/fundstrats-tom-lee-projects-bitcoin-hitting-an-eye-watering-180000-after-spot-etf-approval/">significantly impact the price of Bitcoin</a>.</p>



<p>In a Wednesday interview with CNBC, Lee suggested that if a Spot Bitcoin ETF were to be approved within the next year, the price of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/morgan-creek-founder-predicts-bitcoin-to-surpass-100000-within-a-year-if-this-happens/">Bitcoin</a> could potentially surge to as high as $180,000. And while the analyst did not provide an exact timeline for the approval, he further noted that the demand for Bitcoin through an ETF could surpass its daily supply, causing the price to experience a substantial increase.</p>



<p><em>“If the spot &#8212; bitcoin gets approved, I think the demand will be greater than the daily supply of bitcoin and so the clearing price- this is done by Shawn Farrell, our crypto digital strategist- is over 150,000, could be like 180,000.”</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir8jYyrBY5s&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision">Said</a> Lee.</p>



<p>In April, the pundit predicted that Bitcoin&#8217;s price trajectory could witness a remarkable surge, potentially reaching $180,000 before the anticipated halving event in April 2024, partially attributed to the potential introduction of a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">BlackRock spot ETF</a>.</p>



<p>When asked about his specific price targets for Bitcoin, Lee, however, acknowledged that his forecasts tend to be bold. He clarified that his estimates are influenced by regulatory clarity and developments in the cryptocurrency space. The pundit further highlighted the regulatory status of Bitcoin and Ethereum, arguing that it was relatively straightforward compared to other cryptocurrencies, making them more navigable investment options.</p>



<p>Lee&#8217;s prediction comes amid ongoing discussions and anticipation surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States. An ETF would provide institutional and retail investors with a more accessible way to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This potential for increased accessibility has fueled speculation about how such approval could impact the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. </p>



<p>The discussion surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF in the US remains ongoing, reflecting diverse viewpoints on its potential green light. Recently, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, chimed in on the discussion by advocating for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We SkyBridge believe the time is long overdue for a spot Bitcoin ETF</em>,” Scaramucci’s firm wrote in an August 14 letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission&nbsp;(SEC). In the letter, the firm contended that executed surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase have effectively tackled concerns related to market manipulation.</p>



<p>Despite escalating interest and endorsements, the SEC has persistently denied multiple Bitcoin ETF proposals, citing worries regarding market manipulation and the protection of investors.</p>

<p>The much-anticipated <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-token-falls-11-following-shibarium-deployment-heres-reason-why/">launch of Shibarium mainnet</a>, a groundbreaking Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, has been accompanied by unexpected turbulence, leading to significant price declines in the Shiba Inu ecosystem.</p>



<p>On August 16, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shiba-inu-price-in-view-amid-shib-exploding-ecosystem-activity-as-shibarium-debut-beckons/">Shibarium</a> successfully launched on the mainnet after an extensive testing phase involving millions of users and the creation of 21 million wallets.</p>



<p>Shibarium was developed to address Ethereum&#8217;s scalability concerns, including enhancing transaction capacity and reducing expenses. Its introduction on Wednesday hence marked a deliberate move to elevate Shiba Inu beyond its origins as a meme coin.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu gained significant popularity during the 2020-2021 bull market. However, despite briefly surpassing the well-known Dogecoin, SHIB&#8217;s value plummeted just over 90% during the subsequent bear market.</p>



<p>However, the Shiba Inu community remained resilient and established a decentralized ecosystem centred around SHIB. This ecosystem includes ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and a native token, BONE. In the lead-up to the Shibarium mainnet launch, SHIB&#8217;s price experienced an uptick, reflecting optimism within the community.</p>



<p>The network garnered attention from new projects, underscoring its potential influence on the industry. Reports indicated that more than 100 companies were actively developing Shibarium, highlighting the expanding interest in the platform.</p>



<p>However, SHIB and BONE tokens encountered significant price declines following the launch. The plunge came as concerns emerged over a potential hiccup in the launch, with reports suggesting difficulties in recovering assets bridged to the Shibarium network.</p>



<p>Reportedly, some users who sought to transfer their assets from Ethereum to the newly operational network encountered issues that prompted a temporary halt. Notably, Chinese blockchain journalist Colin Wu highlighted that an astounding 965 ETH, valued at $1.7 million, found themselves trapped on the bridge. Supporting evidence from Etherscan substantiated these claims with the Shibarium bridge contract showing a balance of holds 965.3 ETH, equivalent to $1.735 million, in tokens meant to transition from Ethereum to Shibarium.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, issues extended to the Shibarium Remote Control Protocol, which is presently nonfunctional. This setback impeded remote procedures on the network, hampering user interaction and data retrieval efforts.</p>



<p>Furthermore, data from the Shibarium explorer suggests that block production encountered difficulties, causing a 7-hour cessation in blocks. And although block production briefly recommenced, it stalled again before resuming a few hours later.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the value of SHIB has declined, reaching $0.0000085 during the current reporting period, following a 10% decrease over the past 24 hours. Similarly, BONE plunged significantly over 15%, trading at $1.22 at press time.</p>

<p>As the U.S. inches toward the launch of a Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), enthusiasts are mulling over the range of benefits to be gleaned by the offering.</p>



<p>A recent report from investment firm Bernstein noted that approval for a spot ETF will offer a seal of legitimacy for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. The report predicted an influx of institutional capital into the ecosystem, noting that the ETF’s size could be as high as 10% of BTC’s market capitalization in less than three years.</p>



<p>The fallout of an injection of funds into the markets will trigger a price rally for the entire cryptocurrency market following a lengthy bear market.</p>



<p>The report opined that approving one spot bitcoin ETF application by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would open the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/multiple-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-on-the-way-cathie-wood-predicts/">floodgates</a> for more applications, akin to the 2021 approval of a BTC future-based ETF.</p>



<p>Aside from price spikes and institutional interests, a spot-based bitcoin ETF could change the landscape for the custody of digital assets. Since the start of the year, there has been a surging demand for institutional-grade <a href="https://zycrypto.com/big-blow-to-crypto-as-nasdaq-scraps-plans-to-enter-custody-business-amid-u-s-regulatory-turmoil/">custody solutions</a>, with the custody space reaching a valuation of over $250 billion.</p>



<p>The SEC has been inundated with <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">applications</a> from leading Wall Street firms seeking approvals to roll out their spot bitcoin ETFs. After a string of regulatory back-and-forth, the securities watchdog extended its review of the application from Ark 21Shares, making it the second extension by the SEC for the application.</p>



<p><em>“With the interest of leading global asset managers in Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs and potential mechanisms to address the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) objections, the probability of approval has risen,”</em> read the report.</p>



<p>Several theorists point to the ripple effects of Canada’s Purpose Bitcoin ETF as it racked up over $400 million worth of assets in less than 48 hours after its launch. While the U.S. adopts a slow-and-steady approach, pundits are touting Southeast Asia as the next region to roll out a spot BTC ETF.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-downsides-of-a-spot-etf"><strong>Downsides of a spot ETF</strong></h2>



<p>For all its upsides, critics have warned that offering a spot Bitcoin ETF has several flaws. Perhaps, the most significant downside is the inability of investors to withdraw the underlying instruments, a flaw that runs contrary to the ethos of Web 3.</p>



<p>Another downside is the absence of uniform BTC prices, which could open several market arbitrage opportunities. The SEC remains wary of existing custody solutions and bases its refusal to approve based on insufficient guardrails for investor protection.</p>

<p>Long-term holders are regarded as some of the most stable hands in the cryptocurrency market. These crypto holders are less likely to sell their holdings and more likely to continue accumulating. In the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/fundstrats-tom-lee-projects-bitcoin-hitting-an-eye-watering-180000-after-spot-etf-approval/">Bitcoin market</a>, long-term holders appear to have the upper hand now. </p>



<p>According to data from Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics platform, most of the existing BTC tokens on the Bitcoin network have been scooped by long-term holders.</p>



<p>Glassnode’s data revealed that in 2023, long-term holders accumulated more Bitcoin than in previous years. At present, 75% of all available Bitcoins are now under the possession of long-term holders. The number of Bitcoins is estimated to sit at a staggering 15 million.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the accumulation has been building up since 2010. While the data depicts an occasional fluctuation in these holdings, these long-term holders never sold a significant portion of their assets over the last 14 years.</p>



<p>These metrics reflect positively on Bitcoin, strengthening the narrative that adoption amongst key figures has not slowed, despite the constant chaos recorded in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>It also adds to another bullish trend that suggests that the more long-term holders accumulate, the fewer traders hold. With the former being less likely to sell and the latter looking to attain short-term profits, volatility is expected to reduce significantly as more long-term holders take over.</p>



<p>It appears that volatility in the market is already reducing at a notable speed. Glassnode’s most recent on-chain newsletter disclosed that volatility is already at an all-time low and that Bitcoin seems to be in a <em>“bear hangover”,</em> admitting the upsurge in long-term holdings.</p>



<p><em>“Volatility in the digital asset space remains historically low, with investors reaching an all-time low in willingness to spend coins on-chain. The conditions of the Bitcoin market continue to resemble the bear market hangover seen in prior cycles, with an outsized wealth held by long-term high conviction holders.”</em> The newsletter reads.</p>



<p>However, low volatility also comes with its downsides, Glassnode asserts. As volatility reduces, apathy and exhaustion surges amongst market participants. In the long run, a relatively weak influx of demand might follow.</p>



<p>Additionally, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap is slowly moving upwards, suggesting that a sideways market might remain ahead. At the time of this report, Bitcoin is trading for $26,132 as hourly losses continue to surge.</p>
