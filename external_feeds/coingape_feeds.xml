The price of these tokens has been steadily increasing since they were launched.</p>
<h2>Donald Trump&#8217;s NFT Trading Cards</h2>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards?search[sortAscending]=true&amp;search[sortBy]=UNIT_PRICE" rel="nofollow">OpenSea</a>, a prominent platform for trading NFTs, reported that the floor price for Trump&#8217;s NFTs was first set at 0.282 Ethereum early on Saturday morning. That comes to about $330 in total. However, they were first released for a paltry retail price of $99 per piece.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-launches-nft-collection-at-99/">Former U.S. President Donald Trump Launches NFT Collection At $99</a></em></p>
<p>The pricing on Saturday shows a significant increase in value for Trump&#8217;s NFT trading cards since it was first published as part of what the former president referred to as a &#8220;big announcement&#8221; on his <a href="https://coingape.com/donald-trump-unbanned-on-twitter-but-is-not-willing-to-come-back-heres-why/">Truth Social account</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Former President Trump announces launch of NFT digital trading cards" width="678" height="381" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wpOJezaxs4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>A 390% ROI In 3 Days</h2>
<p>Currently, at the time of writing, the floor price of the NFTs are around 0.41 ETH, which equals to $485; an increase of 390% when compared to its launch price of $99.</p>
<p>Thus, one can conclude if all the 45 NFTs were bought for $4,500, the investment would today stand close to $22,000, in a matter of few days.</p>

<p>The NFTs were immediately sold out, and according to reports on Friday, their cost on the secondary market had nearly doubled.</p>
<h2>Trump&#8217;s Official Comeback</h2>
<p>Trump launched the NFT Trading Cards campaign following the formal announcement of his 2024 <a href="https://coingape.com/expert-explains-crypto-impact-us-presidential-election-2024/">presidential campaign</a>. Trump&#8217;s bid for reelection in 2020 was unsuccessful. He served as president of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> from 2017 to 2021.</p>
<p>According to the site hosting these NFTs, the collection is minted on the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/polygon-matic/">Polygon</a> <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a>, and a total of 45,000 NFTs will be created during the first run of the collection.</p>

<p>Even though Trump has been made fun of for his NFT collection, the consistent climb in price may be enough to persuade the former president that his endeavor has been largely profitable thus far.</p>

He also refuses to address the implosion of the crypto exchange as a fraudulent activity orchestrated by its former CEO.</p>
<h2>O&#8217;Leary&#8217;s Undying Support</h2>
<p>O&#8217;Leary, one of the sharks on the popular television program &#8220;Shark Tank,&#8221; recently took to Twitter to hint his undying support for the FTX founder, even after <a href="https://coingape.com/the-bahamas-authorities-arrest-ftx-founder-on-criminal-charges-before-u-s-hearing/">SBF getting arrested on December 12</a>.</p>
<p>Kevin has stated that he would prefer to invest in an entrepreneur who has experienced the pain of failure in the past. This is because such individuals are able to comprehend how challenging it is to launch a new business.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I would rather invest in an entrepreneur who has felt the sting of failure, because they can appreciate how hard it is to start a company.</p>
<p>&mdash; Kevin O&#39;Leary aka Mr. Wonderful (@kevinolearytv) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinolearytv/status/1604141119134212099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Earlier, he also went on air to mention that, he was not of the opinion of calling the former FTX CEO a criminal mastermind and the sole reason behind FTX&#8217;s failure.</p>
<p>He was famously quoted to say,</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to say he’s guilty before he’s tried, I just don’t understand it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Kevin O&#8217;Leary Slams Binance</h2>
<p>While testifying in front of the Senate on Wednesday, O&#8217;Leary defended <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> but attacked FTX&#8217;s rival exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, who&#8217;s also popularly referred to as &#8220;<a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cz/">CZ</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a title="Breaking: Binance CEO “CZ” Claims Sam Bankman-Fried Threatened His Team" href="https://coingape.com/binance-ceo-cz-blasts-kevin-oleary-defending-sbf/" rel="bookmark">Binance CEO “CZ” Claims Sam Bankman-Fried Threatened His Team</a></em></p>
<p>According to O&#8217;Leary, CZ would not comply with the data requirements imposed by a number of different jurisdictions while dealing with FTX &amp;  intentionally tried to put the rival <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a>“out of business”.</p>
<p>He testified to the senate that,</p>
<blockquote><p>Binance is a massive unregulated monopoly now. This is my personal opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p>This led to a heated altercation between the two, where the Binance CEO even went out to call Kevin a &#8220;liar&#8221; for falsifying facts about his <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> exchange to the senate.</p>

Losing this crucial support, the coin price is poised for the resumption of prevailing downfall. How far can the sellers tumble the Binance coin price?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $250 support  breakdown sets a BNB price of 19% LOSS</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily-RSI slope entered the oversold region.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the BNB price is $1.39 Billion, indicating a 32.4% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s Why Binance Coin Wintnessed Sudden Downfall?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent mayhem in the crypto market due to the<a href="https://coingape.com/sam-bankman-frieds-donations-are-u-s-politicians-giving-up/"> FTX crypto exchange</a>, Binance released its Proof-of-Reserves report in partnership with auditing firm Mazars Group. However, during the proof-of-reserves inspection of Binance&#8217;s bitcoin holdings, Mazars found that its Bitcoin reserves had been overcollateralized on a single day in late November. Furthermore, the report was later removed from Mazar&#8217;s official website, and they also temporarily <a href="https://coingape.com/bnb-tanks-12-5-as-binance-auditor-mazars-suspends-ties/">suspended ties</a> with several crypto firms, including Binance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, this sudden news caused uncertainty and fear among the market participants as they have recently gone through the FTX collapse. As a result, the crypto market fells in the past few days, and BNB coin witnessed heavy outflow. Thus, this altcoin registered an 18% loss since last week,</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Prediction</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/YiJjaAfP.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past four, the Binance coin price obtained sufficient support from the $250-260 accumulation zone. The multiple reversals from this support indicated the buyers were aggressively defending this level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, amidst the recent downfall in BNB price, the sellers gave a massive breakdown from the $250-$260 support. The breakdown should accelerate the underlying bearish momentum and poise the prices for a deeper correction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, BNB&#8217;s price currently trades at $236, with an intraday gain of 1.9. However, this current price jump could be a minor retest phase which should revisit the breached resistance. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> shows sustainability below the $250 mark, the post-retest downfall may plunge the price 19% down to reach the $190 mark.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, the $215 horizontal level stands as significant support where the buyers could wrest for trend control.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI indicator:</strong> this indicator reflects the strength of recent price action, and it is currently wavering at the oversold region. The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI value</a> of 28% reflects the traders have overextended the selling activity, which increases the possibility of a price jump to $250.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the sideway EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) turning down indicate the sellers are in possession of the current price action.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance Levels: $250 and $300</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support Levels: $215 and $190</span></li>
</ul>

The recent news of auditing firm Mazars cutting ties with the crypto exchange appears to have a prolonged bearing on the BNB price. Meanwhile, the overall sentiment in the crypto market continues to be bearish following the Fed’s indication of a continued rate hike in 2023. In this context, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> BNB short selling activity seems to have picked up in recent days.</p>

<p>Earlier, auditing partner Mazars Group has suspended ties with Binance as the exchange faces the heat from crypto community over asset transparency. The trader community believes that Binance is not fully transparent about the way in which it holds and stores user assets. This led a sharp drop in the BNB price. The whole criticism around the exchange’s assets began after it published the audit report on Binance proof of reserves.</p>
<h2>BNB Facing Short Squeeze?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the BNB traders appear to be opening massive short positions in the midst of the FUD around asset transparency. Caesar, a crypto enthusiast, said there are around $118,000,000 worth of shorts opened on BNB token. Traders are piling into it with all this FUD surrounding Binance, he said in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/PARABOLIT/status/1604165325414604800?s=20&amp;t=aJFlFC-la2F5Kzfu60BFHA">tweet</a>. This comes amid continuous drop in the token&#8217;s price in recent times.</p>
<p>As of writing, BNB price stands at $236.80, down 2.90% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/">CoinMarketCap</a>. Over the past one week, the fifth ranked cryptocurrency lost around 18% in value.</p>

However, both parties have filed the final briefs seeking summary judgment in their favor. Meanwhile, an attorney following the XRP lawsuit has revealed what might be the next move from the SEC.</p>
<h2>SEC taking a loss in XRP Lawsuit?</h2>
<p>Attorney Jeremy Hogan replied to a user’s query regarding the XRP lawsuit. A user asked whether <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1604107869368057856" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SEC will file for reconsideration</a> of the summary judgment before appealing it. Hogan stated that the commission could move for reconsideration ahead.</p>
<p>He added that however, he doubt the SEC would file an appeal after a loss. It looks too dangerous for now. Hogan stated that if the SEC loses on appeal then it will become the controlling case authority. This can lead to the SEC losing the case in the 2nd circuit.</p>
<p>Hogan believes that the SEC won&#8217;t risk this as it would be a smart action to take loose here. However, the commission can then focus on exchanges and fraud happening in the crypto market.</p>
<p>Earlier, Coingape reported that after failing to prevent and take action against the SBF and FTX, the<a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-is-more-important-than-ever-for-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> XRP lawsuit has become more important</a> than ever for the commission.</p>
<h2>Ripple vs SEC settlement rumors?</h2>
<p>As of now, Ripple and <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-is-ripple-losing-this-key-battle-against-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC have asked District Judge</a> Analisa Torres not to send the XRP lawsuit to the trial and give a ruling in their favor. However, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson spread a rumor about a <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-whales-276-million-xrp-while-this-rumor-clears-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settlement between the parties</a> around December 15, 2022.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hoskinson’s rumor about the Settlement was debunked by the FoxBussines Journalist, Eleanor Terrett. She mentioned that her source close to the XRP lawsuit has informed that there is no truth to this rumor.</p>

The three Democratic primary committees announced that they will set aside more than $1 million in contributions from convicted crypto tycoon SBF, who is suspected of making tens of millions of dollars in unauthorized campaign contributions.</p>
<h2>Over $1 Million To Be Returned</h2>
<p>SBF&#8217;s political contributions to <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States&#8217;</a> political parties have come under more scrutiny since his arrest on December 12. The accused entrepreneur used the &#8220;dirty money,&#8221; according to U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, to buy influence and shape public policy in Washington.</p>

<p>The Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee were among the organizations to which he donated money.</p>
<h2>Democrats Await Legal Process</h2>
<p>DNC spokesman Daniel Wessel said in a statement on Friday that the organization will set away the $815,000 in contributions it has gotten from <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Bankman-Fried</a> since 2020. In addition to giving directly to the DNC, the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, and the Biden Victory Fund—a joint fundraising group endorsed by Joe Biden&#8217;s presidential campaign.</p>

Ray III Claims “Embezzlement” Root Cause Of FTX Collapse</a></em></p>
<p>Wessel was further quoted saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>We will return as soon as we receive proper direction in the legal proceedings</p></blockquote>
<p>Similar assertions were made by representatives of the DSCC and DCCC, the official campaigns for the Senate and House <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/democrats" rel="nofollow">Democrats</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>According to spokesperson David Bergstein, the DSCC group received $103,000 in donations related to Bankman-Fried and, like the DNC, is planning to return them once it receives the right instructions.</p>

<p>In a statement, the DCCC stated that it is &#8220;waiting for further guidance from the government on what to do with the money based on their legal proceedings.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Individual Politicians Step In</h2>
<p>Additionally, individual politicians have stated their intent to return their portion of the SBF generosity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If a thief randomly contributes $2,900 to you online. I recommend donating the $ to the Border Patrol Foundation like I did. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f49a.png" alt="💚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&mdash; Tony Gonzales (@TonyGonzales4TX) <a href="https://twitter.com/TonyGonzales4TX/status/1603757283930001408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Also, another $1 million donation from SBF was reportedly returned by the Beto O&#8217;Rourke campaign in Texas. Additionally, Greg Casar, stated that nearly the $6,800 worth of donations he received, will go to the advocacy group Fight Corporate Monopolies.</p>

Along with market leaders, the majority of altcoins tumbled lower and neared the November bottom. Thus, if the selling pressure, the downward spiral may continue and plunge the coin price below the last swing low support.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Gainers and Losers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132048" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/17204656/Screenshot_20221217_204121-e1671290270994.png" alt="heatmap of cryptocurrencies" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/17204656/Screenshot_20221217_204121-e1671290270994.png 1200w, https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/17204656/Screenshot_20221217_204121-e1671290270994-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/17204656/Screenshot_20221217_204121-e1671290270994-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/17204656/Screenshot_20221217_204121-e1671290270994-678x381.png 678w, https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/17204656/Screenshot_20221217_204121-e1671290270994-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />Source- Coin360 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the bearish cloud is lurking on the crypto market, the UNUS SED LEO and Toncoin are the only coins in green among the top 100 list. LEO price currently trades at $3.91 with intraday gains of 5.34%, while the TON price trades at $2.46, registering a 0.4% gain. On the other hand, Filecoin and Chainv tokens are top losers, with FIL price at $3.03, down 21.86%, while XCN</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">price at $0.02483 is down 18.67.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why has the crypto market crashed recently?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sudden selling pressure in the crypto space must have been raised when market participants got concerned regarding the financial health of the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange by volume, Binance. The concern arose when Binance presented its Proof-of-Reserves report in partnership with Mazars Group, which many deemed opaque. Furthermore, the news for <a href="https://coingape.com/bnb-tanks-12-5-as-binance-auditor-mazars-suspends-ties/">Mazars Groups has suspended</a> ties with Binance and several other crypto exchanged cause more panic in the market</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the crypto space has recently gone through the FTX crypto exchange crash, investors are quite cautious about such events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the hearsay that US Fed will get aggressive regarding interest hikes has flued more negativity in the market.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-132047" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/17204359/Screenshot_20221217_204152.png" alt="" width="1200" height="352" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-is-19k-still-possible-or-btc-to-fall-below-15k/">Bitcoin price</a> witnessed a recovery rally from late November to mid-December. However, it seems this price bull run was a part of a bearish continuation pattern called an <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-price-breakouts-of-this-repetitive-bearish-pattern-more-downfall-ahead/">inverted flag</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with the recent price drop, the coin price gave a massive breakdown from the pattern’s support trendline. On December 16th, the long breakdown candle backed by an increasing volume indicated the seller&#8217;s confidence for further correction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/m/MsTzOhBJ.png" alt="bitcoin price prediction" width="1946" height="1110" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the BTC price trades at the $16709 mark and shows power struggles to surpass the horizontal level of $16825. Thus, if the price shows sustainability below the mentioned $16825 or breaches the trendline, the Bitcoin price may drop 6.7% to revisit $15600.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum price </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132046" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/17204238/Screenshot_20221217_204212.png" alt="" width="1730" height="526" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to Bitcoin, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-price-prediction-losing-this-crucial-support-eth-poised-for-10-drop/">Ethereum price</a> rose in response to a support trendline. However, on December 15th, this altcoin breached the ascending trendline, indicating market sentiment has shifted from buying on dips to selling in rallies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sustained selling, the ETH price plunged lower and pierced local support of $1240 to $1222. This breached horizontal level offers additional resistance in favor of sellers to maintain the ongoing downfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/SSc8AU12.png" alt="Ethereum Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1110" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the Ethereum price trades at $1180 with an intraday gain of 1.15%. The bullish candle backed by lesser volume indicates market participant is more interested in selling activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a possible retest phase may revisit the $1180 mark to replenish the bearish momentum. Furthermore, a post-retest downfall may plunge the ETH price back to $1100-$1080.</span></p>

<h2>Massive Liquidation</h2>
<p>Earlier, it was reported that DCG&#8217;s assets were witnessing a massive selloff.

Meanwhile, there are concerns that Genesis liquidation and may cause its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) to fall in danger of bankruptcy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is speculation that DCG is dumping assets based on below. It could mean 2 things;</p>
<p>1. They are trying to repay the $1,5bn loan to Genesis. The loan may be recalled in case of a bankruptcy.</p>
<p>2. They are entering chapter 11. To do so they must first exhaust all liquid assets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Additionally, the total amount burned during the last 24 hours has surpassed the amount of tokens burned the day before.</p>
<h2>1.5 Million SHIB Burnt In 1 Hour</h2>
<p>In a dire attempt to reduce the massive supply plaguing one of the crypto industry&#8217;s viral <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">meme cryptocurrency</a>, the Shibburn community has burned a total of 1,500,000 SHIB tokens burned in one transaction.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s burn rate increased by 252% over the course of the last 24 hours, according to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.shibburn.com/" rel="nofollow">Shibburn</a> website, as a total of 45,440,894 SHIB tokens were delivered to non-spendable wallets.</p>

<h2>Shiba Racing Game</h2>
<p>Apart from the rampant token burn mechanism, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is also expanding with more use-cases.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) price today fell to $0.00000805, the lowest price recorded since June. The FUD in the crypto market and Shiba Inu whales continuously selling their SHIB holdings are the factors behind the recent drop in SHIB price.

The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FUD</a> in the crypto market and Shiba Inu whales continuously selling their SHIB holdings are the factors behind the recent drop in SHIB price.</p>
<p>The 24-hour low and high for Shiba Inu are $0.00000805 and $0.0000089, respectively. Therefore, the SHIB price has tumbled nearly 10% in the last 24 hours and 13% in a week. The price is currently trading at $0.000008202.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price to Fall Amid Whale Dumping</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s burn tracker Shibburn in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/shibburn/status/1603978317983584256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on December 17 revealed <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">a total of 47,440,894 </span><span class="r-18u37iz">SHIB</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> tokens burned in 11 transactions in the last 24 hours. According to the official burn website, Shiba Inu&#8217;s burn rate has increased by 235.41% in the last 24 hours.</span></p>
<p>Interestingly, among the transactions that burned the most SHIB tokens, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x95aD61b0a150d79219dCF64E1E6Cc01f0B64C4cE?a=0x1cc75178081ce0f3e44048bc0a384242b957eb4c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan data</a> of a wallet address revealed that the wallet was dormant for over a year. The wallet became active and transferred all 23,616,644 SHIB tokens to the burn address.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meme cryptocurrency</a> Shiba Inu (SHIB) became the whales&#8217; favorite token after it witnessed massive rallies during the bull market in 2021. The whales have made millions of dollars in profit. However, with the<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-winter-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> crypto winter</a>, SHIB has suffered one of the worst downfalls, causing whales to move away from the meme coin.</p>
<p>Recently, a <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-whale-dumps-210-billion-shib-binance-price-tumbles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiba Inu whale transferred over 210 billion tokens</a> worth $2 million to <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> Binance on December 14. The whale bought 3.49 trillion SHIB tokens for 2.37 ETH in 2020 and has since selling SHIB tokens in small amounts. The whale still holds over 546 billion SHIB tokens worth $4.86 million.</p>
<h2>SHIB Price Can Drop More</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu price has reached a crucial support level. Experts believe the negative market sentiment following the collapse of FTX will cause more selloffs. Moreover, the <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-auditor-mazars-suspends-services-for-crypto-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FUD related to Binance</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/why-grayscale-may-be-next-after-ftx-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCG&#8217;s Genesis facing potential bankruptcy risk</a> is limiting traders and whales to pour money into SHIB.</p>
<p>Analysts predict the SHIB price can fall to $0.0000075 before making an upside move. Analysts believe Bitcoin and Ethereum are bearish and have yet to form a bottom. Bitcoin and Ethereum rally will make SHIB follow suit.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">Cardano reached its peak in the bull market of 2021, recording an all time high of $3.10. With a market capitalization of $9 billion, <strong>ADA is currently trading at $0.2667</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Cardano has experienced a hard time gaining momentum for quite some time. ADA&#8217;s prices have declined by 14.77% in the last 7 days and by 17.47% in the last one month.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Cardano prices have slumped by 27.44% in the past two months, by 44.22% in the last three months, and by 80.63% year-to-date (YTD). There is undoubtedly a downward trend in the price of ADA, owing to several market factors. But it also means this could be a great time to invest, as Cardano is in a dip right now.</p>
<h4 style="color: #252525"> Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction</h4>
<p style="color: #252525">According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cryptonewsz.com/forecast/cardano-price-prediction/" rel="nofollow">Cryptonewsz.com</a>&#8216;s price prediction, ADA can reach the $1 mark as early as 2023. On the conservative side of the spectrum, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/cardano/" rel="nofollow">cryptoprediction.com</a> predicts that ADA will reach $0.8 by 2026.</p>

<h4 style="color: #252525">How Much Money You Would Make if ADA Reaches $1?</h4>
<p style="color: #252525">Let’s assume that ADA hits $1 in the coming years. This assumption is not misplaced, as Cardano has breached this barrier several times before and has traded above the $1 mark for most of 2021. It is very likely that ADA will breach $1 barrier in the next bull run.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">So, the question is how much money you would make if you invested X amount in ADA today. Let’s say you invest a modest $100 today.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">At the current price of $0.2667, you will have 374.95 ADA coins. And if you liquidate these coins when ADA hits $1, <strong>your $100 will become $374.95, a 3.7x return on investment.</strong></p>
<p style="color: #252525">Likewise, if you buy $1000 worth of ADA, you will have 3749.5 coins. In this case, <strong>you will make $3749.5 on your $1000 investment, a 274.95% ROI.</strong></p>
<p style="color: #252525">It is important for anyone considering investing in Cardano or any other cryptocurrency to carefully research the asset and understand the risks involved before making any investment decisions.</p>

However, the US SEC mentions that the SBF raised $1.8 billion from equity investors from May 2019 to perform the alleged actions. <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-whales-276-million-xrp-while-this-rumor-clears-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read XRP News Here</a></p>
<h2>Ripple lawyer challenges FTX Investors</h2>
<p>In a recent interaction with CNBC, Kevin O Leary mentioned that the shareholders of FTX including him, might not get anything in return. The venture investors who lost their money understand this, he added.</p>
<p>Kevin stated that he doesn’t want anything back until the users who had money in their accounts got it back.</p>
<p>To this Stuart Alderoty, General Counsel of Ripple stated that Kevin and all other FTX venture investors should challenge the SEC. They should demand that the SEC should stop spending taxpayer money on its tag along case against SBF.</p>
<p>However, Ripple lawyer calls <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-219" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the SEC complaint</a> against SBF a case to recover money on their behalf. Earlier, he stated that the commission&#8217;s charges against the FTX former CEO are just a tag along. While they don&#8217;t want the users&#8217; money to be recovered amid the bankruptcy filed in court.</p>
<p>Earlier, Coingape reported that some users were facing complications while <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-news-are-us-bank-freezing-ftx-linked-bank-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accessing their bank accounts</a> which were linked to the FTX crypto exchange.</p>

The chain of events in the last two days caused the <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-tanks-6-bitcoin-slips-under-17000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market to crash massively</a>. It started with the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s hawkish outlook, tuning sentiment back to negative.</p>
<p>Binance&#8217;s auditor <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-auditor-mazars-suspends-services-for-crypto-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mazars on Friday suspended services</a> including proof of reserves (PoR) for crypto exchanges. It caused massive selling in the crypto market due to the existing Binance <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FUD</a>. BTC price fell over 4% to hit a low of $17K. Thereafter, a market-wide selloff was seen in <a href="https://coingape.com/why-grayscale-may-be-next-after-ftx-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrencies related to Barry Silbert&#8217;s DCG</a>. Crypto influencers believe Genesis and Grayscale could face insolvency.</p>
<h2>Can Bitcoin (BTC) Price Hit $19K?</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst CredibleCrypto in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CredibleCrypto/status/1603926778870779904" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on December 17 shared two scenarios for Bitcoin (BTC) price as it tagged the $16.5K support level again. He remains bullish on Bitcoin price rising over $19K in the short term.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132000" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132000" style="width: 735px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-132000" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/17150235/Bitcoin-Price-Prediction.-Source-CredibleCrypto.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Price Prediction" width="735" height="360" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132000" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price Prediction. Source: CredibleCrypto</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bitcoin price must hold the $16.5K level to rebound from the level. He predicts the BTC price will touch $17.3K first and should break the $18K resistance to rally towards $19K.</p>
<p>However, if the BTC price breaks below $16.5K support, it can only go to $15.6K. A low of $15K is difficult unless something major happens in the crypto industry. Currently, the BTC price is trading at $16,728. The 24-hour low and high are $16,584 and $17,289, respectively.</p>
<p>Bitcoin holding the support level will also influence Ethereum price to bounce from the $1,070 level. He predicts ETH price to recover above $1,300 in the short term. The ETH price is currently trading at $1,178. The 24-hour low and high are $1,162 and $1,255, respectively.</p>

The 45th president of the United States announced a day later that he was selling &#8220;limited edition cards featuring amazing ART of my Life &amp; Career,&#8221; promising that they would be &#8220;very much like baseball cards, but hopefully much more exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 76-year-old former leader of the free world can be seen on the cards in a boxing ring, getting ready to wrestle, as a race car driver, an astronaut, and on a football field. His presidential number, 45, is inscribed on each card.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Donald Trump NFT is available on Opensea</b></h2>
<p>On the Opensea marketplace, which could be accessed via a special website created for the sale, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs) were being sold. The cards were out of stock, as the website reported on Friday.</p>
<p>There were 45,000 NFTs available for purchase, each costing US$99. However, unlike other NFTs, the image itself can be widely copied and shared online by anyone. The buyer retains ownership of the particular digital Trump card. The availability of NFTs was constrained as part of the launch, despite the fact</p>
<h3><b>What are the Digital Trading Cards of Donald Trump?</b></h3>
<p>One of the first things to notice is that Trump never used the phrase &#8220;NFT&#8221; in his announcements. The website doesn&#8217;t mention it either; all of the languages are focused on &#8220;<a href="https://coingape.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-launches-nft-collection-at-99/">Digital Trading Cards</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 45,000 NFTs in Donald Trump&#8217;s collection of digital trading cards all feature images of him in some way. The images share some elements between them, like many NFT collections.</p>
<h3><b>The purpose of Donald Trump&#8217;s NFT collection</b></h3>
<p>The Trump NFT collection is surrounded by a few other crucial facts. First, despite reasonable speculation to the contrary, the NFT collection is a legitimate source of campaign funding.</p>
<p>Second, even though Donald Trump is the focus of this NFT collection, and he undoubtedly had some input into its conception and development, licensing the name is a significant component of the Trump business strategy. In this instance, a business called NFT INT LLC, which is not owned by Trump, has a license to use the Trump name.</p>
<p>Although Donald Trump might not directly benefit from the NFT sales, and those funds might not end up in his campaign account, he did a good job of licensing his name to the endeavor.</p>
<h3><b>Who Benefits from the Trump NFTs, so?</b></h3>
<p>At $99 each, 45,000 NFTs sell for a cool $4.45 million. But who is stealing the money if not the Trump Organization?</p>
<p>NFT INT LLC receives all proceeds. Furthermore, the business receives 10% of each sale of a Donald Trump Digital Trading Card. On Open Sea, one of the most well-known NFT marketplaces, there has reportedly been trading activity worth 663 ETH as of this writing. Given that 663 ETH is worth $846,000, NFT INT LLC has already made an additional $84,600 while trading is still active and prices appear to be on the rise.</p>
<p><b>Trump&#8217;s NFTs give the tumbling market a lift</b></p>
<p>There is no doubt that users all over the world are fascinated by the Donald Trump Digital Trading Card NFT collection. It&#8217;s unclear if the majority of purchasers were NFT traders and speculators. However, it&#8217;s still impressive that any <a href="https://coingape.com/nft/">NFT collection</a> could sell out in less than a day.</p>
<p>Another thing is whether or not the Trump NFTs retain their value over time. One might speculatively say it&#8217;s unlikely because so few NFTs retain any value after their initial boom. Stranger things have happened, though.</p>

<p>Bitvavo Custody BV, a part of Dutch cryptocurrency exchange Bitvavo, in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://blog.bitvavo.com/response-bitvavo-to-situation-dcg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog</a> revealed that it is facing problems accessing its EUR 280 million allocated to DCG. It said DCG and its affiliates are currently experiencing liquidity problems and has suspended repayments until further notice.</p>
<h2>Are DCG&#8217;s Grayscale and Genesis on the Brink of Insolvency?</h2>
<p>Andrew Parish, the co-founder of ArchPublic, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/AP_ArchPublic/status/1603778808846262273" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> that Genesis creditor claims are starting to sell in small batches &#8220;in what could be described as a ‘dark market’. &#8221; He reported that two transactions worth $15 million closed at 35% of their pre-withdrawal suspension value.</p>

FTX and Alameda bankruptcy could risk Genesis liquidation and may cause its parent Digital Currency Group (DCG) to go bankrupt.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-contagion-reaches-grayscale-are-gbtc-ethe-next-ftt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCG’s $1.1 billion promissory note to Genesis</a> could cause the parent group to dissolve Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC and EETH. This indeed risks insolvency for Grayscale. According to data by Coinglass, GBTC is trading at a discount premium rate of -48.79% and EETH at a discount premium rate of -52.58%. In fact, Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum Classic fund ETHC is trading at a discount of over -70%.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Crypto Market Selloff</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price is trading at $16,729, down over 4% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum price plummeted 8%, with the current price trading at $1,181.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies related to Barry Silbert&#8217;s Digital Currency Group such as Filecoin, Mask, Flow, and Ethereum Classic are down 26%, 16%, 16%, and 12%, respectively. Genesis&#8217; lending business Genesis Capital is already considered insolvent by many experts. Neither Barry Silbert nor DCG and Genesis have released statements to clear the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FUD</a>.</p>
