			            <description><![CDATA[Russia’s digital ruble pilot begins August 1, and will be completely optional to use.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world’s largest country by landmass is set to roll out a digital ruble next week after Russian President Vladimir Putin greenlighted the project on Thursday.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202307240009?index=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">text of the bill</a> amends Russia’s Civil Code to allow the digital ruble to be used for payments, while empowering Russia’s central bank to let real citizens use the currency starting August 1.</li>
<li>Accounts for the digital ruble will be managed directly by the central bank, rather than commercial banks.<br />
In a <a href="https://ria.ru/20230721/rubl-1885538360.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">statement</a> shared by Russian media central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina clarified that the use of the currency is purely optional.</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>“We really hope that it will be more convenient, and cheaper for both people and businesses, and they will start using it,” she said. “This is a new opportunity.”</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>The Russian government first began exploring the digital ruble in October 2020, and began piloting the system with Russian banks in February 2022. Two weeks ago, the State Duma <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/russias-state-duma-approvea-national-cbdc-project/" data-wpel-link="internal">approved</a> the new law that will allow the currency’s use by individuals.</li>
<li>The currency will be programmable to implement certain transaction limits, and restrictions on what citizens can spend their money on.</li>
<li>While Western nations like the United States and Canada are merely exploring CBDCs, critical politicians in each country have blasted the concept for exactly this feature.</li>
<li>In March, Florida Governor Ron De Santis <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/no-cbdc-in-florida-says-governor-ron-desantis/" data-wpel-link="internal">called</a> CBDCs a tool for “surveilling Americans, and controlling behavior of Americans.”</li>
<li>By contrast, Putin and the Russian parliament have already banned the use of private cryptocurrencies for payments within the country, only <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bank-of-russia-to-greenlight-cross-border-payments-with-crypto-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">approving</a> their use for cross-border trade.</li>
</ul>

			            <description><![CDATA[Delio is currently under investigation by the South Korea's FSC.  ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean digital asset savings and lending firm Delio has plunged into a deeper crisis more than a month after suspending user withdrawals. The authorities seized Delio&#8217;s assets on July 18th, which reportedly disrupted its operations.</p>
<p>According to the latest update, the actions by the South Korean regulator have made it &#8220;difficult for the company to provide normal services.&#8221; It also highlighted the need to prevent the scattering of the platform&#8217;s property in the interest of depositors.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=byrowa&amp;logNo=223163205856&amp;proxyReferer=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">notice</a> (translated from Korean), Delio raised concerns over its ability to function normally after the South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) confiscated all assets owned by customers and the company, as well as other cold wallets and ledgers.</li>
<li>Delio was a major player in the South Korean cryptocurrency ecosystem.</li>
<li>The lending firm temporarily suspended withdrawals starting from June 14, citing increased market volatility and investor confusion at sister lending company Haru Invest, which stopped deposits and withdrawals just a day earlier.</li>
<li>Delio further said it was focused on safeguarding customer assets in its custody and added that withdrawals will remain suspended till the issue is resolved.</li>
<li>A few days later, Delio chief executive Jung Sang-ho revealed that the lending platform would resume withdrawals. No further timeline was shared with regard to suspended services.</li>
<li>The decision to abruptly halt withdrawals attracted backlash from the community while the FSC launched an inquiry into the firm&#8217;s activities due to accusations of fraud, embezzlement, and breach of belief.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[75% of bitcoin's circulating supply belongs to those who entered the ecosystem at least 155 days ago, Glassnode determined.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Glassnode&#8217;s estimations, long-term holders (LTHs) of bitcoin currently own 14.52 million BTC, an all-time high, leaving just 25% for short-term holders and speculators.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The accumulation spree comes despite the fact that BTC&#8217;s price has stayed relatively flat in the past month, ranging between approximately $29,000 and $31,000. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The updated figures, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1683401299956465665" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">presented</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by the blockchain data provider Glassnode, showed that bitcoin investors who have been part of the ecosystem for at least 155 days hold 14.52 million BTC of the current supply of almost 19.5 million BTC. </span></li>
<li>LTHs have gradually increased their possessions over the last month even though the USD valuation of the leading digital asset had stalled at around $30K.
<p><figure id="attachment_262238" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262238" style="width: 695px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glassnode.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-262238" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glassnode.png" alt="BTC LTHs Supply" width="695" height="400" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glassnode.png 4020w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glassnode-300x173.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glassnode-1024x590.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glassnode-768x442.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glassnode-1536x885.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glassnode-2048x1179.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glassnode-50x29.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262238" class="wp-caption-text">BTC LTHs Supply, Source: Glassnode</figcaption></figure></li>
<li>On the other hand, the high enthusiasm could be explained by the numerous applications coming from finance behemoths, such as <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BlackRock</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Invesco, WisdomTree, VanEck, and others, all of which filed to launch a spot BTC ETF in the US over the past several weeks. </span></li>
<li>It is worth mentioning that LTHs have not always increased their holdings during predominantly bullish times. They accumulated a significant portion of BTC between the summer of 2022 and the end of last year.</li>
<li>Recall that bitcoin&#8217;s price crashed below $16,000 in that period, as multiple collapses of once-prominent crypto firms worsened the crisis.</li>
<li>The demise of Celsius Network and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) are some examples, while <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the meltdown of FTX</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> received a global backlash.</span></li>

			            <description><![CDATA[ISIS affiliates have ramped up their crypto usage with USDT on the Tron network increasingly becoming a preferred mode. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a recent report by blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs, terrorist groups globally, including those linked to ISIS, frequently utilize cryptocurrency for fundraising purposes. In certain instances, these terrorist organizations have been able to attract supporters and bolster their operations.</p>
<p>TRM Labs revealed observing &#8220;mounting on-chain evidence&#8221; over the past 12 months that pro-ISIS networks in countries like Tajikistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have used crypto assets to facilitate their activities. Almost all of the transactions associated with the cases below were conducted using Tether (USDT) stablecoin on the Tron network (TRX).</p>
<h2>Pro-ISIS Terror Organizations Leveraging Crypto</h2>
<p>Several recruited fighters were lured to join ISIS’ affiliate in Afghanistan (ISKP) with the help of crypto. One such fundraising campaign was active for over a year and controlled an address that received around $2 million in USDT on Tron in 2022.</p>
<p>TRM Labs <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/trm-finds-mounting-evidence-of-crypto-use-by-isis-and-its-supporters-in-asia" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">claimed</a> to have busted the campaign, which led the Turkish authorities to arrest Shamil Hukumatov, a senior ISIS fundraiser last month who was allegedly behind it.</p>
<p>More than $517k was sent in 2022 by individuals using an Indonesia-based crypto platform to addresses that were flagged to belong to pro-ISIS fundraising campaigns in Syria and the local exchanges that facilitate their activities. In this case, as well, TRM Labs found that all these transfers were made using USDT on Tron.</p>
<p>During the latter half of 2022, a media unit associated with ISPP, the Pakistan affiliate of the notorious terrorist organization, began promoting its ability to accept donations. The entity was established in 2019 and has been responsible for numerous attacks in Pakistan, mainly directed at local security forces.</p>
<p>ISPP attempted to capitalize on the earthquakes that hit Turkey and Syria to raise funds by posting various cryptocurrency addresses which were previously flagged by TRM Labs as being linked to the terrorist entity.</p>
<p>The media unit of ISIS&#8217; affiliate in Afghanistan has also been using cryptocurrency to fund its operations and/or to receive funds from supporters, according to TRM Labs</p>
<h2>The Syria Link</h2>
<p>TRM Labs&#8217; findings of the aforementioned on-chain information ultimately connect to pro-ISIS fundraising campaigns in Syria. The intelligence platform believes the war-torn country remains a key hub of cryptocurrency use by ISIS and its supporters.</p>
<p>The investigation also revealed that a huge chunk of the donations is directed to ISIS families in camps like al-Hol and Roj and the local cryptocurrency exchanges that facilitate their activities.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Finding these campaigns, tracing the donations on the blockchain, and identifying the donors is critical to map out and potentially disrupt pro-ISIS networks around the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Vitalik thinks Worldcoin has some glaring centralization issues, but its privacy problems are relatively mild. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a blog post on Monday discussing “decentralized proof-of-personhood” – an ambitious concept at the center of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s newly launched “Worldcoin” (WLD) project.</p>
<p>While noting benefits the benefits of the concept at large, the developer highlighted four potential flaws in Worldcoin’s approach that have popular voices in crypto shaking their heads: privacy, accessibility, centralization, and security.</p>
<h2>Worldcoin Not Bad On Privacy, Says Vitalik</h2>
<p>According to Vitalik, proof of personhood schemes naturally <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">include</a> two important privacy-threatening risks. The first is to possibly link someone’s every action to their actual identity, while the second lies in the existence of a registry of biometric scan data.</p>
<p>Proof-of-personhood systems often use biometric data to verify that its users are all human, and not either duplicate users or bots.</p>
<p>The idea, in Vitalik’s words, is to solve a variety of “anti-spam and anti-concentration-of-power problems” required by decentralized governance structures, and to avoid “both centralized control by a project&#8217;s operators and domination by its wealthiest users.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/115m-for-worldcoin-secured-chatgpt-openai-ceo-closes-successful-fundraiser/" data-wpel-link="internal">Worldcoin’</a>s approach is similar: the project’s founders have spent months registering users across the world to its database using a device known as the ‘Orb.’ The Orb does an Iris scan on those who look into it to provide proof of humanity and associates it with a user-provided public blockchain address, to which WLD tokens may be sent in the future.</p>
<p>The project has drawn an immediate <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-crypto-project-worldcoin-launches-wld-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">hostile response</a> from the crypto community, with some likening it to a “digital dictatorship.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, as a matter of privacy, Vitalik claims Worldcoin isn’t that bad: it only records a hash of users’ Iris scans, containing limited information about them.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is the possibility that the iris hashes leak some amount of medical data (sex, ethnicity, perhaps medical conditions), but this leak is far smaller than what could be captured by pretty much any other mass data-gathering system in use today (eg. even street cameras),” wrote Vitalik. “On the whole, to me, the privacy of storing iris hashes seems sufficient.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Centralization Is A Problem</h2>
<p>That said, Worldcoin may be limited from accessing the entire global population as its founders intend. As Vitalik notes, doing so would require placing Orb hardware devices across the world for people to use, including in jurisdictions like the United States, where regulatory uncertainty looms around how such projects should be allowed to their tokens.</p>
<p>Worldcoin also has multiple centralized points: its top-level governance, its orb manufacturing, and potentially proprietary algorithms for ensuring authentic participants in the Worldcoin system. Founders claim the project intends to decentralize with time, but this could fail like decentralization attempts before it.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This could happen because of the common trap of federated protocols: one manufacturer ends up dominating in practice, causing the system to re-centralize,” Vitalik stated.</p></blockquote>
<p>WLD is already prepped for listing on multiple large crypto exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, Kucoin, and Bitmart.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has remained relatively calm over the past couple of weeks, with Bitcoin stuck between the $29000-$30000 price range. However, major tokens are starting to show slightly bearish sentiments, with BTC now down 3.7% in the last 7 days.</p>
<p>The negative outlook is more pronounced in Pepe coin as the token has depreciated nearly 14% over the past week.</p>
<p>However, while Pepe struggles, new meme token Evil Pepe Coin is showing bullish growth, having raised over $650,000 in its presale.</p>
<h2><strong>Pepe Coin Struggles As Crypto Market Eyes The Upcoming Fed Meeting</strong></h2>
<p>The market’s lack of volatility has not stopped bears from taking control of Pepe’s price direction.</p>
<p>The token has plummeted almost 14% over the past 7 days, bringing its total loss since July 14 to over 27%. Its technical analysis also points to further struggles as TradingView gives a Sell signal to the token in the daily time frame.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-22.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262282" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-22.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-22.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-22-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-22-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Not only is $PEPE underperforming with most moving average indicators, but oscillator indicators such as MACD have also turned red.</p>
<p>Pepe became a global meme coin phenomenon back in April and May of this year as its 10,000% rally turned several small-scale traders into millionaires. A pseudonymous trader turned his $273 investment in $PEPE into $13 million worth of profits.</p>
<p>However, Pepe’s lack of concrete utility prevents the token from breaking its correlation with the broader crypto market. Whales and smart money investors dumping their $PEPE holdings during market uncertainty has become all too common.</p>
<p>Experts believe that the crypto market is primed for a strong price movement in either direction, with the upcoming FOMC meeting on the 26th of July a major deciding factor.</p>
<p>With the recent inflation data pointing to cooling inflation levels, investors were certainly hoping that the Federal Reserve will stick to its decision to pause further interest rate hikes.</p>
<p>However, according to the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CME FedWatch tool</a>, the likelihood of another 25 basis points hike is extremely high.</p>
<p>The Fed’s restrictive monetary policy has an adverse impact on the liquidity of the crypto market, resulting in a strong depreciation across the market. High-risk assets such as Pepe are particularly at risk.</p>
<h2><strong>Evil Pepe Presale Turns Heads with Token Having Already Raised $650k</strong></h2>
<p>Despite Pepe and other meme coins struggling, new tokens continue to enter the crypto market with bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>The recently announced <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_evilpepe_35234?referrer=pepe-coin-price-drops-almost-14-in-7-days-but-evil-pepe-coin-continues-to-surge" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evil Pepe Coin</a> is off to a great start in the presale as it has raised $640k in just over one week.</p>
<p>The meme coin’s narrative has certainly struck a chord with the community as it tells investors to get in touch with their “dark side” and put their faith in the Evil Pepe token.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-31.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262281" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-31.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="235" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-31.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-31-300x117.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-31-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Investors are lining up to the presale as copycat versions of Pepe, such as Pepe 2.0 and Saudi Pepe, have displayed remarkable price growth in the recent past.</p>
<p>The token is a true low-cap gem and its presale has a hard cap of just $1,996,002. However, with 90% of the tokens available in the presale itself, investors have ample opportunity to get in early at the fixed price of $0.000333.</p>
<p>The remaining 10% of the token supply has been reserved for decentralized exchange liquidity, which will be locked for one month. This prevents the chance of price manipulation or rug pulls after the launch.</p>
<p>Investors looking to purchase the $EVILPEPE token can swap ETH or USDT tokens in exchange for it.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Deaton said the SEC was so desperate that it asked Judge Torres to adopt a standard that the 2nd Circuit never had.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Deaton, crypto lawyer and legal representative of XRP holders in the lawsuit between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has slammed haters and critics of Judge Analisa Torres, insisting that her recent decision in the ongoing case is &#8220;very sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a lengthy Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1683321401690976256?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">thread</a>, Deaton outlined why Judge Torres&#8217; decision was the correct ruling, despite claims that it was inconsistent with policy considerations behind the 1934 Securities Act.</p>
<h2>Deaton Slams Judge Torres&#8217; Critics</h2>
<p>Deaton explained that thousands of XRP holders acquired the crypto asset for non-investment purposes. He noted that a majority of first-time purchasers were unaware that the company called Ripple existed or that it owned half of all the XRP.</p>
<p>The lawyer insisted that most first-time buyers bought the asset because it was in the top three cryptocurrencies and cheap. Its transactions are settled within 3-5 seconds &#8211; compared to Bitcoin, which takes 10 minutes to an hour &#8211; and cost about a fraction of a cent to transfer $1m, unlike Ethereum.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Deaton stated that the SEC was so <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/stuttering-sec-chair-gary-gensler-disappointed-at-ripple-victory/" data-wpel-link="internal">desperate</a> that it asked Judge Torres to adopt a standard that the 2nd Circuit never had. He argued that the Commission failed to establish the common enterprise factor because it could not satisfy the third Howey factor.</p>
<h2>The SEC Would Need More Than Luck</h2>
<p>The crypto lawyer explained that horizontal commonality must exist for a common enterprise to be established. The horizontal commonality exists when investors&#8217; assets are pooled, and the fortunes of each of them are tied to that of others as well as to the success of the overall enterprise.</p>
<p>According to the law, XRP holders are not in a common enterprise with each other or Ripple because some investors can choose to loan or stake their assets to benefit financially while others do not. Using the bankruptcy of crypto lender Celsius Network as an instance, Deaton explained that XRP holders who loaned the firm their assets suffered losses while Ripple and other investors did not.</p>
<p>After reviewing Judge Torres&#8217; win in the appeals of previous summary judgment decisions, Deaton insisted the Ripple vs. SEC case was a &#8220;simple strict application&#8221; of factors in the Howey test. He asserted that the SEC would <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/has-ripple-xrp-won-or-will-the-sec-appeal-what-will-happen-next/" data-wpel-link="internal">need</a> more than luck to reverse the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-secondary-sales-of-xrp-not-an-investment-contract-judge-rules-following-over-3-year-long-legal-battle/" data-wpel-link="internal">ruling</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Nothing more, nothing less. Judge Torres did her job, and some people don&#8217;t like it. Too bad. The law won,&#8221; Deaton said.</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solana ($SOL) has seen its price plummet by 24% in the past ten days as crypto traders have become increasingly bearish on the token&#8217;s prospects.</p>
<p>The massive sell-off of $SOL has halted the token&#8217;s prolonged uptrend that began in mid-June.</p>
<p>As such, traders appear to be shifting their focus to BTC20 ($BTC20) – a brand-new presale project offering enticing staking rewards and an eco-friendly approach.</p>
<h2>$SOL Price Chart Flashes Warning Signs as Token Nears Vital EMA</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, the Solana price is hovering around $24.53 – and has closed in the red in five of the last eight days.</p>
<p>As evident from the daily price chart, $SOL peaked at the $32.00 level on July 14 before it began a sustained downtrend that continues to the present day.&#8221;</p>
<p>This downtrend means that $SOL is nearing the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) – a crucial metric for identifying a token&#8217;s short-term trend.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-30.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262261" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-30.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-30.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-30-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-30-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>If $SOL were to dip below this EMA, it could signal further downside for the token in the short term.</p>
<p>However, Solana bulls will be hoping that the 20-day EMA holds as support since this could provide the impetus needed for a reversal.</p>
<p>This scenario seems viable, given that <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko</a> sentiment analysis reveals that 67% of the community is still “feeling good” about Solana’s prospects.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Crypto Fear &amp; Greed index</a> is still in &#8220;Greed&#8221; territory – hinting that Solana&#8217;s ongoing woes may be temporary.</p>
<h2>Solana Price Slide – What Has Caused the Sell-Off?</h2>
<p>So, why has Solana’s price been sliding?</p>
<p>The most obvious reason lies in the token&#8217;s technical indicators. On July 14, just before $SOL&#8217;s drastic decline, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reached 82.70 – significantly into &#8220;overbought&#8221; territory.</p>
<p>When a token is in overbought territory, it indicates a high chance that profit-taking will ensue, which appears to be what has happened with Solana.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Solana’s sell-off intensified as more traders became aware of the price dip, resulting in a negative feedback loop that prompted even more traders to liquidate their holdings.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-29.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262260" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-29.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-29.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-29-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-29-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>In addition, market sentiment surrounding Solana continues to be undermined by regulatory concerns.</p>
<p>In early June, the SEC, in its lawsuits against Binance.US and Coinbase, categorized Solana as security – a claim that the SOL Foundation vehemently denied.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this statement by the SEC has cast a shadow of uncertainty over the future of Solana.</p>
<p>Thus, despite Solana’s robust technology and growing ecosystem, until these regulatory challenges are cleared, the token’s price may continue to be affected by fears around its legal status in the US.</p>
<h2>Which Tokens Are Traders Backing to Outperform Solana?</h2>
<p>As Solana struggles with technical and regulatory issues, traders have started looking at alternatives they believe have more upside potential.</p>
<p>One such token rapidly gaining traction is BTC20 – a brand-new ERC-20 token designed to provide attractive staking rewards.</p>
<h2>BTC20 Presale Causes Buying Frenzy as Traders Snap Up Bitcoin-Inspired Stake-to-Earn Token</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b__34851?referrer=heres-why-solana-has-tanked-24-as-interest-in-btc20-soars" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BTC20 ($BTC20)</a>, despite being new to the crypto scene, has already attracted significant attention from the trading community.</p>
<p>The project’s presale has become an instant hit with investors, raising over $1.5 million in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>This has established BTC20&#8217;s credibility in the saturated crypto market and demonstrated the growing hype around the token ahead of the planned exchange listings once the presale concludes.</p>
<p>Much of this hype is driven by BTC20&#8217;s innovative stake-to-earn mechanism, designed to incentivize long-term holding of $BTC20 by rewarding participants with additional tokens over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-23.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262259" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-23.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="295" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-23.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-23-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-23-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Per BTC20’s <a href="https://btc20.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, this mechanism also uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) setup – making it far less energy intensive than Bitcoin mining (and better for the environment).</p>
<p>Adding to BTC20&#8217;s growing appeal is the fact that the token is built on the Ethereum blockchain, opening doors to potential integration with thousands of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<p>These factors have combined to cause a stir in the BTC20 <a href="https://t.me/BTC20Token" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram community</a>, with early investors eager to see how the token performs on the open market.</p>
<p>All in all, with $BTC20 available through the presale for just $1 and over half of the presale supply already snapped up, the signs are strong that this token could be a potential game-changer worth keeping an eye on.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The number of XRP whales owning 100M+ tokens has surged to 199, marking an 11-week high. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One factor playing a role in the new trend could be Ripple&#8217;s court victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which fueled a price increase for XRP and renewed optimism in the entire cryptocurrency space.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Accumulating Again</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The crypto analytics platform – Santiment &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1683054955350065152/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">estimated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that there are now 199 XRP whales, each of whom holds at least 100 million coins.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Santiment also determined that those participants had begun an accumulation mode in mid-July when Ripple (the enterprise blockchain provider behind XRP) <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-explodes-16-as-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ripple-in-sec-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">won</a> a landmark victory against the US SEC. Prior to that (between April and July), investors were predominantly dumping their holdings. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The major win has acted as a catalyst for the price of the digital asset, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">boosting</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> it to as high as $0.95. XRP&#8217;s market capitalization also skyrocketed, briefly surpassing that of BNB. As of the moment of writing these lines, though, Binance&#8217;s native token stands as the fourth biggest crypto asset, while XRP is back in the fifth position (per CoinGecko&#8217;s data).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Regardless, Ripple&#8217;s native token has been one of crypto&#8217;s biggest stars and best performers in the past few weeks.

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SEC&#8217;s Possible Appeal</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite Ripple&#8217;s recent triumph, the legal battle with the American securities regulator seems far from over.

<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Ripple creates an artificial distinction between the expectations of sophisticated institutional and retail investors, improperly transforms Howey&#8217;s reasonable investor inquiry into a subjective one, and turns on its head the reasoning underlying Howey and other cases,&#8221; the watchdog claimed. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some have argued that the SEC&#8217;s discontent could trigger a potential court appeal, meaning the legal battle could drag on for another two years (at least).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, prominent figures in the crypto space argued that a restart of the lawsuit (even if it happens) would not automatically mean that the regulator will emerge victorious. John Deaton &#8211; Managing Partner of the Deaton Law Firm &#8211; and Scott Melker (more popular as &#8220;The Wolf of All Streets&#8221;) are two examples. The latter stated on Twitter:</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>For at least the next two years (appeal and decision) and likely forever, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">$XRP</a> is not a security.</p>
<p>And neither are most altcoins by the same rationale.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin dipped to $29,000 for the first time since June 21.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With bitcoin sliding further below the $30,000 line, the value of liquidated positions has increased to almost $150 million on a daily scale.</p>
<p>As expected, most were from long positions, with the largest one taking place on OKX.</p>
<ul>
<li>It was less than two weeks ago when the primary cryptocurrency was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/btc-above-30k-for-the-first-time-since-april-ripple-xrp-reclaims-0-5-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">riding high</a> following Ripple&#8217;s partial court victory against the SEC. BTC, along with the rest of the market, soared to new multi-year peaks.</li>
<li>However, the market failed to maintain its run, and BTC slipped back down to a tight range between $30,000 and $30,500.</li>
<li>The asset dipped below the round-numbered milestone during the weekend before the bears pushed it further south today.</li>
<li>This time, the nosedive took bitcoin all the way down to $29,000, which became its lowest price point since the leg up on June 21, which came after BlackRock filed for a spot BTC ETF.</li>
<li>Most larger-cap altcoins have suffered just as badly, if not worse, than BTC. XRP has lost almost 7% of value in a day and sits below $0.7. More losses come from the likes of LINK, XLM, ICP, TONCOIN, and others.</li>
<li>In fact, Dogecoin is the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/doge-defies-market-sentiment-with-7-surge-btc-remains-under-30k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">only cryptocurrency in the green today</a>, perhaps fueled by the developments at Twitter.</li>
<li>This enhanced volatility has <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">harmed</a> over-leveraged traders, as the total number of liquidated ones has skyrocketed to over 50,000.</li>
<li>The total value of wrecked positions is just shy of $150 million, with over 90% being from long ones. The largest single liquidated position was on OKX, it involved BTC and was worth more than $2.5 million.</li>
</ul>
