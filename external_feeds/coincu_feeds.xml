<p>King Charles endorsed a measure providing authorities the authority to regulate crypto and stablecoins on Thursday, marking the last formal step before the bill becomes law.</p>



<p>The UK Government has been working on the Financial Services and Markets Bill for quite some time, and it believes that its passage will play a central role in delivering the Government&#8217;s vision of growing the economy and creating an open, sustainable, technologically advanced financial services sector, and it includes measures to bring crypto and stablecoins under regulation. The law was adopted by Parliament&#8217;s upper house last week.</p>



<p>Andrew Griffith, the Treasury&#8217;s Economic Secretary, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/rocket-boost-for-uk-economy-as-financial-services-and-markets-bill-receives-royal-assent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This landmark piece of legislation gives us control of our financial services rulebook, so it supports UK businesses and consumers and drives growth.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Among other things, the FSMB establishes a clear route for crypto assets to be regulated as financial products in order to facilitate their safe adoption in the United Kingdom. The necessity to release a functioning regulation remains one of the most pressing issues in the United States, and the clear progress in the United Kingdom has sparked fears that America would lag behind in adopting future innovation.</p>

<p>The recently signed Bill in the United Kingdom is significantly more comprehensive since it considers wider innovation using blockchain technology. Significantly, the Act provides &#8220;sandboxes&#8221; that potentially promote the deployment of innovative technologies like blockchain in financial markets.</p>



<p>The measure, filed in July 2022, provides authorities more control over the financial sector, including cryptocurrency. As the law was being considered in Parliament, modifications were made to treat all cryptocurrency as a regulated activity and to control cryptocurrency advertisements. The law also includes stablecoins in the scope of payment regulations.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2215.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="420" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2215.png" alt="BREAKING: UK Now Admits Crypto As Regulated Financial Activity In The Country" class="wp-image-198982" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2215.png 640w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2215-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="BREAKING: UK Now Admits Crypto As Regulated Financial Activity In The Country 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Treasury, Financial Conduct Authority, Bank of England, and Payments Systems Regulator in the UK will soon be able to develop and enforce regulations governing the industry. The United Kingdom has now set a positive example for other countries trying to control the crypto environment by assenting to the Bill.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Solana-based Cardinal protocol, which raised $4.4M in July 2022, is shutting down due to the challenging macro environment. It offered NFT leasing, staking, ticketing, and custody services.</strong></h5>

<p>Solana protocol Cardinal announced that it will gradually close its protocols, including NFT leasing, staking, ticketing, custody, and other functions. The project, which completed a $4.4 million seed round of financing in July 2022, is led by Solana Ventures and Protagonist, with participation from Animoca Brands and others. Cardinal blamed the difficult macro environment for its closure.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Everyone, we have some unfortunate news to share <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>After a lot of reflection, we’ve decided to begin the process of winding down our protocols. Let&#39;s dive into it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b07.png" alt="⬇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>&mdash; Cardinal (@cardinal_labs) <a href="https://twitter.com/cardinal_labs/status/1674092964124176387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Although Cardinal has seen some real usage of its staking, rentals, and identity products, the team still feels like they’re stuck in the context of the crypto maximalist community. They’d hoped that the rest of the world’s industries would have begun adopting blockchain tech at a larger scale by now, but that still feels a ways away.</p>



<p>Cardinal believes that utility and intrinsic value will take center stage for digital assets when the day comes that the rest of the world begins adopting blockchain tech at a larger scale. The Cardinal team hopes that their vision for digital assets will continue to inspire others going forward. The team assures users that all assets are completely safe, and they will all have been returned to their rightful owners by the end of the process.</p>



<p>During the two-month notice period, which runs from June 28 to August 26, Cardinal recommends that any and all depositors of assets into their systems manually withdraw them. All of Cardinal&#8217;s website product UIs will remain live during the period so that no one should have any issue doing so.</p>



<p>For the next few weeks, all of Cardinal&#8217;s protocols will work exactly as they do currently. On July 19, Cardinal will disable all new deposit instructions across all protocols so that the only operation that can be done for the remainder of the notice period is a withdrawal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This means that among others, the following operations will be disabled on 7/19:<br><br>Staking<br>Stake Pool creation<br>Token Manager creation in any context (rental listing, etc.)<br>New NFT rentals and rental extensions<br>Namespaces name linking (social media handles and otherwise)</p>&mdash; Cardinal (@cardinal_labs) <a href="https://twitter.com/cardinal_labs/status/1674093004490166272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>At the end of the notice period, Cardinal will forcibly withdraw all remaining deposits and return them to depositor addresses. Among other things, this will include tokens that are still staked, unallocated stake pool rewards, and NFTs wrapped with token managers (rentals, etc.).</p>



<p>Cardinal will take down its UIs and remove its smart contract deployments from Solana. In the process of removing the smart contracts, Cardinal will return the SOL denominated rent stored in all accounts to the relevant account’s initial fee/rent payer.</p>



<p>For teams that use Cardinal&#8217;s protocols via CPI from other smart contracts in different business contexts, Cardinal encourages them to consider the implications of their timeline on their platforms/systems. Cardinal is happy to discuss trivial solutions to migrating away from their protocols on a case-by-case basis for any team that needs assistance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Worldcoin has partnered with Okta to launch an identification system called World ID in Germany.</em></li>



<li><em>The integration allows developers to incorporate &#8220;Sign in with Worldcoin&#8221; as an authentication option alongside other popular platforms.</em></li>



<li><em>Biometric data, such as iris scans, will be available to German users through hardware called &#8220;Orbs.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://coincu.com/192080-is-worldcoin-attractive-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldcoin</a>, the crypto project of OpenAI Founder Sam Altman, has been merged with identity management software Okta and is launching its identification system World ID in Germany.</strong></h5>

<p>Okta&#8217;s Auth0 marketplace now includes a &#8220;Sign in with Worldcoin&#8221; option for authentication solutions, allowing developers to utilize it as a login option for their apps alongside Google or Facebook. Sam Altman&#8217;s project has 1.9 million users in 30 countries, according to World App.</p>



<p>Biometric data will be available to German users. Create hardware for complete verification. The gear is named &#8220;Orbs,&#8221; and it will be marketed across Germany, beginning in Berlin.</p>



<p>According to the project, the Auth0 integration is the first comprehensive implementation of Sign in with Worldcoin. Signing in with Worldcoin is comparable to typical social single sign-on, which enables users to access various apps or websites with a single set of login credentials.</p>

<p>Okta is a supplier of identity and access management software with hundreds of millions of users. To be properly confirmed by the Worldcoin system, individuals must have their irises scanned at one of the Orbs, which are located in certain areas across the globe. Orbs scan users&#8217; irises and utilize artificial intelligence to generate one-of-a-kind codes, known as cryptographic IDs. The biometric data is converted into an ID in near real-time, and the resultant digital key is kept on users&#8217; devices. The Orb does not keep data taken throughout the procedure by default.</p>

<p>With the goal of introducing cryptocurrencies to over a billion people, Worldcoin is certainly one of the most ambitious and legitimate projects. Worldcoin has the potential to be the largest crypto entry, accompanied by the most widely used crypto wallet, and, most importantly, it will bring a new concept to the Internet &#8211; Proof of Personhood &#8211; by using an innovative distribution mechanism.</p>



<p>When users Sign in with Worldcoin, a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is created on their device, attesting to their &#8220;Proof of Personhood&#8221; without providing any unneeded personal information. Evidence of personality, in turn, aids in the prevention of fraud and bots.</p>

<p>The big bang that revolutionized the whole gambling scene across various continents was cryptocurrency. Its formation led to the development of many quality features that, as of now, many punters can do without. Aside from the gambling industry, coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin greatly affected the financial and online sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, cryptocurrencies are more than a means of payment or seen as a substitute for fiat currencies. They have become an entity on their own, which has led to numerous blockchain technology advancements. Most importantly, they are the backbone of crypto gambling platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, for gamblers who want to <a href="https://cryptomaniaks.com/bitcoin-gambling-sites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn more about crypto gambling</a>, they need to have a little bit of knowledge about blockchain technology. The success of Bitcoin gambling sites is simply because their growth was exponential to the extent that nobody saw it coming. This article will examine its rise, the benefits, and the risks associated with wagering on Bitcoin gambling sites.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Crypto Gambling Sites Exponential Growth in the Industry</h2>



<p>It takes a lot to convince a gambler to abandon fiat gambling sites and move to a newer form of gambling. But Bitcoin gambling platforms did it so easily and very quickly. Many punters have grown accustomed to the operations of fiat currency gambling sites; the majority started their gambling journey from these platforms. We all know that many gamblers, primarily traditional gamblers, dislike change, but they do welcome the new bonuses these sites provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Bitcoin came into the online gambling sector, the benefits it came with were very numerous. So, no matter how much gamblers loved fiat currency gambling platforms, Bitcoin wagering sites&#8217; good bonuses and features were too difficult to ignore. The main reason for Bitcoin gambling platforms&#8217; success is that they offered gamblers a perfect means to use their Bitcoin and gave them better chances of making profits. Moreover, making profits from your bets is what gambling is all about.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Benefits of Using Crypto Gambling Sites</h2>



<p>The fact that crypto sites are more beneficial than fiat gambling sites is now notable amongst bettors. Many newbies might not know the benefits they offer or what to expect from a crypto gambling platform. Below we&#8217;ve outlined some of the benefits of using crypto gambling sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Security </h3>



<p>Crypto gambling platforms pride themselves in their security, and the level of safety on their sites is top-notch. The security of a gambling platform is no joking matter; it must be of good quality. This security is because these platforms move thousands of currencies daily, all of which are customers&#8217; money. Based on the fact that they control large profits, they become targets of hackers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fiat currency gambling platforms, you must put your banking details, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>credit card</strong></a> information, and other wallet details. So, if fraudsters hack these platforms, the hackers will have access to these details. So, to avoid issues like this, crypto-gambling sites are encrypted.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sites are Heavily Regulated </h3>



<p>When we talk of regulation, we do not mean from the government but rather something else. Fiat currency sites have heavy restrictions by the government of residence because they operate with the country&#8217;s currency, so every transaction must be reported. For this reason, fiat gambling sites are very limited in their options.</p>



<p>Crypto gambling sites are regulated by their license providers, ensuring punters follow every proposed law. Their restrictions are flexible, and they are usually in customers&#8217; favor. These license holders ensure the cryptocurrency gambling site is committed to a fair gaming policy. So, it means you have better chances of making profits on licensed platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fast Deposits and Withdrawals </h3>



<p>To claim that transactions made on cryptocurrency gambling sites happen instantly would be crazy, but we can state that they are the fastest form of payment in the gambling industry. Compared to fiat currency sites, crypto gambling platforms do exceedingly well in providing quick and seamless transactions for their customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/c/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thanks to Bitcoin</a>, gamblers don&#8217;t have to worry about slow transactions or payment delays. No more waiting 3 to 5 working days to get your profits. With Bitcoin or Litecoin, you have to select your desired amount, which is instantly credited to your wallet address.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">These platforms have low transaction Fees.</h3>



<p>Transactions done with Bitcoin do not involve any third-party agency. It means there are no middlemen when processing transactions, so that no additional fee will be imposed on you. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041615/what-difference-between-fiat-money-and-representative-money.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fiat</a> gambling sites&#8217; payment methods employ a lot of third-party platforms, further increasing the processing time and the cost of transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some gambling platforms may have a fixed percentage cost attached to their withdrawals. However, they are way cheaper when compared to fiat currency sites.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Risks Associated with Using Crypto Gambling Sites</h2>



<p>There are some flaws to Bitcoin and its gambling platforms, but they aren&#8217;t that profound.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Price of Bitcoin is Volatile </h3>



<p>You can never tell how Bitcoin&#8217;s price will flow or when it will happen. The number of Bitcoins in circulation is limited, making it challenging to keep up with the high demand. For this reason, it is advisable as a gambler not to keep your Bitcoin stagnant for a long time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Transactions are Untraceable </h3>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s anonymity is both a blessing and a curse for gamblers. Its transactions are untraceable, so sending your coin to the wrong address cannot be reversed. So, there is nothing the <a href="https://coincu.com/158514-top-bitcoin-gambling-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gambling platform</a> can do to help you, so you must be careful when making cryptocurrency payments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Learning more about Bitcoin gambling sites is the best step if you are considering switching to cryptocurrencies for your online wagering activities. Find the best ways to store your coin and follow other gamblers&#8217; practices for the first few periods to avoid going astray. Thanks to this article, you already have a starting point of knowing what to expect from an excellent Bitcoin gambling site.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance denied a custodial license in Germany, unclear if formal decision.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange faces regulatory challenges and investigations in multiple countries.</em></li>



<li><em>SEC lawsuit accuses the exchange of violating securities rules and evading regulation.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance was developing its own license in Germany and planned to grow with it, but Germany&#8217;s financial authority has opted not to award Binance a custodial license, according to the news journal <em><a href="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-lizenz-deutschland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Finance Forward</a></em> on Thursday, citing persons familiar with the subject.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>According to the article, it is unclear if the refusal was a formal decision made by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) or an intention indicated during continuing conversations.</p>



<p>According to a BaFin representative, the authority does not comment on specific enterprises. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Binance stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;While we cannot share details of our discussions with regulators, we are continuing to work to meet BaFin requirements. It is an ongoing process. We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures in place to continue our discussions with the regulators in Germany.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moreover, corporate partners are pulling away, including the European banking partner <a href="https://coincu.com/198896-binance-european-banking-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paysafe</a>, according to <em>Reuters</em>. The news comes as Binance, the world&#8217;s biggest crypto exchange by trading volume, has been chastised by banking authorities in Europe and the United States.</p>

<p>The new lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the crypto exchange and its founder Changpeng Zhao, in particular, is expected to complicate procedures throughout the globe. At the same time, the SEC accused Binance of repeatedly breaking securities rules, ignoring local laws, and dodging regulatory inspection.</p>

<p>Binance withdrew its application for regulatory certification in Austria on June 26. The exchange announced its pullout from the Netherlands earlier this month after failing to get regulatory permission. It has also moved to deregister its local company in Cyprus and is being investigated in France for significant money laundering. Belgium&#8217;s regulator ordered Binance to halt operations in the nation last week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korean crypto-finance firm Delio applies for bankruptcy proceedings through law firm LKB &amp; Partners amid class-action lawsuit from customers.</em></li>



<li><em>South Korean crypto-finance firm suspended withdrawals, citing Haru Invest impact, but later announced resumption of certain crypto deposit and withdrawal services starting June 28.</em></li>



<li><em>South Korean crypto-finance firm&#8217;s creditors seek legal recourse as bankruptcy proceedings reflect challenges and uncertainties faced by the company, highlighting the importance of due diligence and cautious decision-making in the rapidly changing crypto-finance industry.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Delio have reportedly applied to the Seoul Bankruptcy Court through law firm LKB &amp; Partners to initiate bankruptcy proceedings for the company. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance-1024x614.jpeg" alt="Delio Crypto-Finance Company Goes Bankrupt Amidst Creditor Chaos" class="wp-image-198942" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance-1024x614.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance-300x180.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance-768x461.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance-750x450.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance-1140x684.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Delio Crypto-Finance Company Goes Bankrupt Amidst Creditor Chaos 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The move comes as the law firm also files a class-action lawsuit against Haru Invest and Delio, according to sources familiar with the matter cited by Chosun Biz.</p>



<p>South Korean crypto-finance firm made headlines when it announced the suspension of withdrawals, citing the impact of Haru Invest. Furthermore, South Korean prosecutors imposed travel bans on key executives of Delio, preventing them from leaving the country. These developments raised concerns among investors and customers of Delio.</p>



<p>On June 26, Delio announced that it would resume certain cryptocurrency deposit and withdrawal services starting from June 28. This move may provide some relief to users who were affected by the suspension and were unable to access their funds.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="768" height="527" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance-1.jpeg" alt="Delio Crypto-Finance Company Goes Bankrupt Amidst Creditor Chaos" class="wp-image-198943" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance-1.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance-1-300x206.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/South-Korean-crypto-finance-1-750x515.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" title="Delio Crypto-Finance Company Goes Bankrupt Amidst Creditor Chaos 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The application for bankruptcy proceedings by Delio&#8217;s creditors reflects the challenges and uncertainties faced by the firm, as well as the concerns of those who have invested in or dealt with the company. The court&#8217;s involvement will play a crucial role in determining the future course of action for Delio and its stakeholders.</p>



<p>The class-action lawsuit filed against Haru Invest and Delio by the law firm LKB &amp; Partners adds another layer of legal complexity to the situation. This action suggests that there may be grievances and allegations of wrongdoing that have prompted the creditors to seek legal recourse.</p>



<p>As the South Korean crypto-finance industry continues to evolve, cases like Delio&#8217;s serve as a reminder of the importance of due diligence and cautious decision-making when engaging with cryptocurrency platforms and financial services. Customers and investors are advised to stay informed and exercise caution while navigating this rapidly changing landscape.</p>

<p>The airdrop application process provides users with an opportunity to enter the testing phase and explore the functionalities of the SPACE ID protocol. By participating in the airdrop, users can engage with the decentralized identity ecosystem and experience the benefits it offers.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity solutions aim to empower individuals by giving them control over their personal data and digital identities. By leveraging blockchain technology, these solutions offer enhanced security, privacy, and interoperability. SPACE ID is at the forefront of this movement, providing a platform for users to create and manage their decentralized identities.</p>



<p>The overwhelming response to the SPACE ID Season 2 Journey reflects the growing recognition of the importance of decentralized identity in the digital landscape. With hundreds of thousands of addresses actively participating, it demonstrates the increasing demand for innovative identity solutions that prioritize user control and privacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance is experiencing regulatory scrutiny and facing challenges with its banking partners.</em></li>



<li><em>Paysafe Payment Solutions, the exchange&#8217;s European banking partner, will stop selling its integrated wallet solution to the platform in the European Economic Area from September 25.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange is also facing regulatory issues in Australia and Canada.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>As the crypto exchange Binance continues to undergo regulatory scrutiny throughout the world, banking partners have begun to distance themselves from the exchange.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2203.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2203-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Still In Crisis In Europe As Another Banking Partner Leaves" class="wp-image-198914" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2203-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2203-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2203-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2203-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2203.png 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Still In Crisis In Europe As Another Banking Partner Leaves 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binances-european-banking-partner-stop-support-sept-coindesk-2023-06-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em>, Paysafe Payment Solutions, the exchange&#8217;s European banking partner, said on Thursday that it would discontinue selling its integrated wallet solution to the US cryptocurrency exchange throughout the European Economic Area (EEA) on September 25.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Paysafe and Binance are now working to mutually implement an orderly and fair process to terminate this service over the next few months,&#8221; Paysafe said in an email.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As a consequence, Binance will need to change its Euro deposit and withdrawal provider through the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). Yet, it remains unclear who the exchnage will choose following Paysafe. It has previously used payment intermediaries to get access to SEPA.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The claim comes as the exchange is being scrutinized by officials looking to crack down on money laundering.</p>



<p>After the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s regulatory action earlier this month, the crypto exchange has been losing market share. Yet, Binance retains a leading position over other worldwide cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/197924-binance-withdraws-approval-in-austria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> is under regulatory scrutiny not just in the United States but throughout the globe. Its derivatives license was revoked by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in April. After that, local banks and payment partners ceased to engage with Binance Australia. But, last month, Binance stated that it would depart Canada owing to the country&#8217;s new cryptocurrency restrictions.</p>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://protos.com/nomo-bank-latest-in-uk-to-block-binance-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protos</a></em>, Nomo Bank, a digital bank created in 2021, has also restricted consumer payments with the exchange.</p>



<p>Binance and its U.S. affiliate agreed with the SEC earlier this month to keep U.S. customer funds in the nation until the regulatory agency&#8217;s complaint is resolved. The deal assures that assets belonging to US clients will remain in the nation until the SEC&#8217;s action is resolved.</p>

<p>The Ethereum value has been a topic of debate for years, with many experts and enthusiasts predicting that the Ethereum value could reach astronomical levels in the coming years. In this article, we will explore the factors that could contribute to the Ethereum value reaching $100K by 2034.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can the Ethereum value reach $100K? </strong></h2>



<p>The Ethereum value is supported by its position as one of the most development-heavy blockchain projects in the industry, giving it a solid foundation for future growth. While rival networks have emerged, Ethereum remains more significant, particularly in light of pressure from regulators that has affected other networks like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC). However, Ethereum (ETH) was not deemed a security by the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), which keeps it at a reasonably safe distance from recent chaos.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Ethereum has a lot of room to grow and a lot more use cases than Bitcoin. The difference in value between the two largest crypto projects is substantial, and that gap could narrow in the future. This suggests that the Ethereum value could increase substantially in the years to come, with some even forecasting that it could reach $100K by 2034. At present, Ethereum&#8217;s value is trading at $1,856, and its market cap is around $223B.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://f14-zpc.zdn.vn/6328432829105703348/0d32e06d920f42511b1e.jpg" alt="The Ethereum market cap" title="Could Ethereum Value Reach $100K In 2034? 20"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: The TradingView &#8211; The Ethereum market cap</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some factors can make the Ethereum value up!</strong></h2>



<p>The crypto market has gained significant attention from Wall Street and traditional investment firms. Leading Wall Street companies such as Blackrock, Fidelity, INVESCO, Valkyrie, etc., have submitted applications to the SEC to register BTC ETFs. This move will allow institutional investors to invest in BTC through traditional investment vehicles such as mutual funds and ETFs.</p>



<p>In addition, the Fortune 100, the 100 largest companies in the US, have shown a growing interest in the crypto market. As of now, 52% of these companies have entered the crypto market by investing in cryptocurrencies or developing blockchain-based solutions for their businesses. This trend has been further accelerated by establishing new crypto exchanges, such as EDX, jointly established by three large companies, Citadel, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://f4-zpc.zdn.vn/1437246175987026372/006eec169e744e2a1765.jpg" alt="006eec169e744e2a1765" title="Could Ethereum Value Reach $100K In 2034? 21"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: The TradingView &#8211; The Ethereum value goes up as Elliott wave</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The crypto market has also attracted the attention of large banks such as Deutsche Bank, the top bank in Germany, and JPMorgan, one of the largest banks in the US. Deutsche Bank has registered to operate crypto custody services, while JPMorgan has launched its blockchain system called JPM coin. This move is significant because it shows that even traditional financial institutions recognize the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Finally, macroeconomic factors are also driving the trend toward cryptocurrencies. For instance, Hong Kong has welcomed crypto companies to open trading offices, which has made it easier for crypto companies to operate in the region. Meanwhile, Fed Chairman Powell believes that crypto is an asset, and stablecoins are currencies the Fed supervises. This recognition by the Fed is significant because it shows that cryptocurrencies are starting to gain legitimacy as an asset class.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://f28-zpc.zdn.vn/863307264327947068/8839d8e3a08170df2990.jpg" alt="8839d8e3a08170df2990" title="Could Ethereum Value Reach $100K In 2034? 22"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: The TradingView &#8211; The Ethereum value as RSI above 50</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>These factors combined could contribute to the Ethereum value reaching $100K in 2034. However, it is essential to note that risks are also associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, including volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Investors should consider these risks before <a href="https://coincu.com/198147-may-the-ethereum-price-reach-2000-again/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/198147-may-the-ethereum-price-reach-2000-again/">investing in Ethereum</a> or any other cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the rise of cryptocurrencies is a trend that is here to stay. With more and more institutions stepping into the crypto market, it is clear that cryptocurrencies are becoming a legitimate asset class and will significantly impact the global economy in the coming years. The potential for blockchain technology is enormous, and it is expected to revolutionize many industries, from finance to healthcare to logistics. While risks are associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, the potential rewards are significant, and investors willing to take the risk could reap substantial rewards.</p>

<p>The aim of this initiative is to consolidate and further develop the ongoing work of Eurosystem central banks in this area and gain a better understanding of how different solutions can facilitate interaction between TARGET services and the DLT platform.</p>



<p>The announcement came at the inaugural meeting of a new industry group formed by the ECB last week, as conventional financial players continue to explore cryptocurrency and the blockchain technology that underpins it.</p>



<p>A dedicated market contact group will be established to support Eurosystem&#8217;s exploration work. This group will provide expert input and help Eurosystem keep abreast of advances in the use of DLT and other new technologies in the wholesale financial markets.</p>



<p>&#8220;The ECB that the envisioned start of central bank transactions is in 2024,&#8221; testing the use of central bank money in real and mock wholesale transactions, both the document said.</p>

<p>This work is part of a broader effort by the Eurosystem to ensure that the evolution of central bank money (CBDC) keeps pace with and contributes to digital innovation in wholesale and retail payments. The pre-central bank remained a monetary anchor supporting the stability, integration, and efficiency of the European financial and payment systems.</p>



<p>The European Commission on Wednesday proposed new laws that could bolster retail CBDCs, including consumer privacy and holding limits to prevent deposits from running out of the banking system.</p>



<p>At the end of May, the ECB finalized the prototypes for the digital euro as it prepares to make a decision later this year on whether to develop the EU&#8217;s fiat currency under the new format.</p>



<p>ECB says its potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) could be designed to drive innovation &#8211; but seems more skeptical about using Web3-style distributed ledger technology and smart contracts.</p>
