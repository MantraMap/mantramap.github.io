<ul>
<li>XRP surged to new highs after a U.S. court ruled that the asset is not a security.</li>



<li>The token rose by nearly 70% in less than a day, with bulls hoping to break the $1 price point.</li>



<li>Despite the victory, there are fears that the securities watchdog may file an appeal against the ruling.</li>
</ul>



<p>Barely hours after its historic “victory”, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-overtakes-bnb-coin-as-fourth-most-valuable-crypto-as-coinbase-announces-relisting/">XRP became the fourth-largest crypto asset</a> with a market capitalization of over $40 billion, but there could be further trouble on the horizon.</p>



<p>XRP bulls are rubbing their hands in glee at the resurgence of the token after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">Ripple Labs scored a win</a> against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On July 13, the court ruled in summary judgment that the sale of XRP on exchanges did not meet the criteria for classification as an investment contract.</p>



<p>The judgment was accompanied by a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-makes-a-comeback-as-holders-bet-on-huge-upsurge-amid-ripples-groundbreaking-win-in-sec-lawsuit/">mass hysteria by the community</a> that buoyed the asset to a 52-week high of $0.8875. The value spike translates to a near 70% spike for XRP as bulls anticipate the asset class reaching $10.</p>



<p>Regarding transaction volumes, XRP has been a beehive of activity, recording over $10 billion in volume, a staggering 70% increase in under 24 hours. A contributory factor for the soaring value is the relisting of XRP on a clutch of exchanges, including Coinbase.</p>



<p>While the community continues to savour its hard-fought win, pundits have warned that the SEC could be heading on appeal. However, optimists argue that the chances of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the decision remains slim, given the antecedent of the apex court.</p>



<p>“The odds are even if they (SEC) wins at the appellate level, they’ll lose at the Supreme Court,” said ex-SEC adviser Justin Slaughter. “The Supreme Court has been very hostile to a bunch of agencies recently, on a host of issues from the APA to how staffing at agencies works.”</p>



<p>The SEC dragged Ripple Labs to court in December 2022, alleging that the firm and its executives had engaged in the sale of unregistered securities. Rather than reach a settlement with the SEC, Ripple Labs opted to slug it out in court in a case that spanned nearly three years.</p>



<p>The decision puts a dent in the SEC’s cases against Coinbase and Binance, revolving around facilitating the sale of unregistered securities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coast-is-not-yet-clear-for-ripple-labs"><strong>Coast is not yet clear for Ripple Labs</strong></h2>



<p>Although it was decided that XRP is not a security, the court ruled that the sale of the asset to institutional buyers violated U.S. capital market rules. It was discovered that the sale to institutional buyers may have netted Ripple Labs profits in excess of $600 million.</p>



<p>Ripple Labs faces another mountain to climb on the claims that its institutional sales amounted to an investment contract under the court’s litmus test.</p>



<p><em>“The most important part of the ruling is the Court found that your company broke the law and made illegal institutional sales,”</em> said U.S.-based lawyer Joe Carlasare. <em>“Your company made $700 million in unlawful profit. Good luck at the trial claiming ignorance of Howey.”</em></p>

<p>Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and CEO of Circle, operator of the USDC stablecoin, has expressed optimism about the development of Web3 in Hong Kong and the local monetary authority&#8217;s (HKMA) efforts to regulate stablecoins.</p>



<p>While acknowledging that mainland China is unlikely to open its markets to cryptocurrencies, Allaire believes that stablecoins could play a role in the internationalization of the yuan. Allaire stated in an interview with the South China Morning Post, <em>&#8220;If eventually the Chinese government wants to see the RMB used more freely in trade and commerce around the world, it may be that stablecoins are the path to do that more than the central bank digital currency.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Allaire highlighted the potential of stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, specifically mentioning a stablecoin pegged to the offshore yuan (CNH). He emphasized that stablecoins could offer a more immediate solution for the Chinese government&#8217;s goal of internationalizing the yuan compared to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>



<p>While some government officials in mainland China have shown support for Hong Kong&#8217;s efforts in the cryptocurrency industry, there is no indication that Beijing itself is warming up to crypto.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-circle-in-favor-of-hk-regulations-hk-engaged-in-cross-border-trials"><strong>Circle in Favor of HK Regulations, HK Engaged in Cross-Border Trials</strong></h2>



<p>Hong Kong is positioning itself as a global virtual asset hub and is focusing on regulating stablecoins. The HKMA has committed to introducing regulations for stablecoins by 2024, recognizing their potential impact on financial markets.</p>



<p>The Securities and Futures Commission is also working on complementary regulations for stablecoins. Circle&#8217;s USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin after Tether (USDT), is considered a regulated stablecoin issuer, and the company is encouraged by the HKMA&#8217;s prioritization of stablecoin regulations.</p>



<p>While central banks worldwide have expressed concerns about stablecoins&#8217; impact on financial stability, the HKMA has proposed that the value of reserve assets should always match the value of outstanding stablecoins as a mitigating measure. The HKMA is also researching the possibility of a digital Hong Kong dollar and is participating in a cross-border trial of the eCNY using blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Allaire believes that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and private stablecoins can coexist in a well-regulated environment. He sees CBDCs as a means for central banks to upgrade their systems but believes that private sector innovation on the public internet is distinct and valuable. Circle has a significant presence in Asia, with approximately 125 employees in the region, making it their largest non-US market.</p>



<p><em>“We’re excited that this is a priority for the Hong Kong government and it seems like it’s a real priority for the HKMA,”</em> Allaire added. <em>“That’s tremendously positive and is really motivating for us to want to be able to grow our business here.”</em></p>



<p>The regulatory initiatives and focus on stablecoins in Hong Kong align with Circle&#8217;s business goals, and the company is motivated to grow its presence in the region. Allaire&#8217;s positive outlook on stablecoins and the regulatory environment in Hong Kong demonstrates the potential for continued development and adoption of digital assets in the global financial landscape.</p>

<p>In 2021, Kraken had seemingly received a summons from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), but the exchange did not conform with the order. The IRS now intends to look into the tax liabilities of customers who used the platform to transact in cryptocurrencies between 2016 and 2020. Previously Kraken and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) had reached settlement on SEC allegations of securities law violations connected to Krakens staking service.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency exchange must now provide the IRS with access to account and transaction data under an injunction issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The IRS claimed that it required the data to identify any Kraken users who may have underreported their taxes.</p>



<p>In accordance with the decree, Kraken must divulge details regarding customers who transacted more over $20,000 in a single calendar year. This data consists of genuine or made-up names, birthdates, taxpayer identification numbers, addresses, contact details (phone and email), and other relevant data.</p>



<p>However, it appears that Kraken made every effort to protect its clients from the reach of the law. Crypto News outlet CryptoSlate claimed it had information on the matter and according to a statement obtained by the outlet Kraken said <em>“We fought the IRS because they sought intrusive and unnecessary information about U.S. clients… Were this information leaked by the IRS, it would expose Kraken clients to identity theft and other harm, which Kraken prevented.”</em></p>



<p>Users who transacted in cryptocurrencies beyond predetermined thresholds and during predetermined times were required to give Kraken their names and other identifying information. The Court, however, denied the IRS request for more Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) information, including job details, net worth, and wealth source.</p>



<p>The Kraken representative thanked the Court for rejecting many of the IRS&#8217;s demands since they thought the IRS&#8217;s first demands were too broad. Citing its successful defense in this case, the exchange emphasized its dedication to consumer security and privacy and pledged to constantly speak out for its clients.</p>



<p>Judge Joseph C. Spero said in the June 30th order <em>“The Government has a legitimate purpose for seeking the materials described in the summon. As discussed above, the summons was issued in connection with an investigation by the IRS to determine the identity and correct federal income tax liability of U.S. persons who conducted transactions in cryptocurrency during the period 2016-2020.”</em></p>



<p>The actions by both the SEC and the IRS are in line with what many see as an attack on the crypto industry in the United States. Many influential figures such as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse have vowed to leave the US if the anti-crypto climate persists. Countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom have all been much more crypto friendly and try to position themselves as crypto hubs.</p>

<p>The CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, has continued to sing Bitcoin’s praises. Fink spoke about the growing demand he is witnessing for cryptocurrencies among gold clients in the Friday interview, asserting that crypto will, in the future, “transcend any one currency.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-larry-fink-sees-immense-crypto-demand-from-gold-investors"><strong>Larry Fink Sees Immense Crypto Demand From Gold Investors</strong></h2>



<p>BlackRock boss Larry Fink sees a future where crypto serves as a universal asset.</p>



<p>During a Friday interview with CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Fink <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/blackrock-has-a-responsibility-to-democratize-investing-including-in-crypto-larry-fink-says.html">stated </a>that while he couldn’t talk about Bitcoin specifically as BlackRock had filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for permission to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, cryptocurrencies have “a differentiating value versus other asset classes.”</p>



<p>BlackRock, which is the world’s biggest asset manager with nearly $10 trillion — submitted its application for a spot crypto ETF last month, prompting institutional investors to pour capital into the sector and subsequently sparking a bull run that propelled Bitcoin to $12-month highs.</p>



<p>The BlackRock chief told <em>CNBC </em>that “more and more” gold investors had been enquiring about the role of crypto over the past five years, underscoring the role ETFs have had in democratizing access to gold, as they could do in crypto.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Moment Of Validation For Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Larry Fink further observed that crypto is an international asset that has the potential to eclipse any other currency, as it is not linked to any particular country or government.</p>



<p>“More importantly, because it’s so international, it’s going to transcend any one currency in currency valuation,” he postulated, adding that an “international crypto product” can “transcend” the problem of dollar devaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SEC had already approved a couple of futures Bitcoin ETFs back in 2021. However, the securities regulator has declined to greenlight a spot Bitcoin ETF which would give more institutional investors access to BTC without the hassle of storage. This year alone, nearly half a dozen institutional giants, including the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, BitWise, and WisdomTree have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">filed </a>fresh spot Bitcoin ETF applications in hopes of finally becoming the first to launch such an investment vehicle in the United States.</p>



<p>These applicants included vital surveillance-sharing agreements in their filings, which could prove to be the deciding factor in the SEC finally okaying their spot BTC ETFs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are working with our regulators because, as in any new market, if BlackRock’s name is going to be on it, we’re going to make sure that it’s safe and sound and protected,” Fink said during the CNBC interview.</p>



<p>Just last week, BlackRock’s Fink <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-highly-optimistic-on-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-as-ceo-larry-fink-terms-bitcoin-an-international-asset/">admitted </a>that contrary to his opinion a few years ago, he now sees Bitcoin as “digitizing gold” and that it could “revolutionize finance”.</p>



<p>Validation from the leader of the biggest asset manager in the world could help with mass adoption, further entrenching Bitcoin in mainstream usage and public consciousness.</p>

<p>According to JPMorgan, the key court ruling going partially in favor of blockchain payments firm Ripple marks a monumental win for the entire crypto industry and provides clarity on what does and doesn’t qualify as a security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-giant-win-for-crypto-industry"><strong>One Giant Win For Crypto Industry</strong></h2>



<p>On Thursday, federal district judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">ruled </a>that XRP token purchases via exchanges were not securities transactions. The decision was cheered by the crypto community and market observers like JPMorgan, who feel the outcome will help create more regulatory clarity.</p>



<p>“This ruling is undoubtedly a milestone win for the industry. It provides legal clarity and defense around what does and does not constitute a security, and that overall outcome is in favor of what many in the industry had been arguing,” strategists at JPMorgan said in a research report Friday.</p>



<p>The analysts noted that the lack of clear rules of the road had pushed large capital pools to the sidelines and also “slowed innovation, adoption, and just overall crypto ecosystem valuation”.</p>



<p>Notably, some digital asset exchanges had previously paused trading of XRP after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claimed that it was a security in December 2020. The regulator at the time <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">filed </a>a suit against the blockchain platform and its executives CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen alleging failure to register XRP as security before offering over $1.2 billion worth of tokens to the public. Exchanges including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-overtakes-bnb-coin-as-fourth-most-valuable-crypto-as-coinbase-announces-relisting/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/krakenpro/status/1679582922347520002">Kraken</a>, BitStamp, and <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1679680507871633408">Crypto.com</a> have now rushed to make XRP available to U.S. users again in the wake of the court ruling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Not Over Yet?</strong></h2>



<p>Although Ripple’s victory is incredibly bullish, the bank’s analysts believe the fight for regulatory clarity is not yet over. This is because the SEC will likely appeal the decision to the 2nd Circuit and can also continue to launch similar cases in the future.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, they think the crypto industry “has now established stronger ground for the time being, which could affect ongoing cases, and also the pace of further litigation, but at a high level, we do not think the regulatory overhang simply disappears, it just lessens.”</p>



<p>After a parabolic rally following the verdict, XRP’s price took a 7.5% tumble to settle around $0.72 at the time of publication. The fifth-biggest crypto is now back below BNB Coin (BNB) after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-overtakes-bnb-coin-as-fourth-most-valuable-crypto-as-coinbase-announces-relisting/">briefly surpassing</a> it, CoinGecko data shows.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially recognized <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-renewed-bitcoin-etf-application-featuring-coinbase-raises-questions-on-secs-scrutiny/">BlackRock’s recent spot Bitcoin ETF application</a>. As seen on its official website, the regulatory body acknowledged the ETF filing from BlackRock in a section dedicated to ETFs filed during the third quarter of the year.</p>



<p>Along with BlackRock, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs-wont-be-a-game-changer-for-crypto-industry-jpmorgan-strategists-opine/">SEC</a> also acknowledged other applications sent in by a handful of other leading asset managers. Applications from Fidelity, WisdomTreeFunds, VanEck, Galaxy Digital, Invesco US were also posted on the site.</p>



<p>It is noteworthy that Bitcoin ETF applications filed by leading investment firms like ARK Invest, 21Shares, and Bitwise Invest have already passed this stage.</p>



<p>Key figures in the cryptocurrency market have responded to the recent development. Market players have collectively shared positive sentiments regarding the update on the SEC’s website.</p>



<p>James Seyffrat, a research analyst covering Crypto and Bitcoin relation stories for Bloomberg, seems to think the market is already off to a good start. “We’re off to the races,&#8221; he asserted, adding that Valkyrie Funds’ application is next in line.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">UPDATE: There they are &#8212; SEC just acknowledged the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETF applications for <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackRock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vaneck_us?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vaneck_us</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/InvescoUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@InvescoUS</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/GalaxyDigital?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GalaxyDigital</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Fidelity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Fidelity</a>, &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/WisdomTreeFunds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WisdomTreeFunds</a>.

</div></figure>



<p>It bears mentioning that this is only one of many steps required for ETF applications to be recognized by the SEC. However, the steps are not determining factors in the approval process.</p>



<p>As Seyffrat explained; </p>



<p><em>“Gotta expect ValkyrieFunds&#8217;s application to be acknowledged on ~Monday based on recent trends. Also &#8212; as I said yesterday this is just a step in the process and does *NOT* mean these will be approved. Just that the official process has begun.”</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, anticipation for the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF has intensified following news that Europe is preparing to launch its first spot Bitcoin ETF. According to Jacobi Asset Management, the asset manager responsible for the Bitcoin ETF listing, the ETF is set to go live this July.</p>



<p>The asset manager first received approval for its application in 2021 but failed to launch the ETF due to unfavourable market conditions. After 12 months, the asset manager is ready to meet market demands, which it claims have “shifted since last summer”.</p>



<p>On the other hand, spot Bitcoin ETF applications are still pending. Although market players are not certain how long it will take to get a response from the SEC, a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-spot-bitcoin-etf-could-turn-around-btcs-fortunes-says-galaxy-digitals-ceo/">prominent figure</a> in the market is convinced that the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF could be significantly favourable for Bitcoin’s price.</p>

<p>In a major development, the judge presiding over Ripple&#8217;s case declared that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">XRP does not fall within the definition of a security</a>. According to the judge, Ripple&#8217;s sale of XRP does not constitute an investment contract. This is a win for Ripple. The judge&#8217;s ruling claimed that XRP did not meet the criteria for being a security. This decision also extends to institutional sales of XRP, which are also deemed not to be securities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-price-almost-doubled"><strong>XRP Price Almost Doubled</strong></h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1679582926110064640">Santiment</a>, a market intelligence platform, XRP price skyrocketed 87% within 3 hours. It currently ranks No. 5 on CoinMarketCap, with an instant market capitalization of $36 billion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/p1uzE-UtYe-CsODDdzJA3RWHqhfxGTtFSa-fdckszjqoM9vZGvNdB-SLf50wB5XtMqqjKfEj4E4tf5ZjTIryvNHsSl0McOfsPjZkV2yOO9IQctNsILoIRrKHkCfgE0EvGCJ82vH9TpvXqRfWHAvB98w" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Judge Torres, who provided additional context for the ruling, stated that Ripple&#8217;s programmatic sales, distribution channels, and XRP sales by Larsen and Garlinghouse do not form investment contracts. In essence, this interpretation effectively prevents categorising such transactions as securities.</p>



<p>In a broader context, the judge&#8217;s statement has implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Judge Torres&#8217; ruling specified that the classification of digital tokens sold to the public as securities is not always definitive. This may open the way for cryptocurrency sales and transactions, which is expected to revolutionize the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Only a 50/50 win</strong></h2>



<p>While this ruling has brought <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-makes-a-comeback-as-holders-bet-on-huge-upsurge-amid-ripples-groundbreaking-win-in-sec-lawsuit/">considerable relief to Ripple and XRP enthusiasts</a>, there is more to come, and the verdict is only a 50/50 win, with the court stating that a separate announcement will be issued soon detailing the date of the next hearing and a schedule of any relevant preliminary hearings.</p>



<p>XRP price predictions are all up as $600M in volume keeps XRP above $0.6 – whales are buying; XRP’s charts suggest it may be about to rally again, with its indicators starting to turn up.</p>

<p>As part of its reorganisation strategy, insolvent crypto lending platform Celsius has recently received the green light from the court to swap over its altcoin holdings into Bitcoin and Ethereum. The move comes as Celsius aims to reorganize its assets and navigate its financial challenges. According to reports, the now-defunct platform has transferred sizeable amounts of its holdings to stablecoin issuer Paxos and market maker Wintermute in an effort to increase liquidity.</p>



<p>According to Data from analytics firm Kaiko, the value of Celsius&#8217; altcoin portfolio, consisting of both liquid and illiquid assets and its own CEL currency, has experienced sharp decreases. Since the opening of the institutional exchange EDX in June, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) have seen increases. Still, most of Celsius&#8217; other assets have seen reductions ranging from -84% to -6%. The only asset that has lost more value than CEL, which made up a sizeable chunk of Celsius&#8217; altcoin holdings, is SRM, down 84% from the previous year. CEL has fallen by 83%.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency liquidity surrounding Celsius raises questions about future market effects, according to Kaiko’s analysis. Liquidity for these tokens has decreased over the past year, with overall market depth falling by 40% since 2022 and amounting to about $90 million in early July. However, according to court filings, Celsius possesses altcoins with a value much above this one, making it difficult to liquidate without suffering a significant price drop.</p>



<p>According to Kaiko, “More than 60% of altcoin market depth is concentrated on Binance and other off-shore exchanges while 30% is on U.S. exchanges.”</p>



<p>As Celsius continues to liquidate altcoins, the larger altcoin market braces for probable short-term effects. The industry keeps a careful eye on these developments because it knows that a large player like Celsius can have a big impact on the market as a whole.</p>



<p>“There is virtually no liquidity for CEL as measured by market depth, which has collapsed to just $30k, concentrated mostly on OKX and Bybit.” Kaiko’s report states.</p>



<p>Since a sizable percentage of the altcoin market depth is focused on foreign exchanges, the market may be under pressure due to Celsius&#8217; continued liquidations. The effect of a significant company like Celsius on the market continues to be a subject of curiosity as industry experts keenly monitor these developments.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Celsius has accused StakeHound in a court filing of failing to return various tokens valued at $150 million that were entrusted to the liquid staking platform.</p>



<p>The filing includes a claim of contract breach and &#8220;wilful misconduct”. The tokens in question are valued at $300,000 in Polkadot (DOT) tokens, $120,000 in Ethereum (ETH), and $30,000,000 in Polygon (MATIC). In the ongoing bankruptcy procedures, Celsius requests the return of its property and monetary damages, legal costs, and attorneys&#8217; fees.</p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/australias-big-four-bank-nba-to-mint-stablecoin-on-ethereum-algorand/">Algorand</a>, a state-of-the-art pure proof of stake network, is introducing innovative features that differentiate it from traditional proof of stake networks like Ethereum or delegated proof of stake networks like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analysts-are-predicting-a-300-explosive-rally-for-cardano-amid-impressive-fundamentals-for-ada/">Cardano</a>, according to John Woods, Chief Technical Officer (CTO) at Algorand. In a recent Twitter Video-call, he explained that Algorand&#8217;s pure proof of stake mechanism incentivizes individual participation in consensus and decentralizes the network by disincentivizing pooling.</p>



<p>In pure proof of stake, an individual is randomly and deterministically selected from the entire set of stakers to validate and propose the next block, creating a more decentralized and secure network. Woods emphasizes the importance of security in blockchains, as the technology&#8217;s consensus mechanism is the heart. Algorand&#8217;s security model relies on having at least 80% of the declared stake online during block production to prevent network disruptions.</p>



<p>To ensure decentralization, Algorand encourages a diverse set of stakers geographically and computationally. The concentration of stakes on a single machine increases the risk of network failure, so large stakeholders are advised not to run staking nodes with more than 50 million ALGO.</p>



<p>He said: <em>“Now for most of us, including myself, 50 million ALGO, is a hell of a lot of cash and we don&#8217;t have to worry about that. But for very large companies or international players or venture capitalists or other people who may have very large positions in ALGO, of course they have to be careful that they don&#8217;t centralize too much ALGO or centralize over 20% of the stake on a single machine.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-working-towards-incentivizing-stakers"><strong>Working Towards Incentivizing Stakers</strong></h2>



<p>To enhance network security, the Algorand Foundation temporarily brought more of its custodial funds online. Despite the operational burden, this move increased the amount of ALGO staked, representing around 23% of all the Algorand in circulation. However, Woods acknowledges the need to prioritize organic stake from the community and reduce the foundation&#8217;s stake to achieve a more decentralized network.</p>



<p>Woods discusses the plan to incentivize consensus participation in Algorand, similar to how stakers earn rewards in other blockchain networks. The foundation is actively exploring ways to incentivize consensus and working on easy-to-run nodes and potential participant earnings. Woods believes incentivizing consensus will encourage organic stake growth, diversify stakers, and enhance network security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Elephant in the Room: Algofi</strong></h2>



<p>In closing, Woods mentions the retirement of Algofi, a popular venue running on Algorand, expressing sadness but hoping that the funds there will be redistributed to other venues on the chain.</p>



<p>Regarding Algorand&#8217;s network security, the CTO emphasizes the importance of growing stakes in the network, making it easier for individuals to participate, and rewarding them for their contributions.</p>



<p>As Algorand continues to evolve, Woods assures that more information on incentivizing consensus will be shared in the coming weeks, alongside improvements to Algorand&#8217;s one-click nodes. The aim is to create a secure and decentralized network that benefits individual stakers and the entire ecosystem.</p>



<p>With its innovative approach to pure proof of stake and plans for incentivizing consensus, Algorand&#8217;s future looks promising as it strives to secure and enhance its popular blockchain network.</p>



<p>However, the competition it seems, was also listening in. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, known not to shy away from a quip with another blockchain, immediately responded with a tweet, he said: <em>“It might be prudent for Algorand to consider becoming a sidechain of Cardano. Always here to help.”</em></p>



<p>While it is most like meant in jest, commentators were quick to state that Hoskinson is friendly with the team at Algorand. Nonetheless, collaboration rather than working against each other seems the best way to move the industry forward.</p>

<p>Blockchain-based payment protocol company Ripple <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">notched a landmark win </a>against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday.</p>



<p>In a case that has been closely followed by attorneys and crypto industry players since late 2020, the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that Ripple did not violate federal securities laws by selling the XRP cryptocurrency on public exchanges.</p>



<p>Ripple’s court victory brought a modicum of regulatory clarity for the crypto industry, and America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said it would re-enable XRP trading. At the same time, Gemini revealed that it is considering listing the token on its platform.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-cto-it-s-time-to-relist-xrp"><strong>Coinbase CTO: “It’s Time To Relist” XRP</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple’s XRP is back on Coinbase.</p>



<p>Following the recent bullish ruling, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal announced that “it’s time to relist” the XRP token as the exchange feels comfortable allowing its trading.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>In her decision, Judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">ruled </a>that Ripple&#8217;s sale of XRP on exchanges and via algorithms did not constitute investment contracts.

<p>A slew of U.S.-based crypto exchanges suspended XRP trading in late 2020 when the SEC first <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">sued </a>Ripple. Coinbase noted Thursday that trading is “anticipated to begin later today” if liquidity conditions for the token are met. &#8220;Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our XRP-USD, XRP-USDT and XRP-EUR trading pairs will launch in phases. Support for XRP may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions,” the exchange continued.</p>



<p>Coinbase itself is in the middle of an SEC lawsuit that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">alleges </a>it was operating an unregistered securities exchange that was dealing with unregistered securities. Coinbase denied the allegations, and the case is starting to go through its pre-trial motions. Some legal commentators are <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1679534350138785792">optimistic </a>that Ripple’s win will bolster Coinbase’s case against the SEC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gemini Weighs Listing XRP</strong></h2>



<p>Crypto exchange Gemini also said Thursday that it was mulling relisting XRP.</p>



<p>“Given today&#8217;s ruling that the sale of XRP on exchanges is not a security, @Gemini is exploring the listing of XRP for both spot and derivatives trading,&#8221; the exchange postulated <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1679550388272283649">in a tweet</a>.</p>



<p>The series of bullish events saw the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-makes-a-comeback-as-holders-bet-on-huge-upsurge-amid-ripples-groundbreaking-win-in-sec-lawsuit/">price of XRP go off like a rocket</a>. It has soared by 67% since the judge’s ruling was announced. As of press time, it was changing hands at $0.78 and had become the fourth biggest crypto with a market capitalization of $41.2 billion after overtaking BNB Coin (BNB), according to CoinGecko.</p>



<p>More exchanges that had delisted XRP can be expected to follow in Coinbase’s suit and relist the asset.</p>

<p>Polygon Labs, the development team behind Ethereum scaling solution <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/polygon">Polygon</a>, has announced its new native token, POL. Through a Twitter announcement, Polygon Labs proposed an upgrade plan to replace the existing token, MATIC, with POL — thereby establishing POL as the exclusive token for all networks within the Polygon ecosystem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today, the next technical proposal of Polygon 2.0 is unveiled:<br><br>POL, the upgraded token of the Polygon protocol! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4ab.png" alt="💫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>POL is the next generation native token, designed to secure, align and grow the Polygon ecosystem.<br><br>Watch the video to get an idea how cool it is, then <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/Gn7KcHpWEY">pic.twitter.com/Gn7KcHpWEY</a></p>&mdash; Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1679427540790681600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>These networks include the Polygon mainnet, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/matic-magic-polygon-co-founder-proposes-radical-transformation-of-pos-blockchain/">Polygon zkEVM network</a>, and various Supernet chains (dedicated application chains running on the Polygon mainnet). If the proposal is accepted, POL will serve as a multi-purpose token, enabling network validators to support the operation of multiple chains using a single token.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_O1labsgjfONJaVrn3897sp_dgZpnEJ3bEJhWBR1nErZCKLmmNGWqOUGJbMJrkSjgU6M63jAHuKnjL0wMZTnAoKXcosWjlzftQt38ZUmHGl_Z9NNyzPaGMtplJv56pG5TAVHULITFYyFzuAaC44Sdg0" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Polygon Blog</figcaption></figure>



<p>Upgrading from MATIC to POL would demand an upfront technical procedure: MATIC will have to be sent to an upgraded smart contract, automatically retrieving an equivalent amount in POL. If the community supports this initiative, token holders will have sufficient time to upgrade, such as four years or longer.</p>



<p>Each community of the Polygon chains will ultimately decide which token to use as gas fees. Some may opt for POL, and token holders can utilize POL to vote on governance proposals for DApps built on Polygon, with all rewards and incentives distributed in POL.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/MATICUSD/">TradingView data</a>, after the news was released, the price of the MATIC token rose from approximately $0.73 to $0.77 within an hour, representing a growth of over 5%.</p>

<ul>
<li>Galaxy Digital CEO believes Bitcoin (BTC) will finish the year on a high following a string of positives.</li>



<li>He notes that approving a Bitcoin ETF will be instrumental in pushing the asset class to new highs.</li>



<li>The U.S. SEC currently stands in staunch opposition to a spot ETF, but a wave of applications could see it lower its guard.</li>
</ul>



<p>Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz opines that if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gives the green light for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), it will turn around the fortunes of the largest virtual currency.</p>



<p>Novogratz disclosed in an interview with BloombergTV, noting that the SEC’s thumbs up for ETFs may be construed as a “seal of approval” for the asset class. He noted that a spike in the number of ETF applications in recent months has contributed to BTC’s meteoric rise in 2023.</p>



<p>BlackRock, Ark Invest, and WisdomTree have all <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">submitted</a> their applications for a spot Bitcoin ETFs, braving multiple rejections from the SEC.</p>



<p><em>“What I do think is BlackRock, Invesco, and the group of ETF providers is a real signal that adoption is coming,”</em> said Novogratz.</p>



<p>He pointed out that after over a decade since the first ETF application, the industry has garnered enough infrastructure to support the operations of ETFs. Novogratz added that akin to the approval of a futures ETF in 2021, the SEC may approve several firms at a go, given the similarities of their applications.</p>



<p><em>“The SEC is not going to approve one, so you’re going to have these giant sales forces out there giving access to people that didn’t have access before,” </em>Novogratz said.</p>



<p>He notes that the approval will send Bitcoin’s value soaring as new investors interact with the ETFs. In the weeks following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-the-first-u-s-bitcoin-etf-debuts-grayscale-ceo-sees-an-ethereum-etf-rolling-out/">approval</a> of a BTC futures ETF, the asset reached its all-time high of $69,789.</p>



<p>However, Novogratz expressed scepticism over the SEC granting approvals before the end of the year, noting its hard stance toward cryptocurrencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-sec-s-argument-against-spot-etfs"><strong>The SEC’s argument against spot ETFs</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC has pointed out that spot BTC ETFs do not offer enough protections for individual investors, claiming that “the underlying spot market of bitcoin is subject to fraud and manipulation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the SEC rejected a batch of applications in June, it noted that the sections on a surveillance-sharing agreement with a trading platform were inadequate. Including the surveillance-sharing agreement has been described as the answer to the SEC’s concerns about price manipulation.</p>

<p>Against the odds of the broader crypto market, the value of XRP, the cryptocurrency linked to Ripple, has significantly skyrocketed, providing comfort to holders. The crypto asset has been able to draw the market&#8217;s attention following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">latest judge ruling that XRP is not a security</a>.</p>



<p>The price of XRP increased dramatically over the past hour by around 28%, passing the significant $0.6 price level. XRP holders and enthusiasts now feel more optimistic as a result of Ripple&#8217;s victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The distinctive qualities and prospective uses of XRP inside the financial sector contribute to its growing popularity.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that XRP&#8217;s path has not been without challenges. The firm behind XRP, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-not-a-security-crypto-lawyer-muses-about-lessons-from-telegram-case-for-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit/">Ripple, has been battling</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court over the cryptocurrency&#8217;s regulatory status. The result of this issue has always had a big impact on XRP&#8217;s future and its ability to function in the financial sector freely.</p>



<p>Despite the legal issues, XRP&#8217;s rigidity exemplifies the community of holders&#8217; tenacity. This development shows market participants value and see potential in crypto assets despite legislative uncertainty.</p>



<p>The peculiar position that XRP occupies in the market is another factor contributing to its growing demand. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP acts as a medium of exchange for quick and inexpensive international transactions. Because of this functionality, financial institutions and payment processors have partnered with Ripple and worked with them.</p>



<p>Investors are carefully monitoring XRP&#8217;s essential support and resistance levels as it continues to gain traction. The current support level for the coin is $0.58, while the current resistance level is $0.644. These levels will probably be important in determining the direction of XRP&#8217;s price movement as we advance.</p>



<p>Despite the enthusiasm that the recent increase in XRP&#8217;s value has generated among cryptocurrency investors, it is crucial to exercise caution, given the market&#8217;s inherent volatility. As the case moves to trial, long-term prospects for XRP will likely be impacted by regulatory changes and the legal proceedings surrounding Ripple&#8217;s SEC complaint results.</p>



<p>However, the XRP community can now celebrate this comeback as the token&#8217;s successful performance instils a spirit of optimism and fresh zeal among its fans. Although the direction of XRP is still unclear, the recent increase serves as a reminder of its resiliency and promise in the face of a complex regulatory environment.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs has scored a major court victory after the federal judge presiding over the American blockchain payments company’s case against the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that the XRP token is not a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the monumental ruling that could essentially reshape the crypto industry, XRP exploded by over 35%.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-judge-delivers-vital-summary-judgment-verdict"><strong>Judge Delivers Vital Summary Judgment Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres has granted summary judgment in favor of Ripple, indicating that the XRP token is not a security.</p>



<p>Torres asserted that programmatic sales to public buyers and distributions of XRP to Ripple’s employees did not constitute the sale of unregistered securities.</p>



<p>She, however, ruled that $728 million worth of contracts for institutional sales did constitute unregistered securities sales and those investors &#8220;would have purchased XRP with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple’s efforts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Torres noted: &#8220;Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances surrounding the Institutional Sales, the Court concludes that Ripple’s Institutional Sales of XRP constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the lawsuit <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">lodged </a>in December 2020 by the SEC against Ripple and its executives CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen, the regulator aimed to compel Ripple to stop offering XRP to customers under the assertion that XRP was a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By granting the summary judgment motion, Torres leaves the case open until a jury can weigh in at trial or if Ripple and SEC reach a settlement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP Skyrockets 35.5%</strong></h2>



<p>The positive ruling sent a ripple across the market after the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap dodged a securities classification. XRP surged from $0.45 to $0.63. This puts the token up over 35.5% as of the time of publication, according to data from CoinGecko.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto analyst Adam Cochran <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1679515809893294080">observed </a>that the ruling was a “big win for XRP” given its centralized foundation, with key figureheads, standard sales through exchanges, and formal distribution programs.</p>



<p>“We said in Dec 2020 that we were on the right side of the law and will be on the right side of history,&#8221; Ripple chief Brad Garlinghouse said in <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1679520607837253639?s=20">a tweet</a>. &#8220;Thankful to everyone who helped us get to today’s decision — one that is for all crypto innovation in the US. More to come.&#8221;</p>
