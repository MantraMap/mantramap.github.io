					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) failed to break through the $31,500 resistance level and has since retreated to a range between $30,300 and $30,800 in the past few days. The cryptocurrency has also been unable to reclaim the $31,000 territory, leading some to believe that Bitcoin bears may still have the upper hand. Despite recent signs of strength, Bitcoin&#8217;s inability to overcome key resistance levels has left many investors wary. The digital currency&#8217;s failure to break out of its current range suggests that it may be vulnerable to further losses in the short term. Liquidity Grab Sends Bitcoin Tumbling Bitcoin has been on a remarkable run since June 15th, gaining 25% in nine days. However, according to crypto analyst Justin Bennet, recent price action suggests a pullback may be in order. BTC longs have piled into the rally, but as Bennet notes, Bitcoin doesn&#8217;t usually offer free rides for those late to the party. A pullback from current levels just above $30,000 would make sense, and the price action on the 8-hour time frame looks very similar to the April swing high. Related Reading: BLUR Up By 11% Following This Announcement Bitcoin closed above $30,400 on the 8-hour trend line in April, only to close below it within the next few candles. While BTC has held up better this time, the 4-hour time frame has already broken below $30,400. The next few 8-hour candles will confirm whether this breakdown is sustained. If so, Bennet believes a pullback into the $28,000 area to flush out late BTC longs seems likely. How the Bitcoin price action develops at $27,000-$28,000 if and when tested will determine where BTC trends in July. On the other hand, a sustained break above $31,000 would suggest that bulls remain in control and expose $32,500. Nevertheless, despite the uncertain market conditions, the current uptrend in Bitcoin is far from over as long as bulls do not lose the $30,000 line.  Historical data suggests that if Bitcoin can consolidate and maintain this key level of support, there are many chances for it to continue to breach higher levels and mark new yearly highs. Conversely, the $29,500 support level will be the next floor to watch if Bitcoin succumbs to bearish pressure. A downside movement could continue if BTC drops below this level, potentially leading to a further decline toward the $27,300 line.  Related Reading: Ripple Thrives Despite Legal Battle – What’s The Market Reaction Of XRP? Despite the potential downside risks, the Bitcoin market continues to receive positive news with the applications of Fidelity and Blackrock&#8217;s Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF).

					<description><![CDATA[According to Google Trends data, interest in Bitcoin is heading to historic lows as of June 27. In a screenshot shared by a Twitter user, organic searches related to “Bitcoin” have dropped in the last six months.  Google Trends is a free tool that tracks how people search for specific terms or phrases on Google, the world’s largest search engine. Interest in a particular topic or asset can be ascertained in real time depending on the number of search terms. Currently, few users are searching for the term “Bitcoin.” Interest In Bitcoin Fast Falling Notably, BTC and crypto prices have steadily recovered after bears wiped gains last year. As an illustration, BTC is up roughly 87% when writing and trending at around 2023 highs. On the other hand, organic searches related to the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency are at multi-year lows, sharply falling in the first half of 2023. Related Reading: PEPE Coin Shines Among Top Gainers, Tallies 78% In Last Week Data from Google Trends show that interest in searches around Bitcoin is below 2018 levels and could drop lower, considering how fast the reading has been free-falling in the first half of the year. This “disinterest” in Bitcoin seemed to have been spilled over from the second half of 2022.  In the first half of last year, searches temporarily expanded before dropping. Even so, at that time, Bitcoin search readings, according to Google Trends, were lower than that registered in 2021 when it was at record highs. Based on this development, there appears to be a direct correlation between sentiment and prices, as deduced from Google Trends data on Bitcoin. BTC prices peaked at over $69,000 in November 2021 after steadily rising from late 2019. Notably, prices more than doubled as they rallied below $10,000, breaking December 2017 highs of around $20,000 and soaring to new all-time highs of about $70,000 registered in Q4 2021. When prices roared, searches related to Bitcoin, Google Trends data shows, also rose. The inverse was observed in the past 19 months when prices contracted from all-time highs, dropping by over 70% to as lows as sub-$16,000 in November 2022.  What Could Be The Cause?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Google Trends data, interest in Bitcoin is heading to historic lows as of June 27. In a screenshot <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/decodejar/status/1673446498913353729" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared</a> by a Twitter user, organic searches related to “Bitcoin” have dropped in the last six months. </p>
<p>Google Trends is a free tool that tracks how people search for specific terms or phrases on Google, the world’s largest search engine. Interest in a particular topic or asset can be ascertained in real time depending on the number of search terms. Currently, few users are searching for the term “Bitcoin.”</p>
<h2>Interest In Bitcoin Fast Falling</h2>
<p>Notably, BTC and crypto prices have steadily recovered after bears wiped gains last year. As an illustration, BTC is up roughly 87% when writing and trending at around 2023 highs. On the other hand, organic searches related to the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency are at multi-year lows, sharply falling in the first half of 2023.</p>

<p>Data from Google Trends show that interest in searches around Bitcoin is below 2018 levels and could drop lower, considering how fast the reading has been free-falling in the first half of the year. This “disinterest” in Bitcoin seemed to have been spilled over from the second half of 2022. </p>
<p>In the first half of last year, searches temporarily expanded before dropping. Even so, at that time, Bitcoin search readings, according to Google Trends, were lower than that registered in 2021 when it was at record highs.</p>
<p>Based on this development, there appears to be a direct correlation between sentiment and prices, as deduced from Google Trends data on Bitcoin. BTC prices peaked at over $69,000 in November 2021 after steadily rising from late 2019. </p>
<p>Notably, prices more than doubled as they rallied below $10,000, breaking December 2017 highs of around $20,000 and soaring to new all-time highs of about $70,000 registered in Q4 2021. When prices roared, searches related to Bitcoin, Google Trends data shows, also rose. The inverse was observed in the past 19 months when prices contracted from all-time highs, dropping by over 70% to as lows as sub-$16,000 in November 2022. </p>

<h2>What Could Be The Cause?</h2>
<p>From the current BTC price action, there is a divergence between Google Trends data on Bitcoin and prices. While prices are rising, shaking off bears of Q4 2022 and the first half of Q1 2023, interest in Bitcoin is shrinking. </p>
<p>This observation can be pinned on several factors, including increasing regulatory scrutiny of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the United States and worldwide. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[There is no disputing that cryptocurrencies are now widely accepted. Cryptocurrencies are now firmly part of the global conversation; whether it be investors trading crypto, businesses accepting it as a mode of payment, or just reports about the latest surge or crash in the crypto market. And now, according to a new ConsenSys survey, an impressive 92% of people around the world are aware of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Developing Regions Show Strong Crypto Recognition According to a recent poll conducted by the private blockchain software company ConsenSys and YouGov, 92% of people worldwide are aware of cryptocurrencies. Over 15,158 people in 15 nations, with an average age of 18, were surveyed for the report. However, while awareness of crypto is high, understanding is low. A total of 92% of respondents to the survey had heard of crypto, but only 8% could confidently say they were familiar with the general concept of Web3.

Nigeria, South Africa, and Brazil lead in the pack in crypto awareness, with 99% of Nigerian respondents demonstrating awareness of crypto and over 70% accurately guessing the definition of a blockchain. While developed nations debate regulating crypto, developing regions seem more open to innovation. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have helped to address the inherent risks of unstable currencies leading to high inflation rates and the lack of financial infrastructure for money movement that many people face in developing nations. This stands in stark contrast to the larger level of mistrust toward cryptocurrency displayed by European nations and Asian nations like Japan and South Korea.

					<description><![CDATA[The Nevada Department of Business and Industry&#8217;s Financial Institutions Division (FID) has taken action against Prime Trust, LLC. This US-based financial institution specializes in custody and settlement services for digital assets.  The FID has alleged that Prime Trust has violated Nevada regulations and has a shortfall in customer funds, which has deteriorated to a critically deficient level. As a result, the FID has filed a petition to place Prime Trust into receivership. This means that a court-appointed receiver will take control of the company&#8217;s assets and operations to protect the interests of creditors and other stakeholders. Prime Trust Accused Of Using Customer Assets To Buy Back Crypto The allegations against Prime Trust are significant, with the FID claiming that the firm lost access to legacy wallets in 2021 and used customer assets to buy back crypto.  Prime Trust reportedly owes its customers $85,670,000 in fiat currency but only has $2,904,000, while it owes $69,509,000 in digital currency but only has $68,648,000. The receivership of Prime Trust could potentially have significant implications for the firm&#8217;s customers. If the court grants the petition filed by the Nevada FID, a receiver will be appointed to take control of the firm&#8217;s assets and operations. Related Reading: PEPE Coin Shines Among Top Gainers, Tallies 78% In Last Week During the receivership, the receiver will manage and administer Prime Trust&#8217;s assets and liabilities. This could include selling off assets to pay off creditors, negotiating with customers to resolve outstanding issues, and taking other actions to wind down the firm&#8217;s operations. For customers of Prime Trust, the receivership could lead to delays and disruptions in accessing their accounts and assets held by the firm. The receiver may need to freeze or restrict customer accounts while they assess the firm&#8217;s financial position and develop a plan for winding down its operations. Customers who have assets held by Prime Trust may also face the risk of loss if the firm&#8217;s assets are insufficient to cover its liabilities. While the receiver will work to maximize the recovery of funds for creditors, the outcome of the receivership is uncertain, and customers may not receive the full value of their assets. The petition to place Prime Trust into receivership will be subject to a hearing, where the court will determine whether the firm should be placed into receivership and whether a receiver should be appointed.  The Majority Of Prime Trust&#8217;s Digital Currency Holdings Tied To AUDIO The news of Prime Trust&#8217;s receivership filing has sent shockwaves through the digital asset community, particularly for investors in AUDIO. According to Connor, Director at Coinbase, 88% of the digital currency held by Prime Trust is AUDIO, the native token of the Audius music streaming platform. This news could trouble AUDIO investors, as the receivership process could result in significant losses for those holding the token.  While the receiver will work to maximize the recovery of funds for creditors and stakeholders, the outcome is uncertain, and investors may not receive the full value of their AUDIO holdings. Related Reading: BLUR Up By 11% Following This Announcement The situation is especially concerning, given the recent volatility in the digital asset markets. AUDIO has experienced significant price swings over the past months, and investors may be hesitant to hold a token that is so heavily concentrated in the hands of a single custodian. At the time of writing, the value of AUDIO stands at $0.1853. This represents a 1.7% decrease in value over the last 24 hours. The token&#8217;s price has remained relatively stable following the news of Prime Trust&#8217;s receivership filing. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the continually evolving world of cryptocurrencies, market resilience often proves a key determiner of long-term value and growth. Benjamin Cowen, CEO and founder of ITC Crypto, recently underscored this premise and spotlighted Cardano (ADA) for its performance amid the prevailing crypto bear market. Related Reading: Cardano Poised For Consolidation In This Price Zone Prior To Attempting Reversal In a series of Twitter posts, Cowen shared insights comparing ADA&#8217;s current performance with its past trajectory, with implications for ADA&#8217;s investors and potential adopters. A Historical Perspective: ADA&#8217;s Bear Market Performance Cowen&#8217;s analysis brought to the fore an observation. According to Cowen, Cardano&#8217;s resilience in the current bear market outpaces its performance during the 2018-2020 bearish phase. He used a snapshot of ADA&#8217;s Return on Investment (ROI) to illustrate this, wherein two distinct trends emerged. Comparing #ADA bear markets Blue Line (Jan 2018 &#8211; Mar 2020) Orange Line ( Sep 2021-Present) So far, we are seeing diminishing losses as a function of time. The orange line will reach the length of the blue line on Nov. 13th, 2023. pic.twitter.com/XXKKSjiEmF — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) June 26, 2023 The graphic showcased a blue line depicting the bear market spanning January 2018 to March 2020, while the orange line represented the ongoing bear market that commenced in September 2021. Notably, the orange line displayed a trend of diminishing losses over time. Navigating The Bear Market: Cardano&#8217;s Improved Resilience Cowen&#8217;s observations suggest a slower rate of decline for ADA price in this bear market compared to its previous cycle. Projections place at the end of the current cycle around November 13, 2023, when the orange line is anticipated to reach the same length as the blue line. These insights could signal a less severe impact on ADA&#8217;s price amid the existing bear market compared to the previous cycle. Although ADA has experienced a decrease in price over the last 24 hours, the broader analysis paints a picture of enhanced market resilience. Although the asset declined in the past day, it is worth noting that ADA has been bullish over the past week, up by nearly 10%. The asset currently trades at $0.28 with a trading volume above $185 million and a market cap of $9.8 billion. Over the past 7 days, more than $500 million has been added to ADA&#8217;s market cap following the asset market capitalization surge from $9.1 billion seen last Tuesday. ADA has also recorded a surge in its trading volume, indicating rising trading activity. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Soars 10% In The Last Week, More Rallies Ahead?

					<description><![CDATA[Despite the losses incurred earlier this month, the price of Uniswap (UNI) has managed to recover. However, it has struggled to break through a significant resistance level, causing it to remain stagnant. Despite this, the technical analysis of UNI shows bullish signals, with notable buying strength and a significant increase in both demand and accumulation. Related Reading: Robinhood To Lay Off 7% of Full-Time Staff In Latest Restructuring While UNI has seen an appreciation of over 20% in the past week, the pace of gains has slowed down on the daily chart. A potential rally could occur if UNI surpasses the important overhead resistance. The performance of Bitcoin, which has been above the $30,600 price mark, has positively impacted most altcoins, including UNI. To move beyond its current price ceiling in future trading sessions, the altcoin&#8217;s price movement is closely tied to the broader market strength. Conversely, if UNI cannot break the immediate resistance zone, it may experience a decline toward its support zone. The increased market capitalization of UNI suggests the potential for further gains and extended bullish sentiment. Uniswap Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, UNI is being traded at $5.20. The altcoin is anticipated to face significant resistance at the $5.40 level or resistance zone (highlighted in blue). Breaking through this resistance at $5.40 can propel the altcoin to $5.80 and ultimately to $6, triggering a rally. Conversely, if the Uniswap price fails to sustain its current price level, it may drop to $5, and an inability to remain above $5 could result in UNI trading near or below the $4.80 price mark. Notably, an increase in trading volume has been observed in recent sessions, indicating an influx of buyers into UNI. Technical Analysis Following a rebound from the $5 price level, UNI has experienced a notable increase in buying strength, resulting in consistently positive demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates an upward trend, with the index just below the 60-mark, indicating heightened buying volume. Additionally, the price of UNI has moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that buyers are currently driving the price momentum in the market. Strong buy signals on the daily chart show increased demand for UNI. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), is a tool that reflects price momentum and trend shifts. It displayed green histograms associated with buy signals for UNI. This indicates a bullish sentiment for the altcoin, suggesting the potential for future gains. In terms of price volatility and fluctuation, the Bollinger Bands provide insight.

					<description><![CDATA[Ripple is confidently addressing its ongoing legal challenges while actively exploring new opportunities to expand the capabilities of the Ripple platform. Although the exact role of XRP is still under scrutiny, notable signs suggest a growing interest in its potential. Ripple&#8217;s Resilience In The Legal Battle In a recent twist to the SEC v. Ripple case, XRP holders&#8217; attorney and legal representative, John Deaton, took to Twitter to share a rollercoaster of emotions. Initially filled with anticipation, according to Deaton, he received an email filing related to the case with SEC. However, his hopes were swiftly crushed when he discovered that the email merely announced a lawyer&#8217;s withdrawal from the proceedings. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Blasts SEC Chair For Anti-Innovation Stance, XRP Bulls Remain Optimistic Deaton promptly clarified that this departure holds no significant impact on the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Additionally, it is crucial to note that the lawyer&#8217;s exit should not be misconstrued as a settlement or any substantial change in the case. And Deaton concluded that the withdrawal does not alter the course of the litigation. Surge in Active Addresses Data from Santiment highlights a surge in active addresses for Ripple&#8217;s XRP in the past weeks. Analysis of the chart reveals that this upward trend commenced in late May and has continued to gain momentum throughout June, ultimately reaching an all-time high. Related Reading: ‘Ripple (XRP) Is A Must-Hold For The Next Bull Run,’ Says Bitcoin Maxi The average number of active addresses was close to one million. However, a discernible upward trajectory emerged, pushing the average to approximately 1.1 million. At present, the number of active addresses has surpassed 1.1 million, indicating a sustained growth pattern. XRP Price Stagnation And Potential Reversal Before now, Ripple&#8217;s XRP experienced a distinctive price pattern that deviated from the broader market, displaying an upward trajectory. However, in recent days, its price movement has become stagnant, lacking a clear indication of either an upward or downward trend. XRPUSD daily chart at $0.4801 &#124; Source: TradingView At the time of writing, XRP was trading at approximately $0.48, reflecting a decrease of more than 4%. It is worth noting that the overall trend appears bearish, as evidenced by the positioning of its Relative Strength Index (RSI) line. Nevertheless, the bearish trend observed in XRP&#8217;s price movement has displayed a relatively subdued strength, leaving room for the possibility of a sudden upswing that could propel it back into a bullish trajectory. Additionally, it is worth noting that XRP&#8217;s current trading price remains above its short Moving Average (represented by the yellow line), which also acts as an immediate support level for the cryptocurrency.
