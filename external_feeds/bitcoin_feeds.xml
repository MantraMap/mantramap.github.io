<h2>Dr. Doom Warns Nearly 100% of Crypto Is a Scam</h2>
<p>Economic professor Nouriel Roubini, aka Dr. Doom, warned about cryptocurrency in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Roubini is a professor of economics and international business at New York University (NYU) Stern School of Business. He also serves as chairman of Roubini Global Economics, a global macroeconomic and market strategy research firm that he co-founded. He told the news outlet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Literally, 99.99% of crypto is a scam, a criminal activity, a total real-bubble Ponzi scheme that is going bust.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Doom also shared his opinion on the collapsed crypto exchange FTX and its disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). FTX filed for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">bankruptcy</a> last November and SBF is currently facing several <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/doj-asks-victims-of-sam-bankman-frieds-fraud-to-come-forward/">fraud charges</a>, all of which he has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges-bond-signees-names-remain-sealed/">pleaded not guilty</a> to. &#x201C;FTX and SBF are not an exception &#x2014; they&#x2019;re a rule,&#x201D; Roubini exclaimed.</p>
<p>The NYU professor proceeded to advise against investing in cryptocurrencies. He stated that 99% of bitcoin investors did not buy <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> at $1,000 or $10,000. &#x201C;Most of them got FOMO [fear of missing out] in 2021 when it was skyrocketing from $20,000 to &#x2026; $69,000,&#x201D; he stressed, emphasizing that 99% of bitcoin investors bought the cryptocurrency &#x201C;well above the current market value.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Roubini opined, &#x201C;So they lost their shirts. It&#x2019;s a nightmare.&#x201D; Dr. Doom noted that bitcoin investors are not alone in losing money as other cryptocurrencies &#x201C;have fallen by 90%, 95%.&#x201D; He added: &#x201C;Out of 20,000 ICOs [initial coin offerings], officially 80% were a scam and another 17% have gone to zero. So that means 97% of them &#x2026; were either a scam or lost everything.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Regarding crypto investing, Roubini advised:</p>
<blockquote><p>You have to stay away. You have to absolutely stay away. And most of these people belong literally in jail &#x2014; literally, they&#x2019;re all crooks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The NYU professor of economics has long been a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, claiming that most crypto proponents are conmen. He called Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) &#x201C;a walking time bomb.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Recently, the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, warned that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-warns-most-crypto-will-fail-says-dont-get-caught-up-in-fomo-fear-of-missing-out/">most crypto tokens will fail</a>, urging investors not to FOMO into this asset class. Meanwhile, a former SEC enforcement official, John Reed Stark, cautioned that an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-officials-crypto-warning-regulatory-onslaught-is-just-beginning/">SEC regulatory onslaught</a> is just beginning.</p>

Klaus Schwab, chairman of the WEF, plans to leverage this representation of Davos to allow people and leaders to meet in virtual worlds and coordinate global collaboration efforts efficiently.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">WEF to Promote Metaverse-Based Collaboration</h2>
<p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) has announced the rollout of its own metaverse platform, dubbed the Global Collaboration Village. The digital world, designed to look like the actual town of Davos in which the organization meets once every year, will supposedly allow for more efficient collaboration between world leaders.</p>
<p>According to Klaus Schwab, chairman of the organization, the WEF plans to leverage this new world as a way of turning Davos meetings, which usually last just a week, into a project that will allow for interviews and conversations between world leaders all year round.</p>
<p>Schwab is optimistic about this, as the effect of the policies discussed at Davos might be amplified through constant feedback. &#8220;This could revolutionize global collaboration,&#8221; he <a href="https://time.com/6245731/global-collaboration-village-metaverse-davos-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Time magazine.</p>
<p>The organization believes that meeting through avatars and digital representations might empower the creativity behind these meetings, compared to the video meetings that commonly occur during these events.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Tech and Partners</h2>
<p>The technology that would power this metaverse representation of Davos would be provided by Microsoft and its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microsoft-to-offer-mesh-a-corporate-metaverse-for-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mesh</a> suite, which extends the functionality of Teams, the popular business meeting software, to allow users to appear as 3D avatars. Mesh also has a specially designed app for VR headsets that allows for more interactivity with the metaverse worlds.</p>
<p>This level of immersion is key for the applications that the WEF aims to give these spaces, like showing the effect that certain measures could have, for example, in restoring ocean coral reefs. Kelly Ommundsen, head of the WEF metaverse project, stated the group is &#8220;trying to do things that can only happen in the metaverse—because if it’s better done in person or on paper, then it doesn’t make sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schwab has already enlisted the collaboration and presence of several partners, including Meta and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), that will populate the village spaces with their projects. He expects some kind of resistance to this initiative, but also expects a heavier involvement of people from outside the organization. He explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need new ways of international cooperation, which will allow us to involve many more people into our discussions.</p>

The team notes that the project is in its final stages of development. The hardware wallet, expected to go on sale later this year, features a 2.7-inch e-ink grayscale touch display and it does not require a wired connection.</strong></p>
<h2>New Hardware Wallet From 1inch Network Offers Air-Gapped, Offline Storage for Crypto Assets</h2>
<p>On Thursday, the decentralized finance (defi) project <a href="https://1inch.io/">1inch Network</a> announced the launch of a new hardware wallet that will go on sale later this year. The team explains in a press release sent to Bitcoin.com News that the wallet will offer &#8220;the safest approach to storing users&#8217; private keys in an offline, simple and open-source way.&#8221; The announcement made by 1inch follows the recent collapse of FTX, which spurred a significant amount of demand for hardware wallets, according to the manufacturers behind Ledger and Trezor.</p>
<p>1inch details that the wallet is being developed by an independent team working with the 1inch Foundation. The development team <a href="https://1inch.io/foundation-grant-program/">received a grant</a> from the 1inch Foundation to complete the project. According to 1inch, the hardware wallet is &#8220;fully air-gapped&#8221; as it has no buttons and does not require any wired connection. Data is exchanged via QR codes or, optionally, with NFC. The 1inch hardware wallet is roughly the size of a credit card, weighs 70 grams and is 4mm thin.</p>
<p>Additionally, 1inch says the &#8220;waterproof&#8221; wallet will boast a &#8220;Gorilla Glass 6 surface and stainless-steel frame.&#8221; The wallet will also come in five different colors, feature wireless charging, and the team insists the battery can last for two weeks of regular use. 1inch has started a <a href="https://hw.1inch.io/">waitlist program</a> and plans to notify users when the device is ready for the public. 1inch details that the hardware wallet&#8217;s architecture supports a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet algorithm.</p>
<p>“The 1inch hardware wallet enables users to create and control several sets of wallets with different seed phrases,” the 1inch team disclosed on Thursday. “Each wallet uses the Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet algorithm in accordance with BIP44 to create a new wallet set. At first use, a maximum number of wallets is randomly generated, and no one knows how many of them there are, except for the device&#8217;s owner. Meanwhile, different pin codes provide access to different sets of wallets, closing the market security gap.”</p>
<p>1inch&#8217;s new hardware wallet announcement also follows Ledger&#8217;s latest <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ledger-reveals-new-crypto-hardware-wallet-designed-by-ipod-creator-tony-fadell/">hardware wallet launch</a> with a device designed by iPod creator Tony Fadell. Ledger&#8217;s device, called &#8220;Stax,&#8221; was reportedly built with &#8220;uncompromisingly secure architecture.&#8221; Ledger&#8217;s Stax wallet is also the size of a credit card and features an e-ink touch screen. Meanwhile, 1inch did not disclose the name of the new hardware wallet device, and the waiting list web page simply calls the machine the &#8220;1inch Hardware Wallet.&#8221;</p>

Ray III discussed the business in his first interview since taking over the exchange&#8217;s restructuring process. Ray detailed during the interview that he is open to the possibility of reviving the now-defunct digital currency trading platform.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX CEO John J. Ray III Explores Reviving the Fallen Crypto Exchange</h2>
<p>The new FTX CEO and chief restructuring officer (CRO), John J. Ray III, conducted his first <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/new-ftx-chief-says-crypto-exchange-could-restart-11674143168">interview</a> since the company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, 2022. Ray told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that there may be value in restarting the crypto exchange and stressed that &#8220;everything is on the table.&#8221; Ray&#8217;s interview followed a recent press release and presentation by the bankruptcy team and FTX debtors, which were published to inform the committee of unsecured creditors.</p>
<p>“If there is a path forward on [rebooting FTX], then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it,” Ray told the publication.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-discovers-5-5b-in-liquid-assets-debtors-explore-ways-to-maximize-recovery-via-potential-sale-of-subsidiaries-real-estate/">presentation</a> given to the committee of unsecured creditors showed that $5.5 billion in what are referred to as &#8220;liquid assets&#8221; have been discovered. However, the definition of &#8220;liquid&#8221; as it applies to the stash of locked SOL and cache of FTX token (FTT) is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-5-5-billion-in-alleged-liquid-assets-includes-locked-sol-cache-and-illiquid-ftt-holdings/">debatable</a>. In addition to the $5.5 billion discovered, the bankruptcy team detailed that another $4.5 billion could be obtained by selling subsidiaries and marketing FTX&#8217;s real estate in The Bahamas. Ray said that there are stakeholders the debtors are working with who &#8220;have identified what they see as a viable business.&#8221;</p>
<h2>New FTX CEO Addresses Tensions with Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Criticizes Inner Circle’s ‘Spending Spree’</h2>
<p>Ray also talked about the former CEO, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> (SBF), as it&#8217;s been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disgraced-ftx-co-founder-awaits-trial-passes-time-playing-video-games-and-blogging-on-his-new-substack-newsletter/">reported</a> that the new CEO of FTX has kept his distance from the disgraced FTX co-founder. &#8220;We don&#8217;t need to be dialoguing with him,&#8221; Ray told the WSJ. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t told us anything that I don&#8217;t already know.&#8221; However, The WSJ got a response from SBF, who called Ray&#8217;s commentary &#8220;shocking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a shocking and damning comment from someone pretending to care about customers,&#8221; SBF told the WSJ. Ray sees things differently than SBF and the chief restructuring officer even criticized the co-founder&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-disputes-ftx-us-shortfall-claims-critics-skeptical-of-excel-spreadsheet-defense/">Excel balance sheet theory</a>. &#8220;This is the problem,&#8221; Ray told the WSJ interviewer. &#8220;He thinks everything is one big honey pot.</p>
<p>Ray disclosed that he had not seen anything like FTX during his entire career of restructuring companies. &#8220;They went on a spending spree,&#8221; Ray stressed. &#8220;Sometimes there were no purchase agreements, or the agreements weren&#8217;t signed,&#8221; the FTX CEO added. Once again, SBF denied the claims Ray made about the co-founder thinking things are akin to one big honey pot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ray continues to make false statements based on nonexistent calculations,&#8221; SBF told the WSJ in a text message. “If Mr. Ray had bothered to think carefully about FTX US, he would likely have realized both that his interpretation is wholly inconsistent with bankruptcy law, and also that even if one were to subtract $250m from my balance sheet, FTX US would *still* have been solvent.”</p>
<p>SBF added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rather, Mr. Ray sees everything as one big honey pot—one he wants to keep.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ray does not see eye-to-eye with SBF at all and despite the FTX co-founder saying on countless occasions that he&#8217;d like to be helpful to creditors, Ray believes that SBF is being misleading, and causing more harm than good. Noting that SBF&#8217;s text message statements are false, Ray insisted that it is &#8220;unfortunate because people are continuing to be victims right now.&#8221; The new FTX CEO added: &#8220;They are victims of misinformation&#8230;It&#8217;s harmful.&#8221;</p>
<p>FTX&#8217;s exchange token, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/FTT/">FTT</a>, jumped in value on news stemming from Ray and his belief that there may be a possibility of reviving the defunct trading platform. <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/FTT/">FTT</a> skyrocketed by 35%, reaching $2.48 per unit, after it was trading for $1.71 per unit before Ray&#8217;s interview was published.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When consistency is key, it can be important to select a project that does more than make grand gestures and empty promises. With a host of meme coins and scams out there, credibility is an important factor to take into consideration &#8211; and this is where Spacewalkers comes in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2020, the Spacewalkers development team is Polish and comprises of individuals who not only have decades of experience over multiple projects in well-established studios such as Flying Wild Hog and Techland, but a proven track record of performance and delivering on their promises. Their first release, Interregnum Chronicles: Signal, was launched in 2021 to offer investors and players alike the ability to familiarize themselves with the brand and get a taste of exactly what’s to come. The first title in their portfolio, released on the Steam platform, gave them an overview of the logistics involved when completing production and gaining certification, alongside experience in game release on a global platform, promotion and connecting with players &#8211; and all of this was achieved</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in just six months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further prove that Spacewalkers delivers, earlier this year, the team made the snap decision to create a simple turn-based strategy game to show their support for Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion. Ukraine Defense Force Tactics (UDFT) was soon created and widely praised by players around the world, including Ukraine itself. All proceeds from the sale of the game were donated to victims of the war and reputable local charities.</span></p>
<p><b>About Interregnum Chronicles: False Prophet</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studio&#8217;s next game and biggest one yet is an ambitious project about survival in a post-apocalyptic world in which extraterrestrial civilizations wage war over ruins of Earth while ordinary people fight for survival. Humanity was decimated by a mysterious mind virus and the world was thrusted into a new ice age while the magnetic poles abruptly shifted. The game offers a refreshing perspective of a group of ordinary people caught in events that transcend their understanding &#8211; their small tragedies quietly play out in the background of events that will decide the fate of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first proper game in the series, </span><a href="https://bit.ly/False_Prophet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interregnum Chronicles: False Prophet,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is set for release in the first quarter of 2024 and Spacewalkers aims to create 3-6 games in the series over the course of the next 6-8 years. These games are unique in the fact that they present standalone stories set within a wider fictional universe that is already well-established. This means that it has the additional potential of targeting fans of the novel, as well as those who enjoy sci-fi literature. Spacewalkers are also aiming to complete the book trilogy and branch out into other mediums, such as film and more.</span></p>

<p><b>Why get involved with Spacewalkers?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to selecting a worthwhile project in the gaming industry, the wisest decision will be to opt for a reliable, established team that has already earned their place within this growing industry. Spacewalkers are one such team and you could soon be part of a growing community with a wealth of potential both now and for the future. As blockchain technology is impacting the gaming industry, Spacewalkers are aiming to design and deliver a practical and meaningful experience for players, alongside a cutting-edge investment model. The gaming sector in Poland is a consistently evolving industry and Polish game producers are not only stepping up to compete with other leading developers on the world stage but are actually leading in terms of quality and ingenuity of games created there.</span></p>
<p><b>How to get involved?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in Spacewalkers is simple: all you have to do is purchase the Spacewalker Token (SWT) on the </span><a href="https://bit.ly/SpacewalkersGames"><b>TECRA SPACE</b></a><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The supply of SWT is limited as there is going to be only 20M tokens in total. All of them are available for purchase during the investment phase after which the unsold tokens are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">burned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to secure the value of sold tokens. So far over 6M tokens were sold to investors and the company has pledged to use 40% of their profits from the games to buy back SWT from exchanges. These tokens are then also destroyed, creating a deflationary feedback loop that benefits holders of the token even further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s not just the buyback program that makes investing in Spacewalkers a smart move. Not only do investors directly participate in the profits of Spacewalkers&#8217; games, but they also benefit from the fact that SWT will be freely traded on crypto exchanges. This means that not only do you have the opportunity to earn a share of the profits, but you also have the potential to see the value of your investment increase as the demand for SWT grows. Also, it means that investors can sell their tokens at any time, potentially realizing a profit on their investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, SWT will serve as a utility token within the Spacewalkers games, serving as the in-game currency. Players will be able to use SWT to purchase in-game items, such as new skins, weapons, or other enhancements. As the popularity of Spacewalkers&#8217; games grows, so too will the demand for SWT, potentially increasing the value of the token.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Spacewalkers&#8217; innovative approach to funding and investing in their games represents a major shift in the gaming industry. By allowing anyone to become an investor through the use of cryptocurrency, they are democratizing the process and giving more people the opportunity to participate in the success of their projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t pass up the opportunity to invest in the most innovative, driven game studio in the gaming industry and buy your tokens for Spacewalkers on</span> <a href="https://bit.ly/SpacewalkersGames"><b>TECRA SPACE</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Roughly $3.5 billion of these funds are cryptocurrency assets, with 11 different digital currencies classified as &#x201C;liquid assets.&#x201D; However, two of the firm&#x2019;s top cryptocurrency caches are not liquid as the company&#x2019;s 47.51 million SOL tokens are locked and the firm&#x2019;s FTT balance distorts the realization of actual liquidity due to FTX&#x2019;s control of more than 80% of the supply.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Locked Solana and Illiquid FTT Assets to Complicate FTX&#x2019;s Bankruptcy Process</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
On Jan. 17, 2023, FTX debtors <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-discovers-5-5b-in-liquid-assets-debtors-explore-ways-to-maximize-recovery-via-potential-sale-of-subsidiaries-real-estate/">published</a> a press release and visual presentation of assets discovered since the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, 2022. The FTX debtors claim to have found $5.5 billion via a &#x201C;herculean investigative effort,&#x201D; with $3.5 billion reportedly being crypto assets. The visual presentation explains that FTX controls around $685 million in <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/SOL/">solana (SOL)</a> tokens, approximately 47,511,173 SOL, and using today&#x2019;s SOL exchange rate, that cache is worth much more than $685 million.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, the SOL owned by FTX debtors is locked and this aspect is not mentioned in the visual presentation shown to unsecured creditors. It has been reported that FTX/Alameda managed to purchase 16% of the SOL supply from the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/solana-suffers-exploit-close-to-8000-sol-based-wallets-have-been-compromised/">Solana Foundation</a>, but there is a lockup schedule. The current stash of 47.51 million SOL equates to 8.82% of the total supply the Solana network will eventually issue over time. Presently, there is only 370,992,365 SOL in circulation and that does not account for the 47.51 million locked SOL owned by the liquidators.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The problem with calling this cache of SOL liquid is that it is locked and subject to linear vesting through 2025-2027, and it could take years before the funds can be accessed. Additionally, the debtors&#x2019; cache of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/FTT/">ftx token (FTT)</a>, a coin originally <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-contract-deployer-unlocks-192-million-ftt-exchange-tokens-questionable-tokenomics-highlights-red-flags/">created</a> by the core FTX team, is also not liquid because FTX controls more than 80% of the entire supply. For example, the Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/ethereum/address/0x97f991971a37d4ca58064e6a98fc563f03a71e5c">0x97f</a>&#x201D; controls 45,850,883 FTT, worth more than $100 million using today&#x2019;s exchange rates. The FTX debtors&#x2019; presentation shows the company&#x2019;s FTT stash as being worth $529 million worth of FTT tokens.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The locked Solana issue and the fact that FTX owns most of the FTT in circulation puts these tokens more on the side of being <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp">illiquid</a>. This could complicate the bankruptcy process and payments to creditors because it would be difficult to convert these assets into cash or other crypto assets without significantly impacting the market price.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Even if the SOL were unlocked, dumping 47.51 million SOL on the market would cause disruptions. Additionally, FTT suffers from low trading volume, limited exchange listings, few use cases, and the company controls most of the FTT supply. Because FTX holds a significant amount of the total FTT supply, it can easily affect the ability to trade it. Calling these caches of SOL and FTT tokens &#x201C;liquid&#x201D; is questionable as data does not support that definition.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

Shiba inu, which rose to a nine-week high on Wednesday, fell by nearly 10% today. Markets have been largely overbought in the past few days, with bears seemingly reentering. Dogecoin was also in the red today.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB), which was one of Wednesday’s biggest gainers, climbing by as much as 17%, fell by over 10% today.</p>
<p>Following a high of $0.00001295 in yesterday’s session, SHIB/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.00001097 earlier today.</p>
<p>Thursday’s drop came as the meme coin was unable to cross a long-term resistance level at $0.00001300.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively large drop in price, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is still deeply overbought.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at a level of 80.22, which is close to a ceiling at the 82.00 mark.</p>
<p>SHIB has somewhat rebounded from earlier declines, and is currently trading at $0.00001114.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Like Shiba inu, Dogecoin (DOGE) also declined on Thursday, with prices falling for a fifth straight day.</p>
<p>Since rising to a one-month high on Saturday, the meme coin has moved lower in consecutive sessions.</p>
<p>Today’s low saw DOGE/USD slip to a bottom of $0.08013, which is nearly 8% lower than Wednesday’s peak.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, the drop saw DOGE near a key support point at $0.08000, with bulls so far resisting a breakout.</p>
<p>Recent decline has pushed price strength significantly lower, moving from a reading above 70.00 on Saturday, to 52.35 as of writing.</p>
<p>The 50.00 mark on the RSI indicator seems to be a sustainable support point, however, should this fail to hold, DOGE bears will likely intensify downward pressure.</p>

<h2>Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Move Away from US Dollar Signals Changing Economic Landscape</h2>
<p>This week, the world&#8217;s elite met in the Swiss Alpine town of Davos for the 2023 World Economic Forum, and Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Finance Minister, Mohammed Al-Jadaan, spoke to Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. Al-Jadaan <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-17/saudi-arabia-open-to-talks-on-trade-in-currencies-besides-dollar?leadSource=uverify%20wall">stunned reporters</a> when he said Saudi Arabia is open to trading in other currencies. &#8220;There are no issues with discussing how we settle our trade arrangements, whether it&#8217;s in the U.S. dollar, the euro, or the Saudi riyal,&#8221; Al-Jadaan said. The finance minister added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t think we are waving away or ruling out any discussion that will help improve the trade around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Saudi Arabian finance minister&#8217;s statements have been interpreted as another step toward de-dollarization. To understand why Al-Jadaan&#8217;s comments are significant, one must <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-50th-anniversary-of-nixon-shock-how-suspending-the-dollars-convertibility-with-gold-fueled-todays-fiat-world/">go back in time</a>. In 1971, the U.S. government and President Richard Nixon ended the gold standard, and over the next three years, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis">oil prices skyrocketed</a>. In 1973 and 1974, federal officials and U.S. Treasury Secretary <a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,908276,00.html">William Simon</a> visited with monarchs in Riyadh.</p>
<p>At that time, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-gold-to-greenbacks-a-look-at-the-us-dollars-devaluation-manipulation-and-militant-backing/">petro-dollar</a> was born as Simon convinced the Saudis to sell oil in U.S. dollars and instructed them to purchase Treasury bonds. In addition to the Saudis, all of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) followed suit and priced their oil in U.S. dollars. Many believe this has given the U.S. an unfair advantage and that it has been the root cause of many of the wars the U.S. has been involved in over the last few decades. In more recent times, the U.S. dollar&#8217;s hegemony has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/targeting-the-us-dollars-hegemony-russia-china-and-brics-nations-plan-to-craft-a-new-international-reserve-currency/">seemingly threatened</a>.</p>
<h2>Growing Saudi Tensions With U.S.</h2>
<p>For instance, Saudi Arabia has recently been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-us-dollar-is-toast-citing-saudi-arabias-request-to-join-brics/">considering</a> joining the BRICS nations, which include Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. At the China-GCC summit, China&#8217;s President Xi Jinping urged Saudi Arabia to start accepting yuan for barrels of oil. Moreover, last March, Saudi Arabia <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-considers-accepting-yuan-instead-of-dollars-for-chinese-oil-sales-11647351541">said</a> it was thinking about accepting the Chinese currency for oil. The Wall Street Journal noted that the Saudis were <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-nuclear-talks-break-off-without-a-deal-11646997132?mod=article_inline">not pleased</a> with U.S. President Biden&#8217;s dealings with Iran over the country&#8217;s nuclear program.</p>
<p>In October 2022, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-saudi-government-privately-mocks-joe-bidens-mental-acuity-crown-prince-denies-us-presidents-oil-requests/">reports</a> further claimed that members of the Saudi government, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, privately mocked Biden&#8217;s mental acuity. Al-Jadaan detailed on Tuesday that the leaders in Saudi Arabia have a good bond with China and other nations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We enjoy a very strategic relationship with China and we enjoy that same strategic relationship with other nations, including the U.S. and we want to develop that with Europe and other countries who are willing and able to work with us,&#8221; Al-Jadaan remarked. So far, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s statements have been considered rhetoric, and none of the aforementioned considerations (accepting yuan for oil, joining BRICS) has come to fruition.</p>

Sales in the United States fell by more than expected, coming in 1.1% lower in December. Bitcoin also declined in today&#x2019;s session, with prices falling below the $21,000 mark.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) dropped below the $21,000 mark on Thursday, as crypto markets fell following slowing U.S. retail sales figures.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The decline saw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD hit an intraday low of $20,541.54 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, fresh from a four-month high of $21,564.50.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Since the sell-off, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> now seems to be in search of a support point, with the $20,500 mark a likely candidate.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, a drop was somewhat expected with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) tracking near a two-year high in recent days.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, the index is at the 78.40 level, which is marginally above a floor at the 77.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should a move below this point take place, it is likely that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> bears could push prices towards the $20,000 zone.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), which rose above $1,600 on Wednesday, was also in the red in today&#x2019;s session, falling towards a five-day low.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a high of $1,602.11 on hump-day, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,509.42 earlier today.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of the move, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> fell to its lowest point since Saturday, when prices hit a floor of $1,449.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
From the chart, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s price strength has also hit a support level, with the RSI currently hovering close to a floor at 70.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should momentum continue to trend downwards, the next signal will be that of the 10-day (red) moving average, which for now remains upward facing.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Providing this occurs, ethereum sellers will likely be targeting a move near the $1,350 mark.&#13;<br />
