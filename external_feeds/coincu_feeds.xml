<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Millionaire cryptocurrency influencer Fernando Pérez Algaba was found dismembered in Argentina.</em></li>



<li><em>Police arrest suspect; motive suspected to be financial troubles.</em></li>



<li><em>Social media fame and chilling note add to the sensational case.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A shocking murder investigation has been launched after the dismembered remains of 41-year-old millionaire Fernando Pérez Algaba, a prominent cryptocurrency influencer, were discovered by a group of children in the town of Ingeniero Budge, Buenos Aires Province, according to the <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/27/millionaire-crypto-influencer-found-dismembered-in-suitcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a></em>.</strong></h5>

<p>The grisly case came to light when the kids stumbled upon a red suitcase filled with body parts while playing near a stream on Sunday. Upon notifying the authorities, the Buenos Aires police inspected the package and made the gruesome discovery of the victim&#8217;s legs and forearm inside. Additionally, another whole arm was found in the stream.</p>



<p>Fernando Pérez Algaba, known for flaunting his opulent lifestyle to his nearly one million followers on Instagram, had been reported missing since July 19, when he failed to return the keys to an apartment he was renting. His popularity on social media caused news of his death to spread rapidly.</p>



<p>According to the investigation, the entrepreneur had been in <a href="https://coincu.com/180668-argentina-approves-bitcoin-futures-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Argentina</a> for at least a week after spending time in Barcelona and <a href="https://coincu.com/178570-ralph-lauren-now-accepts-crypto-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miami</a>. Authorities discovered his remains inside a bag near the stream in Ingeniero Budge, indicating that he had been brutally murdered before being dismembered.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2127.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="880" height="586" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2127.png" alt="Nightmare Of Crypto KOL Fernando Pérez Algaba: Wildly Murdered In Argentina" class="wp-image-206796" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2127.png 880w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2127-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2127-768x511.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2127-750x499.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" title="Nightmare Of Crypto KOL Fernando Pérez Algaba: Wildly Murdered In Argentina 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>The autopsy revealed that Fernando Pérez Algaba died from three gunshot wounds. The clean amputation of the body parts suggested the involvement of a professional, as reported by local media.</p>



<p>The police identified Algaba by his fingerprints and distinctive tattoos on his body parts. He had made his fortune by renting luxury vehicles and selling cryptocurrency, which he frequently promoted to his large following on Instagram.</p>



<p>Authorities arrested one suspect in connection with Algaba&#8217;s death. While the motive remains unclear, investigators suspect that it may have been related to his financial troubles and mounting debts.</p>

<p>Fernando Pérez Algaba&#8217;s brother, Rodolfo Pérez Algaba, revealed that the influencer had faced severe economic problems due to cryptocurrency investments gone wrong. He was reported to owe a substantial amount of money to Argentina&#8217;s tax agency. An entry on his phone suggested that he had also borrowed money from a local gang.</p>



<p>The tragic end of the self-made businessman, known as &#8220;Lechuga&#8221; (lettuce) among friends, marked a grim turn of events for a man who started his journey at the age of 14, selling sandwiches from a bicycle. With unwavering determination, he progressed to buying and repairing vehicles, eventually amassing a warehouse filled with high-end cars, motorcycles, and jet skis by the age of 24.</p>



<p>The investigation into the murder is moving swiftly, with one suspect already in custody. The messy crime scene has led authorities to believe that the act was not carried out by professionals.</p>



<p>The entire community is left in shock and mourning the loss of Fernando Pérez Algaba, a charismatic influencer who met a tragic and untimely end in a crime that has sent shockwaves through Argentina and beyond.</p>

<p>The two countries have also had discussions regarding their individual approaches to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which is a digital version of a country&#8217;s fiat currency. Both countries emphasized the importance of these efforts and the need for them to be part of international standard-setting bodies like the International Organization of Securities Commissions (<a href="https://www.iosco.org/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.iosco.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">IOSCO</a>) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).</p>



<p>The United Kingdom and Singapore have agreed to sustain their dialogue and collaboration on the regulation of crypto and digital assets. They will also work together on other areas such as sustainable finance, fintech, and innovation.</p>

<p>In June, the Monetary Authority of Singapore published a whitepaper that outlines a standard for the use of digital currencies, including CBDCs. This whitepaper was created in partnership with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as the central banks of Italy and South Korea, among others. It is expected that this initiative will pave the way for more countries to adopt similar standards and contribute to the global evolution of digital currencies.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124-1024x683.png" alt="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization" class="wp-image-206780" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124.png 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://cryptohayes.medium.com/moai-da798c72a83b" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cryptohayes.medium.com/moai-da798c72a83b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Hayes, </a>AI will adopt a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure for self-organization. Unlike traditional centralized systems, DAO relies on public blockchains, paving the way for a new era of collaboration between AI and humans within the AI+Human economy.</p>



<p>The DAO structure empowers AI and humans to collaboratively shape the future of various industries, enabling growth and prosperity in the evolving digital landscape. By harnessing the potential of public blockchains, DAO gains independence from state control, offering a more decentralized and autonomous approach to organization.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="775" height="1024" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123-775x1024.png" alt="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization" class="wp-image-206779" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123-775x1024.png 775w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123-227x300.png 227w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123-768x1014.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123-750x991.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123.png 848w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" title="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Hayes emphasizes that the role of DAOs will be instrumental in facilitating the expansion of the AI+Human economy. This synergy between AI and human intelligence creates a powerful ecosystem, driving innovation and unlocking untapped potential in various sectors.</p>



<p>As AI&#8217;s capabilities continue to grow, it becomes evident that traditional centralized systems cannot effectively govern artificial intelligence. DAOs present a robust alternative, providing the structure and framework needed for AI and human collaboration without heavy reliance on central authorities.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2125.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="542" height="708" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2125.png" alt="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization" class="wp-image-206781" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2125.png 542w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2125-230x300.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" title="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization 8"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>One of the key advantages of the DAO structure lies in its ability to raise funds and trade various tokens, including debt, equity, and utility, on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). By leveraging DEXs hosted by non-traditional centralized exchanges (CEXs), DAOs ensure a more transparent and secure environment for financial activities.</p>



<p>Hayes foresees the emergence of natural monopolies within the crypto space, particularly for exchanges that facilitate the trading of all forms of DAO tokens. Identifying such DEXs and acquiring their admin tokens could potentially lead to substantial profits for investors and participants in the evolving AI-driven economy.</p>

<p>Additionally, the legislation targeted crypto mixers and &#8220;anonymity-enhancing&#8221; crypto assets, making it one of the most substantial congressional actions taken to date concerning digital assets.</p>



<p>This amendment was <a href="https://coincu.com/206365-us-senate-advances-crypto-aml-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> by a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, including Kirsten Gillibrand, Cynthia Lummis, Elizabeth Warren, and Roger Marshall. In a joint press release, the senators emphasized the importance of this move in regulating the crypto landscape and combating illicit finance activities.</p>



<p>The Senate&#8217;s approval of the NDAA, by a notable 86-11 vote, authorized a topline figure of $886 billion for fiscal year 2024, a total amount agreed upon during the debt ceiling negotiations between the Biden administration and House Republicans.</p>



<p>Unlike previous years, the passage of the NDAA encountered minimal drama, as the Senate displayed a commitment to bipartisan cooperation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer consistently urged the chamber to expedite the legislative process in a collaborative manner.</p>



<p>The provisions included in the amendment were derived from the 2023 Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act and Senator Warren&#8217;s and Senator Marshall&#8217;s Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, both introduced in 2022. The key aspects of the amendment required the Secretary of the Treasury to establish examination standards for crypto assets, enabling better risk assessment and ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering and sanctions laws. Additionally, the Treasury Department was mandated to conduct a study on combating anonymous crypto asset transactions, particularly focusing on the use of crypto mixers that can obscure fund origins.</p>

<p>Senator Lummis stressed the necessity of cracking down on illicit finance in the crypto industry to root out bad actors and prevent crypto assets from being exploited for evading sanctions and funding terrorism.</p>



<p>It is customary to add non-defense-related amendments to the NDAA. Notably, the Republican-controlled House passed its version of the bill by a narrow 219-210 majority, with some hard-right Republicans introducing amendments addressing social issues unrelated to defense, such as the repeal of a Pentagon policy related to service members&#8217; abortion-related travel expenses.</p>



<p>In the same vein, the House Financial Services Committee <a href="https://coincu.com/206573-house-lawmakers-locked-in-battle-stablecoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approved</a> the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act on July 26. The bill aims to establish clear guidelines and consumer protections for the cryptocurrency industry. Although the bill passed with a 35-15 vote, it faced strong opposition from several senior Democrats.</p>

<p>In a separate development, the House Agriculture Committee also <a href="https://coincu.com/206631-house-agriculture-committee-crypto-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advanced</a> the Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act following the House Financial Services Committee&#8217;s approval. The bill seeks to create a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies within the United States.</p>

<p>IMX will exclusively support deposits from the Ethereum network, indicating Upbit&#8217;s focus on bolstering its Ethereum-based offerings. However, it&#8217;s important to note that deposits via other networks, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), will not be supported for IMX.</p>



<p>With IMX&#8217;s inclusion on Upbit, traders can diversify their portfolios and access a wide array of trading opportunities within the KRW market, enhancing their crypto trading experience.</p>



<p>The upcoming launch of IMX marks another milestone in the crypto industry, as it reflects Upbit&#8217;s ongoing efforts to expand its offerings and cater to the growing demand for digital assets.</p>

<p>According to posts on its Discord server, the protocol plans to phase out its governance token, PRT, and will begin redemptions on Monday. The redemption program will last for eight weeks and will conclude with the sunsetting of PRT.</p>



<p>The Solana-based lending and stablecoin market has set up a stablecoin market on the OpenBook decentralized exchange to buy PRT tokens from all sellers at a price of $0.0045 apiece. This redemption program comes after a community vote to return a slice of Parrot&#8217;s treasury, valued at over $70 million, to token holders. The vote passed with a lopsided 99% in favor but faced backlash from small-time investors who feel Parrot’s developer team is keeping too much of the treasury for itself.</p>

<p>While original investors of Parrot and PRT can expect to recover only about a tenth of the value they put in, newcomers, particularly the activist investors who pressured Parrot&#8217;s leaders for a redemption program, could make many multiples, depending on when they bought in.</p>



<p>Parrot&#8217;s redemption program comes after two years into the project&#8217;s unremarkable run on the Solana blockchain, where it has failed to catch fire despite raising over $90 million from retail and venture investors. Some experts believe that the redemption program could help Parrot Finance regain the trust of its small-time investors and attract more new investors as well.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2114.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="929" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2114.png" alt="SEC Warns Accounting Firms Of Legal Peril In Crypto Audits" class="wp-image-206753" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2114.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2114-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2114-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2114-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="SEC Warns Accounting Firms Of Legal Peril In Crypto Audits 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>The SEC&#8217;s Chief Accountant, Paul Munter, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-crypto-072723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that these firms could be held legally accountable for the statements made by crypto companies regarding partial reviews of their finances, which are sometimes touted as &#8220;audits.&#8221;</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s concern primarily revolves around certain crypto asset trading platforms and other companies in the crypto industry that have marketed their retention of third parties, including accounting firms, to conduct reviews of specific aspects of their business, misleadingly presented as &#8220;audits.&#8221;</p>



<p>One prominent case that garnered public criticism involved accounting firm Mazars and its partial review of Binance&#8217;s books last year. Binance&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://coincu.com/191314-changpeng-zhao-denies-rumors-of-laying-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a>, had claimed the review to be an audited proof of reserves. However, the report was subsequently pulled from Mazars&#8217; website, raising further concerns about the transparency and accuracy of such reviews.</p>



<p>As a result of the controversies surrounding the crypto industry, Mazars <a href="https://coincu.com/152554-mazars-discontinues-audit-crypto-exchanges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> the decision to halt all work with clients in the crypto business, mirroring a growing trend among high-finance companies distancing themselves from the beleaguered sector.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2116-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2116-1024x576.png" alt="image 2116" class="wp-image-206758" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2116-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2116-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2116-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2116-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2116-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2116.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Warns Accounting Firms Of Legal Peril In Crypto Audits 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>Mazars had been hired by major crypto exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/206699-binance-accuses-cftc-overruling-stop-the-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> to perform a proof-of-reserves check on its Bitcoin holdings. While the firm initially found that the reserves were overcollateralized on a single day in late November 2022, they later removed the report from their website.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/193132-sec-alleges-binance-and-us-affiliate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC&#8217;s enforcement filings</a> against Zhao, Binance, and Binance.US contained allegations that Binance.US did not have enough assets to cover customer redemptions, despite claims that it operated independently of Binance.</p>



<p>Munter further elaborated that accounting firms could face legal liability under antifraud laws if their clients mislead investors about the extent of a financial review or the scope of work done by the accounting firm. Moreover, anyone providing substantial assistance to another person in violation of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act may also be held liable.</p>

<p>In another development <a href="https://coincu.com/206678-grayscale-sec-concurrent-approval-bitcoin-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by Coincu, Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm submitted a letter to the SEC regarding eight spot Bitcoin ETF filings, including their own. The letter argued that the SEC should make a fair and orderly decision, not picking &#8220;winners and losers&#8221; among ETF applicants. Grayscale suggested that the approval of spot ETFs could be based on the SEC&#8217;s previous approvals for Bitcoin futures ETFs, emphasizing that the two fund types are inextricably linked. The letter also raised concerns about surveillance-sharing agreements between Coinbase and spot ETF providers, claiming they would not meet the SEC&#8217;s standards.</p>



<p>As the crypto industry faces increased regulatory scrutiny, accounting firms and companies alike are being urged to maintain transparency and adhere to regulatory guidelines to protect investors and promote confidence in the market.</p>

<li><em>Officials seized some $28.7 million worth of assets during raids on company-linked addresses in São Paulo and Aracaju.</em></li>



<li><em>Before that, the owners of the company allegedly fled the country with about $160 million worth of customers.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brazilian authorities <a href="https://www.gov.br/pf/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2023/07/operacao-da-pf-bloqueia-mais-de-r-130-milhoes-oriundos-de-crime-envolvendo-criptoativos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have arrested</a> the main suspects involved in Braiscompany&#8217;s crypto fraud in an effort to protect investors and expose fraudulent activities.</strong></h5>

<p>Brazilian law enforcement has arrested three individuals believed to be involved in the activities of the now-defunct cryptocurrency brokerage, Braiscompany.</p>



<p>The detentions occurred in Foz do Iguaçu, near the Brazil-Argentina border, when the suspects are believed to have tried to flee the country. According to the report, those arrested were Arthur and Sabrina Lima, a couple suspected of being deeply involved in Braiscompany&#8217;s activities.</p>



<p>Police opened an investigation into the company, codenamed Operation Halving, earlier this year. And in an official statement, officials said that the latest phase of the operation has seen officials seize some $28.7 million worth of property in raids. Click on company-related addresses in São Paulo and Aracaju. One of the properties appears to be an office equipped with computer terminals and desks.</p>



<p>Braiscompany came under closer scrutiny after investors voiced their inability to withdraw funds from the platform in December 2022. Earlier this year, the company, known for making promises to investors monthly interest of up to 8% on fiat or Bitcoin deposits, closed amid allegations of fraudulent activity.</p>



<p>Following the closure, the company&#8217;s executives were suspected of fleeing with around $160 million in customer funds, prompting authorities to label the company a possible crypto pyramid scheme.</p>



<p>Arthur Lima is said to have played a vital role in this scheme, creating promotional videos and advising Antonio Neto, the operation&#8217;s alleged mastermind.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Meanwhile, Neto and Fabrícia Campos, another critical figure in Braiscompany, remained at large. Both have been added to Interpol&#8217;s red list, making them international fugitives who can be immediately apprehended.</p>



<p>Police say their latest investigations are focusing on a number of &#8220;brokers&#8221; affiliated with Braiscompany because these individuals act as &#8220;commercial representatives&#8221; and are actively looking for &#8220;new victims&#8221; for this plan.</p>
