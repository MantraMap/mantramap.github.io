<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) started yet another week in consolidation, as price uncertainty in the market remained high.</p>
<p>After peaking at $29,441.00 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to a bottom at $29,124.11 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Since falling to this low, bitcoin bulls moved to buy the marginal dip, pushing price to a current reading of $29,351.73.</p>

<p><!-- TradingView Widget END --></p>
<p>In order for bullish momentum to truly intensify this week, a ceiling of 49.00 will first need to be broken on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 47.90, with the 10-day (red) moving average on the cusp of an upward cross.</p>
<p>A breakout above the 49.00 zone will also likely lead to a crossover of moving averages, which could be what is needed to recapture the $30,000 mark this week.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also largely unchanged on Monday, as the cryptocurrency continued to trend sideways.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD fell to an intraday low of $1,834.80 to start the week, which comes following Sunday&#x2019;s high at $1,859.92.</p>
<p>The decline resulted in ethereum once again moving towards a key support point at $1,830, which is a level it has been tied to for the past few weeks.</p>

</div>
<p>Despite this downward sentiment, the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages have moved closer to an upwards crossover.</p>
<p>Like with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> above, for this to occur the RSI would first need to breach a resistance zone, in this instance at the 48.00 point.</p>
<p>Should this take place, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> could hit $1,900 in the coming days.</p>

Through a historical examination of the development of securities laws, the brief concludes that an investment contract &#8220;requires contractual undertakings to deliver future value.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Law Professors Explain Investment Contracts in Amicus Brief</h2>
<p>Six professors from different U.S. universities have filed an amicus brief <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.59.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backing</a> Coinbase&#8217;s position in its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-urges-court-to-dismiss-sec-case-claiming-regulator-overstepped-its-statutory-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle</a> against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>Stephen M. Bainbridge from UCLA, Tamar Frankel from the Boston University School of Law, Sean J. Griffith of the Fordham Law School, Lawrence Hamermesh of the Widener University Delaware Law School, M. Todd Henderson from the University of Chicago Law School, and Jonathan R. Macey from Yale Law School argue that for the tokens listed on Coinbase to be considered investment contracts, their issuers need to have some contractual undertaking for investors.</p>
<p>In their brief, the law professors undertake a historical look at the origins of securities laws, explaining that the current security law framework was inspired by &#8220;blue sky laws&#8221; (laws seeking to establish safeguards for investors against securities fraud), with these routinely relying on contractual arrangements between issuers and investors to determine what constituted an investment contract.</p>

<h2>Case Law Examined</h2>
<p>According to several cases examined by the legal scholars, in every case where investment contracts were recognized by the Supreme Court and the second circuit, there was some contractual binding between issuers and investors, even in post-<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howey test</a> trials.</p>
<p>This view is also shared by Coinbase, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-alleges-sec-lacks-any-powers-to-regulate-digital-asset-exchanges-in-recent-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a filing on June 28 declaring that &#8220;an economic arrangement can qualify as an investment contract only if it involves<br />an ongoing business enterprise whose management owes enforceable obligations to investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brief states the court should &#8220;adhere to the settled meaning of the term—consistently applied by the state courts interpreting state blue-sky laws, as well as by the federal appellate courts before and since Howey,&#8221; concluding that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under that settled meaning, an investment contract requires contractual undertakings to<br />deliver future value reflecting the income, profits, or assets of a business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this view runs counter to SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-states-coinbase-misinteprets-howey-test-misuses-major-questions-doctrine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filings</a>, which stated that Coinbase &#8220;attempts to construct its own test for what constitutes an investment contract.&#8221; For the regulator, even in the absence of a contractual obligation, an arrangement might be considered an investment contract, detailing that &#8220;Howey did not require a common law contract, and no court has held otherwise.&#8221;</p>

First, with the introduction of the gold standard, then with advancements in banking communications, digitized international trade and investment, and remittances. All of these inventions have made the world economy more efficient. In recent years, this trend hasn’t stopped. World-leading entrepreneurs still continue to release exciting financial products that improve our lives and make the market more efficient.</p>
<p>The next iteration of financial technologies are already here: cryptocurrency, cryptography, distributed ledgers, and blockchain technology. These four technologies are already changing the nature of P2P payments and global value exchanges.</p>
<p>World Pay (WPAY) is the newest creation that seeks to build on the P2P and blockchain revolution to make finance more direct and transparent.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing WPAY: A Decentralized Payment System For Everyone</strong></p>
<p>WPAY is a decentralized payment system that is based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. WPAY’s payment system allows for direct transactions to take place between people without the need for a third-party.</p>
<p>This is a positive key feature that WPAY is introducing as it will help many people worldwide avoid the entry barriers, the high-fees, the slowness, and the risks of censorship of using traditional payment platforms such as Paypal. In addition, WPAY’s application of advanced cryptography protects users against fraud, while also supporting small transactions.</p>
<p>The world today is digital in every way. Social media interactions are digitized, communications are digitized, business is digitized, and finance is digitized. Resulting from this are realistic banking and app risks that happen every day such as fraud, hacks, and theft. A solution to these problems is WPAY.</p>
<p>In particular, WPAY is solving these problems with its platform that implements blockchain and cryptographic technology.</p>
<p>WPAY’s solution is based on cryptographic proof that facilitates direct transactions between parties without the need for a middleman.

Now that the bloc, which unites leading emerging markets, accounts for over a quarter of the global gross domestic product (GDP), it could become a counterpart of the G7 group of developed economies, they say. </strong></p>
<h2>BRICS Push for Global Economic and Financial Reform Deemed Hard to Ignore</h2>
<p>With more countries willing to join <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRICS</a>, which currently consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, the bloc’s push to reform the global economic and financial system should be taken seriously, according to Anthony Rowley, a veteran journalist specializing in Asian economic and financial affairs.</p>
<p>Given the weight of the economies of the BRICS members, which already account for more than a quarter of the world GDP, “no one can dismiss lightheartedly now their challenge to the established economic order,” Rowley wrote in an article published Saturday by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.</p>
<p>BRICS leaders are preparing to discuss the organization’s expansion during their summit on August 22 – 24 in Johannesburg and the piece quotes South Africa’s top diplomat responsible for relations with the bloc who revealed that over 40 countries have either formally applied or expressed interest in joining the union.</p>
<p>“But it is not so much size that matters as the diverse areas into which BRICS members are projecting their influence,” Rowley remarked. He believes that this diversity is what seems to have guided BRICS towards a more global perspective than that demonstrated by other regional formats.</p>
<p>The journalist also pointed out that BRICS differs from regional trade and investment agreements in seeking to provide members with alternative financing sources, including through its New Development Bank (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-to-offer-more-loans-in-local-currencies-president-calls-for-diversified-global-currency-system/">NDB</a>), launching mechanisms for settlements in local fiat and developing central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-test-digital-ruble-in-11-cities-moscow-subway/">CBDC</a>s). He also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>BRICS is a natural pole of attraction because its chief focus is to promote multilateralism and global governance, not least in the areas of economics and finance.</p></blockquote>
<h2>BRICS Future Role Depends on China-India Rivalry</h2>
<p>At the same time, some see these traits jeopardized by the rivalry between China and India, which have differing views on the bloc’s enlargement. While Beijing is pushing for rapid expansion, New Delhi favors association of other countries without necessarily granting them full membership.</p>
<p>BRICS “could evolve to become a counterpart to the Group of Seven (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G7</a>) in world affairs, resulting in a profound impact on international relations,” according to Hung Tran, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank. Whether this is positive or negative depends on whether China’s or India’s approach prevails, he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Tran elaborated that India “has tried to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-faces-opposition-to-rapid-brics-expansion-from-india-and-brazil-report/">resist</a> China’s efforts to turn the BRICS group into a support organization for China’s geopolitical agenda … and explicit anti-U.S. rhetoric.” India also wants to focus BRICS on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-president-dilma-rousseff-calls-for-the-creation-of-a-global-south-focused-financial-system/">Global-South</a> economic and financial cooperation, reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar and reforming international financial institutions to give developing countries more voice.</p>
<p>Rowley and Tran’s comments on the role and future of BRICS come after the UAE professor of international affairs and strategy Mohamed El Yattioui <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-expansion-to-make-west-recognize-new-world-order-de-dollarization-uae-professor/">suggested</a> recently that the induction of new members would allow the grouping to push Western nations to accept changes in international relations and recognize what he called the “new world order.”</p>

Researchers Juan Ignacio Iba&#xF1;ez and Alexander Freier make the case that Bitcoin miners&#x2019; demand for cheap electricity provides incentives for increased renewable energy production. However, for mining to play this decarbonizing role, the industry needs to adapt.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Researchers Reveal Bitcoin Mining Could be a Potential Catalyst for Renewable Energy Growth</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) process that underpins Bitcoin has faced criticism for high electricity use and carbon emissions. However, Iba&#xF1;ez and Freier&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/14/3/35">research analysis</a> indicates the network&#x2019;s thirst for inexpensive energy may attract miners to renewable sources like solar and wind. This additional revenue stream could aid renewables&#x2019; profitability and incentivize capacity expansion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;There are reasons to view Bitcoin for decarbonization in a positive light: not only does it need minimal policy support to deploy, but also the advantages of bitcoin mining (interruptibility, flexibility, portability, etc.) are intrinsic technical strengths, whereas challenges are mostly the result of economic factors and contingent technical circumstances,&#x201D; the author&#x2019;s explain.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Effectively, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/unidentified-miners-f2pool-lead-all-time-bitcoin-mining-rankings-a-comprehensive-review-of-bitcoins-historic-block-discovery/">BTC mining</a> would act as a &#x201C;flexible load resource,&#x201D; absorbing excess renewable supply that would otherwise be wasted. The mining industry&#x2019;s mobility and interruptibility make it well-suited to provide grid stability services. By smoothing imbalances between fluctuating renewable generation and variable demand, mining may facilitate increased renewable penetration.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, for mining to drive decarbonization, adaptations are required. The researchers note that mining must avoid exacerbating peak grid demand and utilize excess renewable supply only. With predominantly renewable-based operations optimized to grid conditions, the Bitcoin network could plausibly produce a net-decarbonizing impact, Iba&#xF1;ez and Freier&#x2019;s analysis details.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Nonetheless, the authors say uncertainties remain regarding timelines and the feasibility of entirely carbon-neutral mining. Iba&#xF1;ez and Freier&#x2019;s study highlights that <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/north-tonawanda-welcomed-bitcoin-miners-some-residents-regret-it/article_0f4eb6e6-36f2-11ee-85bc-9be5d17a4da0.html">public backlash</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-pushes-dame-tax-proposal-to-address-alleged-environmental-costs-of-crypto-mining/">regulations</a> could also threaten the industry&#x2019;s growth. Still, Iba&#xF1;ez and Freier argue Bitcoin holds unique technical strengths that warrant <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kpmg-study-highlights-bitcoin-minings-potential-to-shrink-carbon-footprints/">further research</a> into its potential <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/esg-study-shows-bitcoin-minings-potential-to-eliminate-0-15-of-global-warming-by-2045-claims-no-other-technology-can-do-better/">environmental role</a>, rather than outright dismissal.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Within the broader field of Bitcoin research, this study positions the energy consumption and decarbonization potential of bitcoin mining as a significant and consequential area of investigation,&#x201D; the study insists. &#x201C;Given the unique attributes and possible impacts of Bitcoin mining on energy grids and climate change, it is our conviction that this issue represents one of the most important future research directions in the realm of Bitcoin studies,&#x201D; the study concludes.&#13;<br />

<h2>Elon Musk&#8217;s X Seeks to Open an &#8216;Entire Financial World&#8217;</h2>
<p>While the acquisition and transition of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to the hands of Elon Musk, tech visionary, and eccentric millionaire, has not been without its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-sparks-controversy-with-twitter-rate-limits-censorship-expert-says-musk-has-stepped-on-a-rattlesnake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiccups</a>, it&#8217;s undeniable that Musk&#8217;s vision has changed the direction of the company &#8211; for good or otherwise, depending who you ask to. The legacy Twitter, commandeered by Jack Dorsey, felt like more of a traditional Nasdaq-listed company with processes carried out by company employees, and users were separated from it.</p>
<p>Musk has tried to scrap this notion, having a more close-to-the-user approach and introducing the idea of rewarding content providers with part of the revenue received by the company using this content as the hook. This is nothing new, as monetization has been implemented widely in the content industry; however, X seems to want to do it in the most universal way possible.</p>
<p>This is evidenced by the renewed requirements that users wishing to benefit from this plan need to fulfill, which have been <a href="https://twitter.com/Support/status/1689781903514017792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1689781903514017792%7Ctwgr%5E46bc733a422113e56563e8b07aa9ca75ac7cf4cd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F08%2F10%2Fx-formerly-twitter-lowers-requirements-for-its-ad-revenue-sharing-program%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowered</a> recently with the idea of getting more people to benefit from the program.</p>
<h2>Using a Legacy Payment System</h2>
<p>However, Musk&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683656350046232578?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambition</a> of making X&#8217;s users able to &#8220;conduct their entire financial world&#8221; and <a href="https://twitter.com/X/status/1679572360695824384" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X&#8217;s</a> &#8220;effort to help people earn a living directly on Twitter&#8221; crash with the reality of using legacy payment rails to distribute gains. At the time of writing, Twitter only allows users to receive these earnings by using a Stripe account, a U.S. and Dublin-based payments processor.</p>
<p>This limits the reach of X&#8217;s programs to only the 45 countries where the company is <a href="https://stripe.com/es-419-us/global" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a>, leaving users of countries like Russia &#8211; which is facing economic sanctions from Western countries &#8211; and developing or excluded nations like Venezuela outside of the scope of these.</p>
<p>This does not have to do with X launching its own cryptocurrency &#8211; in fact, Musk has outright <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/x-will-never-launch-a-crypto-token-says-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied</a> this will ever happen &#8211; but using cryptocurrency payment rails based on low-fee tokens or even U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins while still following compliance and tight KYC procedures could be the solution to keep expanding the platform&#8217;s user base.</p>
<p>At the same time, X could also accept these same cryptocurrencies for paying for advertisements and premium memberships, allowing these same users to invest in getting more reach for their content, generating a circular economy out of these activities.</p>

In this issue: The Argentine peso reaches historic lows, Tether&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> accounts for more than 80% of the transactions in the Brazilian market, and Binance gets fully licensed in El Salvador.</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Argentine Peso Sinks Before Elections</h2>&#13;
<p>The Argentine peso sank to historic lows this week, reaching an exchange rate of 605 pesos per U.S. dollar. Economic analysts linked this accelerated devaluation with the uncertainty surrounding the general ballotage held on Sunday, where Argentines elected their candidates for the next elections.</p>&#13;
<p>Mateo Reschini, a research analyst for Inviu, explained that big capitals preferred to secure their investments in foreign currency to protect from possible fluctuations caused by the outcome of the ballotage. Reschini <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentine-peso-plunges-to-historic-lows-as-uncertainty-rules-before-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The market takes note of the relevance of the date of the upcoming elections and decides to be covered against possible exchange rate jumps, hand in hand with statements from economists, the IMF statement, and media rumors.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>The plunge of the Argentine peso will also affect the August consumer price index (CPI). Private firms predict a 9%+ increase in the CPI this month, putting Argentina among the countries with the highest inflation worldwide.</p>&#13;
<h2>Tether Dominated More Than 80% of the Brazilian Crypto Market During Q1 and Q2 2023</h2>&#13;
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>, the largest stablecoin by market cap, was the biggest participant in the Brazilian cryptocurrency market during Q1 and Q2 2023. The Brazilian tax authority <a href="https://portaldobitcoin.uol.com.br/tether-usdt-domina-mais-de-80-do-mercado-brasileiro-de-criptomoedas-mostram-dados-da-receita-federal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> data confirming that more than 80% of the transactions made during the first half of 2023 featured <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>. This means that more than 90 billion reales (almost $18.4 billion) were transacted using the stablecoin in Brazil.</p>&#13;
<p>Also, 3.2 million people purchased cryptocurrency last June, breaking a record high. Companies also registered all-time high numbers buying crypto.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>Binance Becomes a Fully Licensed Exchange in El Salvador</h2>&#13;
<p>Binance, the cryptocurrency behemoth, has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-expands-global-reach-becomes-fully-licensed-crypto-exchange-in-el-salvador/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it has become a fully licensed cryptocurrency exchange in El Salvador. It received two operational licenses: a Bitcoin Services Provider license (BSP) and a Digital Assets Services Provider license (DASP).</p>&#13;
<p>Min Lin, Binance head of Latin America, commented:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>This announcement comes after many months of dedication from our team to provide all information and proceed with the necessary due diligence required by the agencies, showcasing our commitment to the Salvadoran market and our users.</p>&#13;

Even amid gold&#8217;s rather uninspiring performance this last month, David Neuhauser, the founder of the investment company Livermore Partners, forecasts that gold&#8217;s worth could rise to $2,500 by the close of 2024.</strong></p>
<h2>From Slump to Surge: Some Expect Gold to Bounce Back</h2>
<p>Approximately three years ago, in August 2020, gold soared to an unprecedented peak, hitting $2,074 per ounce, while silver simultaneously reached a high of around $28 per ounce on August 6 of the same year.</p>
<p>Since then, however, the luster has faded from these precious metals, and prices have slid downward. As of August 12, 2023, gold&#8217;s current trading price stands at <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/">$1,913 per ounce</a>, with silver trailing at <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SILVER/">$22.67 per ounce</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier in the month, on August 1, the World Gold Council (WGC) published the latest <a href="https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-demand-trends/gold-demand-trends-q2-2023">Gold Demand Trends report</a>, shedding light on gold&#8217;s performance in the first half of the year, buoyed by a high level of central bank acquisitions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-602341" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/silver_2023-08-12_20-46-11.png" alt="" width="1996" height="778" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/silver_2023-08-12_20-46-11-300x117.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/silver_2023-08-12_20-46-11-1024x399.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/silver_2023-08-12_20-46-11-768x299.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/silver_2023-08-12_20-46-11-1536x599.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/silver_2023-08-12_20-46-11.png 1996w" sizes="(max-width: 1996px) 100vw, 1996px" /></p>
<p>The WGC further elaborated that the half-year success of gold was bolstered by thriving investment markets and a resilient demand for jewelry. However, even amidst these favorable conditions, the report divulged that gold demand (excluding over-the-counter or OTC) experienced a 2% year-over-year dip to 921 tons during the second quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inclusive of OTC and stock flows, total demand strengthened 7% y/y to 1,255t,&#8221; the WGC&#8217;s Gold Demand Trends Q2 2023 report clarified. Although gold and silver have lost ground in the past month and remain significantly below their 2020 peaks, some industry experts retain an optimistic outlook, foreseeing bullish trends toward the close of 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>In an email sent to CNBC, Bart Melek, TD Securities&#8217; managing director and global head of commodity strategy, shared his perspective that gold could rise above $2,100 in the latter part of 2023 or the commencement of 2024. Melek attributed this optimistic projection to the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/end-of-feds-tightening-cycle-bernanke-majority-of-polled-economists-see-terminal-rate-hike-ahead/">quantitative tightening</a>, pinpointing it as the catalyst for the bullish forecast.</p>
<p>Additionally, Livermore Partners&#8217; founder, David Neuhauser, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/11/gold-prices-to-breach-all-time-highs-with-some-calling-for-2500.html">conveyed</a> to CNBC&#8217;s Lee Ying Shan that he foresees gold reaching the remarkable milestone of $2,500 by the conclusion of the upcoming year. “2024 is when I see gold breaking out and reaching new highs and beyond,” Neuhauser said.</p>
<p>“My target is $2,500 by the end of 2024 … Much of this has to do with the fact that recessionary forces may take hold beginning later this year and gain steam in 2024,” the Livermore Partners executive added.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://capital.com/gold-price-forecast-next-5-years">report</a> from Capital.com, ANZ research provided a prediction in May 2023, anticipating that gold could be trading at $2,100 by the close of 2023, and near $2,200 by September 2024. Furthermore, the same report reveals that Walletinvestor, an algorithm-driven price prediction platform, explains that the precious metal&#8217;s price will surge to $2,289 by May 2028.</p>

Additionally, the defi crypto sector has swelled to $45.08 billion, reflecting a 6.17% rise in just a day.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Defi Resurgence: $45 Billion Market Cap Achieved Amidst Mixed Performance in Top Tokens</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
As of Sunday, August 13, 2023, the defi token market is worth $45.08 billion with approximately $1.8 billion traded in 24 hours. This represents a daily increase of 6.17%, and the trade volume has risen by 6.39%. Chainlink (LINK) emerged as one of the top gainers this week among the ten leading defi tokens, with its value jumping by 5.14% within a week&#x2019;s time. Nonetheless, coins such as synthetix (SNX) and injective (INJ) slipped between 2.70% and 3.36% over the previous week.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
During the past week, ellipsis (EPS) saw a significant rise of 129%, while thorchain (RUNE) climbed by 49.29%. On the other hand, persistence (XPRT) plummeted by 12.47%, and mobox (MBOX) suffered a decline of 10.94%. Curve&#x2019;s CRV token continued to struggle after a recent hacking incident, falling by another 4.81% this week. While defi tokens experienced growth in the past day, defi&#x2019;s total value locked (TVL) reached $41.94 billion on Sunday, August 13.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
The TVL nearly slipped below $40 billion on August 2 but managed to stay above this critical level. Lido Finance leads the pack with TVL size, boasting a significant $15.11 billion in its liquid staking protocol&#x2014;an increase of 2.34% within the past week. Following Lido, Makerdao, Aave, Uniswap, and Tron&#x2019;s Justlend protocol are ranked based on TVL size on Sunday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Out of 202 blockchain platforms, Ethereum&#x2019;s TVL dominates by over 58% with a sizable $24.38 billion. Tron, BSC, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, Mixin, Solana, and Cronos trail in its wake. Tron&#x2019;s TVL commands a 13.31% market share with an overall $5.56 billion on Sunday morning at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Lastly, a staggering 10.89 million ether is stashed in 23 distinctive liquid staking defi protocols related to ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>), which translates to a worth of $20.252 billion&#x2014;a significant sum within the world of value-locked across the 202 blockchain networks. In fact, these 23 defi protocols built on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> liquid staking account for nearly half (48.28%) of the entire $41.94 billion total locked in defi this weekend.&#13;<br />

This action was followed by another sequence of events; when a batch of slumbering bitcoins from 2014 was spent, marking their first movement in nearly a decade.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Over $11 Million in Dormant Bitcoins Spring to Life</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Fast forward to August 12, 2023, when an impressive sum of 391.305 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, valued at $11.4 million, stirred from its long hibernation. The term &#x201C;sleeping bitcoins&#x201D; denotes a category of bitcoins lying inactive in an address, unspent and unmoved for extended periods.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
These quiescent bitcoins, often the subject of intrigue and conjecture among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, earn their &#x201C;asleep&#x201D; label due to their lack of active trading or usage. A significant shift in these dormant assets could conceivably send ripples through the market.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The existence of these slumbering bitcoin wallets can be attributed to various factors, such as lost access, deliberate long-term cold storage, forgotten possessions, inherited or legal barriers, or simply a strategic decision to hold for an extended period.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The discovery of these sleeping stashes is often the work of specialized blockchain parser programs like <a href="https://btcparser.com/">btcparser.com</a>, which detected Saturday&#x2019;s 2016 and 2014 spends. The <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1Pk2wiBjyqRkfxrpQdnZ8vQ1Ts72TqctCV">initial awakening</a> unfolded at block height 802,827 when an address established in March 2016 released 195.795 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> worth an impressive $5.7 million.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This notable event transpired through four separate transactions, all directed to the address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qn0vaan6awqc04f872d6aw3za8k2r7v3adv5ekk">bc1qn</a>.&#x201D; In a curious twist, the user <a href="https://explorer.btc.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qruhv35cnaguhy032d7f4hcwupuegcqncu8eegs5r9">previously possessed</a> 195.795 bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>), entirely spent on December 7, 2017.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following this, on August 12, 2023, at block heights 802,872 and 802,879, groups of <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1C7zT37yxf5qQK5S18e5gWVSwn49zrrkE2">100</a> and <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=19ZyB7awJaQYpktzjnqHQNquqK3sR7Bohr">66.589</a> bitcoins were transferred, marking their first movements since April 2014. Additionally, at the same block height, <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1N73FfnBnLyobchKpDuYFG1Rtggf499bpw">28.93 BTC</a> from March 22, 2014, were moved for the first time in over nine years.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The decision to spend or move sleeping bitcoins can be a complex one, often governed by an individual&#x2019;s unique circumstances and various underlying factors. For example, a significant surge in bitcoin&#x2019;s value may motivate owners to sell or trade their dormant holdings to capitalize on profits.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Changing financial needs, concerns about wallet security, or the desire for a more secure storage method might also prompt the movement of these assets. In essence, the decision to awaken sleeping bitcoins is a multifaceted one, shaped by an intricate interplay of financial, legal, personal, strategic, and emotional considerations.&#13;<br />
