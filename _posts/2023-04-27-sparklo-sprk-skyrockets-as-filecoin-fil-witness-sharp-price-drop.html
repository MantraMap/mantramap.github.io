<p class="s7">As Filecoin (FIL) struggles in the market, investors have turned their attention to other promising projects, one of which is Sparklo (SPRK). Analysts have predicted that Sparklo's (SPRK) value has the potential to skyrocket by 40x due to precious metals' overall appeal to investors</p>
