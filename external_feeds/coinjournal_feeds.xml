										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Metaverse games are constantly expanding and becoming more advanced. The technology is connecting players with new earning opportunities and new methods of exploring immersive landscapes online, which makes them some of the most highly sought-after investment opportunities around.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this article, the very best metaverse games will be discussed and evaluated according to their investment potential:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">Metacade (MCADE)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Axie Infinity (AXS)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Gods Unchained (GODS)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Decentraland (MANA)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Enjin (ENJ)</li>
<li dir="ltr">The Sandbox (SAND)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Star Atlas (ATLAS)</li>
</ol>
<h2 dir="ltr">1. Metacade (MCADE)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The best investment opportunity for all metaverse games during 2023 is <a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a>. <strong>Metacade is building the biggest arcade on the blockchain, offering a range of different arcade-style games that each have play-to-earn (P2E) mechanics</strong>. Players can compete in PvP tournaments and earn financial rewards for progressing through endless levels in these classic arcade titles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As well as this, Metacade will become a central hub for the entire GameFi community. The platform offers a place to meet up with other gamers and discover the latest trends, and players will be rewarded with MCADE tokens for contributing useful information to the community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is community-driven at its core. The community can access paid beta-testing roles, helping to uncover any bugs and optimize gameplay before new games are officially released. Metacade users can get a unique insight into the game development process and will be given a springboard to launch a career in Web3.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Why buy MCADE?</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is supporting the development of metaverse games directly through its Metagrants program. Metagrants will be awarded to the most in-demand blockchain games, which can help to boost the overall level of innovation in the GameFi sector.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The MCADE token is also brand-new and recently attracted $1.12 million worth of investment in just three weeks during its presale. <strong>MCADE is currently priced at just $0.01 per token and has the potential to climb to over $1 during 2023, when the Metacade is fully developed</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; You can participate in the MCADE presale&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">2. Axie Infinity (AXS)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Axie Infinity (AXS) is a digital collectible card game built on the Ethereum blockchain. Axies are unique virtual pets with different skills, stats and backstories. Players can collect these animals and improve their level while progressing through the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Axie Infinity metaverse game has been described as a cross between Pokemon and Tamagotchi. Like both of these games before it, Axie Infinity has proven to be extremely popular among gamers from all over the world. In October 2021, Axie Infinity attracted over 2 million daily users, making it one of the most widely used decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Axie Infinity was one of the first games to utilize non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to create a blockchain-based game. By all accounts, Axie Infinity popularized the GameFi movement when it was launched in 2018, and the AXS token has since become a top 50 cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Why buy AXS?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Axie Infinity is one of the original blockchain games and has been developed with a unique design. The Ronin bridge is an Ethereum sidechain built specifically for Axie Infinity to improve the game&rsquo;s compatibility with the blockchain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over time, the AXS token is expected to fully recover from its bear market lows. The price of AXS is currently $6.31, with an all-time high of $166 &ndash; the AXS token has the potential to reclaim these highs over time, making it the second-best metaverse game to invest in during 2023.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">3. Gods Unchained (GODS)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Gods Unchained is an online strategy game where players trade NFTs, upgrade their deck, and compete against other players for victory. The Gods Unchained metaverse game utilizes P2E mechanics to deliver financial rewards to players as they win battles and expand their arsenal of NFTs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project is led by an experienced team, including Chris Clay, who is the former Game Director at Magic: The Gathering Arena (MTGA). Gods Unchained works in a similar way to MTGA, except with the added benefits of self-owned digital assets and integrated financial rewards for players.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gods Unchained has attracted a significant following since development began in 2018. The game has sold millions of individual trading cards and launched a native token for the platform, GODS, in November 2021.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Why buy GODS?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Gods Unchained is an established metaverse game with a relatively new token. The GODS token was launched at the end of the bull market in 2021, so the current price of $0.1997 does not accurately reflect its value.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As the wider crypto market recovers before the next bull market, GODS could rise significantly and enter price discovery. Bull markets are known to produce parabolic rises for new tokens &ndash; GODS will benefit from this initial burst and has the added security of being a widely-used metaverse game already.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">4. Decentraland (MANA)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Decentraland is a metaverse game that allows users to purchase digital plots of land and build unique applications and experiences. The MANA token is used as a medium of exchange on the Decentraland platform, giving players the ability to acquire LAND tokens &ndash; unique NFTs that represent parcels of virtual real estate.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Users can build whatever they like on their purchased LAND, including art galleries, assault courses, meeting rooms, and nearly anything else that can be imagined</strong>. Creations can be explored and monetized in a variety of ways, as users are in full control of their assets on the Decentraland platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Decentraland is driving the expansion of metaverse games by supporting user-generated content (<a href="https://hotplay.games/why-user-generated-content-ugc-can-be-the-future-of-gaming/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>UGC</u></a>) at the foundation of the game. The platform allows anyone to buy and sell digital assets in the metaverse, reducing barriers to entry for digital real estate and encouraging an enhanced user experience through greater personal control.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Why buy MANA?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Decentraland can help to increase the adoption of metaverse technology due to its unique mechanics. The platform can serve individual content creators and businesses looking to create virtual experiences. This enables brand-new ways to interact with other people over the internet, which could prove increasingly popular over time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The MANA token is currently priced at $2.00, and looks undervalued at this level. Experts are predicting significant gains for MANA over the coming years as the metaverse becomes more widely adopted, making it the fourth-best metaverse game to invest in during 2023.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">5. Enjin (ENJ)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Enjin (ENJ) is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates the development of metaverse games. The platform aims to make the creation, management, and trading of in-game digital assets more accessible. Anyone can create NFTs easily on Enjin, as the project offers a suite of tools to make the process simple and intuitive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Enjin also offers some unique features that are specially developed to improve the user experience in metaverse games. ENJ tokens are locked into NFTs that have been created on the platform, which serves to provide instant liquidity for gamers. This feature enables instant trades at a low cost.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Why buy ENJ?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">GameFi continues to grow in popularity, and NFT technology remains at the foundation of the industry. Enjin can help to optimize the user experience for many blockchain games by improving the transaction speed and transparency of NFTs across many different blockchain games, which gives it significant value in the wider GameFi ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ENJ token is currently priced at $0.247987 &ndash; down from its all-time high of $4.82. Enjin Network is expected to expand its ecosystem of games, and the ENJ token will benefit from high demand and a rising price as a result. ENJ is a top project to invest in, as it supports the growth of metaverse games directly.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">6. The Sandbox (SAND)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Sandbox allows users to create their very own digital world and explore a vast number of gaming experiences that have been created by other players. Unlike other metaverse games that focus on combat and active gameplay, The Sandbox encourages players to explore the landscape, tell stories with friends, and build their own worlds.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The Sandbox</u></a> focuses on UGC and makes building game assets more accessible to everyone. Users can create games with little to no programming experience, which can help to boost the level of innovation in game development over time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Sandbox has been compared to Minecraft due to its focus on UGC. Minecraft is the most popular PC game of all time, which reflects the widespread demand for the type of experience that The Sandbox delivers.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Why buy SAND?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">SAND is the medium of exchange that allows users to buy and sell gaming assets on the platform. The Sandbox is a popular metaverse game that attracted over 2 million active users during March 2022, and the platform is expected to continue to grow over time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the price of $0.413, SAND is expected to grow significantly in value over the coming years. For this reason, it is one of the top metaverse projects to invest in during 2023.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">7. Star Atlas (ATLAS)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Star Atlas is a futuristic metaverse game set in space. <strong>The metaverse utilizes Unreal Engine, which helps to deliver cinematic graphics that can engulf players in a mind-blowing 3D world</strong>. Players can explore the universe and conquer new challenges, as well as construct entire cities using purchased plots of land and tradeable assets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">NFTs can be bought, sold, and upgraded using the ATLAS token. Tradeable items include a spaceship, crew members, land parcels, and other items that can be used to enhance the gaming experience. The game utilizes P2E mechanics to deliver rewards with financial value to all players.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Why buy ATLAS?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Star Atlas was launched in 2021 and has since become a major name among metaverse games. The platform has a unique experience that immerses players in outer space, offering an engaging plotline and advanced graphics alongside integrated financial rewards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">ATLAS is expected to grow significantly in value from its current price,&nbsp;$0.00292817. It is definitely one of the top metaverse games to watch during 2023, as an investment at this price level could produce major returns over time.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade: The best metaverse game to invest in 2023</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>MCADE token presale</u></a> sold out during its beta phase extremely quickly. The price of MCADE started at $0.008 and is gradually rising to $0.02 over the course of the presale. Since Metacade has the potential to become one of the biggest crypto projects around over the next few years, the MCADE presale could be the biggest investment opportunity of 2023.</p>

<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Iran and Russia are reportedly eyeing a new stablecoin for cross-border trade, including in the Astrakhan special economic zone.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>The stablecoin will be backed by gold, according to local Russian media outlet Vedomosti.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>Both Iran and Russia are under tough international sanctions.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Iran and Russia are looking to launch a new <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/stablecoin/">stablecoin</a> in the market, Russian news agency Vedomosti has <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/economics/articles/2023/01/16/959100-rossiya-i-iran-nachali-prorabotku-obschego-steiblkoina" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the news outlet, there&rsquo;s cooperation between the Central Bank of Iran and its Russian counterpart on a project that will see the two countries issue a new gold-backed cryptocurrency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The stablecoin, targeted for the Persian Gulf region, will be used for cross-border transactions in the place of the US dollar, the Iranian rial and the Russian ruble. The digital asset is also specifically intended as a payment method in the Astrakhan area &ndash; an economic zone whose design helped Russia begin to receive cargo shipments from Iran.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The report quotes Alexander Brazhnikov, the Executive Director of the Russian Association of Crypto Industry and Blockchain as stating that the project is indeed in the works.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Crypto in foreign trade transactions</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The gold-backed stablecoin is indeed being worked on by the two nations even as they continue to face strict sanctions from the United States as well as other Western countries.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But notably, both Iran and Russia have allowed the use of crypto in foreign trade, with the Iranian government taking the step in August last year. As <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/russia-says-crypto-is-safe-alternative-for-cross-border-payments/">earlier covered</a> by CoinJournal, Russia also considered cryptocurrency as a &ldquo;safe alternative&rdquo; for cross-border payments in August.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In December 2022, the Bank of Russia governor Elvira Nabiullina noted that the country was ready to allow cryptocurrency use for foreign trade only &mdash; the central bank was looking at this on an experimental basis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on the latest report, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev said the reported joint stablecoin will proceed once Russia is able to fully regulate the digital assets market. &nbsp;The country, which has toyed with crypto regulation bills for much of 2022, looks to get one over the line in 2023 following multiple delays.</p>

<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Binance&rsquo;s off-exchange settlement solution Binance Mirror to benefit institutional investors.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>The solution is offered via Binance Custody, a regulated institutional digital assets platform.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>Binance Mirror currently accounts for more than 60% of assets on Binance Custody.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a> is looking to grow confidence among institutional investors through a brand new service dubbed Binance Mirror.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In an announcement <a href="https://www.binanceinstitutional.com/support/announcements/article/204448334901952512" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a> on Monday, the global crypto exchange giant said the service will be accessible via Binance Custody, the exchange&rsquo;s regulated institutional crypto custody solution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance Mirror, according to the press release, is an off-exchange settlement solution designed to help institutions to trade and invest in products across the Binance ecosystem through cold custody.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Security key for investors</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The crypto space remains much within the chaos that followed the collapse of FTX, with centralised exchanges including Binance seeing a significant slash of customer deposits as uncertainty mounted. Amid this has been the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/interest-in-cold-storage-wallets-will-increase-says-ledgers-ceo/">push for self-custody</a>, which has been fueled by the fears around more CEXs folding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But Binance says its new product protects institutional investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Instead of posting collateral directly onto the Binance exchange, institutions will leverage Binance Mirror to lock specified asset balances in the cold storage solution, with these mirrored on their exchange accounts at a 1:1 balance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the security of these assets, the Binance team wrote:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Their assets remain secure in their segregated cold wallet for as long as their Mirror position remains open on the Binance Exchange, which can be settled at any time</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance Custody launched in December 2021, a custodian platform separate from the Binance exchange &ndash; it has a segregated cold wallet system. The unveiling of Binance Mirror is already seeing adoption of the custodial platform reach new levels. As noted in today&rsquo;s announcement, the new product currently accounts for over 60% of the total assets on Binance Custody.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Athena Yu, the VP of Binance Custody, emphasised on the issue of security for investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Security is a top priority for institutions, who also desire the deep liquidity that the Binance Exchange offers. Binance Mirror brings the best of both worlds</em>,&rdquo; Yu said in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the exec, Binance spent most of 2022 refining its operations as it looked to enable clients to tap into benefits of unlocked liquidity. Mirror&rsquo;s launch therefore offers the crypto company an opportunity to introduce new features aimed at taking the cold custody functionality to the next level.</p>

<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Solana is currently changing hands at $23.26, about 137% up year-to-date.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>The coin&rsquo;s price plummeted after FTX fell in November, ending the year below $10.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>SOL price has soared amid positive sentiment, broader market rally and meme coin-driven interest.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/solana/">Solana</a> traded below $10.00 on the first day of 2023, having plummeted more than 73% in a massive dump following the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As was the case, Solana is a blockchain project with ties to disgraced crypto figure Sam Bankman-Fried &ndash; the founder of FTX and Alameda Research. After both companies filed for bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried found himself in custody, the native Solana token SOL took a nosedive.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Solana&rsquo;s SOL soars 137% year-to-date</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Having ended 2022 at around $9.66, SOL price has seen impressive bullish action over the past two weeks. The token&rsquo;s price has rebounded strongly to currently trade more than 62% in the past week, according to crypto market data aggregator CoinGecko.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For its YTD price, SOL is up more than 137%, trading at $23.26 across major exchanges on Monday, 16 January, 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A turnaround for SOL comes on the back of positive sentiment from across the crypto, including last month&rsquo;s optimistic outlook for the Solana ecosystem from Ethereum founder <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1608591727316684804" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vitalik Buterin</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A rebound in decentralised finance (DeFi) and meme coin craze-related activity is also leading to more <a href="https://coinjournal.net/solana/buy/">buy Solana</a> market action. Another factor driving SOL price in recent days has been the broader enthusiasm in the market after what was typically a suffocating run at the backend of last year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On 12 January, crypto markets platform Messari <a href="https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1613355108779315202" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highlighted</a> that Solana was far from &ldquo;dead.&rdquo; According to the firm, on-chain data showed both transaction volumes and active accounts on the Solana blockchain had surged to levels last seen before the FTX collapse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is <a href="https://twitter.com/solana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@solana</a> dead? Its fundamentals might say otherwise.</p>
<p>Transaction volumes and active accounts both spiked back to pre-FTX levels.</p>
<p>While tweets and meme coins may have been the cause for recent activity, it is difficult to pinpoint the FTX collapse by looking at these metrics. <a href="https://t.co/hL05ixfLVw">pic.twitter.com/hL05ixfLVw</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bonk-price-action-spells-trouble-after-becoming-an-overnight-crypto-sensation/">previously covered</a>, some of the uptick in activity followed the launch of meme coin Bonk (BONK), with significant spike in interest in Solana after the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s airdrop to the community.</p>

<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Bitcoin price broke above $21,440 on major cryptocurrency exchanges for the first time since the FTX implosion.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Much of the buying pressure was retail driven as crypto mirrored stock markets&rsquo; Friday surge.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>Veteran trader and markets analyst Peter Brandt has shared his prediction for Bitcoin price in 2023.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies roared into the weekend as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> spiked to highs above $21,000 for the first time since FTX&rsquo;s debacle began to unfold in November.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Data from CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shows</a> that the benchmark crypto hit prices near $21,450 on major crypto exchanges on Sunday, with major altcoins tracking the leading digital asset. <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> broke above $1,500, Solana jumped to trade at highs of $24 and Dogecoin rose as high as $0.088.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s notable that the rise in crypto prices followed a tick up for growth stocks and risk assets as the US inflation slowed further in December to suggest a potential pivot from the Federal Reserve.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin price rally- analyst points to $25K by March</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is up more than 22% in the past seven days, with BTC currently showing resilience above the $20,000 support level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While on-chain data <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptounfolded/status/1614946148837457921" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">indicates</a> the weekend buying pressure wasn&rsquo;t so much as institutional investor-driven, the potential for bitcoin going higher remains if prices consolidate above the psychological level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to veteran trader and markets analyst Peter Brandt, BTC&rsquo;s bullish trend will benefit from a weekly close above $20,800. He shared the prediction in a <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1614728484764684288" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweet</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Any idiot can make wild guesses about markets, so here is my dunce-hat prediction. In reality, nobody has a clue what any given market will do. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> <a href="https://t.co/bpP2ThjnZK">pic.twitter.com/bpP2ThjnZK</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">The seasoned trader predicts a run to major resistance at $25,000 by March, with rejection seeing BTC retest the $18,000 level. If bulls hold this level, the analyst forecasts another sharp rally that could end up with Bitcoin price testing resistance levels around the $35,000 mark by July 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although he warns that no one can predict the markets with certainty, his long term outlook for Bitcoin has the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s price above $100,000 by 2025.</p>

<li>DeFi protocol Frontier Wallet brings in-browser wallet support for Sui, Aptos, and 33 other cryptocurrencies.</li>
<li>Besides transactions, users will also be able to stake and transfer tokens between networks.</li>
<li>The wallet basically offers a one-stop platform for users to interact with dApps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Frontier has <a href="https://twitter.com/FrontierDotXYZ/status/1614918979499479041?s=20&amp;t=-yqCL2C-xxpJoHKoByys_A">officially launched</a> the Frontier in-browser wallet extension.</p>
<p>The wallet extension brings in-browser wallet support for 35 cryptocurrencies including Sui and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/aptos/">Aptos</a>. Users will be able to stake tokens, transact using the allowed cryptocurrencies as well as store and transfer NFTs.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the wallet will give users the privilege of interacting with any decentralized application (dApp) without needing to switch between different applications, which can be quite tedious for DeFi users. Additionally, the wallet supports some of the newer blockchains like Aptos and Sui which have become so popular in the recent past.</p>
<h2>Transferring tokens between networks</h2>
<p>In addition to the features mentioned above, the in-browser wallet will also allow users to transfer tokens between different blockchain networks, a process commonly referred to as bridging within the crypto space.</p>
<p>The Frontier team has built APIs for networks like &nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/near-protocol/what-is-near-protocol/">Near</a>, Solana, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cosmos/what-is-cosmos/">Cosmos</a>, and others. Users can use these APIs to get their balances and transactional history.</p>
<p>The wallet is a game changer since a majority of other popular crypto wallets including Zerion and MetaMask do not offer similar features to their in-browser wallet users.</p>
<p>Frontier also claims that its wallet has a security feature that detects phishing attacks and fraud to help keep users safe.</p>
<p>The wallet currently has over one million users worldwide and the new feature is expected to drive that number even higher.</p>

<li>The Harmony bridge hack took place in June last year and over $100 million was lost</li>
<li>121 bitcoins have been recovered by Huobi and Binance security teams.</li>
<li>The hackers were also moving ETH worth about $64 million over the weekend.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seven months after one of the largest cryptocurrency exploits of 2022 took place, industry players are still optimistic about recovering the stolen funds. Over the weekend, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance </a>and Huobi teams teamed up to freeze and recover 121 bitcoins that the Harmony bridge hackers were trying to launder.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1614887319177428992?s=20&amp;t=rvMhvqITxueRM4cHY8L5jw">tweet by Binance CEO</a>, Changpeng Zhao, the hackers tried to launder 121 bitcoins worth about $2.5 million on the Huobi exchange and Binance detected the move and alerted Huobi. Binance then went ahead to assist Huobi in freezing and recovering the crypto assets which had already been deposited by the hackers.</p>
<p>Prior to Huobi and Binance recovering the bitcoins, on-chain crypto detective ZachXBT had tweeted saying that the hackers were moving 41,000 ETH worth about $64 million over the weekend.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/2 North Korea&rsquo;s Lazarus Group had a very busy weekend moving $63.5m (~41000 ETH) from the Harmony bridge hack through Railgun before consolidating funds and depositing on three different exchanges. <a href="https://t.co/huDumaJeSh">pic.twitter.com/huDumaJeSh</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Laundering seven months after the hack</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/one-dips-by-10-following-harmony-protocol-hack-will-it-dip-lower/">Harmony One team detected the hack on June 24, 2022</a>, and reported that crypto assets worth about $100 million had been lost in the hack. The hackers, who were identified on June 30 to be the notorious North Korean Lazarus Group had exploited mutisigs securing the Horizon bridge.</p>
<p>After the hack, the attackers deployed laundering programs to move the stolen assets.</p>
<p>According to ZachXBT, the hackers deposited the stolen crypto assets in three crypto exchanges although he did not specify these exchanges.</p>
<p>However, going by the recent developments, it is most likely that Huobi is one of the exchanges that the attackers have been trying to use.</p>

<li>Bithumb had a one and half hour outage that caused customers to lose funds.</li>
<li>South Korean Supreme Court has ordered the exchange to pay the customers for the damages.</li>
<li>Initially, a district court had ruled in favour of the exchange but the ruling was later overturned.</li>
</ul>
<p>The local courts in South Korea have ordered that Bithumb is supposed to pay just about $200,000 for damages to 132 customers affected by a service outage on January 12, 2023.</p>
<p>On January 13, The South Korean Supreme Court ruled that Bithumb exchange should pay damages caused to customers after the 1.5-hour service outage. According to the Supreme Court, the exchange was to pay damages equivalent to $202,400 (251.4 million won). Customers are supposed to be paid as little as $6 to as much as $6,400.</p>
<p>According to the final ruling by the Supreme Court:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The burden or the cost of technological failures should be shouldered by the service operator, not [the] service users who pay commission for the service.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Initially, a district court had ruled against the customers before the matter was moved to the Supreme Court which overturned the earlier ruling and issued a final ruling on the matter.</p>
<h2>Bithumb in South Korea</h2>
<p>Bithumb is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in operation in South Korea and the service outage was caused by a sudden surge in the average amount of orders per hour coupled with bottle-necked transaction flows.</p>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bithumb-executives-sued-in-hong-kong-over-fraud-allegations/">Bithumb has also been under investigation f</a>or the sudden death of one of the largest shareholders following embezzlement claims. There is also a special tax investigation on the exchange after authorities suspected the exchange of possible tax evasion.</p>
<p>Bithumb headquarters were actually raided by the National Tax Service (NTS) on January 10.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin is back in the 20s, Ethereum has crossed $1,500 and altcoins are powering north in what is the biggest crypto rally in 9 month</li>
<li>Optimism that Federal Reserve will pivot off high interest policy sooner than expected, following cooler inflation data</li>
<li>Next big day for crypto markets is February 1<sup>st</sup>, when the Fed will decide on the latest interest rate policy</li>
<li>Solana is up 130% since the start of the year, leading the altcoins</li>
<li>Even memes are rising, with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu again making moves</li>
<li>Some analysts fear the market is premature in pricing in an earlier-than-expected Fed pivot</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto markets are dishing out a heavy dose of nostalgia to start the year, off to their strongest rally in 9 months.</p>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> is trading close to $21,000, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> is at $1,500 and altcoins are powering aggressively upward, too.</p>
<p>I took a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/why-are-crypto-prices-rising-2023-off-to-hot-start/">snapshot of the market</a> on this day last week, when markets had bounced to start the new year. One week later, the direction is the same &ndash; but the rally has been taken up a notch. The below chart presents crypto price returns to start the year, a sea of upward moves:</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12454307">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2><strong>What is causing prices to rise?</strong></h2>
<p>Over the past year, i<em>nflation</em> has perhaps replaced <em>pandemic&nbsp;</em>as the dirtiest word in our vocabularies. But it is for good reason, with the globe gripped by an inflation crisis the likes of which we haven&rsquo;t seen since the 1970s.</p>
<p>But in the last few weeks, just a little bit of optimism that inflation has peaked has seeped into the market. This has led to investors betting that the Federal Reserve will peel away from interest rate rises sooner than previously expected. And the markets are doing something that most people forgot they could &ndash; they&rsquo;ve gone <em>up.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The market in general has risen. The S&amp;P 500 is up close to 5%. Crypto prices can throw up a 5% candle in a matter of minutes, but the stock market is obviously less volatile, and 5% amounts to a strong move &ndash; there were only four occasions throughout what was a very volatile 2022 when the market rose by this much in a week.</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12454394">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p>Interest rates hold the key for the crypto markets. Altcoins trade like levered bets on Bitcoin, and Bitcoin has been trading like a levered bet on the S&amp;P 500 over the last year or so. Ever since interest rates began to be hiked in April 2022, the Bitcoin price has <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/73-less-bitcoin-millionaires-than-a-year-ago-as-crypto-losses-top-2-trillion-in-torrid-2022/">been freefalling</a>.</p>
<p>While there have been wobbles drawn from the crypto market itself (the LUNA death spiral, Celsius crash and staggering <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-insolvent-what-next-for-crypto/">FTX debacle</a> spring to mind), the key variable is undoubtedly tight monetary policy suppressing the value of all risk assets. Bitcoin will not be allowed to rise until the Fed pivots, and this past week has seen investors move towards a stance that expects that pivot earlier than previously.</p>
<h2><strong>Will it continue?</strong></h2>
<p>The next key date is February 1<sup>st</sup>, when the Federal Reserve will meet to decide the latest interest rate policy. These FOMC meetings, alongside the monthly CPI report, have been the key drivers in markets over the last year.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/its-the-calm-before-the-storm-in-crypto-markets/">five days ago</a> about how we would get volatility to end the week as we ran into the CPI report. That report came in as anticipated, but reflected another month of falling inflation, which as described earlier propelled markets upward.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the surge in prices is somewhat surprising when considering the words that have thus far come out of Fed chairman Jerome Powell&rsquo;s mouth. He has been adamant that a pivot is not coming and has even taken swipes at the market&rsquo;s perceived premature assumption that monetary policy will be loosened again.</p>
<p>Indeed, there had been plenty of false starts in the market over the last year, with investors repeatedly betting that the Fed was bluffing over the extent and speed that interest rate hikes would be implemented. This is part of the reason that the subsequent move downward has been so fierce.</p>
<p>In truth, the below chart paints the picture better than a thousand words:</p>

<h2><strong>Altcoins making greater moves</strong></h2>
<p>As we have seen repeatedly throughout crypto history, the higher-beta altcoins are printing gains significantly higher than Bitcoin. Of course, this comes from a lower base &ndash; the downside of higher beta is that when times are tough, the pain is that much more severe, and altcoins have certainly experienced that throughout this crypto winter.</p>
<p>The gains have been led by Solana, the Layer 1 that has had a tumultuous year even by crypto standards. I wrote a deep dive on it <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/is-solana-dead-top-projects-flee-the-blockchain/">two weeks ago</a>, but the coin had plummeted from at one point holding the third spot behind Ethereum and Bitcoin to barely hanging on inside the top 20.</p>
<p>A combination of repeated outages, top projects leaving for rival blockchains and a close connection with the disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried all contributed to Solana shaving 97% from its all-time high of $260, trading towards the end of 2022 at $7.70.</p>
<p>But in typical crypto standards, a flip of sentiment led by the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/why-is-bonk-going-up-be-careful-of-doggy-tokens-we-have-seen-this-movie-before/">outright inexplicable</a> meme coin BONK has helped to boost the coin, which is now trading at $23.40, having more than doubled in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Meme coins have been enjoying the gains across the board. This would normally be the part where I&rsquo;d try input some analysis about why, but we know by now that there is no real pattern to the meme coin madness, so instead I will simply list the returns. Shiba Inu is up 29%, while the Daddy of them all, Dogecoin, has added 20% and is now trading at a market cap of $11.2 billion.</p>
<h2><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2>
<p>For now, investors are enjoying the gains, having simply tried to survive throughout 2022. But in looking at the market, while prices have soared, volatility remains low and volumes are still way off what they were during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The market has been uncharacteristically serene since the FTX implosion, and this is the first real move of any significance. While optimism is obvious, investors remain somewhat cautious and prices are still extremely suppressed from this time last year.</p>
<p>A 75% fall followed by a 20% rally still amounts to a 70% fall. So while the green candles are pretty this morning for traders &ndash; and long overdue &ndash; the scale of the damage to crypto here is still severe. Institutional adoption has likely been <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/even-cathie-wood-admits-institutional-adoption-of-crypto-will-fall-off/">dented harshly</a> by the myriad scandals, there is still the potential for more <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/expect-crypto-contagion-as-ftx-crisis-is-far-from-over/">dominoes to fall</a> in the FTX web of contagion, and macro/inflation remains highly uncertain.</p>
<p>The last two weeks amount to some much-needed positive news not only for crypto, but for the economy as a whole. Investors are celebrating that with surging charts, but these are still uncertain times with many twists and turns ahead.</p>
