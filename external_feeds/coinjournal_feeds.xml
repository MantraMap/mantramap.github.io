<li>Michael Saylor reiterates his bullish view on Bitcoin.</li>
<li>MicroStrategy Inc currently has about 140,000 BTC.</li>
<li>Bitcoin has lost nearly 10% from its high in April.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has lost nearly 10% in recent weeks but the pullback is only an opportunity to build a position as far as Michael Saylor &ndash; Chairman of MicroStrategy Inc is concerned.</p>
<h2>Saylor is sceptic on other cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>Interestingly, his bullish view is particular to bitcoin only while he remains &ldquo;sceptic&rdquo; on other cryptocurrencies in the midst of regulatory uncertainty. Speaking with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/05/19/microstrategy-michael-saylor-crypto-growing-pains.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a> today, Saylor said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think bitcoin has found the bottom, the leverage is out of it, we are on a bull run. BTC is the one commodity the SEC won&rsquo;t regulate. I think the way is clear for bitcoin to rally from here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-03/fed-raises-rates-by-a-quarter-point-and-hints-at-possible-pause" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pause</a>&rdquo; which could be a tailwind for BTC moving forward as easing monetary policy is known to see investors make riskier bets.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy Inc currently has about 140,000 bitcoin bought for a total cost of roughly $4.17 billion.</p>
<h2>Why else is he keeping bullish on bitcoin?</h2>
<p>Saylor is convinced that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/04/us-banks-failing-pacwest-western-alliance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent bank failures</a> and the regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies will work in favour of the bitcoin considering its reputation as the safe haven.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is the most secure network, the most secure asset. You&rsquo;ll see a consistent flow of capital flowing from the rest of the crypto ecosystem to bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other reasons cited for the bullish view on BTC include the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lightning-network.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightning Network</a>&rdquo; &ndash; a protocol layered over bitcoin that he&rsquo;s convinced has the potential to be a disruptive payment network.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, Anthony Pompliano also <a href="https://cryptonews.net/news/bitcoin/21011727/">said</a> that bitcoin was like the world&rsquo;s biggest insurance company.</p>

<li dir="ltr">The new platform is designed to give users more control over their data and identity</li>
<li dir="ltr">Web5 is also targeted at making it easier for developers to build decentralised applications.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The platform is powered by the Bitcoin blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">TBD, a fintech startup of former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s company Block, has <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> the launch of a new decentralised web platform called Web5.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Web5: Giving users more control over their data</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The announcement that TBD made on 19 May at the Bitcoin 2023 in Miami revealed that the new platform&rsquo;s focus will be on giving users a way to enjoy more control over personal data and identity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Web5 is built on top of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> blockchain, and it uses decentralised identifiers (DIDs) to create a secure and private way for users to sign in to applications. DIDs are unique identifiers that are not tied to any centralised entity, so users can be sure that their data is not being tracked or sold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The platform includes a decentralised web node (DWN), which is a personal data store that users can use to store their own data. This data can include things like contact information, social media profiles, and financial records.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">DWNs are encrypted and stored on the blockchain, so users can be sure that their data is secure and private.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Web5 will also look to offer access to the tools and support developers need to build decentralised applications.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">TBD primarily focused on Bitcoin</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Dorsey is one of the most popular self-taught programmers and a big believer in Bitcoin. He also believes in the power of decentralised technology, which is the path TBD is taking as it looks to create a more decentralised and user-centric web.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While most of the industry is looking to tap into Web3, Dorsey&rsquo;s Web5 is seeing the potential the new Web5 technology offers in terms of handing control of data and identity to users. Key actors in this quest include wallets, Decentralised Web Nodes (DWNS), and Decentralised Web Apps (DWAS).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dorsey teased the development of TBD in June 2021, which CoinJournal covered <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/jack-dorsey-unveils-plans-for-a-bitcoin-developer-platform/">here</a>.</p>

<li>The Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX) is owned by Miami International Holdings (MIH).</li>
<li>The acquisition deal was announced in April and approved by the bankruptcy judge on May 4.</li>
<li>LedgerX is one of the FTX assets the bankruptcy court approved for sale in January.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX) has today completed acquiring LedgerX, which is one of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/is-ftx-insolvent-why-is-binance-selling-ftt-deep-dive/">FTX&nbsp;</a>assets the court had approved for sale.</p>
<p>LedgerX operated as an exchange and clearinghouse and was regulated by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<h2>MIAX expansion into the swaps and futures industry</h2>
<p>According to the CEO of MIAX, Thomas Gallagher, the acquisition of LedgerX is &ldquo;an important part of our growth strategy, expanding our ability to offer new and innovative products to the swaps and futures industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an April tweet, the CEO of OPNX, a cryptocurrency exchange co-founded by Three Arrows Capital (3AC) founders claimed that MIAX was also an investor in the firm.</p>
<p>The acquisition process started in April when the involved parties entered into a $50 million purchase agreement. The agreement was, however, approved on May 4 by Judge John Dorsey of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and it has taken almost 15 more days to complete the purchase.</p>
<h2>FTX assets approved for sale</h2>
<p>LedgerX was among the four <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-has-the-green-light-to-sell-its-other-businesses-including-ledgerx/">FTX subsidiaries that were approved for sale</a> in January by the Delaware court. The other three are FTX Japan, FTX Europe, and the stock-trading platform Embed.</p>
<p>On May 17, FTX filed a lawsuit against the former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, former engineering director Nishad Singh, and co-founder Gary Wang for failing to apply due diligence when acquiring Embed. FTX paid $200 million when acquiring the stock trading platform.</p>
<p>It was reported that 117 prospective buyers expressed interest in the four assets out of which 56 wanted to acquire LedgerX.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The DeFi ecosystem has suffered huge losses over the past two years due to the ongoing bear market.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Giddy&rsquo;s DeFi smart wallet seeks to solve the problems of interoperability and ease of use within the DeFi ecosystem.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Eric Parker, the CEO of Giddy, believes that the DeFi ecosystem will ultimately become Finance 2.0</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Binance Smart Chain (BNB) and Ethereum were some of the leading blockchains for DeFi projects. Despite the major growth recorded by the DeFi ecosystem in recent years, one of the major issues that remain is interoperability. Not many projects are working on solving interoperability within the DeFi ecosystem, a solution that would make it easier to move tokens between various blockchains.</p>
<p>Giddy, a provider of a self-custody smart wallet, is making a mark in this area. The company&rsquo;s DreFi smart wallet integrates with some of the best projects in DeFi and is set to increase interoperability and ease of use even more.</p>
<p>Coinjournal sat down with Eric Parker, the CEO of Giddy, to discuss the company&rsquo;s plans after recently raising $6.9 million in a funding round.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Coinjournal (CJ)</strong>: Giddy recently raised $6.9 million and will use the funds to boost DeFi adoption. How does Giddy intend to improve on some of the existing DeFi solutions or expand its services?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Eric Parker (EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>We&rsquo;ve developed a ton of new tech already- from our self-custody no-seed-phrase private key solution to our Autogas and our one-tap staking, all of this works together to make DeFi feel seamless for brand new and experienced crypto users alike. Giddy currently integrates with some of the best projects in DeFi, and we&rsquo;ll be using this funding to increase interoperability and ease-of-use even more. Next up we&rsquo;re going to add more chains, integrate new DeFi protocols, add more utility to our token, add new fiat off-ramps, and bolster our private key platform for more ease and security. We&rsquo;ve shown we can build the concept and scale it. Now it&rsquo;s all about extending our DeFi smart wallet across all aspects of DeFi.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: Could you talk more about the involvement of your strategic investors in this funding round, and how their expertise will contribute to Giddy&rsquo;s growth and development?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>We have some really incredible advisors and strategic investors, who come from backgrounds and have experience at some of the biggest consumer experience brands like Disney, Fortnite, Traegar Grills, and more. What we love is that they have &ldquo;been there, done that&rdquo; when it comes to creating incredible consumer experiences &ndash; something we think that&rsquo;s been lacking in the crypto space, and is a prerequisite to true mass adoption. So much of crypto has been focused on infrastructure technology, and while that&rsquo;s certainly needed, we think there&rsquo;s a huge opportunity to solve the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; problem by putting tech in actual user&rsquo;s hands and focusing on the end user experience to an extreme degree. We&rsquo;re beyond lucky and very grateful to have these advisors helping us make something really special happen here.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: Can you discuss how Giddy&rsquo;s Autogas feature works and how it addresses the issue of gas fees in DeFi transactions?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP: </strong><em>Pretty much anyone who has interacted with the blockchain knows the pain of running out of gas, or having to hold some arbitrary amount of tokens just to pay network fees. Giddy&rsquo;s Autogas feature is a first for crypto users and is a game changer when you experience it. As long as you hold USDC, GIDDY token, or MATIC in your wallet, you can swap, stake, or send any token on the Polygon chain with no additional cost or hassle. More token types and chains are coming soon, which means with the Giddy smart wallet, you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about running out of gas again, no matter what chain you&rsquo;re on.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: How does Giddy ensure the security of its users&rsquo; private keys, especially with the increasing prevalence of hacking and cyber attacks in the crypto industry?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>Great question. So first off, it&rsquo;s important to mention that under the hood, Giddy is a self-custody wallet, which means it&rsquo;s always your keys, your crypto. You can export your private key, and verify all transactions as they happen on the blockchain. But what we&rsquo;ve done is eliminate the need to write down your seed phrase and have to store it somewhere, which, as you know, is a dangerous single point of failure for many users.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>When you download our app and go through the one-minute setup process, Giddy is actually splitting your private key into multiple secure shares that are owned and controlled by you, using several factors that you&rsquo;re familiar with, such as your email login, your phone, an Authenticator app, etc. This allows you to recover your wallet as long as you control at least two of your shares &ndash; meaning if you ever lose your device or forget a password, your money can still be recovered as long as you have the other shares. And crucially, if one of your shares is ever compromised, your funds are still safe because it always takes at least two factors to get your wallet back. This makes your wallet as convenient as a hot wallet, while being just as secure (if not more so) than a cold wallet. With Giddy, you can say goodbye to lost seed phrases.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: What is the Giddy MPC technology, and how exactly does it work?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>We dove into how it works in the last question, but this is a good time to talk a bit about Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Most MPC implementations utilize other individuals, such as a family member or friend, to be a guardian of a share of your private key. That&rsquo;s where Giddy stands out &ndash; our implementation gives users complete control over their wallet recovery, all while using security factors that you own. So rather than having to go to Uncle Bob to unlock your MPC wallet, with Giddy, you always have complete control. How it works feels incredibly natural, just like using any other Web 2.0 mobile app &ndash; except you&rsquo;re getting the full benefits and tech behind a real self-custody Web 3.0 wallet.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: Giddy&rsquo;s unique solution implements elements of the Ethereum Foundation&rsquo;s guidelines in the new ERC-4337 standard. What does Giddy intend to achieve with this solution?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>The Ethereum Foundation released the new ERC-4337 standard to help improve end users&rsquo; experience on the Ethereum network, but this didn&rsquo;t just happen overnight. Vitalik and other key Ethereum developers have been talking about the core principles behind ERC-4337, e.g. account abstraction, for years. The other thing to know about ERC-4337 is that it&rsquo;s a set of guidelines to help developers, but developers still have to actually build the technology themselves. The Giddy smart wallet has been in development for almost 18 months, and we started with the end user in mind. So it&rsquo;s no wonder that we&rsquo;ve actually arrived at many of the same conclusions set out and defined in ERC-4337. We set out to solve the same challenges outlined in ERC-4337 before it was fully baked, and we&rsquo;re already ahead of the game by implementing some of the core features spelled out in the proposal, such as AutoGas and one-tap staking.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: Giddy has been chosen for the Robinhood Connect Program. What role will Giddy play in the program, and how will Robinhood Connect boost crypto adoption?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>We had a chance to meet with the Robinhood Connect team at ETH Denver, and quickly hit it off. As you can probably tell from this interview, we&rsquo;re obsessed with user experience, and so are they, which is why Robinhood Connect fits perfectly into our platform. We&rsquo;re happy to be one of the first wallets to integrate Robinhood Connect as a launch participant, and see it as a great channel for onboarding users into crypto going forward through its ease of use.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: What do you think about the current DeFi ecosystem, and where do you see the sector in the next decade?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP: </strong><em>Yeah, there has certainly been a lot of discussion about the state of DeFi, particularly coming out of the &lsquo;DeFi Summer&rsquo; of 2021 and into the down cycle of 2023. I&rsquo;m seeing major investments into the foundational infrastructure of what will ultimately become Finance 2.0. While most of the million-percent APY inflationary IDOs (I like to call them Ponzi speedruns) have gone away, we&rsquo;re now seeing fundamentally sound business models operating on-chain, generating real yield and rewriting legacy financial protocols into modern Web 3.0 equivalents. I think over the next decade, we&rsquo;ll see quite a bit of market consolidation &ndash; right now most of the tech is fractured, and interoperability isn&rsquo;t quite where it needs to be yet. The best user experiences will rise to the top because that&rsquo;s what will drive adoption as people look for how to get on board with the finance 2.0 movement. Also, smart regulation will allow the entire ecosystem to build trust within the nations that embrace it, whereas those that don&rsquo;t will be left behind.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has stalled its movement over the past few days as investors consider their positions.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Investors are keenly observing the ongoing debt talks, with the United States&rsquo; debt now above $31 trillion.</p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">With prices now down, this could be an excellent opportunity for investors to purchase cryptocurrencies like Metacade.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been in a consolidating stage this week, with prices of most cryptocurrencies currently in the red zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors have been keenly observing the ongoing debt ceiling talks in the United States, with many of them conservative in their approach. This has led to a poor performance from the crypto market this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As the prices of most cryptocurrencies declined this week, could this be a perfect opportunity to purchase more coins and tokens like&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=investment_opportunity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a>?&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The debt ceiling and how it could affect the cryptocurrency market</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently stated that the United States could surpass its debt ceiling by June 1st. If that happens, market experts believe that the US could default on its debt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the official data obtained from the US Treasury Fiscal Data website, the US&rsquo;s current&nbsp;<a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20national%20debt,accumulated%20over%20the%20nation's%20history." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>debt stands at $31.46 trillion</u></a>. The debt limit is the highest amount the United States government can borrow to service the economy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Due to the ongoing talks, the cryptocurrency market has underperformed this week. Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, continues to trade below $27k. At press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at $26,884, down by 1% so far today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The total cryptocurrency market cap also stands at $1.13 trillion, down by 1% over the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What are experts saying about the debt ceiling?&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Some market experts believe that the US will not default on its loan but will likely print more dollars. This will effectively weaken the dollar and strengthen assets such as cryptocurrencies and commodities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jesse Meyers, the chief operating officer of investment firm Onramp,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Croesus_BTC/status/1650934343316152320" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>believes</u></a> that the US government will print more money, resulting in a 2020-like rally by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He stated that;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;When the debt ceiling is lifted, and credit-contraction leads to an economic crisis. They will have to print money on a massive scale. Bitcoin was the winner during the last round of stimulus.&ldquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Market analysts are predicting that Bitcoin and other major assets could experience a boost if the US government prints more dollars to service its debts, as there would be liquidity available for investors to purchase BTC and other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How does this affect projects like Metacade?&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin&rsquo;s rally is usually duplicated by other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=investment_opportunity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> could be one of the projects that could be a big winner if the market experiences another bull cycle soon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, the price of Metacade stands at $0.02002, down by 10% over the last 24 hours. The token is down by 56% from its all-time high price of $0.04569. This could represent an excellent buying opportunity for investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What makes MCADE one of the tokens investors could consider is the potential of the Metacade project.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is a web3 project that is powered by the Ethereum blockchain. The development team is working to improve the existing play-to-earn (P2E) ecosystem, allowing users to enjoy new web3 experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Metacade, players will be able to play, connect, build, and earn seamlessly. In addition to that, Metacade will transition into a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) by 2024, giving token holders control over the ecosystem. With such plans in motion, MCADE could be one of the biggest winners in the upcoming Bull Cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is Metacade a good investment now?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Down by more than 50% from its all-time high, MCADE could be trading at a discount at the moment. Investors looking to take advantage of the project&rsquo;s potential could purchase MCADE tokens now.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">After raising $16 million during the presale event, the&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=investment_opportunity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> team is working hard to list the token on several cryptocurrency exchanges and roll out its GameFi platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">These events could ultimately lead to a surge in the value of Metacade over the next few months and possibly years.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">Pompliano argues that Bitcoin&rsquo;s unique properties make it an attractive insurance asset for a variety of reasons.</li>
<li dir="ltr">He says Bitcoin provides insurance against a variety of risks, including, currency debasement and sovereign default.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin critics however point to things like the volatile nature of crypto assets and meagre adoption as reasons why it might not be the global insurance company.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Anthony Pompliano, a venture capitalist and popular <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> advocate, argues that BTC could be considered the largest insurance company in the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The investor says the idea was proposed to him at a breakfast meeting with two investors, whose point suggested that the world&rsquo;s largest insurance company may not &ldquo;look like&rdquo; the typical insurance company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is bitcoin the largest insurance company in the world?</p>
<p>This was the question posed by two investors at breakfast yesterday. In this piece, I unpack why they may be correct in their analysis.<a href="https://t.co/nSS4xDnuou">https://t.co/nSS4xDnuou</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Pomp &#127786; (@APompliano) <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1659536569861111808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why Bitcoin could be the insurance</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Pompliano&rsquo;s argument, published in the <a href="https://pomp.substack.com/p/is-bitcoin-the-largest-insurance#details" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest edition</a> of The Pomp Letter, is based on the idea that Bitcoin provides insurance against a variety of risks, including, currency debasement, sovereign default, undisciplined monetary and fiscal policy, and economic censorship.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">He explained:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Just as there are different insurance policies that serve different purposes, Bitcoin is different things to different people. And just as most policyholders don&rsquo;t want to ever have to use their insurance, most bitcoiners realise that bitcoin&rsquo;s success will likely come on the heels of major issues in the legacy financial world</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On what exactly makes Bitcoin an insurance, the entrepreneur listed a number of reasons.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He says Bitcoin is a one-time purchase, and it comes with certain advantages. Unlike traditional insurance policies, BTC doesn&rsquo;t require ongoing premiums. If you buy early, Bitcoin comes as a cheap premium and much more expensive when done later.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The second reason is that <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/">cryptocurrency</a> is a decentralised asset that is not subject to the control of any one entity, which makes it more reliable than traditional insurance companies. It also has an inverse relation to catastrophe in traditional finance, the latest example being when BTC price rose amid the US banking crisis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, Bitcoin is a global asset that can be accessed by anyone, anywhere in the world, which makes it more accessible than traditional insurance products. As an insurance, its programmatic nature means holders don&rsquo;t need to submit claims and wait for someone to judge whether to honour it or not.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin critics may disagree, but&hellip;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Although Bitcoin continues to see major adoption across the globe, the argument such as the one highlighted by Pompliano has not escaped crypto critics. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For some, BTC remains too volatile to be considered a reliable insurance asset. Another argument is that the digital asset hasn&rsquo;t achieved the adoption levels that would make it a practical insurance choice for most people.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pomp says the idea is still a viable one, especially with the possibility that Bitcoin can be an insurance against events like inflation and economic collapse. Most of these events have largely been &ldquo;uninsurable.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>No insurance company is going to write you a legitimate policy against high inflation. They won&rsquo;t write you a policy against government seizure of your assets. The insurance companies historically have not covered hyperinflation or economic collapse</em>,&rdquo; the investor argued.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He also thinks one doesn&rsquo;t need to hold huge amounts of BTC to tap into the benefits. Putting about 1-3% of investment allocation into bitcoin can be an effective hedge against negative impact of economic risks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Nearly $24 billion of stablecoins have left exchanges since FTX collapsed last November</li>
<li dir="ltr">The total marketcap of stablecoins has dipped $16 billion in that time</li>
<li dir="ltr">Liquidity continues to fall in the crypto space, with capital moving elsewhere despite rising prices</li>
<li dir="ltr">Strict regulatory climate in the US, high yields in trad-fi and uncertainty may be contributing to the pattern</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto prices have risen since the start of the year, but capital continues to flow out of the space. Last week brought the news that two prominent market makers, Jane Street and Jump Crypto, were <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-liquidity-falling-as-market-makers-pull-back-from-hostile-us-market/"><u>scaling back</u></a> operations in the US amid the continued regulatory crackdown on the sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For markets that have already been suffering from thin liquidity since the Alameda insolvency last year, the news amounts to the latest blow. While rising prices may have brushed the problem under the carpet for the time being, Bitcoin markets getting drained of capital is undoubtedly a hurdle that needs to be overcome for an asset that has ambitions of establishing itself in the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Indeed, with liquidity so low, prices have been able to move up more rapidly, with less capital needed to shift the shallow order books on exchanges. In the short-term, this has been a boon. As inflation has come down and forecasts around the future path of interest rates have softened in the last six months, crypto has thus surged upward with less resistance in its way, Bitcoin expanding over 60% this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13825425">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">In the long-term, however, this is not a bullish development. Thin liquidity means amplified moves downward as well as upward. And looking at the regulatory climate, things only seem to be getting worse for crypto firms based in the US, which happens to be the centre of the financial world.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SEC is on a warpath with the entire entire industry, clapping back at accusations that it is the lack of regulatory clarity that is causing so many issues, but rather &ldquo;mass non-compliance&rdquo; on the part of crypto firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The money is talking. We have discussed the recent announcements of market makers, but a glance at the liquidity on exchanges also reveals the capital flight that is occurring. This week, the total balance of stablecoins on exchanges dipped below $20 billion. At the start of the year, that figure read $37.7 billion. When FTX fell in November, it was $43.5 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13825154">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">We have published research on this exodus <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/45-of-stablecoin-balance-has-left-crypto-exchanges-in-4-months-but-where-has-all-the-money-gone-a-deep-dive/"><u>before</u></a>. But the flood shows no sign of drying up, and we are now at a place whereby 55% of the stablecoins on exchanges have departed since FTX and Alameda <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-insolvent-what-next-for-crypto/"><u>went poof</u></a> in November.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This 55% outflow represents a funnelling out of nearly $24 billion, a massive chunk when considering the entire stablecoin market cap is currently only $130 billion. Interestingly, the market cap was $146 billion when FTX went down, meaning the total stablecoin drawdown has &ldquo;only&rdquo; been $16 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This suggests stablecoins are being moved elsewhere in the blockchain world, as well as fleeing the crypto space altogether. But with T-bills yielding an easy 5% while the regulatory climate around crypto continues to worsen, it is not a surprise to see investors&rsquo; heads turned. When considering the fear around custody of assets after FTX collapsed, and the fact the macro climate remains uncertain, this makes more sense again.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whatever happened, the main point here is that liquidity in the crypto space continues to be drained. Most order books are as shallow as they have been in over two years, and Bitcoin&rsquo;s volatility remains high (even with the last couple of weeks feeling relatively serene, Bitcoin has still dropped 12%). As for other cryptos, the effect is even more pronounced. If this liquidity issue doesn&rsquo;t change, crypto will have a tough time establishing itself as a force on the mainstream stage.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">Shrimps have been adding an average of 26,000 BTC every month, data shows.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The growth of the shrimp cohort is a positive development for the Bitcoin network.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The amount of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> held by &ldquo;shrimps&rdquo; &ndash; those <a href="https://coinjournal.net/wallets/">wallet</a> entities that currently hold less than 1 BTC) has reached a new all-time high.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1659279592899637253" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> from Glassnode, shrimps have increased their total holdings to 1.31 million BTC. The cohort has witnessed the gradual increase in holdings over the past several months.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shrimps grow holdings by +26,000 BTC every month</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Per data Glassnode shared via Twitter, the shrimp cohort has experienced a significant expansion of their holdings in 2023. This followed a similar trend last year, with the buying among this group coming despite the greater volatility that hit the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Specifically, shrimps have added 26,000 or more Bitcoin every month. Since July 2020, only 202 (3.9%) trading days have recorded a larger monthly growth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The suggestion from this is that retail investors have been aggressive in accumulating BTC, with the dips seen during the bear market providing investors with an opportunity to buy Bitcoin at low prices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The chart below shows the growth in the amount of BTC held by wallet addresses with less than 1 bitcoin. As you can see, the amount held by these entities has increased significantly in June/July 2022 and again in November/December and January 2023.</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption    fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable" style="width: 615px"><span class="fr-img-wrap"><a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1659279592899637253" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/19/1684506138046-7c6d8ab7-56de-4993-8c07-1776fa24bb82.jpg" style="width: 700px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="700" height="353"><span class="fr-inner"></span></a></span></span></div>
<p dir="ltr">Increase in small holders is a positive for the long-term health of Bitcoin&rsquo;s network as the metric suggests retail investors are confident in the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s growth and long term potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">MATIC is up by only 3% over the past seven days despite Polygon announcing a series of interesting partnerships.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Antimetal launched its AI-powered cloud cost optimization platform on Polygon.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">MATIC could be eyeing the $1 mark, but the fundamentals of the broader crypto market could play a huge role.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">MATIC continues to trade below $1</h2>
<p dir="ltr">MATIC, the native coin of the Polygon ecosystem, is trading below the $1 mark. The coin has less than 1% of its value over the past 24 hours. At press time, the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/polygon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Polygon</u></a> stands at $0.8748 per coin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The performance comes despite Polygon announcing several key partnerships this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, AntiMetal launched its AI-powered cloud cost optimization platform on the Polygon blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The partnership was followed by Horizon integrating Sequence&rsquo;s wallet and developer stack on Polygon providing enterprises and app developers the ability to customize and extend blockspace.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">In the same vein, Sandeep Nailwal, the CEO of Polygon, also launched a web3 fellowship program.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Will MATIC move past the $1 soon?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">MATIC has been underperforming over the past few days due to the fundamentals of the broader cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;</p>
