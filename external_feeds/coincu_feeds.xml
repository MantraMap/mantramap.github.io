<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>French privacy watchdog CNIL investigates Sam Altman&#8217;s Worldcoin project over the legality of its biometric data collection, raising concerns about storing such data.</em></li>



<li><em>Worldcoin requires users to provide iris scans for a digital ID and offers free cryptocurrency in certain countries, attracting 2.1 million users in a trial period.</em></li>



<li><em>The project&#8217;s unique ID system aims to combat online identity fraud and income inequality, but regulatory scrutiny and investigations in Germany could impact its future.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Friday, France&#8217;s privacy watchdog, CNIL, made public its awareness of Sam Altman&#8217;s Worldcoin project and expressed concern over the legality of its biometric data collection.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2181.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2181-1024x576.png" alt="Worldcoin&#039;s Controversy: French Privacy Watchdog Investigates Ambitious Project" class="wp-image-206969" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2181-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2181-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2181-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2181-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2181-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2181.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Worldcoin&#039;s Controversy: French Privacy Watchdog Investigates Ambitious Project 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The ambitious venture launched just days ago, has been a topic of controversy in Silicon Valley due to its unorthodox approach to tackling online identity authentication and income inequality.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/206496-worldcoin-proves-critics-wrong-altman-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldcoin</a>&#8216;s concept requires users to provide their iris scans in exchange for a digital ID, and in some countries, they receive free cryptocurrency as well. The platform claims to have already registered 2.1 million participants, primarily through a two-year trial period.</p>



<p>At the core of Worldcoin&#8217;s proposition lies &#8220;Tools for Humanity,&#8221; the company behind the project. According to insiders, Altman has used AI advancements as a compelling incentive to attract investors. As the value of the Worldcoin token, dubbed &#8220;<a href="https://coincu.com/205553-worldcoin-unveils-new-nft-collectible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WLD</a>,&#8221; appreciates, it promises to yield substantial returns for Altman and other stakeholders.</p>

<p>The process of acquiring a unique <a href="https://coincu.com/204875-worldcoins-world-id-sdk-is-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldcoin ID</a> involves scanning users&#8217; irises using a specialized device called &#8220;The Orb.&#8221; This biometric data collection aims to distinguish real individuals from bots, a critical concern given the rise of large language models like ChatGPT. Additionally, it could play a crucial role in mitigating fraud when governments contemplate implementing &#8220;universal basic income&#8221; programs.</p>



<p>While the project has attracted attention worldwide, it has also raised red flags with regulatory authorities. The British data regulator announced earlier this week that it would be investigating Worldcoin following its recent launch.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2182.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="503" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2182.png" alt="Worldcoin&#039;s Controversy: French Privacy Watchdog Investigates Ambitious Project" class="wp-image-206971" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2182.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2182-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2182-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2182-750x393.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="Worldcoin&#039;s Controversy: French Privacy Watchdog Investigates Ambitious Project 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>In response to inquiries from <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/frances-privacy-watchdog-says-worldcoin-legality-seems-questionable-2023-07-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em>, CNIL expressed reservations about the legitimacy of Worldcoin&#8217;s biometric data collection and storage practices. The French watchdog has initiated its own investigation but has discovered that the Bavarian state authority in Germany holds jurisdiction over the matter. Subsequently, the Bavarian authority has taken the lead in the investigation, with support from CNIL.</p>



<p>As the situation unfolds, Worldcoin&#8217;s future hinges on the resolution of these investigations and compliance with privacy and data protection regulations in various countries. The novel approach to solving complex issues is a double-edged sword, and its success will be closely monitored by both investors and authorities alike.</p>

<p>The renowned crypto derivatives and copy trading platform, <a href="https://coincu.com/205333-bitget-now-listed-wld-token/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitget</a>, will be listing its token, BGB, on <a href="https://coincu.com/192190-mexc-global-accused-false-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MEXC</a>, while MEXC&#8217;s platform token, MX, will find its way onto Bitget&#8217;s exchange. This move is set to bolster liquidity, accessibility, and overall value and utility for both tokens, presenting traders with new opportunities and privileges.</p>



<p>The decision comes at a time when major exchanges like <a href="https://coincu.com/206699-binance-accuses-cftc-overruling-stop-the-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/206128-okx-exchange-breaks-new-records-11-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OKX</a> are increasingly focusing on compliance measures. Bybit, Bitget, and MEXC have recognized the potential to tap into markets like Japan and South Korea, leading them to adopt a more aggressive approach to expand their user base. Their mutual equity relationship ensures a coordinated effort in their advancement strategies, presenting a united front in the competitive crypto arena.</p>



<p>Bitget&#8217;s native token, BGB, plays a crucial role within the platform&#8217;s ecosystem, boasting a circulating supply of 1,400,000,000 and a total supply of 2,000,000,000. Holders of BGB enjoy a range of exclusive privileges and rights on Bitget&#8217;s exchange, including fee discounts, access to high-quality tokens through Launchpad and Launchpool participation, and the highly sought-after Super Airdrop feature.</p>



<p>The decision to list BGB on MEXC is in response to the soaring demand for the token in the market. Impressively, BGB has already attracted over 300,000 holders and achieved a staggering total trading volume of more than two billion USD since the beginning of the year. Its price growth has been remarkable, reaching an all-time high of over 0.51 USDT in February, outperforming even BTC and emerging as the best-performing exchange token in H1 2023.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2176.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2176-1024x1024.png" alt="Bitget And MEXC Create New Breakthrough To Compete With Other Platforms" class="wp-image-206962" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2176-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2176-300x300.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2176-150x150.png 150w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2176-768x768.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2176-75x75.png 75w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2176-350x350.png 350w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2176-750x750.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2176.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitget And MEXC Create New Breakthrough To Compete With Other Platforms 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>Bitget&#8217;s own success and steady growth have undoubtedly contributed to the surge in BGB&#8217;s value. With a rising share in both the spot and derivatives trading markets, the platform has earned a reputation for high financial security, garnering significant traction among traders. Moreover, Bitget&#8217;s impressive track record of listing over 180 coins in 2023 and delivering the best Launchpad performance, with an ATH average ROI of 41.9x, has further enhanced the appeal and use cases for BGB.</p>



<p>The release of the updated BGB whitepaper in April unveiled exciting new features in development, such as the BGB lottery, a trial fund for futures trading, and exclusive earning services. Additionally, Bitget is actively exploring a BGB buyback and burn mechanism to reduce the token&#8217;s circulating supply, thereby increasing its overall value. Another innovative feature, &#8220;Super Airdrop,&#8221; was introduced in May, allowing eligible BGB holders to receive airdrops of new crypto assets listed on the Bitget platform.</p>

<p>Besides the developments surrounding BGB, Bitget&#8217;s growing influence and continuous expansion within the cryptocurrency market significantly contribute to the demand and price performance of BGB. According to <a href="https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/bitget-sees-market-share-increase-in-q2-with-bgb-becoming-best-performing-cex-token" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TokenInsight&#8217;s Crypto Exchange Report Q2 2023</a>, Bitget ranks fourth in trading volume among all CEXs, with its market share surging by 1.81% to 8.7%, the second-highest increase among the Top 5 CEXs. The platform&#8217;s increasing market share in both the spot market and open interest solidifies its position as a leading player in the industry.</p>



<p>As these exchanges unite their efforts, traders and investors can look forward to enhanced opportunities and a more robust trading experience across both platforms. The listings are scheduled to go live on July 31, signifying a significant milestone for both Bitget and MEXC in their pursuit of market dominance.</p>

<p>The BGB Fund adopts a closed-end structure with a fixed term of 6 years, unless renewed based on the fund&#8217;s documentation. This strategic approach ensures long-term planning and stability, aligning with the company&#8217;s vision of sustainable growth and profitability.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant development within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) vs. Ripple lawsuit, the prominent attorney representing Ripple Labs and its CEO, <a href="https://coincu.com/205247-ripple-ceo-brad-garlinghouse-blames-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brad Garlinghouse</a>, has formally <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.880.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requested</a> to withdraw from the case.</strong></h5>

<p>This request was made following Judge Analisa Torres&#8217; landmark ruling in the ongoing legal battle. Furthermore, Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn has urged both <a href="https://coincu.com/203303-ripple-to-initiate-talks-with-us-financial-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a> and the SEC to explore a potential settlement on other aspects of the lawsuit.</p>



<p>As per the filing in the District Court For the Southern District of New York on July 27, Ripple submitted a motion for Lisa R. Zornberg of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP to withdraw as attorney for the defendants. The company cited that Lisa R. Zornberg will no longer be associated with the law firm effective from July 31.</p>



<p>Despite this withdrawal, Ripple maintains that the interests of the defendants, including Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen, will not be adversely affected. The legal representation for Ripple Labs in the lawsuit will continue with other attorneys from Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP.</p>

<p>Another attorney, Anna R. Gressel, also filed a motion to withdraw as an attorney for Ripple Labs on July 12. Ripple similarly requested the court to grant Anna R. Gressel of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP the withdrawal, as she is no longer associated with the law firm effective as of July 12.</p>



<p>The case has seen additional changes in legal representation, with the court approving withdrawal motions for attorneys Clayton J. Masterman and Kylie Chiseul Kim, who have also exited from the lawsuit.</p>



<p>In response to the recent ruling and disclosure of Ripple&#8217;s future plans, the price of <a href="https://coincu.com/203962-ripple-jumps-over-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP</a> experienced a surge. Notably, XRP holder and lawyer, John E. Deaton, emphasized that even if SEC Chair <a href="https://coincu.com/203493-gary-gensler-feeling-disappointed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Gensler</a> <a href="https://coincu.com/204894-us-sec-signals-appeal-court-ripple-xrp-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeks</a> an appeal, XRP will likely retain its classification as a non-security for at least two years. This prediction is based on the complexities the SEC may face in altering its stance on the matter.</p>

<p>In light of the ongoing developments and changing legal landscape, Judge Analisa Torres has entrusted Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn with the responsibility of overseeing the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. Magistrate Judge Netburn has directed both parties to negotiate and agree on three mutually convenient dates to schedule a settlement conference. This conference aims to address pertinent issues, including the institutional sales of XRP, and explore the possibility of resolving the case outside of court.</p>



<p>Amidst these legal proceedings, it is worth mentioning that Lisa R. Zornberg, the attorney seeking withdrawal from the Ripple case, was appointed as City Hall Chief Counsel by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week, signifying her transition to a new role within the city&#8217;s administration.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>ParaSpace to launch zkSync network, supporting ETH, USDC, and WBTC for NFT lending.</em></li>



<li><em>Platform swiftly resolves asset liquidation issues, reimbursing affected users.</em></li>



<li><em>Exciting upgrades in Version 2.0 promise enhanced user experience in DeFi lending.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ParaSpace, the decentralized NFT lending protocol, has exciting news for its users. The platform has <a href="https://twitter.com/ParaSpace_NFT/status/1684826203499483136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the upcoming launch of the zkSync network, a move aimed at further enhancing its capabilities and user experience.</strong></h5>

<p>With this integration, ParaSpace will support three major cryptocurrencies: ETH, USDC, and WBTC, expanding its reach and offering even more options to its users.</p>



<p>In addition to the zkSync network launch, ParaSpace has implemented four vital features, namely &#8220;Supply,&#8221; &#8220;Withdraw,&#8221; &#8220;Borrow,&#8221; and &#8220;Repay.&#8221; These features are designed to bolster the overall experience on the platform, providing users with more flexibility and control over their assets.</p>



<p>As a fully decentralized and permissionless protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, ParaSpace has already gained popularity for its support of a wide range of fungible tokens, including BTC, ETH, DAI, USDC, and APE, along with various blue chip NFT collections. Furthermore, the platform has ambitious plans to promote capital efficiency across the crypto space by enabling cross-chain lending and borrowing for EVM-compatible or equivalent blockchains in the future.</p>

<p>Recently, ParaSpace also <a href="https://coincu.com/205075-paraspace-swift-action-on-asset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demonstrated</a> its commitment to its users by addressing and rectifying an issue related to asset liquidations that occurred between July 3 and July 4. The platform took prompt action and reimbursed the affected users for the price difference resulting from the liquidations. Moreover, to ensure transparency and provide clarity, ParaSpace plans to host an event for the affected users, demonstrating its dedication to creating a user-friendly ecosystem.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://coincu.com/200128-paraspace-azuki-airdrop-elementals-on-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ParaSpace</a> is gearing up for the launch of Version 2.0, which is <a href="https://coincu.com/202259-paraspace-upcoming-critical-upgrade-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected</a> to bring significant upgrades to the lending platform. With a strong focus on user-friendliness, this new version aims to empower the web3 community with seamless and powerful borrowing options. As the launch date approaches, excitement is building within the decentralized finance space as ParaSpace marks another milestone in its journey to revolutionize the lending ecosystem for NFTs and cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://www.justice.gov/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.justice.gov/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DOJ</a> has accused Bankman-Fried of leaking Caroline Ellison&#8217;s private diary to The New York Times and trying to tamper with witnesses multiple times.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried has requested the court to seal the private diary of Caroline Ellison, his ex-girlfriend and ex-Alameda Research CEO. In response, Inner City Press has opposed the move, according to court filings. Judge Kaplan has declined to jail Bankman-Fried immediately, but has imposed a temporary gag order on parties and witnesses to avoid public dissemination or discussion of the case, which could interfere with a fair trial. Judge Kaplan has also set out a rapid schedule for both the prosecution and the defense to make formal written submissions on the matter.</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyer has written to the court, &#8220;The presumption of access to these documents is greatly outweighed by the need to avoid their public dissemination at this time.&#8221; A publication that covers court proceedings in New York&#8217;s federal court, Inner City Press, has previously opposed Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bid to keep secret the identity of his bail co-signers and asked the court to schedule a hearing on the matter if required.</p>



<p>Inner City&#8217;s Matthew Russell Lee wrote to the court opposing the sealing of documents Bankman-Fried already provided to The New York Times, stating, &#8220;Again this defendant is being treated differently than other defendants in this District. This is an application for this court to grant or, if necessary, schedule a hearing on this challenge to the proposed withholding of this information.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.182.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court case</a> has taken an unexpected turn, with <a href="https://coincu.com/206346-prosecutors-want-sam-bankman-fried-in-jail-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> seeking to seal <a href="https://coincu.com/204571-former-alameda-co-ceo-admits-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ellison</a>&#8216;s private diary, a move that Inner City Press, a publication covering court proceedings, has opposed.</p>



<p>The situation has intensified due to the U.S. Department of Justice&#8217;s (DOJ) request for Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York to have Bankman-Fried remanded to jail before his criminal trial. The DOJ accuses SBF of leaking Ellison&#8217;s diary to <em>The New York Times</em> and tampering with witnesses on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyer, however, has argued that public dissemination of the private diary should be avoided at this time. The attorney asserts that the presumption of access to the documents should be outweighed by the need for privacy.</p>



<p>During a court hearing, Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon emphasized that the leaked diary entries, combined with Bankman-Fried&#8217;s prior interactions with FTX&#8217;s general counsel, constituted witness tampering. Sassoon contended that no set of release conditions could guarantee community safety.</p>



<p>In response to the escalating situation, Judge Kaplan issued a temporary gag order, restricting SBF, his legal team, and representatives from discussing the case publicly. The judge also announced that further filings from both the prosecution and defense would be accepted over the next week. Kaplan will then decide whether to revoke Bankman-Fried&#8217;s current bond conditions, which permit him to remain under house arrest until his scheduled criminal trial in October.</p>

<p>Inner City Press, known for its involvement in court matters, has previously opposed Bankman-Fried&#8217;s efforts to keep the identity of his bail co-signers confidential. The publication has requested a hearing if necessary.</p>



<p>The legal battle continues to intensify as the FTX founder faces a two-part trial in October and next March, encompassing charges of securities and wire fraud, as well as bank fraud and bribery allegations. Bankman-Fried maintains his plea of not guilty throughout the proceedings.</p>



<p>In a recent development, US prosecutors <a href="https://coincu.com/206349-bankman-fried-innocence-unlawful-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped</a> the charge of unlawful campaign contributions against Samuel Bankman-Fried. The charge was not included in the extradition agreement between the US and the Bahamas. However, SBF is still slated to face trial in October on 12 other charges, including allegations of running a years-long fraud at FTX.</p>
