<p>KuCoin has denied reports of mass layoffs after crypto journalist Colin Wu reported earlier today that the Seychelles-based crypto exchange was planning to let go of 30% of its workforce. The report comes a month after the exchange enforced mandatory know-your-customer (KYC) checks on its trading platform, which reportedly led to a decline in profits.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>NY AG’s Lawsuit Against KuCoin Led To Decline In Profits</strong></h2>



<p>Citing three anonymous internal sources, Colin Wu <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1683821842447106048" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that KuCoin is set to lay off 300 of its nearly 1000 employees. In March, New York Attorney General Letitia James sued the crypto exchange, accusing it of violating securities laws by offering securities to users on its platform. </p>



<p>This was followed by the enforcement of mandatory KYC checks which took effect on July 15. According to Colin Wu, the lawsuit paired with the strict KYC policy led to a decline in <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/22k-usdt-lost-kucoin-twitter-exploit/">KuCoin’s</a> profits. This reportedly prompted the crypto exchange’s plan to lay off 30% of its employees.</p>



<p>However, the exchange denied the reports of mass layoffs and stated that it intended to make routine adjustments to its workforce as part of normal performance appraisal. “KuCoin is actively embracing compliance and focusing on core business development,” the exchange said in a statement to the crypto journalist. </p>

<p>Data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kucoin#statistics" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinGecko</a> showed that the crypto exchange’s trading volume has declined by a whopping 73% following the lawsuit by the New York AG. As for this month, the trading volume declined by 54% since the KYC policy came into effect.</p>

<p>CEO Changpeng Zhao along with his group of companies including Binance plan to file a <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767.53.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767.53.0_1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">motion to dismiss</a> a lawsuit from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) submitted in March 2023. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, Gretchen Lowe who serves as chief counsel for the CFTC&#8217;s enforcement division, accused Binance and CZ of willful evasion of U.S. financial rules. Lowe stated in the commission&#8217;s lawsuit that Binance&#8217;s compliance efforts were a hoax and that the company consistently prioritized profits over adhering to the law.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The defendants’ own emails and chats reflect that Binance’s compliance efforts have been a sham and Binance deliberately chose — over and over — to place profits over following the law.</p></blockquote>



<p>Responding to the lawsuit shortly after, Changpeng Zhao refuted the CFTC&#8217;s allegations and called into question the completeness of so-called facts presented in the lawsuit.</p>



<p>In April, CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-official-settlement-binance-lawsuit/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-official-settlement-binance-lawsuit/" rel="noreferrer noopener">hinted</a> a settlement in the Binance lawsuit was not ruled out and remarked that a &#8220;path forward&#8221; could be possible. </p>



<p>The motion to dismiss is expected on Thursday in line with the July 27 deadline. However, CZ&#8217;s lawyer asked the court to permit a longer document as the standard limit for such filings is capped at 15 pages. Notably, the CFTC&#8217;s counsel did not oppose this relief. </p>



<h2>Binance vs CFTC, SEC</h2>



<p>CZ and his crypto empire face lawsuits on multiple fronts following accusations from both the CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleging rule-breaking. The crypto exchange and its CEO are also subjects of a Department of Justice probe focused on possible money laundering among other suspicions. </p>



<p>The company plans to lay off between 1000-3000 employees amid ongoing legal battles, per <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/binance-could-lay-off-thousands-in-response-to-doj-probe-source.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/binance-could-lay-off-thousands-in-response-to-doj-probe-source.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a>. </p>

<p>Major crypto exchange Binance said its Japanese division will begin full operation for local users by August this year, per a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-25/binance-to-start-full-services-on-new-japan-platform-in-august" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-25/binance-to-start-full-services-on-new-japan-platform-in-august" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. </p>



<p>The company headed by CEO and founder Changpeng &#8216;CZ&#8217; Zhao <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-returns-japan-sakura-exchange/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-returns-japan-sakura-exchange/" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired</a> Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC), a locally regulated digital asset platform, last year in November. </p>



<p>Sakura&#8217;s acquisition was sealed by an undisclosed sum and opened a route for Binance to re-enter the Japanese market through a platform regulated by the country&#8217;s Financial Services Agency (FSA).</p>



<p>The move also marked Binance&#8217;s first foothold in Japan since 2018 after CZ&#8217;s company was shown the door due to regulatory compliance issues. </p>



<p>Per today&#8217;s announcement, Binance Japan operating through SEBC would function as a fully compliant platform offering crypto and digital asset services to users in Japan. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the development is buoyed by rhetoric from Japan&#8217;s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida who has hinted at pathways for crypto operators to set up shop in the country and expanding the local digital currency ecosystem. </p>



<p>In recent months, policymakers have <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/japans-flexible-crypto-listing-regime/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/japans-flexible-crypto-listing-regime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revised</a> token listing procedures to accommodate more coins and mulled rules to allow crypto businesses comply with financial rules.</p>



<h2>Binance Expansion Across Jurisdictions</h2>



<p>While Binance plans to resurface in the Japanese market, the company has lost some ground in Europe and the U.S. amid regulatory crackdowns. </p>



<p>The crypto exchange heavyweight exited Cyprus and saw its derivatives license revoked by Australia&#8217;s securities watchdog (ASIC). Binance France also experienced a raid on its Paris office after suspicions of money laundering activities. </p>



<p>Several executives like CSO Patrick Hillmann left the company amid a lawsuit from the U.S. SEC, although departing leaders <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binances-cz-dispels-fud-around-exits/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binances-cz-dispels-fud-around-exits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insisted</a> that their exits had nothing to do with allegations against the crypto exchange or CEO Zhao. </p>

<p>A VIP hiring program launched by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ark-invest-sold-coinbase-share-53-million/">Coinbase</a> last week has attracted more than 250 applications from around the globe. The VIP Access program, which was announced by CEO Brian Armstrong last week, seeks to attract experienced crypto enthusiasts to work at the largest crypto exchange in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase’s VIP Access Attracts Veterans &amp; Crypto Influencers</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/careers/vip-access" rel="nofollow noopener">VIP Access</a> Program was launched on July 19 to attract crypto enthusiasts with extraordinary abilities. According to Coinbase, the program is aimed at hiring highly-talented individuals who are passionate about crypto and economic freedom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to Twitter earlier today to provide a glimpse into the applications received so far. The VIP Access program had attracted 283 applications, the majority of which came from North America. 39 applications came from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, 13 from India, and 10 from the Asia Pacific region. The remaining two applicants were from Latin America.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>DOGE became one of the top gainers today after Elon Musk rebranded Twitter as X.&nbsp;</li><li>The meme token gained as much as 10%, topping a two-month high of $0.077.&nbsp;</li><li>The demand for Dogecoin increased after Musk briefly displayed its dog-themed logo in his Twitter bio.&nbsp;</li><li>Traders also rushed to invest in multiple namesake tokens leading to triple-digit gains.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessed double-digit gains earlier today after <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/elon-musk-offensive-in-dogecoin-lawsuit/">Elon Musk</a> rebranded Twitter as X. Musk, who bought Twitter in October last year, has owned the domain name X.com since 2017 and previously revealed his plans to turn it into “the everything app”. The domain name now redirects users to Twitter and is part of the billionaire businessman’s broader plan to turn the social networking platform into what he envisions as “the most valuable financial institution in the world.”</p>



<h2><strong>Dogecoin Reaches Two-Month High Of $0.77</strong></h2>



<p>Elon Musk took to Twitter recently to <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683171310388535296" rel="nofollow noopener">announce</a> his social networking platform’s new identity. The rebranding included the X logo featured on Twitter’s homepage, replacing the iconic blue bird logo.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.&#8221; </p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213798386147329" rel="nofollow noopener">Linda Yaccarino, CEO of Twitter</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Shortly after the announcement, traders scrambled to buy up DOGE, anticipating some role for the meme token in Twitter’s overhaul. The memecoin gained as much as 10%, reaching a two-month high of $0.77. At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.75. The buying frenzy led to a 374% increase in the memecoin’s daily trading volume, which topped $1.38 billion. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy</a> now points to <a href="https://t.co/AYBszklpkE" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/AYBszklpkE</a>. <br><br>Interim X logo goes live later today.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683171310388535296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">July 23, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The rebranding to X also led to several namesake tokens witnessing triple-digit gains. Data from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/x/" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinMarketCap</a> shows that the price of one X token increased by a whopping 313%. Another token, X AI, which didn&#8217;t even exist till last week, gained more than 166%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Musk has been vocal in his support for Dogecoin, going as far as enabling DOGE payments on The Boring Company, an online store that previously sold flamethrowers, perfumes, and even Tequila. Several of his cryptic tweets with a subtle hint of the dog-themed memecoin have sent its price soaring in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the announcement of X, he even displayed Dogecoin’s logo in his Twitter bio briefly. In early April, members of the crypto community on Twitter reported that they could see the dog mascot of the meme coin instead of Twitter’s logo on their homepage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The project co-founded by OpenAI CEO <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethmatlins/2023/06/22/sam-altman-is-the-unofficial-1-on-forbes-2023-worlds-most-influential-cmos-list/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethmatlins/2023/06/22/sam-altman-is-the-unofficial-1-on-forbes-2023-worlds-most-influential-cmos-list/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Altman</a> sparked debates across the crypto ecosystem with proponents raising concerns over centralization and privacy. </p>



<p>Worldcoin styles itself as a &#8220;privacy-preserving digital identity&#8221; protocol built on the Ethereum L2  solution Optimism that allows users to claim a WorldID through Orb biometric verification and a digital currency (WLD), where local regulations permit. </p>

<h2>Ethereum Founder Buterin Chimes In On Worldcoin Conversation</h2>



<p>Indeed, WLDs launch raised eyebrows mainly regarding the project&#8217;s biometric verification and possible data leaks that could emerge. The project utilizes a device called Orb &#8211; a device that scans a participant&#8217;s Iris and validates their identity on the company&#8217;s database. Notably, the product is unavailable to U.S. users. </p>



<p>Tools for Humanity&#8217;s chief communications officer Rebecca Hahn said the German-made Orbs will debut in 35 cities over the coming months. Currently, there are 200 Orbs although that number is expected to reach 1,500 by year&#8217;s end, head of product and design Tiago Sada noted. </p>



<p>Amid concerns that privacy leaks and Worldcoin&#8217;s centralization could put users at risk, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.htmlhttps://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.htmlhttps://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opined</a> that the technology is needed and will likely take time to effectively build at scale. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The concept of proof-of-personhood in principle seems very valuable, and while the various implementations have their risks, not having any proof-of-personhood at all has its risks too: a world with no proof-of-personhood seems more likely to be a world dominated by centralized identity solutions, money, small closed communities, or some combination of all three.</p></blockquote>

<ul><li>The United States SEC has signaled that it will appeal the recent ruling in the lawsuit against Ripple.</li><li>The securities regulator’s latest comments were part of a filing in the lawsuit against Do Kwon and Terraform Labs.&nbsp;</li><li>Do Kwon recently cited the Ripple ruling to support his motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against him.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has signaled that it may appeal the landmark ruling in its lawsuit against Ripple, which handed the crypto firm a major victory and set a precedent surrounding the security status of cryptocurrencies. The securities regulator’s intent to appeal came to light in its latest filing in a separate lawsuit against Do Kwon and his defunct Terraform Labs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>SEC: Ripple Ruling Adds Baseless Requirements To Howey Test</strong></h2>



<p>The summary judgment motion by Federal Judge Analisa Torres last week identified XRP’s institutional sales as securities offerings. However, the judge ruled that retail or programmatic sales of XRP did not constitute an investment contract. This ruling was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-do-kwon-ripple-ruling-dismiss-sec/">cited</a> by  lawyers representing Terraform Labs’ disgraced founder Do Kwon in the motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against him and his firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-21/sec-signals-appeal-to-crypto-ripple-ruling-in-terra-response#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the SEC urged the judge overseeing its lawsuit against Kwon and Terraform Labs to not consider the Ripple ruling as a legal precedent. The securities regulator argued that Judge Torres’ stance on XRP’s programmatic sales created “an artificial distinction between the expectations of sophisticated institutional and retail investors. The regulator added that the Ripple ruling added “baseless requirements” to the decades-old Howey Test, which is used to determine if an asset qualifies as a security.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Institutional buyers in this case, such as trading firms that purchased Defendants’ crypto assets with no restrictions on resale, purchased because they viewed the assets as an investment opportunity into Terraform’s efforts.” </p><cite>SEC’s filing in the lawsuit against Do Kwon</cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC asked the judge hearing Do Kwon’s case to reject the components of the Ripple ruling about XRP’s non-security status for retail sales and added that it was considering appealing the controversial ruling by Judge Torres. Interestingly, the securities regulator encouraged the Terraform judge to consider Judge Torres’ stance on institutional sales of XRP, which were deemed securities.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Binance France reported a loss of €4 million in the financial statements for 2022.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange’s French arm currently holds €1bn in crypto assets on behalf of its clients.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange started recording expenses eight months before revenue, which led to the multi-million euro loss.&nbsp;</li><li>Binance France expects to be profitable by the end of this year.</li></ul>



<p>Binance France has reported a loss of €4 million for the year 2022. The French arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange recently, which was established in November 2021, released the audited financial reports for last year. The crypto exchange’s financial statements were audited by Paris-based accounting and audit firm RSM France.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance France Holds €1 Billion On Behalf Of Clients</strong></h2>



<p>According to the audited <a href="https://www.binance.com/fr/blog/ecosystem/binance-france-publishes-2022-accounts--what-do-they-say-and-faq-7753651850896626460" rel="nofollow noopener">financial reports</a> released by Binance France earlier today, the exchange held €1 billion worth of crypto assets on behalf of its users residing in the country. Apart from that, the exchange also holds 7 million USDT in its own account. The majority of the French crypto exchange’s income came from trading fees charged from users on the platform. </p>



<p>The crypto exchange stated in its report that the reason for the €4 million loss was a mismatch in the dates that they started recording expenses and revenues. The accounts reportedly covered 14 months of expenses but only six months of revenue. The delay in receiving revenue was attributed to the lack of regulatory approval from France’s top market regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers’ (AMF).&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cut-employee-benefits-low-profits/">Binance</a> France started operating as a crypto exchange only after registering as a virtual asset service provider (VASP) with the AMF in May last year, followed by another two months of formalities to onboard the French users. However, the exchange had started incurring expenses as early as November 2021, which led to 14 months of expenses being recorded in the financial statements. </p>



<p>If not for the mismatch, Binance stated that its French unit would be profitable in 2022. The exchange clarified that the international platform was profitable and that the French unit would also turn profitable in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Elliptic&#8217;s report identified payments to Russian crypto exchange Garantex and an unnamed Australian platform for fentanyl products worth billions in street value.</li><li>The report estimates that these platforms received roughly $50 million in Bitcoin and Tether&#8217;s stablecoin USDT.</li><li>At least 100 Merchants accept crypto payments for fentanyl ingredients as a means to evade sanctions and export restrictions.</li></ul>



<p>Fentanyl precursor merchants in China are utilizing centralized crypto exchanges in Russia and Australia to accept digital payments in a bid to evade sanctions, a report from blockchain analytics shop <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.elliptic.co/hubfs/Elliptic_Report_Crypto%20and%20the%20Global%20Fentanyl%20Trade.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.elliptic.co/hubfs/Elliptic_Report_Crypto%20and%20the%20Global%20Fentanyl%20Trade.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Elliptic</a> said. </p>



<p>The study identified two crypto exchanges &#8211; U.S.-sanctioned Russian platform Garantex and an unnamed Australian exchange &#8211; that have served as payment gateways for merchants in China offering precursor chemicals and pill presses required to produce Fentanyl.</p>



<p>Elliptic&#8217;s study on crypto&#8217;s use in the fentanyl supply chain comes at a time when the deadly synthetic opioid is causing massive public health issues in the United States, Europe, and the world at large.</p>



<p>Despite China&#8217;s fentanyl export restrictions, the study revealed that savvy operators have found ways to smuggle precursor chemicals overseas. Tactics include using disguised packaging, such as dog food or car wash detergent, and leveraging established carriers who may not frequently verify package contents.</p>



<h2>Crypto Exchanges Funnel $50 Billion In Street-Valued Fentanyl Ingredients</h2>



<p>According to the report, transactions to Bitcoin addresses, and USDT addresses on Tron and Ethereum blockchains were identified. In total, these addresses received $32 million in crypto for fentanyl precursor chemicals. </p>



<p>Elliptic estimates that if all these funds were used to buy fentanyl products, the goods could produce as much as $50 billion in drug proceeds factoring in street value. </p>



<p>The report was released amid a global crackdown on questionable crypto exchanges suspected to be money laundering intermediaries. In January, U.S. authorities <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2023/01/18/justice-department-shuts-down-700-million-russian-crypto-exchange/?sh=72806ed427c7" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2023/01/18/justice-department-shuts-down-700-million-russian-crypto-exchange/?sh=72806ed427c7" rel="noreferrer noopener">sanctioned</a> and shut down an almost unknown Russian exchange called Bizlato on money laundering suspicions. Investigators also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-bitcoin-transactions-bitzlato/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-bitcoin-transactions-bitzlato/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">linked</a> Bizlato to major exchange Binance.</p>

<ul><li>FTX lawyers said that founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives used customer cash to fund personal their lifestyles.</li><li>Bankman-Fried and members of his inner circle like Caroline Elisson, and Nishad Singh spent $1 billion funding stock buys, property purchases, and fraudulent loans.</li><li>SBF is facing criminal charges from the DOJ while Ellison and Singh agreed to plea deals in America’s largest fraud case.</li></ul>



<p>FTX Trading Ltd filed a lawsuit against founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other company executives, seeking to recover $1 billion of customer cash misused for personal benefits, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-sues-bankman-fried-others-recoup-fraudulent-transfers-2023-07-20/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-sues-bankman-fried-others-recoup-fraudulent-transfers-2023-07-20/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> reported.</p>



<p>Lawyers submitted court documents on July 20 claiming that the defendants stole customer assets to fund political donations, loans to executives, and luxury apartments. The suit named former CEO Bankman-Fried, ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, co-founder Gary Wang and former Lead Engineer Nishad Singh as defendants.</p>



<p>According to lawyers of the bankrupt crypto exchange, Singh received $447 million in a supposed loan from FTX and Alameda but there was no intention to repay.</p>



<p>The defendants received at least $725 million in equity for shares that were never paid for, per the filing. Lawyers also alleged that Bankman-Fried’s brother Gabriel planned to acquire the island nation of Nauru.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the beleaguered exchange sent tens of millions for real estate purchases and legal fees to SBF’s dad, Allen Joe Bankman. Separate lawsuits seek to recover $71.5 million and $700 million respectively spent by SBF for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-71-million-recovery-sbfs-sham-ngo/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-71-million-recovery-sbfs-sham-ngo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal aggrandizement</a> prior to FTX&#8217;s collapse in November 2022.</p>



<h2>FTX Debacle Continues</h2>



<p>In other related news, the U.S. Department of Justice asked a court to ban &#8220;extrajudicial statements&#8221; made by defendants and witnesses after FTX founder Bankman-Fried reportedly leaked Caroline Ellison&#8217;s private diary to the press. </p>



<p>Ellison who led SBF&#8217;s hedge fund and FTX sister firm Alameda Research agreed to a plea deal with federal prosecutors. Singh was also in talks with DOJ attorneys over a possible deal. </p>



<p>While bankruptcy administrators track down stolen customer cash and prosecutors levy charges against former company leadership for wrongdoing, crypto observers remain puzzled about the whereabouts of known FTX executive Sam Trabucco and his noticeable omission from court proceedings. </p>
