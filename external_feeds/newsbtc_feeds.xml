					<description><![CDATA[Arbitrum (ARB)&#8217;s gains have been tempered by various challenges, hindering its further upswing. The declining inflows of stablecoins on the Arbitrum network have raised concerns among investors and enthusiasts alike, as it signals potential obstacles for the growth and development of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.  As a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Arbitrum initially garnered significant attention and saw impressive gains, but recent hurdles have dampened the optimism surrounding its future prospects.  While the decline in stablecoin inflows is a cause for worry, there are potential avenues for growth that could help revive Arbitrum&#8217;s momentum.  Source: Coingecko Resilient Growth Amidst Volatility: ARB Performance Despite facing market volatility, both the Arbitrum protocol and its native token, ARB, have demonstrated remarkable growth. CoinGecko reports ARB&#8217;s current price at $1.14, showcasing a 0.9% rally over the past 24 hours and an encouraging seven-day gain of 3.3%.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin and crypto market eagerly observed the expiry of the quarterly BTC and ETH options today (at 8:00 am UTC / 4:00 am EST). It was the second largest in history with a volume of 159,000 BTC options and 1.25 million ETH options with a total value of almost $7 billion. The market was expecting a sharp increase in volatility, but it failed to materialize. In the run-up, the BTC price briefly spiked as high as $31,300 before seeing a pullback towards $30,700. The event has thus pretty much become a nothing burger. Options analysts at Greeks.Live confirmed a few minutes ago that the quarterly expiration has been completed, with more BTC block calls being traded in the last few days, mainly to close and roll positions at the end of the quarter, with ETH being mainly in the order book, adding: With the quarterly expiry, the market has seen a release of positions that have built up in recent months, and options could see a larger shift if the market supports it in July. Although volatility levels have risen this month and market makers are happy to actively buy positions, the downward trend in major term IV is very much in evidence amidst the strong selling pressure from quarterly delivery. What&#8217;s Next For Bitcoin? Today&#8217;s daily close could become extremely important for the Bitcoin price. Today is month-end, quarter-end and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s preferred inflation gauge, will be released at 8:30 am EST (12:30 pm CET). On Tuesday, the U.S. market is closed for the Fourth of July, Independence Day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Key Indicators Suggest A Strengthening Case For Rally To $32K The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index is preferred by the Fed because it provides broader coverage of consumer spending, includes chain weighting to accurately track behavioral changes, accounts for the substitution effect, and uses comprehensive data sources. The PCE is therefore considered a more flexible and representative indicator of inflation compared to other indexes such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). While headline CPI data have looked extremely good in recent months, core inflation has been shown to be very sticky. A lot of focus today will therefore be on core PCE. The expectation for PCE inflation is 3.9% and for core PCE 4.7% year-over-year. A surprise to the downside has the potential to provide a bullish boost to both the traditional financial market as well as the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Related Reading: Dawn For Bitcoin: $5 Billion In Options Expire And Could Push Price Towards $31,000 As renowned analyst @rektcapital writes via Twitter, BTC is positioning itself for a monthly close above a resistance that had rejected the price for the past three months. Currently, BTC is holding above the same level (black). Thus, the monthly as well as the quarterly close could be an extremely bullish harbinger for July. Is The Best Time To Buy Next Monday? Analyst @tedtalksmacro recently published an analysis about Bitcoin&#8217;s historical performance via Twitter. The result may suggest that the upcoming Monday, July 3, is the best option for a Bitcoin buy, at least historically. As the analyst noted, July has been the best performing month since October 2009. However, the data is skewed due to a 10x in July 2010. Taking only the last five years of data, the best performing month is October, closely followed by July. On a weekly basis, Mondays are the best day to buy and hold BTC. This assumes that buyers do not hold BTC on any day other than the nominated one, as the analyst evaluated. At press time, the Bitcoin price hovered below the $31,000 resistance zone, trading at $30,856. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has gone through the roof in recent days. Within the last ten days, the Bitcoin fork has risen by a staggering 168%, temporarily BCH was already up over 200% today. While Bitcoin Cash was still trading at $104 on June 20 and was stuck in a deep bull market that looked bad even compared to other altcoins, a miracle occurred 10 days ago. The price exploded out of nowhere. Why Is Bitcoin Cash Experiencing A Revival? As NewsBTC reported, the reasons for the phenomenal rise in BCH&#8217;s price have already been discussed hotly over the past few days. It was often heard that the listing on the new crypto exchange EDX Markets, which is backed by industry giants Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Digital Assets, favored BCH. Furthermore, it has been argued that the price increase is also due to Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s recent &#8220;game-changing&#8221; upgrade. In mid-May, Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork that not only improved the network&#8217;s security and privacy measures, but also introduced plans for CashTokens. However, the real reasons for the current Bitcoin Cash pump seem to lie elsewhere: namely in South Korea. Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu reports today that South Korea could be the reason for the BCH pump, looking at where much of the trading volume originates. Related Reading: Kaching! Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Explodes Over 100% – What’s Powering It? In the last 24 hours, the largest exchange in South Korea, Upbit, recorded over $350 million in trading volume for BCH/KRW, accounting for 23.58% of the total trading volume for BCH. Moreover, it is also three times the trading volume of BTC/KRW on Upbit &#8211; an anomaly that has extreme rarity. Renowned crypto whale and trader Andrew Kang agrees, stating that the current BCH rally reminds him of the multi-week Aptos (APT) battle between Korean retailers and &#8220;professional traders.&#8221; Never Skip A Korea Pump? &#8220;Koreans didn&#8217;t need a reason to bid, all that mattered is that it kept going up and early bears got slaughtered,&#8221; Kang said. The trader is alluding to APT&#8217;s 500% rally earlier this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Surges 20% In One Day As Market Rebounds, What’s Next? South Koreans pumped Aptos because of a joke about housing affordability. APT&#8217;s trading volume on the South Korean crypto exchange UpBit was often higher than the total trading volume on Binance at the time. It was also beneficial that the Aptos Foundation marketed the altcoin to Koreans from day one. According to Alex Shin, co-founder of crypto venture capital firm Hashed, South Korean crypto investors took Aptos&#8217; three-letter ticker &#8220;APT&#8221; and turned it into a meme alluding to how absurdly expensive it is to buy an &#8220;apartment&#8221; in South Korea. Asia expert Wu said at the time that &#8220;pumping altcoins is a tradition in the Korean community.&#8221; Kang concluded: &#8220;People are shorting more BCH than there is liquid supply of it. It’s highly illiquid since most of the supply is dead. Imagine fading the original cartel&#8221; and added &#8220;disbelief pump.&#8221; At press time, BCH changed hands for $300 per coin.

					<description><![CDATA[The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Ethereum and Bitcoin, slowed down on their rally. Following a surge above critical resistance, the cryptocurrencies could retrace and return to critical support levels. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? As of this writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $1,840 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, ETH has recorded a 2% loss except for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), the crypto top 10 by market cap trades in the red. Trouble Ahead For Ethereum? Earlier today, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced the launch of a new product. The platform will roll out an Ethereum (ETH/USD) to Bitcoin (BTC/USD) ratio futures contract. The financial product will follow the price of these cryptocurrencies and their correlation. In that way, traders can gain exposure to both cryptocurrencies by holding a single futures contract. According to an official announcement, The product aims to create more opportunities for traders in the nascent industry. However, in the short term, the CME launch hints at a potential downside for the two largest assets in the crypto market. CME Product Could Trigger This Effect In the past, whenever the CME rolled out a Bitcoin or Ethereum-based contract, the price of either asset trended to the downside. A pseudonym analyst forecasted issues for ETH and BTC, probably driven by a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect. Via Twitter, the analyst stated, reacting to the news: If this has an effect similar to the $BTC &#38; $ETH futures back in the day then the release of this instrument could form a pivot for the ETH/BTC pair. Maybe more down into the release and then a reversal around the end of July? Let&#8217;s see. In response to the forecast, another analyst stated that a “buy the rumor, sell the news effect” will cause ETH’s price to rally into the event. Therefore, ETH could profit as the CME prepares to roll out their new contracts and anticipation around the spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) applications continues. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Battle Against Miners’ $128 Million Move: Is The Bull Run In Danger? The analyst stated: Wouldn&#8217;t make more sense a buy the rumor, sell the news event? So we pump before end of July Everything is exhausted right now. If BTC pumps through resistance, maybe ETH could catch up. Cover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

<h2>Trouble Ahead For Ethereum?</h2>
<p>Earlier today, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19384891-cme-group-to-launch-ether-bitcoin-ratio-futures-on-july-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> the launch of a new product. The platform will roll out an Ethereum (ETH/USD) to Bitcoin (BTC/USD) ratio futures contract.</p>
<p>The financial product will follow the price of these cryptocurrencies and their correlation. In that way, traders can gain exposure to both cryptocurrencies by holding a single futures contract.</p>
<p>According to an official announcement, The product aims to create more opportunities for traders in the nascent industry. However, in the short term, the CME launch hints at a potential downside for the two largest assets in the crypto market.</p>
CME Product Could Trigger This Effect
<p>In the past, whenever the CME rolled out a Bitcoin or Ethereum-based contract, the price of either asset trended to the downside. A pseudonym analyst forecasted issues for ETH and BTC, probably driven by a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect.</p>
<p>Via Twitter, the analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/DaanCrypto/status/1674463455720484884" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a>, reacting to the news:</p>
<blockquote><p>If this has an effect similar to the $BTC &amp; $ETH futures back in the day then the release of this instrument could form a pivot for the ETH/BTC pair. Maybe more down into the release and then a reversal around the end of July? Let&#8217;s see.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to the forecast, another analyst stated that a “buy the rumor, sell the news effect” will cause ETH’s price to rally into the event. Therefore, ETH could profit as the CME prepares to roll out their new contracts and anticipation around the spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) applications continues.</p>

<p>The analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/silver_bits/status/1674464475397738496" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wouldn&#8217;t make more sense a buy the rumor, sell the news event? So we pump before end of July Everything is exhausted right now. If BTC pumps through resistance, maybe ETH could catch up.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin (LTC) has been one of the most bullish coins for the year 2023 with anticipation around its forthcoming halving event. This has propelled the digital asset toward price increases higher than the market average. And now, once again, the bull case for the digital asset is even stronger as its hashrate has risen rapidly to a new peak. Litecoin Hashrate Touches New All-Time High As the halving event draws closer, more attention is being paid to the Litecoin network. This has led to an increase in the hashrate of the network as more miners are joining the network. Most of the month of June has seen large spikes in hashrate following the rise in the mining difficulty. Related Reading: The Blessing Of July: Can Bitcoin Climb To $36,000 In The Coming Month? The rise in mining difficulty means that it is harder to find a block and as such, miners have to bring more machines online to increase their chances, leading to a spike in the hashrate. And as more miners are brought online, the Litecoin hashrate has touched its highest level yet. According to data from CoinWarz, the Litecoin hashrate reached 958.36 terahashes per second (TH/s), on Wednesday, June 28, 2023. This is a new all-time high for the network whose previous all-time high had data just above 800 TH/s. Litecoin hashrate reaches new all-time high &#124; Source: CoinWarz The hashrate has seen a decline and is now sitting at 735.71 TH/s for the global hashrate. However, the spike points toward a more positive development for its network and its native token LTC. LTC Could Surge Upon Halving Event The Litecoin halving which will cut block rewards down from 12.5 LTC per mined block to 6.25 LTC per mined block is now less than two months away. As halving events have been known to impose a level of scarcity on a digital asset, a surge in the price of LTC is expected as the event draws closer. LTC price sitting above $85 support &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com This scarcity would see supply reduce and if demand continues to rise, then LTC is poised to break $100 by the time the halving is done. If this happens, it could also trigger a reasonable rally in the crypto market as positive sentiment and profits from LTC spills over into the rest of the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Suggests BTC Rally Is Far From Over Litecoin’s rise in hashrate already shows that miners are preparing for the halving, indicating renewed fate in the digital asset. As the next few weeks leading up to the event roll by, investors can expect LTC to trade in the green despite market bearishness. At the time of writing, LTC is trading at a price of $85.40 per coin, down 3.08% in the past week. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Still recording some green on small timeframes, the price of Bitcoin has remained above $30,400. Despite the recent selling pressure across the sector, the support around this level held, providing bulls a chance to fight back. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Battle Against Miners’ $128 Million Move: Is The Bull Run In Danger? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $30,458 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. The previous week, the number one crypto by market cap recorded similar price action while other cryptocurrencies experienced losses. Bitcoin About To Explode? Data from crypto options platform Deribit, shared by analyst Tom Dunleavy, shows that over $7 billion in these contracts will expire today, Friday 29th. In other words, today, option holders can exercise their right or obligation to buy/sell BTC and other assets at a specific price, depending on their contract. Over $5 billion of the options contracts are based on Bitcoin, while the rest are based on Ethereum, as seen in the chart below. However, option holders could choose to “roll over” their contracts to a later date. As a result, according to Dunleavy, spot prices could see a spike in buying pressure as major option players hedge their positions. This increased buying pressure could see BTC soaring above the $31,000 mark. Via Twitter, the analyst stated: Big options expiration date for both ETH and BTC tomorrow ETH: ~$2B notional BTC: ~$5B notional If these are rolled into more calls we should see spot buying from dealers to hedge their books; puts opposite story. Either way expect some vol (volatility). As Dunleavy claims, the crypto market is poised for volatility, whichever direction. The chart above shows the Max Pain price for BTC options, which is $26,500. Max Pain is the price Bitcoin must trade to deny most options traders from booking profits. In that sense, the BTC price will likely turn to the downside with a spike in volatility. Beyond $31,000, What’s Next For BTC? Analysis and crypto education firm Blofin recently posted a report on BTC&#8217;s short- and long-term risks and scenarios. The firm claims the recent rally was driven by a “hunger for positive news” and a “rebalancing” of internal liquidity. In other words, crypto investors got bullish and took money from altcoins into BTC. However, there is still a liquidity issue within the sector that could limit any rally, but there is a silver lining in this scenario. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? Blofin stated: The decline in the price of BTC will be more limited, with a relatively small probability of falling below $28k, while the upward space is relatively large, and there is even hope for a rebound to $35k and above.
