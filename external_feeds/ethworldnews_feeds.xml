<ul><li>The judge overseeing the bankruptcy case of FTX has ruled that the identity of the creditors should remain undisclosed.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankruptcy estate persuaded the judge to not disclose creditors’ identities in the interest of their security.&nbsp;</li><li>The firm in charge of selling the exchange’s assets told the court that revealing identities would hurt the sales process.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The judge overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings of <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judge-extends-genesis-mediation-period/">FTX </a>has ruled that the identity of the defunct crypto exchange’s customers will remain undisclosed. The ruling addressed the repeated demands by leading media houses, including Bloomberg and the Financial Times to get the names of the exchange’s customers out to the public, arguing that they had a legitimate and compelling interest in knowing the names of those affected by the exchange’s collapse. </p>



<h2><strong>Revealing FTX Customers&#8217; Names May Hurt Asset Sales Process</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-customer-names-will-not-be-revealed-by-bankruptcy-court-2023-06-09/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, U.S Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey has granted FTX’s request to permanently redact the names of individual customers from its bankruptcy filings. During the hearing, lawyers representing the exchange argued that publishing the names of customers would jeopardize them by exposing them to potential identity theft, among other risks. The latest ruling came six months after the bankruptcy judge initially allowed FTX to keep the names of its 9 million customers hidden. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;It is the customers who are the most important issue in this case. We want to make sure that they are protected and they don&#8217;t fall victim to any types of scams.&#8221; </p><cite>U.S Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey</cite></blockquote>



<p>Judge Dorsey also allowed FTX to hide the names of companies and institutional investors temporarily. However, the exchange would have to make a new request after 90 days in order to keep those names undisclosed. Perella Weinberg Partners, the investment bank hired to sell the bankrupt crypto exchange’s remaining assets, told the judge that disclosing customers’ names would hurt the sales process. “My belief is that disclosure of the names, regardless of who disclosed them, would degrade value,” said Kevin Cofsky, a partner at Perella Weinberg.</p>

<ul><li>The CFTC has won a lawsuit against OokiDAO through a default judgment in its favor.</li><li>The regulator’s victory sets a critical precedent for DeFi that DAOs could be held liable for violations as a person.&nbsp;</li><li>OokiDAO has been ordered to pay a penalty of $643,542 and cease all operations.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a major blow to the decentralized finance space, OokiDAO has lost the lawsuit filed against it by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-official-settlement-binance-lawsuit/">CFTC</a>). A federal judge handed the victory to the CFTC by entering a default judgment against the decentralized autonomous organization after it failed to respond to the commodities regulator’s enforcement action. </p>



<h2><strong>OokiDAO’s Loss Set A Critical Precedent For Lawsuits Against DAOs</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8715-23" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by the CFTC earlier today, the Commission’s victory in the lawsuit set a critical precedent for decentralized autonomous organizations that attempt to evade liability and regulatory scrutiny for their actions. The ruling by U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick paved the way for DAOs to be held liable for legal violations as a &#8220;person&#8221; under the Commodity Exchange Act. The judgment will likely be cited in future lawsuits against decentralized entities. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This decision should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who believes they can circumvent the law by adopting a DAO structure, intending to insulate themselves from law enforcement and ultimately putting the public at risk.” </p><cite>Ian McGinley, Director of CFTC’s Division of Enforcement</cite></blockquote>



<p>Judge Orrick has ordered OokiDAO to pay a monetary penalty of $643,542 and immediately suspend all operations and shut down its website. The DeFi exchange has also been banned from conducting business with any CFTC-registered entity. The CFTC sued OokiDAO in September last year for operating an illegal trading platform and unlawfully acting as a futures commission merchant. The regulator’s complaint accused the DeFi exchange of offering leveraged and margined commodities transactions without ensuring compliance with KYC rules.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Russian nationals for hacking Mt Gox and laundering the stolen crypto.&nbsp;</li><li>The two Russians have been accused of stealing some 647,000 BTC between 2011 and 2014.&nbsp;</li><li>The Russians are facing two charges, conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money service business.&nbsp;</li><li>If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to a combined penalty of 45 years in prison.</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, along with the Southern District of New York and the Northern District of California, has filed charges against two Russian nationals in connection with the hacking of Mt Gox and the subsequent theft of BTC from the exchange. Charges against Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner were unsealed earlier today. </p>



<h2><strong>Mt Gox Hackers Face Over 25 Years In Prison</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/russian-nationals-charged-hacking-one-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-illicitly-operating" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the case against the two Russian nationals has been divided into two, namely, the SDNY case and the NDCA case. As per the allegations in the indictment unsealed in the Southern District of New York, the two Russians and their accomplices gained unauthorized access to Mt Gox’s servers in 2011. This was followed by fraudulent transactions where BTC was transferred to wallets controlled by Verner and Bilyuchenko. </p>



<p>The illegal transfers took place between September 2011 and May 2014, during which the Russians along with their accomplices, transferred at least 647,000 BTC out of Mt Gox. As per today’s rates, the stolen BTC would be valued at $17 billion. The Russians managed to launder more than 300,000 BTC through a New York-based <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-nfts-added-to-binance-marketplace/">Bitcoin</a> Broker. As per the allegations in the indictment unsealed in the Northern District of California, Bilyuchenko worked with Alexander Vinnik and other accomplices to run an illegal Bitcoin exchange between 2011 and 2017. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>These indictments highlight the department’s unwavering commitment to bring to justice bad actors in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and prevent the abuse of the financial system.” </p><cite>Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In the SDNY case, both Russian nationals have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The NDCA charged Bilyuchenko with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money services business, which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.</p>

<p>Robinhood Markets Inc. has decided to delist three crypto tokens from its online trading platform in light of recent developments in the crypto market. The tokens, Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL), were named in the lawsuits filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gary-gensler-crypto-firms-flouting-rules/">SEC</a>) against Binance and Coinbase earlier this week. All three tokens were described as securities in the complaints. </p>



<h2><strong>Robinhood Will Delist The Tokens on June 27</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/cardano-polygon-solana-update/?irclickid=Xm0VJJ0DHxyPTb52F0Qo3RxnUkF0tBVsZ2m52g0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_campaign=10078&amp;utm_content=Skimbit%20Ltd.&amp;utm_term=1375188" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Robinhood, the decision to end support for ADA, MATIC, and SOL was taken after conducting a review of the platform’s crypto offerings. The tokens will be removed from the online trading platform on June 27, 2023, at 6:59 PM ET. The discount brokerage assured its customers that the extent of the delisting was limited to just those three tokens. </p>



<p>In the meantime, the platform’s customers will be allowed to buy, sell and hold ADA, MATIC, and SOL. Following the June 27 deadline, all ADA, MATIC, and SOL will be sold at market value. The proceeds will be transferred to the customers’ wallets. Earlier this week, Robinhood’s Chief Legal Compliance testified before the U.S. House Committee for Agriculture where he revealed that when the firm attempted to register itself with the SEC as a special purpose broker-dealer, they were met with unhelpful conduct. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The legislative branch needs to lead by passing commonsense, consumer-oriented legislation to restore clarity and integrity to the US crypto markets.” </p><cite>Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano </cite></blockquote>



<p>Commenting on Robinhood’s decision to delist ADA, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson told Fox Business that the blame goes to the country’s regulators for creating an environment of fear where there is a lack of clarity and contradictory guidance instead of collaboration with rule makers. According to Hoskinson, entities will leave markets if regulators continue their hostile stance towards crypto.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Binance US is suspending USD deposits on its trading platform effective immediately. The crypto exchange has revealed that its banking partners are preparing to pause fiat (USD) withdrawal channels as early as June 13, 2023. The American arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange blamed the deposit and withdrawal suspension on the enforcement action initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance US Blames SEC’s Extremely Aggressive and Intimidating Tactics</strong></h2>



<p>Binance US took to <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceUS/status/1666996908651323393" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> a little while ago to inform its customers about the latest developments regarding its online trading platform. The exchange accused the SEC of using extremely aggressive and intimidating tactics in pursuit of its “ideological campaign against the American digital asset industry.”. According to the crypto giant’s American arm, the legal troubles and complications stemming from the securities regulator’s actions have led to challenges with the banks that the exchange works with. </p>



<p>The crypto exchange stated that in the interest of consumer protection, it will suspend USD deposits today and transition to a “crypto-only” exchange. All customers are being encouraged to withdraw their fiat assets from the American exchange before June 13, 2023. The exchange warned that due to elevated volumes and weekend bank closures, the withdrawal process may take longer than usual. </p>

<p>Leading crypto custodian BitGo has reached a preliminary agreement to acquire rival firm Prime Trust.

The funding round saw participation from Kraken Ventures, Fin Capital, FIS, and Mercato Partners.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>BitGo’s Deal To Acquire Prime Trust Subject To Regulatory Approval </strong></h2>

The crypto <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-sings-licensing-deal-bitpanda/">custody</a> firm signed a term sheet to acquire Prime Trust’s parent firm,<em> </em>Prime Core Technologies Inc. This acquisition made BitGo the first global digital asset company to provide a full suite of solutions for institutions and fintech platforms. The deal is subject to regulatory approval. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>No other company will have the breadth of product and services nor depth of experience that this combined company would have. We are excited to offer our world-class infrastructure within a broader ecosystem and revolutionize the future of crypto.” </p><cite>Jor Law, Prime Trust’s Interim CEO, and President</cite></blockquote>



<p>BitGo, which is backed by the likes of Goldman Sachs, Digital Currency Group, DRW, and Galaxy Digital Ventures, processes approximately 20% of all global Bitcoin transactions by value and caters to over 1500 institutional clients around the world. As per the acquisition deal, Prime Trust’s Nevada Trust Company will join BitGo’s existing global network of regulated trust companies in multiple jurisdictions, including Germany and Switzerland.

<ul><li>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has alleged that crypto firms made a calculated decision to evade rules.&nbsp;</li><li>Gensler also denied the allegations of crushing the crypto industry through enforcement actions.&nbsp;</li><li>The SEC Chair reiterated his long-standing view that the majority of crypto tokens qualify as a security.&nbsp;</li><li>Rebutting industry claims, Gensler laid out the path for crypto firms to register with the regulator.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Gary Gensler, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has responded to the crypto industry’s backlash in light of recent enforcement actions initiated by his agency. Gensler defended the actions of the SEC and blamed crypto firms in the country for “flouting” rules. The SEC Chair also responded to the industry’s claims of having no way to register with the securities regulator.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gary Gensler Denies Allegations of Crushing the Crypto Industry</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-sec-chair-says-crypto-companies-made-calculated-decision-flout-rules-2023-06-08/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, Gary Gensler has accused the crypto firms of making a “calculated economic decision” to flout the rules set by his agency. The SEC chair alleged that crypto firms decided to take the risk of enforcement as the cost of conducting business in the United States. Gensler believes that crypto entities that got hit with enforcement actions had legal trouble coming. He indicated that firms that don’t comply with the rules will attract enforcement action. </p>



<p>SEC Chair Gensler’s comments came during the Piper Sandler Global Exchange and Fintech Conference earlier today. During his speech, he pushed back against the crypto industry’s allegations of him using the agency to crush them. He also stated that contrary to the industry’s repeated demands, there was no need for legislation from Congress for regulating the crypto space.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We’ve issued a reopening release that reiterated the applicability of existing rules to platforms that trade crypto assets securities, including so-called DeFi systems, that’s already the law. That’s already the rule. Not liking the law, not liking the rules is different than not hearing it or not getting it.”  </p><cite>Gary Gensler, Chairman of the SEC</cite></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gary-gensler-us-no-more-digital-currency/">Gary Gensler</a> reiterated his long-standing controversial stance on crypto securities and stated that the majority of the crypto tokens out there qualified as security. For those who claimed that there was no way to comply with the SEC’s rules, Gensler detailed how crypto firms could register themselves with the regulator and highlighted potential exemptions that may be granted to operators who meet certain criteria. </p>

<p>Coinbase’s Chief Executive Brian Armstrong sold thousands of shares earlier this week. The crypto community on Twitter questioned the CEO’s decision to dump his company’s shares in light of the enforcement action initiated against it by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The questionable stock sale took place just two days before the securities regulator sued the crypto exchange, leading to a double-digit fall in the share price.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase CEO’s Alleged Stock Dump Part of Pre-Planned Stock Sale?</strong></h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000195824423000844/0001958244-23-000844-index.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">Form 4</a> filed with the SEC by Brian Armstrong, the Coinbase CEO sold a whopping 29,730 shares on June 5, 2023. The sale took place in 8 separate transactions, all on the same date. Armstrong sold his company’s Class A Common Stock at an average price of $60.3 per share, netting more than $1.7 million. The SEC’s lawsuit against the crypto exchange led to a drop of 20% in the company’s share price, which Armstrong managed to avoid by selling a considerable chunk of his holdings. </p>

<p>Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett took to <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1666833553814945794" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> to share her take on the matter after crypto users accused Brian Armstrong of dumping his shares to avoid the impact of the SEC’s lawsuit. Terrett highlighted that the shares sold by Armstrong were part of a pre-planned stock sale that was initiated in August 2022. As per Terrett, it is common for executives to schedule stock sales on the first Monday of the month or the beginning of the third fiscal quarter. </p>



<p>Reports of the alleged stock dumping emerged just days after multiple <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-continue-staking-no-delisting/">Coinbase</a> executives, including Brian Armstrong, sold over $2.7 million worth of shares in a single day. The executives involved Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, Chief People Officer Brock Lawrence, Chief Financial Officer Haas Alesia, and company President Choi Emilie. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The measures introduced by the CBA include holds, declines, and limits on outgoing transfers to crypto exchanges.</li><li>CBA will also introduce a monthly $10,000 limit on these transactions in the coming months.</li><li>James Roberts, Commonwealth Bank General Manager of Group Fraud Management Services said that measures should combat crypto-related scams as consumer interest in digital assets grows.</li></ul>



<p>The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has made the decision to <a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/articles/newsroom/2023/06/changes-on-payments-to-crytocurrency-exchanges.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.commbank.com.au/articles/newsroom/2023/06/changes-on-payments-to-crytocurrency-exchanges.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">limit</a> payments to cryptocurrency exchanges and to introduce a monthly limit on outbound transactions to digital-asset trading platforms. Some transfers will be held for 24 hours or declined, all due to the increasing number of scams in the market, a spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday.</p>



<p>James Roberts, Commonwealth Bank General Manager of Group Fraud Management Services said that measures should combat crypto-related scams as consumer interest in digital assets grows.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With the incidences of scams increasing and in many cases customers suffering significant losses from being scammed, the introduction of 24 hour holds, declines and limits on outbound payments to cryptocurrency exchanges will help reduce both the number of scams and the amount of money lost by customers</p></blockquote>



<p>In the coming months, the CBA will implement a $10,000 AUD ($6,663) monthly limit of bank payments to crypto exchanges. Today&#8217;s announcement further said that the CBA will conduct regular reviews to assess how well these measures work. </p>



<h2>Binance Australia</h2>



<p>Earlier this month, Binance Australia <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-halts-bank-transactions/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-halts-bank-transactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a statement urging users to convert AUD balances to USDT stablecoin in order to ensure seamless transactions, stating that from the 1st of June, the company will no longer facilitate AUD deposits or withdrawals by bank transfer for Australian users. </p>



<p>Binance halted AUD deposits and transfers after filing a request with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to cancel its derivatives license. The move came after 500 derivatives positions on Binance Australia were <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-closes-futures-accounts-australia/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-closes-futures-accounts-australia/" rel="noreferrer noopener">liquidated</a>.</p>
