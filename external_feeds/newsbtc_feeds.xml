					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $1,780 level against the US Dollar. ETH must clear $1,820 to start a decent increase in the near term. Ethereum is currently consolidating below the $1,820 resistance zone. The price is trading below $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,818 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent increase if it settles above the $1,820 resistance. Ethereum Price Recovery Faces Hurdle Ethereum’s price extended its decline below the $1,800 zone. ETH even declined below the $1,780 level before the bulls appeared near $1,760, similar to Bitcoin. A low was formed near $1,761 and the price is currently attempting a recovery wave. It is trading above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,872 swing high to the $1,761 low. Ether is now trading below $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,818 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,872 swing high to the $1,761 low. Immediate resistance is near the $1,818 zone and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $1,820 level. A close above the $1,820 resistance could send Ether toward $1,845. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The next resistance sits near $1,875, above which Ethereum could rise toward $1,920. Any more gains above the $1,920 resistance zone could push the price toward the $2,000 resistance. Fresh Decline in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,820 resistance, it could start another bearish wave. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,785 level. The next major support is near the $1,760 zone or the recent swing low. If there is a close below the $1,760 support, the price could start another major decline. In the stated case, the price might drop toward the $1,700 support zone. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,660 level in the coming days.

					<description><![CDATA[The Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystem is gaining increasing attention in the world of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi). Despite not being as well known as other chains, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche&#8217;s unique consensus mechanism and interoperability with other chains make it a compelling option for developers and users alike.  With a promising Total Value Locked (TVL) and strong engagement from users and developers, the Avalanche ecosystem is on the cusp of significant growth and innovation. Related Reading: XRP Bears Prevail As Asset Retreats From Recent Highs Is AVAX The Next Big Thing? According to DeFi researcher Wacy, the Avalanche ecosystem is on the verge of blooming, and there are several reasons behind its recent increase in popularity. While many are focused on the new Layer 2 solutions, Wacy suggests that the potential of Avalanche should not be overlooked. One important measure of a chain&#8217;s success is Total Value Locked, and despite the token price dropping over 80%, the TVL for $AVAX has only decreased by 50%. This indicates continued interest in the chain and serves as a positive indicator of its future potential. In addition to TVL, other metrics such as daily active addresses and daily transactions show good growth, indicating strong engagement from users. The number of contracts and deployers is also a powerful indicator of interest in a project, and this metric also shows strong engagement from developers. Furthermore, Wacy notes that The Avalanche community is also growing, with increasing followers on Twitter and a high level of Twitter mentions over the past 7 days. These basic metrics may be overlooked by some, but they provide valuable insights into the potential of the Avalanche ecosystem. Avalanche Emerges As A Hidden Gem For Developers and Users According to Wacy, as the Avalanche ecosystem continues to gain attention in the world of blockchain and decentralized finance, several projects are emerging as potential main narratives that could see a significant rise during this heyday. One such project is Trader Joe, which is currently the number one decentralized exchange (DEX) on Avalanche. By creating the most capital-efficient DEX in DeFi, Trader Joe is shaping the future of decentralized finance. The JOE token allows users to earn a share of the platform&#8217;s revenue and unlocks access to exclusive rewards and features. With a current price of $0.35 and a market cap of $120M, Trader Joe is listed on Binance, OKX, and Huobi, and is poised for significant growth in the coming months. Another project that could see significant growth during the Avalanche ecosystem&#8217;s heyday is GMX. GMX is a decentralized exchange with low swap fees and zero price impact trades. While it is well known for its support of Arbitrum, GMX also supports AVAX. With a current price of $54 and a market cap of $475 million, GMX is listed on Binance, OKX, Huobi, and KuCoin, and staking GMX earns rewards, with 30% of swap and leverage trading fees converting to ETH/AVAX and distributing to GMX tokens. Staking on Arbitrum earns ETH while staking on Avalanche earns AVAX. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance Overall, these projects represent the unique potential of the Avalanche ecosystem. With its unique consensus mechanism, interoperability with other chains, and promising metrics, Avalanche is attracting significant interest from developers and users alike. As more projects like Trader Joe and GMX emerge, we can expect to see continued growth and innovation in the ecosystem, with new use cases and applications for blockchain technology. At present, AVAX is experiencing a significant drop in value across all time frames. Its current trading price is $14.09, with a slight increase of 0.1% over the last 24 hours. However, over the seven, fourteen, and thirty-day periods, AVAX has experienced a decline of 5%, 6%, and 16% respectively.

					<description><![CDATA[Crypto exchange Coinbase announced and launched the testnet for its very own Layer 2 blockchain called Base earlier in February 2023. Since the launch, there have been speculations about the exchange launching a token for the L2, which has now been clarified in the newly released roadmap for Base. Base Roadmap Mentions No Token Following the launch of Base, crypto exchange Coinbase made it known that there were no plans to actually launch a token for the Layer 2 blockchain. Nevertheless, this did not stop the speculations, but with the release of its roadmap, the team seems to have put an abrupt halt to all rumors regarding a token.

The roadmap which was published on Wednesday on the Coinbase website clearly states that “Base has no plans to issue a network token.” Instead, it will continue to operate like most other Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains, using ETH as a way to carry out transactions and pay for gas fees. As the L2 moves closer toward a mainnet launch, the team is rather focusing on builders on the chain. It is also looking toward upgrading Optimism’s Bedrock, as well as all of the reviews and audits while making sure the testate remains stable. “We’ve been building towards Mainnet Genesis, the first step of delivering a decentralized platform that scales Ethereum with fast, low-cost and secure transactions. As we prepare to upgrade from testnet to mainnet, we want to build in the open and keep the community informed of our roadmap and status,” the statement said.

As Coinbase enters the L2 space, it is coming into fierce competition with other L2s that are already live on the mainnet. The likes of Optimism and Arbitrum have seen a reasonable level of success since their launch, which signals that Base could be just as successful.

Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism remain the dominant L2s in the space with total value locked of $2.31 billion, $986.88 million, and $881.1 million respectively.

					<description><![CDATA[Rumors of the arrest of the Multichain team have sent shockwaves throughout the Fantom ecosystem. Despite trading volumes of $129 million, the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) have resulted in a 5x increase in daily bridging volumes. However, upon closer examination of the on-chain data, the bridging volumes do not show a significant sign of panic. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Under Bearish Strain As Selling Pressure Mounts Fantom&#8217;s Risky-Wrapped Token Exposure According to a Twitter thread by the crypto researcher DeFi Ignas, Fantom (FTM) is the most exposed to Multichain&#8217;s wrapped tokens. This suggests that Fantom is particularly vulnerable to any negative impact that may result from the rumored arrest of the Multichain team. This is because Fantom has significant exposure to Multichain&#8217;s wrapped tokens, with 35% of its total value locked (TVL) dependent on these wrappers. In addition, Multichain issues 40% of non-FTM assets, which is equivalent to a sizable $650 million. This means that if anything were to happen to Multichain, it could have a significant impact on the overall value of these assets. Furthermore, Multichain handles 81% of Fantom&#8217;s total stablecoin market capitalization. Stablecoins are digital assets that are pegged to the value of a real-world asset, such as the US dollar. They are often used as a way to hedge against market volatility. However, If anything were to happen to Multichain, it could have a significant impact on the value of these stablecoins and cause instability in the Fantom ecosystem. Fantom Investors Stay Calm Amid Multichain Arrest Rumors According to Ignas, there should have been a significant outflow of Total Value Locked from Fantom due to its reliance on Multichain. However, the data shows that the amount withdrawn was only 1% of its total TVL of $1.78 billion, which indicates that there is not much panic in the market. Furthermore, while the TVL has dropped by 9.55% in USD, adjusting for the price of FTM shows no significant outflow of capital. The clearest and only sign of panic is the Multichain Liquidity Providers (LPs) on Fantom, with a total of $33 million being withdrawn by LPs from Fantom, and only $1.7 million in deposits. However, what is most worrying is the lack of communication from the Multichain team. It has been reported that the current Multichain CEO Zhaojun hasn&#8217;t been online in a week. This has left many investors and traders in the cryptocurrency market feeling uncertain about the future of the project. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance Additionally, Multichain has reported that some of the cross-chain routes are unavailable due to force majeure and that Kava, zkSync, and Polygon zkEVM routes were temporarily suspended. There were also 83 transactions pending for more than a day, which has raised further concerns among investors and traders.

					<description><![CDATA[The Polkadot price analysis continues to indicate a bearish outlook as the market undergoes a notable decline. Within the past 24 hours, the asset&#8217;s price experienced a slight decline, demonstrating sideways movement under the influence of bearish sentiment. On a weekly timeframe, there has been limited movement in the price of DOT. In terms of technical indicators, DOT has exhibited bearish strength, with low buying pressure. Both demand and accumulation levels have decreased based on the daily chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance Given the indecisiveness in Bitcoin&#8217;s chart, many altcoins, including DOT, have either remained constrained under immediate resistance levels or have entered consolidation phases. It is crucial for DOT to maintain a price level above its immediate support to avoid the possibility of another substantial decline in upcoming trading sessions. If selling pressure intensifies, there is a risk of the altcoin breaking below its crucial support level. The declining market capitalization of Polkadot indicates that sellers are still exerting control over the asset. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the current writing, DOT is being traded at $5.29, with Polkadot hovering near its critical support level of $5.15. Should the price fall below this level, it may further decline to $5. On the upside, a significant resistance level is observed at $5.40. If DOT bulls manage to surpass this resistance, it could potentially trigger a rally towards $5.71, indicating a 6% appreciation. Further progress could then lead the price into the $6 range. Notably, the trading volume of DOT in the last session was relatively low. This suggested that buying strength was weaker compared to selling pressure. Technical Analysis During the months of April and May, the demand for DOT remained relatively weak. Analysis shows that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained below the 40-mark, indicating that selling pressure outweighed buying pressure in the market. Additionally, DOT remained below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), further affirming the dominance of sellers in driving the price momentum. However, if DOT manages to surpass the $5.30 mark, it has the potential to climb above the 20-SMA line. This could potentially attract buyers back into the market and shift the overall sentiment in a more positive direction. As demand for DOT declined, the altcoin exhibited decreasing buy signals on its one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which represents price momentum and trend reversal, displayed declining green histograms, indicating a weak buy signal for DOT. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands, which illustrate price volatility and fluctuations, exhibited constriction, indicating a range-bound movement.

The asset trades below the 200-Day And 50-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), suggesting a bearish market sentiment. This indicates that LINK will experience a bearish momentum both in the long and short-term trends. Investors may see this as an opportunity to take profits, which will cause a further price decline. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of LINK currently stands at 37.73, indicating a neutral market. However, the trend line is moving downwards, suggesting an increase in bearish momentum. It is worth noting that an RSI below 30 signifies strong selling pressure, indicating that bears control the market, whereas a level beyond 70 suggests bulls dominate. Lastly, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) trading below the signal line confirms the bearish moves present in the market. This indicator suggests a high bearish momentum in the market, just like the RSI depicts. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) has found rejection at the long-term resistance zone recently. Bitcoin NUPL Has Observed Some Decline In Recent Days As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC NUPL metric has failed to clear a major resistance. The &#8220;NUPL&#8221; is an indicator that tells us about the degree of unrealized profit or loss that&#8217;s currently being held by the investors. By &#8220;unrealized,&#8221; what&#8217;s meant here is that the holders have accumulated profits/losses (due to the price being more/less than what they purchased the coins at), but they are yet to actually sell their BTC to set them in stone. When such investors who are holding unrealized profits/losses do end up selling eventually, the profits/losses they were previously holding are said to be &#8220;realized.&#8221; When the value of the NUPL is greater than zero, it means the average investor is carrying a profit on their coins right now. On the other hand, the indicator being below this threshold suggests the market as a whole is sitting on some loss currently. The zero value of the metric itself naturally represents the break-even level, as the total amount of unrealized profits in the market equals the unrealized losses at this mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hangs At $26,200: Why This Is A Crucial Support Level Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL, as well as its 365-day moving average (MA), over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant In the above graph, the quant has marked the &#8220;long-term resistance&#8221; zone that the Bitcoin NUPL has seemed to have historically followed. This area, which lies in between the values of 0.31 and 0.38, has been an important retest for the cryptocurrency, as failure here has often meant the start of a drawdown. When coming from above, however, there have also been bullish retests of this zone, as the points marked by the green checkmarks in the chart display. A prominent example of such a successful retest was back in July 2021, when BTC hit a local bottom and proceeded with the second half of the 2021 bull run following it. The example of a bearish resistance appears to have formed just recently, as the indicator entered the zone recently but has been rejected downwards. And with it, so has the asset&#8217;s price. It&#8217;s uncertain yet, but this rejection may have started an extended drawdown for the coin. &#8220;Given that the NUPL index has also formed a bearish Head &#38; Shoulders (H&#38;S) pattern, this could mean that Bitcoin could fall into the $24,000-$20,000 range,&#8221; notes the quant. &#8220;With the successful implementation of the H&#38;S, the local uptrend of the NUPL index will also be broken.&#8221; Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio Nears All-Time Lows, Big Move Soon?

<h2>Bitcoin NUPL Has Observed Some Decline In Recent Days</h2>
<p>As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/646e09885cd12663d790d29b-The-NUPL-index-indicates-certain-risks-for-Bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, the BTC NUPL metric has failed to clear a major resistance. The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bullish-signal-nupl-forming-golden-cross/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">NUPL</a>&#8221; is an indicator that tells us about the degree of unrealized profit or loss that&#8217;s currently being held by the investors.</p>

<p>When the value of the NUPL is greater than zero, it means the average investor is carrying a profit on their coins right now. On the other hand, the indicator being below this threshold suggests the market as a whole is sitting on some loss currently.</p>
<p>The zero value of the metric itself naturally represents the break-even level, as the total amount of unrealized profits in the market equals the unrealized losses at this mark.</p>

<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL, as well as its 365-day moving average (MA), over the last few years:</p>

<p>In the above graph, the quant has marked the &#8220;long-term resistance&#8221; zone that the Bitcoin NUPL has seemed to have historically followed. This area, which lies in between the values of 0.31 and 0.38, has been an important retest for the cryptocurrency, as failure here has often meant the start of a drawdown.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[XRP is in the red today, losing grip of its recent gains as the bears act on its price. The bulls had sustained the price momentum driving XRP to $0.4688 on May 19. The asset traded within this range till May 24, when the bears dropped it to a closing price of $0.454. But today, XRP&#8217;s price has gradually declined to the $0.451 level as the bears continue to exert pressure on its price. More Bearish Trend For XRP XRP is in a downtrend today, forming a second consecutive red candle on the daily price chart with lower lows. The asset trades below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a short-term-bearish sentiment. The 50-day SMA indicates XRP&#8217;s average price over a specific period. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Green Today – What’s The Energy Behind The Glow? Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 46.71 in the neutral zone and descending, further confirming a bearish sentiment for XRP. The RSI has two critical regions the overbought region and the oversold region. RSI values between 70 and 30 are neutral.  Given the descending line of XRP&#8217;s RSI, the asset is entering the oversold region from which a trend reversal is imminent.  XRP&#8217;s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line, suggesting a bullish sentiment. However, the MACD displays negative values, and its histogram bars hint at a bearish reversal. The MACD identifies the trend direction of an asset and is often used to place trades. Currently, it displays a tentative sell signal in the market today. But XRP is trading above the 200-day SMA, suggesting a bullish trend in the long run.  The altcoin is trading at the $0.4504 support level as the bears seek to push it down. Bearish pressure at the $0.46591 resistance level pushed XRP into a downtrend.  A further decline will see XRP return to the $0.44446 support level and push it to the oversold region. XRP will likely record more price drops in the short term.  However, since it is still trading above its 200-day SMA, a long-term bullish sentiment, the bulls will rally again once they regain control of its price. XRP Updates Might Influence Price Action In Long term Ripple Labs&#8217; ongoing legal case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission is likely one of the reasons behind XRP&#8217;s price downturn. However, as the Ripple CEO said, the case may likely conclude soon.

					<description><![CDATA[Renowned financial guru, entrepreneur, and bestselling author of &#8220;Rich Dad Poor Dad,&#8221; Robert Kiyosaki, has once again made headlines with his latest Twitter remarks on the importance of Bitcoin in the face of growing US debt. As the US economy continues to deteriorate and the country&#8217;s debt ceiling discussions take center stage, Kiyosaki emphasizes the urgency of securing one&#8217;s financial future by investing in alternative assets, including the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The State Of The US Economy  Robert Kiyosaki begins by shedding light on the deteriorating state of the US economy, expressing concern over the growing national debt. With Congress currently discussing raising the US debt ceiling to $31.4 trillion to avoid blemish, Kiyosaki dismisses it as nothing more than &#8220;kabuki theater.&#8221; Drawing attention to the dire financial situation, he asserts that the US is already bankrupt, citing unfunded liabilities, such as Social Security, which surpass $250 trillion. Related Reading: Why This Top Financial Expert Is Saying ‘Buy Bitcoin’ Amid Looming Bank Failures Furthermore, Kiyosaki highlights the size of the financial market&#8217;s &#8220;derivative assets,&#8221; amounting to thousands of trillions of dollars.
