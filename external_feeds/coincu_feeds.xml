<p>LayerZero Labs has announced the introduction of four new tokens &#8211; USDC, USDT, WETH, and WBTC &#8211; built on top of LayerZero, to the Fantom network. With support from the Fantom Foundation and a majority of the ecosystem, these tokens are expected to account for over 50% of the TVL on Fantom. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we are announcing the introduction of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$USDC</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$USDT</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$WETH</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WBTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$WBTC</a>, built on top of LayerZero, to the Fantom network with the support of <a href="https://twitter.com/FantomFDN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@FantomFDN</a> and a vast majority of the ecosystem.</p>&mdash; LayerZero Labs (@LayerZero_Labs) <a href="https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs/status/1676989298003021824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The adoption of these assets on Fantom will bring much-needed stability and longevity for projects utilizing them as liquidity, collateral, stores of value, and more. LayerZero-powered assets are already widely used as canonical assets across a number of ecosystems, and the introduction of these assets will ensure that the Fantom ecosystem can continue to grow with the trust of its users. The new tokens will be able to be bridged between Fantom and Ethereum via <a href="https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs/status/1676989317858889728" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs/status/1676989317858889728" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stargate Finance</a>. </p>



<p>This announcement comes ahead of Fantom&#8217;s next two major milestones, Carmen and Tosca. With over a dozen of the most recognizable teams building on Fantom, the platform is poised for further growth and adoption in the coming months.</p>



<p>Coincu previously <a href="https://coincu.com/200064-layerzero-ceo-twitter-account-hacked/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/200064-layerzero-ceo-twitter-account-hacked/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>that LayerZero has officially acknowledged that the CEO&#8217;s Twitter account (@PrimordialAA) has been compromised. As a precautionary measure, users have been warned against clicking on any suspicious links or engaging in questionable activities.</p>



<p>Last month, the Uniswap Foundation <a href="https://coincu.com/195595-uniswap-cross-chain-bridge-assessment/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/195595-uniswap-cross-chain-bridge-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared </a>an assessment report on cross-chain bridges, providing insights into the analysis of various protocols. According to the report, LayerZero did not fully meet all the requirements at the time of evaluation. However, the foundation noted that LayerZero is actively working towards fulfilling these requirements through a planned upgrade to its Oracle and relayer set. The Committee strongly urges the LayerZero team to implement this upgrade swiftly and recommends conducting a reassessment after the new configuration has been operational for at least three months.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Taylor Swift reportedly had a partnership deal with FTX crypto exchange, despite previous denials.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried decided not to proceed with the deal.</em></li>



<li><em>The agreement contradicts earlier explanations, and Bankman-Fried is facing criminal charges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a surprising turn of events, recent reports suggest that <a href="https://coincu.com/149906-taylor-swift-was-on-ftx-sponsor-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a> may have been involved in a partnership deal with the now-defunct FTX crypto exchange, despite previous public denials.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift-eras-chicago-2023-billboard-1548.webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="677" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift-eras-chicago-2023-billboard-1548-1024x677.webp" alt="Taylor Swift&#039;s Alleged Partnership With FTX Raises Questions Amidst Scandal" class="wp-image-200761" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift-eras-chicago-2023-billboard-1548-1024x677.webp 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift-eras-chicago-2023-billboard-1548-300x198.webp 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift-eras-chicago-2023-billboard-1548-768x508.webp 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift-eras-chicago-2023-billboard-1548-1536x1016.webp 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift-eras-chicago-2023-billboard-1548-750x496.webp 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift-eras-chicago-2023-billboard-1548-1140x754.webp 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift-eras-chicago-2023-billboard-1548.webp 1548w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Taylor Swift&#039;s Alleged Partnership With FTX Raises Questions Amidst Scandal 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>Sources familiar with the matter have disclosed with <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/06/taylor-swift-agreed-to-ftx-partnership-despite-contrary-public-claims-source.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em> that the popstar had agreed to a collaboration, only for it to be thwarted by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who is currently embroiled in legal troubles.</p>



<p>Contradicting earlier statements made by a class-action attorney, it appears that Swift did, in fact, entertain the idea of a partnership. The signed agreement was allegedly sent to Bankman-Fried&#8217;s email inbox, where it languished unanswered for several weeks. Eventually, a group of FTX executives reportedly convinced Bankman-Fried to abandon the proposed $100 million deal, painting a markedly different picture from the narrative surrounding Swift&#8217;s supposed withdrawal.</p>

<p>The nature of the agreement, which was initially reported by <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/technology/tom-brady-crypto-ftx.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a></em>, challenges the public messaging surrounding the failed FTX-Swift deal. Previously, a high-profile attorney had praised Swift&#8217;s due diligence efforts and claimed that she rejected the deal after questioning <a href="https://coincu.com/199738-ftx-announces-to-launch-customer-claims-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> about the status of its listed assets as unregistered securities. However, multiple sources, speaking anonymously due to ongoing legal proceedings, revealed that Swift&#8217;s team signed the deal after six months of negotiations, with <a href="https://coincu.com/198247-bankman-fried-pretrial-motions-denied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> ultimately halting its progression.</p>

<p>FTX&#8217;s subsequent filing for bankruptcy in November added further complications to the unfolding narrative. Bankman-Fried now faces criminal charges related to alleged fraud and money laundering, while three other FTX executives have pleaded guilty to federal charges and are cooperating with the government&#8217;s prosecution.</p>



<p>The existence of an FTX-Swift partnership was first reported by <em>The Financial Times</em>, introducing an intriguing twist to an already convoluted situation. As the story develops, more information is likely to emerge, shedding light on the true extent of Taylor Swift&#8217;s involvement with FTX and the reasons behind its ultimate collapse.</p>



<p>Please note that the aforementioned information is based on current reports and sources, but it is always advisable to consult trusted news outlets for the most up-to-date and accurate information.</p>

<p>The partnership will allow NFT Inspect users to purchase a range of cryptocurrencies using MoonPay&#8217;s payment infrastructure to then buy NFTs. MoonPay supports payment methods such as debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or various local bank transfer options. The collaboration is in line with their shared vision of fostering widespread crypto adoption and creating a borderless digital payments ecosystem where everyone can participate, regardless of experience level.</p>



<p>Last month, Inspect released a new Chrome browser extension that provides real-time data on popular NFT collections commonly used as Twitter profile pictures (PFPs). The Twitter NFT Search tool, which is also available in beta as a web version, allows users to search for different ways an NFT is used on Twitter and analyzes blockchain data about the collection.</p>

<p>NFT Inspect was resurrected under new ownership in March after announcing its reluctant shutdown in January. Post-acquisition, it has continued to build out its suite of tools to help NFT traders monitor market trends and recently partnered with Polygon Labs to drive adoption.</p>



<p>The new partnership between NFT Inspect and MoonPay is a significant step towards making NFTs and cryptocurrencies more accessible to the general public. The ability to purchase NFTs and cryptocurrencies on Twitter will make it easier for users to engage with the growing NFT market and benefit from the potential financial gains. With the support of MoonPay&#8217;s payment infrastructure, users can now purchase NFTs and cryptocurrencies without the need for extensive knowledge of crypto wallets or complex payment methods.</p>

<p>The assets came from the US Department of Homeland Security, which was essential in capturing the stolen digital assets and prosecuting the perpetrators, Bitfinex stated in a statement on Thursday. Around 120,000 Bitcoins, worth approximately $72 million at the time, were taken. The haul is worth around $3.7 billion at the current market price.</p>



<p>The digital asset trading platform Bitfinex reported the restitution of $312,219.71 in cash and 6.917 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) from the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as part of continuing efforts to recover assets taken during the 2016 security incident. The recovery value at today&#8217;s Bitcoin Cash pricing is $314,196.</p>

<p>Heather &#8220;Razzlekhan&#8221; Morgan and Ilya &#8220;Dutch&#8221; Lichtenstein, a couple detained last year for allegedly laundering billions of dollars in Bitcoin from the robbery, are among individuals previously accused of keeping cash from the attack. The seizure was carried out by US Customs and Border Protection, a law enforcement department inside the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>Bitfinex&#8217;s Chief Technical Officer, Paolo Ardoino, acknowledged the company&#8217;s happiness with this recovery milestone and thanked for law enforcement authorities&#8217; efforts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This specific seizure demonstrates the commitment of law enforcement officials to diligently track all the proceeds of the crime committed against Bitfinex almost seven years ago,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The fund will be given to holders of Bitfinex&#8217;s Recovery Right Tokens, which are digital tokens given to individuals who lost money in the breach. Since there are around 30 million RRTs in circulation, each investment will most likely get just a tiny portion of the recovery. RRT holders will have their tokens redeemed pro rata today, July 6, 2023, at 12:00.01 AM UTC, depending on the amount of their RRT holdings. Bitfinex is continuing to work actively with law enforcement and legal institutions to retrieve the stolen assets.</p>

<p>The proposal, unveiled on July 6, aims to enable users to actively participate in protocol governance while ensuring adequate liquidity for decentralized exchanges. By implementing the 8020 Initiative, Balancer offers a unique solution to the liquidity issue faced by DeFi platforms. The structure allows token holders to engage in governance activities while simultaneously providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges. This approach ensures that the locked governance tokens do not hinder the availability of liquidity within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>Several prominent protocols have already joined the 8020 Initiative, including Radiant, Aave, Alchemix, Y2K Finance, OATH Finance, Paraswap, and Timeless Finance. The collaboration of these projects further strengthens the ecosystem by pooling resources and expertise to enhance liquidity provisions across DeFi platforms.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DeSo, the social blockchain platform, is offering an enticing opportunity for developers by providing bounties of up to $1 million.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1.jpeg" alt="DeSo&#039;s $1 Million Bounty Program Empowers Developers To Revolutionize Social Blockchain" class="wp-image-200739" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1-300x180.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1-768x461.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeSo_Logo_1679592032deSNey69wD-1024x614-1-750x450.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="DeSo&#039;s $1 Million Bounty Program Empowers Developers To Revolutionize Social Blockchain 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The rewards are aimed at those who can create alternatives to the Reddit chain on DeSo&#8217;s platform. This initiative comes as a response to Reddit&#8217;s recent decision to restrict API access, leading to discontent within the community due to limited access to content.</p>



<p>DeSo believes that building a decentralized version of Reddit on its blockchain will grant users complete control over their content, free from censorship or the risk of being banned at the protocol level. By leveraging the capabilities of blockchain technology, the firm aims to empower users with greater freedom and ownership over their social media experiences.</p>



<p>The announcement of the bounty program comes on the heels of the platform successful financing round in 2021, which secured a substantial $200 million in funding. Prominent investors, including a16z and Sequoia Capital, participated in the financing, highlighting the growing interest and support for DeSo&#8217;s innovative blockchain-based social platform.</p>

<p>As DeSo continues to gain traction and support from investors, it remains at the forefront of the social blockchain revolution, offering an alternative path to social media that prioritizes user control and content ownership.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Crypto attacks rose by 65.3% in Q2 2023, while the total damage decreased by 60.4%.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum were the main targets of the attacks, with hacking being the most common method.</em></li>



<li><em>The North Korean hacker group Lazarus was responsible for almost half of the illegal attacks.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the second quarter of 2023, the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors witnessed a significant increase in the number of attacks, according to a <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/zgX5ZJPLIiJgPDngenEsQ/209d1fb848f9bcbe5d41a0da3b4eeff1/Immunefi_Crypto_Losses_in_Q2_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by Immunefi. Despite a rise in the number of incidents, the scale of damage caused by these crypto attacks decreased compared to the same period last year.</strong></h5>

<p>Immunefi&#8217;s analysis revealed that the number of <a href="https://coincu.com/164099-crypto-attacks-cause-3-8-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto attacks</a>, including hacking incidents, rose by 65.3% from 49 to 81 cases in Q2 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. However, the total funds stolen during these attacks decreased by 60.4% in Q2 2023, indicating improved security measures within the industry.</p>



<p>The report estimated that nearly half of the illegal attacks, approximately 49.7%, were attributed to the notorious North Korean hacker group known as Lazarus. Hacking attacks accounted for 83.1% of the damages caused in Q2, with fraud, scams, and rug pulls accounting for the remaining portion.</p>



<p>In terms of targets, the Binance Smart Chain (BNB) and Ethereum were the primary targets for these attacks. The BNB chain accounted for 44.4% of the total damages, while Ethereum accounted for 32.1%.</p>

<p>Despite the decrease in stolen funds, the overall damage to the cryptocurrency industry in Q2 2023 amounted to approximately $265.5 million. It is worth noting that only a small portion, $10.5 million, was recovered, representing just 3.9% of the total damages.</p>



<p>Additionally, the report highlighted a concerning trend regarding targeted attacks on blockchain networks. Arbitrum, which had no incidents in Q2 2022, experienced a significant rise in attacks, with 10 major incidents in Q2 2023. This places Arbitrum as the third most targeted blockchain for two consecutive quarters, with a total of 18 incidents recorded year-to-date. Other notable blockchain platforms, such as Polygon and zkSync, also experienced multiple incidents during the quarter.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, believes that BlackRock does not have an advantage over ARK Invest in the application of a Bitcoin spot ETF.</em></li>



<li><em>Wood suggests that if the US SEC loses the &#8220;Grayscale v. SEC&#8221; case, the chances of approving a Bitcoin spot ETF would increase.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood spoke to Fortune magazine about a Bitcoin spot ETF filing and SEC approval.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1.jpeg" alt="Cathie Wood Bullish: US SEC Ruling Impact on Bitcoin Spot ETF" class="wp-image-200725" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1.jpeg 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1-300x158.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Cathie Wood Bullish: US SEC Ruling Impact on Bitcoin Spot ETF 17"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In an interview with Fortune magazine, Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, expressed her perspective on the application of a Bitcoin spot ETF and its potential approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Wood believes that BlackRock does not hold an advantage over ARK Invest in this regard, stating that any necessary revisions to their application profile can be made swiftly.</p>



<p>Wood highlighted that while BlackRock&#8217;s application includes a supervisory sharing clause, ARK Invest can easily adjust their application to align with industry standards. Wood emphasized that multiple institutions are moving towards this direction and have submitted their respective applications. The SEC is expected to review ARK Invest&#8217;s application by mid-January next year, while BlackRock&#8217;s review is anticipated before March next year.</p>

<p>Cathie Wood pointed out that the SEC has already approved some Bitcoin futures ETFs and recently granted approval for a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF. However, she believes that spot ETFs, such as the grayscale version, offer greater security as they are fully backed by bitcoins stored in cold wallets, in contrast to futures that involve swaps. Wood finds the SEC&#8217;s approval situation contradictory, with futures ETFs being approved while spot ETFs are rejected.</p>



<p>Moreover, <a href="https://coincu.com/193117-cathie-wood-binances-troubles-help-coinbase/">Wood</a> stated that if the SEC were to lose the ongoing &#8220;Grayscale v. SEC&#8221; case, the likelihood of approving a Bitcoin spot ETF would increase. This case outcome could potentially shape the SEC&#8217;s stance on spot ETFs and pave the way for their approval.</p>



<p>As the regulatory landscape evolves, investors and industry players eagerly await the SEC&#8217;s decisions on Bitcoin spot ETFs, which could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency market and investment opportunities.</p>

<p>In a recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York test, some of the world&#8217;s largest banks, including Citigroup and Wells Fargo, participated in a 12-week trial using a regulated liability network technology. This technology allows banks to simulate issuing digital money representing their customers&#8217; funds before settling through central bank reserves on a distributed ledger. The test proved that digital dollars can improve wholesale payments without altering the legal treatment of the deposits.</p>



<p>Unlike public blockchains commonly seen in cryptocurrencies, the test was conducted on a private blockchain that requires permission to participate. The project concluded that there were no significant legal impediments under existing US laws that would prevent the establishment of a digital dollar. However, further engagement with regulators would be required before reaching a final conclusion.</p>



<p>A central bank digital currency is not yet a reality in the US, but bank deposit tokens issued on a blockchain could be more widely used than stablecoins. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has said they see promise in deposit tokens. Meanwhile, some officials at the Federal Reserve have expressed doubt over the need for a central bank digital currency.</p>



<p>The New York Innovation Center emphasized that the proof-of-concept was not intended to signal that the Federal Reserve will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a central bank digital currency or any other product or service. The project aimed to explore the potential functional benefits of central bank and commercial bank digital money operating together on a shared ledger.</p>



<p>The pilot found that the technology could help synchronize dollar-denominated payments and facilitate settlement in near-real time. This could greatly benefit cross-border settlements, which are often lengthy and cumbersome due to the many different systems banks and governments use worldwide.</p>
