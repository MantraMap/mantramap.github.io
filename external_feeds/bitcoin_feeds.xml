Foss expressed his support for &#x201C;hard assets&#x201D; such as real estate, gold, and bitcoin. He believes that bitcoin, the leading crypto asset, is one of the best hard assets available. According to Foss, bitcoin provides insurance against &#x201C;the failure of a basket of fiat currencies.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Foss Supports Holding Hard Assets Like Real Estate, Gold, and Bitcoin</h2>
<p>In less than two months, chaos has erupted in the U.S. banking industry following the second, third, and fourth-largest bank failures in the country&#x2019;s history. During a conversation with Kitco&#x2019;s lead anchor and editor-in-chief, Michelle Makori, <a href="https://twitter.com/foss_sammy">Greg Foss</a> weighed in on Fed chairman Jerome Powell&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">recent statement</a> that the U.S. banking system is &#x201C;sound and resilient.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think Jerome Powell is a horrible poker player,&#x201D; Foss <a href="https://youtu.be/ax-_Tb9zsXQ">opined</a> to Makori. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s another shoe to fall [in the banking industry], or as Elon says, it could be an anvil,&#x201D; Foss added. The Validus Power executive added that he thought Powell&#x2019;s body language &#x201C;reeked of desperation.&#x201D; Foss insisted that the Fed tightened too much because they &#x201C;waited too long to tighten at the outset.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to Foss, the possibility of more banks collapsing is high. While the largest banks are considered &#x201C;too big to fail&#x201D; and will likely receive bailouts, shareholders may not be so lucky. This is where significant financial losses can occur, the Validus Power executive emphasized to Makori. Foss estimates that there is &#x201C;at least $10 trillion of bank equity globally that can literally be wiped out if the system fails.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In his interview, Foss expressed his support for &#x201C;hard assets&#x201D; and specifically mentioned real estate, gold, and bitcoin. While Foss believes that <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> is the best hard asset, he also recognizes the value of gold as an investment. However, Foss advises against selling gold to purchase bitcoin. Instead, he suggests selling a portion of one&#x2019;s bond portfolio to invest in bitcoin. According to Foss, if a person doesn&#x2019;t own bitcoin they are &#x201C;actually taking on more risk.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;You can look at bitcoin as being insurance on the failure of a basket of fiat currencies,&#x201D; Foss told the Kitco anchor. &#x201C;$200 trillion is the liability just of the United States. You take 160 [basis points] times $200 trillion and you get &#x2026; $3.2 trillion would be the implied insurance value on the United States &#x2026; What is bitcoin trading for? Well, about half a trillion dollars,&#x201D; he added. Foss concluded his conversation with Makori by noting that &#x201C;bitcoin is a free and open market,&#x201D; while the &#x201C;Fiat Ponzi is manipulated by guys like Jerome Powell.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Lawyer Expects SEC to Lose Against Coinbase in Court</h2>
<p>Lawyer James Murphy explained in a series of tweets Wednesday why he believes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will lose if it takes Coinbase to court. Murphy started law firm Murphy &amp; McGonigle in 2010 to represent clients in the securities and banking industries. The firm pivoted in 2017 toward representing emerging companies that leverage blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Referencing a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-informs-crypto-exchange-coinbase-of-potential-securities-law-violations/">Wells Notice</a>, a formal communication that typically precedes a lawsuit, that the securities regulator sent the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange in March, the lawyer opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the SEC follows through on its threat to sue Coinbase, I believe the SEC will lose. The SEC&#8217;s case has a fatal flaw. And the problem is entirely of Gary Gensler’s own making.</p></blockquote>
<p>Murphy explained that SEC Chairman Gensler himself said in his testimony to Congress on May 6, 2021, that the SEC does not have the authority to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges. Gensler&#8217;s testimony followed his confirmation by the U.S. Senate on April 14, 2021, to serve as chair of the SEC. He was sworn into office on April 17, 2021.</p>
<p>If the SEC files a lawsuit against Coinbase, the crypto exchange&#8217;s legal team &#8220;will surely zero in on the communications within the SEC leading up to Gensler’s May 6, 2021 testimony,&#8221; Murphy said, adding that &#8220;All testimony of an SEC Chairman is thoroughly vetted internally before they testify.”</p>

<p>Murphy stressed: &#8220;So there will be emails, meeting notes, memos, text messages, chats, and deposition testimony showing that: There was a consensus within the SEC that it lacked legal authority from Congress to regulate crypto exchanges.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>If they sue Coinbase, the SEC&#8217;s lawyers will have the unenviable task of trying to explain away their own chairman&#8217;s testimony to Congress and all the documents and discussion that preceded it internally within the SEC … It&#8217;s a highly embarrassing prospect for the SEC.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Even more damaging will be all the discovery Coinbase will conduct around Gensler&#8217;s decision to pull a 180-degree reversal and suddenly claim that the SEC does have the authority to regulate crypto exchanges in the absence of any Congressional authorization,” the lawyer emphasized. &#8220;His unequivocal testimony before Congress and his bizarre 180-degree reversal make Gary Gensler himself the star witness at trial — for Coinbase.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Ackman Calls for Urgent Action as Time Runs Out to Prevent More Bank Failures</h2>
<p>Billionaire Bill Ackman, CEO and portfolio manager of Pershing Square Capital Management, has warned that time is running out for the U.S. government to fix the banking system. He tweeted Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The regional banking system is at risk … The rapid rise in rates impaired assets and drained deposits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ackman explained that the “failure” of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) “to update and expand its insurance regime has hammered more nails in the coffin.” He stressed that First Republic Bank “would not have failed if the FDIC temporarily guaranteed deposits while a new guarantee regime were created. Instead, we watch the dominoes fall at great systemic and economic cost.” First Republic Bank was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">seized</a> by regulators earlier this week and most of its assets were sold to JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>The billionaire added that globally systemic banks (G-SIBs) “have an unfair competitive advantage as too big to fail means only their uninsured depositors can sleep soundly. Until the playing field is leveled, the regional banks are at grave risk.”</p>

<p>Ackman continued: “Confidence in a financial institution is built over decades and destroyed in days. As each domino falls, the next weakest bank begins to wobble. Until investors are rewarded for betting on a wobbling bank, there will be no bid, and the best sale is the last price.” He stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are running out of time to fix this problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>“How many more unnecessary bank failures do we need to watch before the FDIC, U.S. Treasury, and our government wake up? We need a systemwide deposit guarantee regime now,” he concluded.</p>

<h2>722 Banks Reported Unrealized Losses of More Than 50% of Capital</h2>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has revealed in a board presentation by the Division of Supervision and Regulation that 722 banks reported unrealized losses exceeding 50% of their capital at the end of the third quarter of 2022. The presentation, released to the public in April, is dated Feb. 14. It highlights the impact of raising interest rates on certain banks and the Fed&#8217;s supervisory approach to address issues at these banks.</p>
<p>“Rising interest rates are creating significant unrealized losses in investment securities and in some cases depressing tangible equity,” the Fed presentation states. “As interest rates increase, banks with large market value losses could experience increased financial and risk management challenges.”</p>
<p>The Fed presentation further details:</p>
<blockquote><p>At third quarter end, 722 banks reported unrealized losses exceeding 50% of capital.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, “31 of these banks report negative tangible equity levels,” which means they are currently “not able to borrow new money from Federal Home Loan Banks and may lose the ability to sell loans to Government Sponsored Enterprises,&#8221; the Fed presentation adds.</p>

<p>Many people took to social media Saturday to voice concerns about the U.S. banking crisis. Some stressed that this is a clear indication that the banking crisis is far from being resolved while others warned that the banking crisis in the U.S. is just getting started.</p>
<p>Gabor Gurbacs, director of Digital Assets Strategy at investment management firm Vaneck, opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed had the data, knew what could be coming after their reckless interest rate policies yet they didn’t meaningfully warn either the government or the public.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite multiple bank failures, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">insisted</a> that the U.S. banking system is &#8220;sound and resilient.&#8221; Regarding the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, the Fed chairman claimed: &#8220;Those have all been resolved, and all the depositors have been protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Multiple people have cautioned that the U.S. banking crisis is not over, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who said last month that there will be &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-says-banking-crisis-not-over-warns-of-repercussions-for-years-to-come/">repercussions for years to come</a>.&#8221; Economist Peter Schiff also recently warned that the banking crisis is not over and a much worse <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-says-banking-crisis-not-over-much-worse-financial-crisis-incoming-warns-of-massive-recession/">financial crisis</a> is incoming.</p>

In its application challenging the injunction, Binance said the action had been taken without notice. Binance also said it could not comply with the injunction since it was granted after the fraudulently acquired crypto assets in question were moved.</strong></p>
<h2>Claimant Proceeded Against Binance Without Notice</h2>
<p>A United Kingdom high court recently ruled to set aside an interim proprietary injunction against the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The interim injunction, which required Binance to preserve a certain amount of cryptocurrency, was issued after a victim of cryptocurrency fraud claimed to have traced the stolen funds to the crypto exchange.</p>
<p>According to a recent post on the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills&#x2019; <a href="https://hsfnotes.com/litigation/2023/05/04/high-court-sets-aside-interim-proprietary-injunction-against-cryptocurrency-exchange-binance/">blog</a>, the discharge of an injunction against Binance is one of the first known cases where a cryptocurrency exchange has challenged granting a proprietary injunction. The proprietary injunction, which was granted on October 18, 2022, was issued in respect of 470,904 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> stablecoins that were traced to Binance user accounts.</p>
<p>However, following the granting of this injunction, Binance applied for the setting aside of the injunction. The crypto exchange argued that the claimant proceeded to seek the injunction without notice. Binance also argued that it was not possible for it to comply with the injunction since it was granted after the funds in question had been moved.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was impossible in practice for Binance to comply with the injunction because the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> in question had been transferred to its central pooled funds address where they had been mixed and dissipated in the ordinary course of its business before it was served with the injunction,&#x201D; Binance said.</p>
<p>In addition to setting aside the injunction, the high court also ordered the claimant &#x201C;to pay Binance&#x2019;s costs of the application on the indemnity basis amounting to &#xA3;90,000 [$113,685.00].&#x201D;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Legal Risks for Crypto Fraud Victims</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in the same blog post, the law firm sought to point out the difference between obtaining an injunction against the account owner and serving this &#x201C;on the exchange as a third party&#x201D; versus identifying the crypto exchange as a respondent.</p>
<p>The law firm also argued that if an injunction against the cryptocurrency exchange &#x201C;is inappropriately obtained&#x201D; and is later &#x201C;discharged,&#x201D; this may leave the fraud victim &#x201C;with a significant adverse costs order.&#x201D; Therefore, before seeking an injunction, Herbert Smith Freehills, which acts for Binance in relation to the claim, said legal advisers of victims of crypto fraud should first distinguish the position of a crypto exchange from that of other defendants.</p>
<p>They should also consider if there is a proper basis for making an application against the exchange without notice. Legal advisers should see to it that there are identifiable assets when an application is made, the blog post added.</p>

Two sources have claimed that the securities regulator is scrutinizing the bank&#8217;s executives for making trades using confidential information. Although the sources have not named any specific individuals under investigation, they assert that the SEC is looking into the matter. Furthermore, reports indicate that U.S. lawmakers sold shares of the troubled bank before it collapsed and was acquired by JPMorgan Chase. </strong></p>
<h2>Securities Watchdog Investigates First Republic Execs</h2>
<p>On May 1, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">took control</a> of First Republic Bank, a San Francisco-based financial institution, and placed it under the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). With $229 billion in assets, this was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States">second largest bank failure</a> in U.S. history, following the 2008 collapse of Washington Mutual (Wamu).</p>
<p>In the wake of the First Republic Bank&#8217;s collapse, Sabrina Willmer and Austin Weinstein, reporters for Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/first-republic-executives-trading-probed-by-sec-investigators?leadSource=uverify%20wall">revealed</a> that &#8220;two people familiar with the matter&#8221; disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating the bank&#8217;s executives for potential insider trading schemes. This development comes on the heels of the SEC&#8217;s investigation into the executives of Silicon Valley Bank, whose failure resulted in the third-largest bank collapse in U.S. history.</p>
<p>According to Willmer and Weinstein, when they reached out to the SEC and JPMorgan Chase for comment on the alleged investigation into First Republic Bank, representatives from both entities &#8220;declined&#8221; to provide a statement. The sources who disclosed the investigation did not identify any specific executives from First Republic, and the reporters emphasized that no one from the bank has been accused of any misconduct.</p>
<h2>U.S. Lawmakers Dump First Republic Shares Prior to Bank’s Failure</h2>
<p>In addition to the information provided by Willmer and Weinstein&#8217;s sources, several other <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/05/04/lawmakers-dump-first-republic-shares-amid-banking-crisis.html">reports</a> suggest that U.S. lawmakers sold off their shares in First Republic prior to its collapse. During the fallout of First Republic Bank, Florida Democrat Lois Frankel <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/politics/democratic-congresswoman-first-republic-stock/index.html">disclosed</a> that she had sold her shares in the bank prior to its collapse and had instead invested in JPMorgan Chase. In an interview with CNN, Frankel explained that her stocks are &#8220;managed independently by a money manager who buys and sells stocks at his discretion.&#8221;</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that U.S. officials have been accused of selling off stocks before a market crash. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, several members of the United States Senate were <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/488593-four-senators-sold-stocks-before-coronavirus-threat-crashed-market/">accused</a> of violating the 2012 STOCK Act. However, no charges were filed against the lawmakers and the cases were eventually closed. In a 2022 editorial, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/09/13/us/politics/congress-members-stock-trading-list.html">reported</a> that 97 members of the U.S. Congress had reported trades in companies that were &#8220;influenced by their committees.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts on the recent allegations of insider trading by First Republic Bank executives and the reported sale of shares by U.S. lawmakers prior to the bank&#8217;s collapse?</strong></em></p>

As of today, the TVL amounts to $49.31 billion, registering a 1% increase within the last 24 hours.</strong></p>
<h2>TVL in Defi Shows Signs of Improvement, Yet to Surpass Previous Record of $53 Billion</h2>
<p>Currently, the combined TVL across all defi platforms stands at <a href="https://defillama.com">$49.31 billion</a> as of May 6, 2023, with Lido Finance leading the pack by commanding a 24.82% share of $12.24 billion on Saturday. Over the past month, Lido&#x2019;s TVL has grown by 9%, while posting a moderate 2.42% increase in the preceding week. The remaining top five candidates in today&#x2019;s defi landscape include Makerdao, Aave, Curve Finance, and Uniswap; three out of these four experienced monthly downturns, with Uniswap being the exception by posting a 3.48% gain over the past 30 days.</p>

<p>Ethereum takes the lion&#x2019;s share of this TVL with its <a href="https://defillama.com/chains">$28.66 billion</a> accounting for over 58% of the defi market cap. Following Ethereum are other contenders such as Tron, BSC, Arbitrum, and Polygon who boast relatively large TVL statistics. Both Tron and Arbitrum have recorded monthly gains of 7.77% and 9.98%, respectively. However, BSC stands as the top defi-chain loser in terms of TVL losses from last month with a decrease of approximately 6.52%.</p>

<p>A sizable $16.416 billion worth of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> (8,550,940 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) is locked in liquid staking platforms out of the entire $49.31 billion amount locked in defi systems today. The dominant liquid staking platforms for Ethereum are Lido, Coinbase, Rocket Pool, Frax, and Stakewise. Rocket Pool and Frax have witnessed impressive 30-day increases of 29.75% and 39.49%, respectively. Furthermore, the largest number of defi applications belongs to Ethereum with 771 protocols in total.</p>

<p>While Binance Smart Chain and Polygon follow Ethereum&#x2019;s protocol count with 593 and 409 applications, respectively, Tron &#x2014; the second-biggest defi blockchain &#x2014; has only 18 associated protocols. However, Tron boasts the highest user base among the top five defi platforms with 2,538,896 participants. Ethereum&#x2019;s active user count for its defi apps is approximately 332,548. Although the TVL in defi has shown signs of improvement in 2023, it has yet to surpass its previous record of $53 billion.</p>

During a meeting with his colleagues in India, Moscow’s top diplomat also discussed the similar initiative within BRICS.</strong></p>
<h2>Sergey Lavrov Convinced SCO Countries Will Switch to National Currencies, Won’t Rule Out Single Fiat</h2>
<p>There is understanding about increasing the use of national currencies in settlements between the member states of the SCO, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov said after conferring with counterparts in Panaji, capital of the Indian state of Goa.</p>
<p>To achieve that, Lavrov believes participants can apply practices that are being formed in the Eurasian Development Bank, the Asian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the New Development Bank established by the BRICS bloc.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this was discussed. All of this is very relevant. All this is now being considered by the relevant departments, ministries of finance, central banks,” Lavrov was quoted as saying by the Tass news agency. He also emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>This work is underway, and, in general, it cannot be stopped.</p></blockquote>
<p>The head of the Russian diplomacy also reminded about the proposal put forward by President of Brazil Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the transition towards payments in national currencies in the BRICS group of emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).</p>
<p>The topic has been also discussed at the SCO meeting, including the creation of “some kind of aggregated currency” which, in Lavrov’s words, cannot be ruled out either.</p>
<p>“The main thing now is to consider practical issues that will make it possible to protect the cooperation of independent states,” he said, accusing the West of abusing its position in the global economy and the reserve currency status of the U.S. dollar and the euro.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://eng.sectsco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCO</a>, the world’s largest regional organization which unites China, Russia, India, Pakistan, and several Central Asian nations, is preparing to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/syria-urges-brics-to-lead-in-ditching-dollar-talks-yuan-adoption-with-china/">ditch the dollar</a> in favor of settlements in the national currencies of members, its Deputy Secretary General Grigory Logvinov <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worlds-largest-regional-organization-to-switch-to-settlements-in-national-currencies/">unveiled</a> in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Despite intentions to move away from the greenback, however, the introduction of a common currency is not yet being considered by its members, the Russian diplomat noted. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">BRICS</a>, arguably the world’s largest bloc by gross domestic product (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-emerges-as-the-worlds-largest-gdp-bloc-propelled-by-chinas-rapid-expansion/">GDP</a>), also intends to initially <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-to-promote-national-currencies-before-issuing-common-one/">promote</a> the use of its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currencies-to-have-no-alternative-former-russian-president-medvedev-says/">national currencies</a>.</p>

<h2>Voyager Digital Expects Initial Distributions to Creditors ‘Within the Next Few Weeks’</h2>
<p>Voyager Digital has published an update for creditors. According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/VoyagerUCC/status/1654203057591267329?s=20">tweet</a> from the firm on May 4, 2023, they may be able to expect some cash or crypto back &#8220;in a few weeks.&#8221; This update comes after a long and difficult journey for the TSX-listed crypto lender. Last year on July 1, 2022, Voyager Digital <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tsx-listed-voyager-digital-temporarily-suspends-trading-deposits-and-withdrawals/">halted withdrawals</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/voyager-files-for-bankruptcy-citing-contagion-in-crypto-markets-three-arrows-capitals-loan-default/">filed for bankruptcy</a> just days later. Since then, the defunct business has been navigating the bankruptcy process after it was almost acquired by Binance US.</p>
<p>After Binance US <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-pulls-the-plug-voyager-purchase-deal-falls-through/">backed out of the deal</a>, the crypto lender has been left to navigate the bankruptcy process in the Southern District of New York in order to reimburse creditors. But despite the challenges, Voyager Digital says it is making progress. In the tweet on Thursday, the firm explained that they are &#8220;in the process of finalizing liquidation procedures.&#8221; Voyager also reminded creditors that the liquidation procedures must be filed before the plan can go into effect.</p>

<p>While Voyager is moving forward with their plan to reimburse creditors, there&#8217;s still a chance for objections. According to the firm, parties will have ten full days to object to the plan. If no objections are filed, Voyager intends to go &#8220;effective&#8221; with the plan at that time. However, if an objection is filed, the court will hold a hearing to consider the objection before the plan can go into effect. The plan had a clause that explained what would happen if the Binance US deal fell through, which allowed Voyager to begin liquidating assets.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://twitter.com/VoyagerUCC/status/1654203061277949952?s=20">stated</a> on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors. We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The news of Voyager Digital&#8217;s plan to reimburse creditors has been met with mixed reactions. While many customers are pleased with the progress, others are feeling frustrated. One person <a href="https://twitter.com/NoLimitAlski/status/1654203694945017856?s=20">responded</a> that customers wanted their assets “last August and July.&#8221; Another individual <a href="https://twitter.com/JOSHREKT/status/1654216255522447360?s=20">stressed</a> on Twitter, &#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; And yet another person <a href="https://twitter.com/tvch2/status/1654250696152174599?s=20">added</a>, &#8220;No one, I repeat no one, file an objection! Ok!&#8221;</p>
