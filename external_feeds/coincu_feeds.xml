<p>Specifically, the developer nicknamed Shytoshi Kusama told his 864,000 Twitter followers that the <strong>Shibarium will be coming &#8220;very soon&#8221; but that it will not be launched during the New Year holiday.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Some community members have speculated that this implies that the development of Shibarium is complete and is just waiting for the right time to roll out, or that it will hit the market early next year.</p>



<p>As the event is highly anticipated by the community, this is not the first time that the developers of Shibarium have hinted at its launch. <strong>Shibarium is a blockchain scaling solution that addresses the low transaction speeds of Shiba Inu&#8217;s Ethereum (ETH) server chain</strong>. Shibarium will also introduce new features, such as <strong>burning of SHIB tokens</strong>, which can<strong> increase the value of the meme crypto asset</strong>.</p>



<p>As was updated in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/102126-shibarium-public-beta-launch-in-q3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous Coincu News articles</a>, in July Shiba developers are developing their own ecosystem second layer protocol, <strong>Shibarium announced this protocol will support implementation and develop native apps, including a GAS token called BONE</strong>. Shibarium is slated to utilize BONE, another token in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, for gas fees. BONE is the governance token of ShibaSwap, the native decentralized exchange (DEX) of the Shiba Inu project. BONE allows users to vote on upcoming proposals.</p>

<p><strong>The team is building its own metaverse project with 100,000 pieces of land as virtual real estate</strong> and collectible card games that will be included in Shiba&#8217;s metaverse.</p>



<p>Competitor Dogecoin Ecosystem (DOGE) is also anticipating the release of its own metaverse.</p>



<p>Currently, <strong>SHIB is trading at $0.0000083 and ranks 15th among the most owned cryptocurrencies in the world.</strong></p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies have lately gained worldwide traction. Countries of all sizes are attempting to digitalize their economy and include blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Several central banks are attempting to develop their own digital currencies, <strong>while others are attempting to introduce stablecoins.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Palau is the most recent country to join the bandwagon</strong>. Palau is an island nation and a microstate with a population of only 20,000 people. Surangel Whipps Jr., the president of Palau, revealed significant insights regarding the country&#8217;s digitization and the eventual adoption of blockchain in one of the most recent <a href="https://bizzabo.engage-live.co.uk/bloomberg/L21+ASEAN/Panel_Web_3.0_2.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bizzabo.engage-live.co.uk/bloomberg/L21+ASEAN/Panel_Web_3.0_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviews </a>with Bloomberg.</p>



<p>He indicated that they intend to deploy<strong> the stablecoin short</strong>ly, making payments easier and safer.</p>



<p>Whipps Jr. also discussed CZ&#8217;s (Binance CEO) recent visit to the nation and their discussions about how to utilize Binance Pay to make payments easier for the country&#8217;s digital population.</p>

<p><strong>Gemini </strong>is one of the larger exchanges that does not currently support Cardano trading on its platform. The exchange, which now accepts more than 110 currencies, the bulk of which have a smaller market cap than Cardano, has been <strong>slow to add ADA, but founder Charles Hoskinson is not concerned.</strong></p>



<p>Hoskinson informed that the digital asset was not listed on the Gemini cryptocurrency market. <strong>Recalling the difficulty that Gemini ran with its Earn program</strong> <strong>when Genesis Digital Trading halted withdrawals and was rumored to be on the verge of bankruptcy</strong>. In turn, Gemini had to halt its Earn program, and Genesis is said to owe the exchange $900 million in user assets.</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Hoskinson compares this to FTX</strong>, which did not include ADA for trade as well. FTX planned to launch the cryptocurrency approximately a month before it went bankrupt, thus <strong>no ADA coins were lost when the exchange declared bankruptcy</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">We are still not listed on Gemini,” Hoskinson stated. “Turns out that’s probably a good thing cause FTX didn’t list us either.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite being viewed as an afterthought by a number of prominent exchanges in the past, <strong>Cardano remains one of the market&#8217;s most powerful cryptocurrencies</strong>. With a market valuation of more than <strong>$9 billion</strong>, it is now the ninth-largest cryptocurrency, despite the token losing a significant portion of its value.</p>



<p><strong>ADA reached an all-time high price of $3.10 in 2021</strong>, but it has since lost more than <strong>91% of its worth</strong>. As a result, it is one of the top losers among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The price is presently consolidating between<strong> $0.24 and $0.26</strong>, with no hint of a breakthrough on the horizon.</p>

<p>ADA is trading at<strong> $0.265</strong> at the time of this writing. It is up <strong>4.53%</strong> in the last 7 days and <strong>2.13%</strong> in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>There is still significant resistance at the<strong> $0.0265</strong> level, where bears took their stronghold during Friday&#8217;s rise. To see gains before the end of the year, ADA must break and establish support above <strong>$0.265</strong>, else a poor finish is the most likely scenario.</p>

<h5><strong>According to research by blockchain analytics vendor OKLink, the Bitkeep vulnerability that happened on December 26 employed phishing sites to trick users into installing fraudulent wallets.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>The attacker created a number of fictitious Bitkeep websites that each hosted an APK file that seemed to be Bitkeep wallet version 7.2.9</strong>. Users&#8217; private keys or seed words were taken when they &#8220;updated&#8221; their wallets by downloading the malicious file, and they were delivered to the attacker.</p>



<p>Previously, Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155628-oklink-bitkeep-hack-total-loss/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/155628-oklink-bitkeep-hack-total-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>that on-chain data services provider OKLink has made public the total loss that was caused by the BitKeep hack, which is close to $31 Million with 50 different hacker addresses.</p>

<p>The malicious software grabbed the users&#8217; keys in an unencrypted form, although the report did not specify how. <strong>As part of the &#8220;upgrade,&#8221; it may have only required the customers to re-enter their seed words</strong>, which the program could have recorded and forwarded to the attacker.</p>



<p>After obtaining users&#8217; private keys, <strong>the attacker unstacked all assets and transferred all funds to five wallets under their command</strong>. From there, they attempted to withdraw part of the money via centralized exchanges: 2 Ethereum (ETH) and 100 USDC were sent to Binance, and 21 ETH were sent to Changenow.</p>

<p><strong>Five networks were affected by the attack: BNB Chain, Tron, Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Chain bridges</strong>. Some of the coins were connected to Ethereum via the bridges Biswap, Nomiswap, and Apeswap. The hack resulted in the theft of cryptocurrency valued at over $13 million in total.</p>

<p>Solana is a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain that allows project developers to create DApps, currencies, and smart contracts. Like BscScan and EtherScan, Solana offers a specialized block explorer named SolScan. </p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">What is SolScan?</h1>



<p><strong>SolScan is a blockchain explorer used to search through information on the Solana blockchain</strong>. It’s a popular alternative to the official Solana explorer. SolScan turns complex transactional data into simple ones. The block explorer provides access to anything recorded on-chain, including crypto <strong>transactions, addresses, smart contracts, blocks, tokens, and more.</strong> </p>



<p>Notably, it’s free to use and doesn’t require an account, but you can create one and log in for enhanced functionality.</p>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Why should I use SolScan?</strong></h2>



<p>Using a blockchain explorer can help seek where your staked funds have gone, or perhaps a transaction is still pending. Basically, users can use SolScan to find out what’s happened. </p>



<p><strong>All information on SolScan comes directly from the Solana blockchain</strong>, so users can be sure of the accuracy. </p>



<p>SolScan uses the same format as EtherScan. Many users prefer its layout to Solana’s official explorer. <strong>It’s all free to use and contains several tools, lists, and analytical graphs</strong>. The explorer also contains a set of public APIs that can leverage real-time data from SolScan into custom, third-party applications, and tools.</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">How to look up transactions and addresses on SolScan?</h1>



<p>The search capability for transactions and addresses is one of SolScan&#8217;s most popular features. Users can easily obtain a vast quantity of information by using the right hash. Transaction costs, confirmations, timestamps, addresses involved, and other details are all included.</p>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Transactions</strong></h2>



<p>1. Every Solana transaction is signed and logged on the Solana mainnet. The following is a lengthy string of numbers and letters sample:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>5JLcGJQfZjEEuh1bSDqyw2iEfLuFRoYRJY1paoSwrZC8c8zZFW3VqvxsJgjW3bsUjTrpEUDEtvs83PxsuR6hUWqz</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>2. Copy and paste the signature into the SolScan search field and press enter.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2034.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="657" height="165" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2034.png" alt="What Is SolScan And Its 5 Useful Function" class="wp-image-155710" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2034.png 657w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2034-300x75.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" title="What Is SolScan And Its 5 Useful Functions 20"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>3. You’ll now see all available information about the transaction. This is divided into three categories: </p>



<ol>
<li>Overview</li>



<li>SOL Balance Change</li>



<li>Token Balance Change</li>
</ol>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2035.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="657" height="340" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2035.png" alt="What Is SolScan And Its 5 Useful Function" class="wp-image-155711" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2035.png 657w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2035-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" title="What Is SolScan And Its 5 Useful Functions 21"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>4. The <strong>Overview </strong>category will have most of the details. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Signature</td><td>An alphanumeric string uniquely assigned to each transaction. It’s an identifier similar to Ethereum’s&nbsp;Transaction Hash&nbsp;or&nbsp;TxID.</td></tr><tr><td>Block</td><td>The block number your transaction was processed in. These numbers are sequential and indicate your transaction’s placement within the blockchain’s history.</td></tr><tr><td>Timestamp</td><td>The timestamp associated with the block in which your transaction was processed.</td></tr><tr><td>Result</td><td>The transaction’s confirmation status.</td></tr><tr><td>Signer</td><td>The wallet address that initiated the transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>Fee</td><td>The fee paid for the transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>Main Actions</td><td>An overview of the activities associated with the transaction.</td></tr><tr><td>Previous Block Hash</td><td>The alphanumeric hash to identify the previous block.</td></tr><tr><td>Instruction Details</td><td>A detailed log of the transaction’s actions.</td></tr><tr><td>Program Log</td><td>A detailed log of the instructions/actions results.</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure>



<p>5. The <strong>SOL Balance Change</strong> and <strong>Token Balance Change</strong> tabs provide data on the transaction’s token balance changes for all parties involved.</p>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Addresses</strong></h2>



<p>Users can check a detailed history of the address&#8217;s activities. This can give users an overview of the transactions and smart contract interactions of a particular wallet.</p>



<p>1. Find the Solana address to look at. It’s shorter than a signature and looks something like this:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>138KHwTqKNWGLoo8fK5i8UxYtwoC5tC8o7M9rY1CDEjT</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>2. Copy and paste the address into SolScan’s search bar and hit Enter.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>3. All available information about the account will be displayed in detail. The <strong>Overview section</strong> shows current account balances, while the bottom tabs deal mainly with transaction history.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2037.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="657" height="281" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2037.png" alt="What Is SolScan And Its 5 Useful Function" class="wp-image-155713" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2037.png 657w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2037-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" title="What Is SolScan And Its 5 Useful Functions 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">How to find tokens on SolScan?</h1>



<p>Tokens are easily verified on SolScan, and their data are displayed in full. All you have to do is:</p>



<p>1. Enter the token address into SolScan&#8217;s search field by copying and pasting it. We utilized a wrapped version of Bitcoin (BTC) in this example, but you may also use a wrapped version of Ethereum (ETH) or any other SPL-token on the Solana network.</p>



<p>The token address looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>9n4nbM75f5Ui33ZbPYXn59EwSgE8CGsHtAeTH5YFeJ9E</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>2. After users entered the address, users would see the following information.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Tokens</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Fully Diluted Market Cap</td><td>This is the max total supply multiplied by the token’s current price. It’s called diluted because it also includes locked tokens.</td></tr><tr><td>Max Total Supply</td><td>The total number of tokens that will ever exist for a particular cryptocurrency, whether previously mined or issued in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>Holders</td><td>The number of addresses holding the token.</td></tr><tr><td>Social Channels</td><td>Links to the token’s official social media channels.</td></tr><tr><td>Token name</td><td>The name and ticker of the token in the format: [token name (TICKER)].</td></tr><tr><td>Token address</td><td>Unique alphanumeric address assigned as an identifier for each token.</td></tr><tr><td>Owner Program</td><td>A class type and unique ID indicating the specific owner program responsible for reading and writing data to the blockchain.</td></tr><tr><td>Authority</td><td>The account (usually multi-signature) that has authority to validate transactions within the network.</td></tr><tr><td>Decimals</td><td>How divisible a single token is (the number of decimals allowed).</td></tr><tr><td>Tags</td><td>Descriptive tags used to indicate the nature of the token.

<p>The <strong>Defrost</strong> team said on <strong>December</strong> <strong>25</strong> that the initial attack used a flash loan to siphon money from its <strong>V2</strong> product. The owner key was used to exploit V1 in a second, more significant attack. The leveraged trade protocol on the <strong>Avalanche</strong> blockchain didn&#8217;t specify how much money had been taken.</p>

<p>When developers construct and set up a liquidity pool and then take the money out and vanish after investors have purchased the associated token, this is known as a <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155339-defrost-finance-hacked-to-rug-pull-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rug pull</a> or exit scam.

<p>Cronje, who previously developed protocols including Yearn.finance and Keep3rV1, also said that he took a position on the boards of both Fantom Foundation Ltd and Fantom Operations Ltd, which manage the ecosystem for the named directed acrylic graph.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Our overarching objective over the next 12 months will be towards creating an environment for dapp developers to build out sustainable businesses, while differentiating ourselves from other layer 1 solutions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Gas monetization, which would enable revenue sharing for decentralized apps, or DApps, as a development incentive, is a crucial component of Cronje&#8217;s 2023 Fantom plan</strong>. Additionally, using gas subsidies, Fantom DApps might communicate without a wallet being required to cover the gas costs on its own. Users are not required to have or be aware of FTM during onboarding, according to Cronje.</p>

<p>The distinction between smart contracts and externally held accounts will be <strong>eliminated as part of the &#8220;gas reform&#8221; process</strong> so that anybody may start a transaction and pay for gas. On the protocol, other tokens besides FTM would also be acceptable for usage as gas costs.</p>



<p><strong>Cronje intends to concentrate on creating the Fantom Virtual Machine and a new storage mechanism</strong> in terms of future innovations. Cronje wrote on the protocol&#8217;s financial administration as follows:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">As has been communicated publicly, we are in a very sustainable and healthy position given the current economic climate, and especially compared to 2018. This is finally one threat to our existence we do not have to be too concerned about.</p>

<p>Decentralized applications, both new and old, could be launched and made profitable with the aid of the app. Integrating communication is essential today since users depend on it so heavily as technology advances. </p>



<p>By providing on-chain communication and notifications, Dapps boost retention while also resolving other issues with discoverability and visibility. This provides customers with a seamless experience and aids projects in creating a community around their products.</p>



<p>The app is a decentralized app store that is open-source in order to increase adoption in the market. Similar to how the internet is invisible to you while you read this, the goal is to make <strong>Web3</strong> invisible to users. It provides developers with a better set of tools for attracting and keeping customers as well as a better means of monetizing their applications so that <strong>Web2</strong> developers can establish themselves in the Web3 environment.</p>

<p>Vauld&#8217;s founder and CEO, <strong>Darshan</strong> <strong>Bathija</strong>, stated in an email to the company&#8217;s creditors that conversations with Nexo have regrettably fallen through.</p>



<p>Further investigation finds that <strong>Nexo</strong> attempted to buy <strong>BlockFi</strong> and <strong>Celsius</strong>, two additional crypto companies. However, those transactions also failed. In the end, the businesses turned down the offer. <strong>Vauld</strong> is the third company to leave the crypto lender in less than six months.</p>



<p>An acquisition negotiation&#8217;s submission of a due diligence report is one of the negotiations. The report demonstrates a thorough analysis of the company conducted before the merger. According to an email from Vauld management to customers, <strong>Nexo</strong> <strong>failed to submit the required diligence.</strong></p>

<p>Early in <strong>July</strong> of this year, <strong>Vauld</strong> stopped allowing client withdrawals. After that, <strong>Nexo</strong> and <strong>Vauld</strong> began discussing a possible acquisition and conducting due diligence. <strong>Bathija</strong> revealed in a tweet on <strong>July 5 </strong>that the crypto lender would be purchasing <strong>Vauld</strong>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The completion of this transaction is pending due diligence &#8211; which both teams are working on as we speak. <br><br>Vauld has strived to deliver long term value to all customers, and we believe coming under the <a href="https://twitter.com/Nexo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Nexo</a> umbrella will significantly help achieve this.</p>&mdash; Darshan Bathija (@darshanbathija) <a href="https://twitter.com/darshanbathija/status/1544258908843257856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 5, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The possible acquisition was put on hold after the due diligence phase was prolonged twice. According to reports, <strong>Nexo</strong> <strong>twice presented Vauld with the potential agreement terms</strong>, but Vauld felt that the proposal would not be in the best interests of all the creditors. <strong>Vauld</strong> also believed the crypto lender wasn&#8217;t being honest enough about its financial situation.</p>

<p>Furious <strong>Vauld</strong> investors are blaming <strong>Nexo</strong> for their current predicament, and the<strong> $300 million</strong> market cap crypto powerhouse may soon face a bank run.</p>



<p>Customers of <strong>Vauld</strong> were expecting that this acquisition would protect their assets while the company might disintegrate.</p>
