<ul><li>Ripple has filed a response in anticipation of an interlocutory appeal by the SEC.&nbsp;</li><li>The securities regulator is likely to request Judge Torres and the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals for an interlocutory appeal.&nbsp;</li><li>Ripple and its executives have opposed the anticipated appeal citing the failure of such an appeal to satisfy the prerequisites.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-appeal-ripple-ruling-xrp-do-kwon/">Ripple</a> has filed a response ahead of an interlocutory appeal expected from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its legal battle against the crypto giant. Ripple’s opposition to the securities regulator’s anticipated interlocutory appeal comes a month after it was handed a partial victory following the summary judgment on July 13, 2023. </p>



<h2><strong>Ripple: Immediate Appeal Won’t Terminate The Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>The law firm representing Ripple sent a <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/kihuQOR/latest-file-3-pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">letter</a> to Judge Analisa Torres, who is overseeing the lawsuit, to oppose the SEC’s anticipated motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal for the court’s July 13 order which granted the crypto firm’s summary judgment. </p>



<p>An interlocutory appeal is filed to appeal a ruling by a trial court amid ongoing proceedings for other aspects of the case. In other words, an interlocutory appeal is sought to appeal a certain ruling before a final judgment is passed by the court. </p>



<p>James Murphy, a popular crypto lawyer on X (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1683817505100374016" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> last month that an interlocutory appeal from the SEC was likely. According to Murphy, the mounting political pressure on SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the summary judgment’s potential impact on the SEC’s ongoing high-profile lawsuits against crypto giants Binance and Coinbase could prompt the securities regulator to make such a move. </p>



<p>However, the SEC would need the permission of Judge Torres, as well as the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, to proceed with an interlocutory appeal. This would require the regulator to demonstrate three things: First, the court’s previous ruling involves a controlling question of law. Second, there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion on that question, and lastly, an immediate appeal may advance the termination of the litigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ripple, along with Chief Executive Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen, opposed the anticipated appeal on the grounds that none of the above-mentioned prerequisites would be satisfied in the SEC’s anticipated interlocutory appeal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-justice-token-fatmanterra-ox/">Open Exchange</a> has been hit with a $2.7 million fine by Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). The fine was issued in early May but remains unpaid, which prompted a public notice of fines against OPNX from VARA. The digital assets regulator also fined Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, the disgraced founders of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) who launched Open Exchange earlier this year. </p>



<h2><strong>OPNX May Face Litigation Over Outstanding Fines</strong></h2>



<p>As per an enforcement <a href="https://www.vara.ae/en/regulations/regulatory-notices/vara-notice-of-fines-opnx-exchange/" rel="nofollow noopener">notice</a> circulated by VARA earlier today, OPNX was hit with an AED 10,000,000 fine on May 2, 2023, for a market offense of the Virtual Assets and Related Activities Regulations that were unveiled by the regulator earlier this year. The regulator stated that the fine remained unpaid at the time of publication of the notice. </p>



<p>Additionally, VARA slapped fines of AED 200,000 ($54,450) against each of OPNX’s founders, namely Su Zhu, Kyle Davies, Mark Lamb, and the crypto platform’s Chief Executive Leslie Lamb. The founders were fined for violation of an administrative order related to the regulation of crypto advertising and marketing in the emirate. The fines have been paid in full.&nbsp;</p>



<p>VARA stated that it was mulling over further fines and penalties against OPNX due to failure to pay the fines imposed over three months ago. The digital asset regulator added that it would take any action necessary to recover the fine, including referring the matter to law enforcement agencies or even resorting to litigation&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open Exchange Token (OX), the native token of the derivatives and bankruptcy claims trading platform, lost more than 8% of its value following the news of the fines and potential enforcement action. At the time of writing, OX was trading at $0.065.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase has gained approval from the National Futures Association to offer crypto futures trading.&nbsp;</li><li>The regulatory approval comes nearly two years after the crypto exchange initially submitted an application to the NFA.&nbsp;</li><li>The latest development promoted the company’s share price to hike 5% in pre-market trading.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, has gained regulatory approval to offer crypto futures trading in the country. The approval was granted by the National Futures Association (NFA), a self-regulatory organization overseen by the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), nearly two years after the California-based crypto exchange initially filed an application with it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Taps Into $2.9 Trillion Crypto Derivatives Market</strong></h2>



<p>The regulatory approval from the National Futures Association has made <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-decentralized-l2-network-base/">Coinbase</a> a regulated Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) in the United States. It will be the first crypto-native platform to directly offer spot crypto trading alongside leveraged crypto futures to its users. </p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-financial-markets-inc-secures-fcm-approval-to-bring-regulated" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>, Coinbase described the regulatory approval from the NFA as a critical milestone that reaffirmed its commitment to operate a regulated and compliant business in the country. The exchange had reportedly been working with regulators over the past two years to ensure that its FCM business complied with the CFTC’s consumer protection standards. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Approval for US customers to access regulated crypto derivatives will allow more people to access the crypto economy in the United States in a safe way that helps keep the US at the center of digital innovation.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase’s registration as an FCM paves the way for its debut in the crypto derivatives market, which clocked a whopping $2.95 trillion in March this year. Earlier this year, CCData reported that the market share of crypto derivatives trading rose to an all-time high of 77.6% in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crypto exchange previously identified this market as a critical trader access point, which prompted the acquisition of FairX in 2022, which was later rebranded as Coinbase Derivatives Exchange. This subsidiary has since offered nano BTC and ETH futures contracts for retail investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>News of the regulatory approval to offer crypto futures trading led to a hike of more than 5% in Coinbase’s share price in pre-market trading. The stock soared as high as $84.20.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Federal prosecutors plan to use Caroline Ellison’s personal documents in the lawsuit against Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</li><li>Caroline’s personal documents reportedly prove that the FTX founder misappropriated customer funds.&nbsp;</li><li>The Department of Justice plans to use similar documents from former FTX executives Nishad Signh and Gary Wang.&nbsp;</li><li>The DOJ’s latest filing showed that Ryan Salame will not testify against his former boss SBF.</li></ul>



<p>Federal prosecutors involved with the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Sam Bankman-Fried plan to use the personal documents of Caroline Ellison against the disgraced FTX founder. Ellison served as the chief executive of FTX’s sister firm Alameda Research and was a member of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle aside from being romantically involved with him.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>“Things Sam is Freaking Out About”</strong></h2>



<p>A filing made by federal prosecutors on Monday revealed that among the evidence they planned to use against Sam Bankman-Fried were personal documents from Caroline Ellison which would prove fraud and misappropriation charges leveled against the FTX founder, <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/08/15/caroline-ellison-memo-doj-prosecutors-sam-bankman-fried-ftx/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fortune</a> reported earlier today. </p>



<p>Monday’s filing, which sought to establish the evidence that would be permissible in the trial, showed that prosecutors planned to use certain to-do lists and personal notes to strengthen their case against Bankman-Fried. Among the personal notes, is an entry titled “Things Sam Is Freaking Out About,” which reportedly proves that the former FTX CEO illegally used the funds of FTX customers to fill a multi-billion dollar hole in Alameda’s balance sheet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF’s concerns laid out in Ellison’s personal documents included the negative media attention that FTX’s relationship with Alameda Research drew. Federal prosecutors have also secured a covert recording from Ellison that predates the dramatic implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire. The recording is from an all-hands meeting that was held on November 9, where Ellison can be heard stating that Alameda had been borrowing funds from FTX on Bankman-Fried’s directions.</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors are reportedly planning to use similar personal documents from former FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh. Ellison, Singh, and Wang have all pled guilty to charges stemming from FTX’s collapse and are set to testify against their former boss. However, former CEO of FTX Digital Markets, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-ryan-salame-plea-deal-prosecutors/">Ryan Salame</a>, is planning to invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, meaning that he will not be testifying against SBF. </p>

<ul><li>Binance has announced that it will delist Serum (SRM), Sonm (SNM), and DFI.Money (YFII) on August 22, 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>The news of the delisting has led to double-digit declines in the price of the tokens.&nbsp;</li><li>Bitget has suspended SRM, SNM, and YFII deposits with immediate effect in anticipation of massive transfers from Binance.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance announced earlier today that it would delist and cease trading on all trading pairs for Serum (SRM), Sonm (SNM), and DFI.Money (YFII), starting August 22, 2023. The world’s largest crypto exchange’s decision to delist the tokens led to double-digit declines in their prices, with one tanking as much as 50% within minutes of the announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Bitget Suspends SRM, SNM &amp; YFII Deposits In Response To Binance</strong></h2>



<p>Binance published a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-delist-snm-srm-and-yfii-on-2023-08-22-f43511a4c1d347a8a2dd1efbdd2fe716" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> on its official website earlier today, which stated that the decision to delist the tokens was taken following a periodic review of all listed crypto assets on the platform. The crypto exchange made its decision based on several factors, including the commitment of the team to the project, level and quality of development activity, network stability, and trading volume and liquidity among other things. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When a coin or token no longer meets this standard or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it. We believe this best protects all our users.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Following its delisting from <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/doj-fraud-charges-binance-bnb-down-4/">Binance</a>, Serum (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serum/#Markets" rel="nofollow noopener">SRM</a>) proceeded to tank more than 25%, reaching as low as $0.538. The token’s daily trading volume skyrocketed 259% as traders rushed to market dump their holdings. Sonm (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sonm-bep20/" rel="nofollow noopener">SNM</a>) lost a whopping 51% of its value, sinking to a nearly 1-year low of $0.138. Similar to SRM, SNM’s trading volume jumped 800% likely due to traders scrambling to offload their holdings. DFI.Money (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance-ii/" rel="nofollow noopener">YFII</a>) had the most dramatic decline of all, tanking nearly 65% to a 2-month low of $579. </p>



<p>Crypto exchange Bitget announced earlier today that it had suspended SRM, SNM, and YFII deposits with immediate effect. The decision was likely made in anticipation of the traders attempting to transfer their tokens from Binance in order to eventually dump them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>London-based asset manager Jacobi has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230815404630/en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230815404630/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listed</a> a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Europe two years after the company received approval from regulators. </p>



<p>Jacobi was approved to list its Jacobi FT Wilshere Bitcoin ETF in Amsterdam in 2021. However, the firm delayed its debut till 2023 due to crypto crashes like Terra and Three Arrows Capital which happened last year.</p>



<p>The ETF launched with Flow Traders as a market-making partner while Fidelity Digital Assets is in charge of custody for the fund. Jacobi&#8217;s ETF trading under the ticker BCOIN is regulated by Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC). </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Unlike other products in the European market which are debt instruments, our fund owns the underlying asset directly. Jacobi is proud to be supported by Tier1 partners at the forefront of this digital asset market evolution whilst also pioneering an innovative, environmentally sound solution for European investors.”</p><cite>&#8211; <strong>CEO of Jacobi Asset Management, Martin Bednal</strong></cite></blockquote>



<h2>US Spot Bitcoin ETF Await Approval</h2>



<p>Jacobi&#8217;s launch in Amsterdam means that Europe approved and listed a spot Bitcoin ETF ahead of the U.S. despite clear interest from American issuers. </p>



<p>Indeed, titans like Valkyrie and Fidelity filed for spot Bitcoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Blackrock led a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/pretty-standard-ark-21shares-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/pretty-standard-ark-21shares-bitcoin-etf/" rel="noreferrer noopener">swathe of applications</a> after the company submitted its filing in June. </p>



<p>Notably, these filings buoyed by Blackrock&#8217;s filing proposed a surveillance-sharing agreement to mitigate market manipulation, a major concern cited by the SEC in past spot Bitcoin ETF rejections.</p>



<p>If approved, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said the U.S. could account for 99.5%&nbsp; of the world&#8217;s trading volume for crypto ETFs. </p>

<p>Authorities <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-heads-brooklyn-jail-notorious-poor-conditions-2023-08-14/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-heads-brooklyn-jail-notorious-poor-conditions-2023-08-14/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">transferred</a> former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried to a federal jail in Brooklyn after a U.S. revoked SBF&#8217;s $250 million bail bond. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried was moved to Brooklyn&#8217;s Metropolitan Detention Center  (MDC) ahead of his trial starting in October. SBF&#8217;s previously lived at his parents&#8217; home in Palo Alto, California until last week. </p>



<p>Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled to cancel SBF&#8217;s bail conditions after reviewing arguments on his alleged witness tampering. Prosecutors raised complaints after Bankman-Fried leaked Caroline Ellison&#8217;s private diary to the New York Times. His lawyers subsequently asked the court to seal the dairy, a move that puzzled observers while the Justice Department <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/doj-sam-bankman-fried-jail-nyt-article/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/doj-sam-bankman-fried-jail-nyt-article/" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued</a> for jail time. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyers <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-appeal-remand-arrest/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-appeal-remand-arrest/" rel="noreferrer noopener">appealed</a> Judge Kaplan&#8217;s decision to revoke bail shortly after his arrest. However, SBF will likely prepare his defense from a federal prison cell.</p>



<p>Inmates of Brooklyn&#8217;s MDC like former president of Honduras Juan Orlando Hernandez and exiled Asian businessman Guo Wengui both described the prison as dangerous. This is the second prison Bankman-Fried has checked into since FTX&#8217;s collapse. </p>



<p>SBF was previously held at the Fox Hill Prison in the Bahamas, another prison notorious for its poor conditions. </p>



<h2>Charges Against Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>Prosecutors charged SBF on 12 counts including fraud following the crash of FTX last November. Authorities dialed back on campaign finance violation charges due to an issue with Sam&#8217;s extradition papers from the Bahamas. This particular charge was not included in the agreement, per reports. </p>



<p>SBF&#8217;s trial is scheduled to begin on October 2 in what experts say is the biggest fraud case in America&#8217;s history. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following significant coin distribution between February 2021 and May 2022, Cardano [ADA] investors that hold over 100,000 ADA coins have again begun accumulating the crypto asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Santiment, these investors have continued to “fill their bags” with ADA despite the steady decline in the altcoin’s value. The coin shaved off 35% of its market capitalization in the last four months. At press time, this was $10.16 billion, making it the eighth-largest crypto asset in terms of market capitalization.</span></p>

However, the sharks &amp; whales haven&#39;t been as deterred as one may think.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since this cohort of ADA investors began accumulating the coin, its value has dropped by 69%. As of May 2022, ADA traded above $0.7. At press time, it exchanged hands for under $0.3. </span></p>
<h3><b>ADA is on a loss-making streak</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On-chain assessment of how profitable ADA has been as a digital asset in the last year revealed that the majority of holders have failed to turn profits since April 2022. According to <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/Y67Rvd5H__sCl" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Santiment</a>, the coin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio turned negative on 7 April that year and remained below the center line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This metric tracks the ratio between an asset’s current price and the average price of its every coin/token acquired. A high MVRV ratio indicates that the asset is overvalued, while a low MVRV ratio indicates that it is undervalued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At -51.36% at press time, it meant that if all holders sold ADA at its current value, more than half of them would realize losses.</span></p>

This figure represents 89% of all coin holders, as only 10.26% of all addresses holding ADA are at a profit.</span></p>

<h4><b>No rally in sight</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its price declining further, daily traders have continued to distribute ADA. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 42.99 at press time, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 23.67, almost oversold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both key indicators resting beneath their center lines since the month started showed a momentum shift from buy-side to sell-side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bears controlled the ADA market at press time with the positive directional index (green) beneath the negative directional index (red). </span></p>

<h2>Short-Lived BALD Hype On Base</h2>



<p>BALD, a memecoin seemingly inspired by the distinct haircut of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, achieved overnight success before crashing to ruin. The token grew to over $80 million in market cap and became popular on Base, the L2 network backed by Armstrong&#8217;s crypto exchange Coinbase. </p>



<p>Base is also the first decentralized network <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-decentralized-l2-network-base/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-decentralized-l2-network-base/" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> by a publicly traded company domiciled in the U.S.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-1024x576.png" alt="Base-BALD Deployer Bridges $12.9 Million To Ethereum, Moves 2,100 ETH To Kraken 17" class="wp-image-583654" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-1024x576.png 1024w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-300x169.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-770x433.png 770w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-1536x864.png 1536w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-269x151.png 269w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-746x420.png 746w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-1376x774.png 1376w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Base-BALD Deployer Bridges $12.9 Million To Ethereum, Moves 2,100 ETH To Kraken 22"><figcaption><strong>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although moving funds to Base worked through a one-way portal, degens speculated on BALD&#8217;s price ascending higher. Holders were left struck out after the token deployer suddenly <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" rel="noreferrer noopener">withdrew liquidity</a> in an apparent rug pull. The coin&#8217;s price declined afterward and never recovered. </p>



<p>Regarding the identity of the mysterious BALD deployer, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT shared clues pointing to a pseudonymous user known as @milkyway16eth. The suspected individual sent $50,000 in crypto to another in 2021 with the same addresses used to deploy BALD&#8217;s smart contract. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not proven or confirmed that @milkyway16eth is indeed the BALD deploy, although the user went private after the info came to light. </p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s legal defense team has appealed his remand to jail less than an hour after his bail was revoked by a Manhattan judge. The disgraced <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-ryan-salame-plea-deal-prosecutors/">FTX</a> founder was handcuffed and escorted out of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York earlier today after federal Judge Lewis Kaplan remanded him into custody ahead of his trial, which is set to begin on October 2, 2023. </p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried Jailed For Witness Tampering</strong></h2>



<p>Inner City Press <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690106507436646400" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today that Judge Kaplan remanded Sam Bankman-Fried to jail due to his attempts to tamper with a key witness in the Department of Justice’s case against him. The judge also highlighted the FTX founder’s decision to leak the private writings of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison with the New York Times last month. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“In view of the evidence, my conclusion is that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has attempted to tamper with witnesses at least twice…” </p><cite>SDNY Judge Lewis A. Kaplan</cite></blockquote>



<p>After Bankman-Fried’s bail was revoked, he was handcuffed by U.S. Marshals and escorted out of the courtroom. As for Bankman-Fried’s jail arrangements, Assistant United States Attorney Danielle Sassoon proposed that he be held at the Putnam County Correctional Facility in New York and the Manhattan Detention Center during his trial. </p>

<p>Within an hour of Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail revocation and subsequent arrest, his legal defense team led by Mark Cohen appealed his remand to jail. Cohen had previously stated his intent to appeal and asked Judge Kaplan for a written order of bail revocation for the same. According to Inner City Press, an electronic filing for the appeal has been made, complete with a filing fee of $505.&nbsp;</p>
