<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-accused-of-deliberately-flouting-laws-by-cftc-chief/">Binance</a>, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, has recently laid off a portion of its workforce amidst a decline in its market share. In response to a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1663890209526927373">Wu Blockchain</a> regarding the layoffs, a Binance spokesperson explained that the company periodically reviews its talent allocation to ensure optimal team composition and resource allocation. <br /><br />Consequently, some employees who are underperforming or not fitting the organizational culture may be let go.<br /><br />The spokesperson clarified that this move is not a case of rightsizing, but rather a reevaluation of the expertise and talent required in critical roles. <br /><br />Binance intends to fill hundreds of open positions to align with the evolving demands of users and regulators. Although the exact number of employees affected was not disclosed, the exchange confirmed that it had a headcount of around 8,000 before the layoffs.<br /><br />Interestingly, these layoffs follow Binance&#8217;s previous statement in March, where they stated they had no plans for layoffs and were actively seeking to fill 500 additional positions by the end of June. Even now, Binance still has over 300 open positions advertised on its website.<br /><br />In January, Binance&#8217;s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, expressed plans to increase staff numbers by 15% to 30% in 2023, stating their commitment to building and preparing for the next bull market. However, recent reports have indicated a declining market share for Binance, coinciding with decreasing trading volumes. It is worth noting that regulatory actions taken against Binance and Zhao in the United States in March might have contributed to this decline.<br /><br />Responding to concerns about the layoffs, Zhao mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1663945939482968075">Twitter</a> that Binance follows a program called &#8216;bottom out,&#8217; which involves parting ways with individuals who do not align with the company&#8217;s unique culture or situation. He emphasized that this program is an ongoing process and that the company does not have specific targets for employee departures.<br /><br />Despite the layoffs, Binance remains optimistic about the future. The company&#8217;s spokesperson reiterated their commitment to delivering for users and expressed excitement about the growth and innovation within the Binance ecosystem. They also clarified that the layoffs were not cost-cutting measures.<br /><br />Binance spokesperson<a href="https://twitter.com/PRHillmann/status/1663925657611403264?s=20"> Patrick Hillmann</a> further explained on Twitter that the company regularly conducts talent density audits and resource allocation exercises every six months or so. He emphasized that these exercises aim to streamline operations and ensure efficiency within the organization. However, he did not provide a specific number of layoffs, highlighting that the focus is on directing resources where they are needed most.<br /><br />In summary, Binance has decided to lay off a portion of its workforce as it evaluates talent allocation and streamlines operations. Despite the decline in market share and recent regulatory challenges, the company remains committed to its users and is optimistic about its future growth and innovation.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ltc-price-analysis-how-far-will-rapid-whale-accumulation-take-ltc-price-litecoin-ranks-top-payment-option-on-bitpay/">Litecoin</a> is gearing up for its highly anticipated third mining reward halving scheduled for early August. Following this event, the per-block reward paid to miners will be reduced by 50%, from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC. In anticipation of the halving, the twelfth largest cryptocurrency by market value has witnessed significant gains, pushing its price to $92.58.<br /><br />On-chain metrics have also shown positive trends for Litecoin. Data from <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1663472029050306560">IntoTheBlock</a> reveals a surge in the total address count with a balance since the end of April, reaching an impressive 8.5 million LTC addresses with a balance last week. <br /><br />Both new and active address counts have hovered near all-time highs established in February, with new addresses briefly surpassing those of Bitcoin.<br /><br />Crypto-analytic platform<a href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/litecoin-s-ltc20-is-less-than-3-months-out-how-big-of-a-deal-is-it-7307"> Santiment</a> highlights the increased on-chain volume as a strong indicator that significant players are entering the LTC market in anticipation of the halving. They believe this event will have a positive impact on Litecoin&#8217;s price.<br /><br />Furthermore, Litecoin&#8217;s hash rate has remained consistent, experiencing a growth of over 24% since the beginning of the year, reaching 712 TH/s. The mining difficulty stands at 25.12 million hashes, closely aligned with the hash rate.<br /><br />The upcoming halving has also influenced Litecoin&#8217;s futures derivatives contracts, which have <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/LTC">surged</a> by over $420 million globally, resulting in a year-to-date growth of over 20%. This surge in interest has pushed Litecoin Futures&#8217; open interest to its highest level since the beginning of last year.<br /><br />As the halving approaches, Litecoin continues to show promising signs in its on-chain metrics and futures contracts, building anticipation for the event and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>Analytics provider Glassnode has issued a cautionary<a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1663173812781830146"> report</a> in its weekly on-chain analysis, suggesting that <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-btc-might-drop-near-22k-analyst-says-shiba-inu-among-most-searched-cryptocurrencies-in-us/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> is poised for a significant movement after a period of low volume and volatility. Glassnode noted that the recent extended period of minimal volatility and narrow trading ranges is likely to be disrupted shortly.<br /><br />The news of the U.S. government reaching an agreement on the debt ceiling prompted a 4% surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. However, this increase was insufficient to break BTC out of its current tight, range-bound channel that has persisted over the past few weeks. BTC has already started retracing from its minor burst of activity.<br /><br /><a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-22-2023/">Glassnode</a>&#8216;s report also highlighted that digital assets and commodities are undergoing their second corrective upswing of the year, and it observed a closer correlation between these two asset classes in 2023.</p>
<p>The report disclosed that Monthly Realized Volatility has dropped to 34%, falling below the 1-standard deviation Bollinger Band. This level of low volatility has been seen in less than 20% of historical market activity, leading to the logical expectation of increased volatility in the near term.<br /><br />Additionally, transfer volumes remain low, indicating reduced exchange flows. Recent exchange activity has decreased by 27.3% compared to the past six months, further supporting the notion of a phase of equilibrium.<br /><br />The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric, which currently sits at 0.29, reinforces this equilibrium phase. A drop below 0.25 would signify a decline in market profitability, potentially entering the capitulation and recovery phase.<br /><br />Glassnode concluded that the market currently lacks a clear directional pull, suggesting a state of indecisiveness.<br /><br />As of now, BTC has retreated by 0.7% and is cooling off from its Monday high of just over $28,000. Presently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $27,775.<br /><br />Immediate support is anticipated at $27,200, with further support at $26,600. If the expected volatility materializes and leads to another downward movement, the ongoing trend that started in mid-April could result in more short-term losses.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/gemini-launches-global-platform-amidst-us-regulatory-challenges/">Gemini</a>, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, finds itself in a challenging position as it grapples with a decline in market share. The exchange&#8217;s troubles came to light in November 2022 when its partner in the Earn Program, Genesis, filed for bankruptcy, leaving Gemini owed a staggering $765 million. Consequently, on January 10, Gemini decided to discontinue the program.<br /><br />Shortly after, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against both Gemini and Genesis, claiming that the Earn Program involved the sale of unregistered securities. However, Gemini and Genesis recently <a href="https://jfblegal.egnyte.com/dl/EgiiPyjDym">filed</a> to have the SEC&#8217;s case dismissed, arguing that the program does not constitute a security offering.<br /><br />To alleviate financial strain, the Winklevoss twins, the founders of Gemini, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-gemini-exchange-winklevoss-twins-loan-100-million-ftx-funding-2023-4">extended</a> a $100 million loan to the exchange, highlighting the adverse impact of the broader market downturn on Gemini&#8217;s financial performance. While rumors circulated that JPMorgan intended to terminate its partnership with Gemini due to profitability concerns, Gemini Trust Lawyer Charles Harder refuted the claims, stating that the relationship between Gemini and JPMorgan remains intact.<br /><br />In addition to these challenges, an analysis conducted by CCData and reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-29/winklevoss-twins-gemini-crypto-exchange-pivots-after-layoffs-losses-earn">Bloomberg</a> revealed that Gemini&#8217;s cumulative trading volume between January and April 2023 declined by almost 50% compared to the period from September to December 2022. February marked a record low for the company&#8217;s monthly trading volume, accounting for a mere 0.07% of the global spot trading volume. However, this figure improved to 0.12% ($747 million) in April. Despite the recovery, Gemini&#8217;s trading volume in April remained nearly half of what it was a year ago.<br /><br />Meanwhile, competitors such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance experienced growth in their market share in April compared to the previous year. Binance, in particular, dominated the global market with a 46% share, up from 31% a year earlier.<br /><br />Recognizing the challenging regulatory landscape in the United States, Gemini has been actively expanding its presence overseas. In recent developments, the exchange launched its derivatives platform, Gemini Foundation, in 30 countries. Additionally, the Winklevoss twins announced that Dublin, Ireland, will serve as the new European base for the exchange.<br /><br />However, Gemini continues to face regulatory obstacles abroad. Just last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines cautioned that Gemini&#8217;s newly launched derivatives platform is operating without proper approval.<br /><br />Campbell Harvey, a Finance Professor at Duke University, suggested that Gemini could potentially benefit from being acquired by a larger competitor. Harvey emphasized the strong brand associated with the Winklevoss twins and speculated that a merger with Coinbase or Kraken could be conceivable. Nonetheless, the exchange&#8217;s regulatory challenges may impede any such potential deal.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-65197" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbank-300x159.png" alt="blockbank Price Analysis" width="300" height="159" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbank-300x159.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbank-768x407.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbank-750x398.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbank.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The current price of blockbank tokens stands at $0.0022, with a market capitalization of $880,000. Over the past 24 hours, the trading volume has surged by 99% to reach $35,416. Meanwhile, the circulating supply of blockbank tokens is approximately 400 million, which aligns with the total supply of 400 million tokens which means there are no more token unlocks.</p>
<h2>Looking at the Future: Exciting Developments on the Horizon</h2>
<p>blockbank has some exciting features in its pipeline that could potentially stimulate the demand for $BBANK tokens, potentially propelling its price upwards. The most imminent is the launch of the blockbank card, expected to roll out in the next two months. This development could spur increased usage of $BBANK, as users lock tokens to climb the reward tiers and maximize their debit card benefits.</p>
<p>Further, there are also rumors of a lending and borrowing feature being added to blockbank. If realized, this feature would solidify blockbank&#8217;s standing in the DeFi space, potentially driving further demand for $BBANK as users look to take advantage of borrowing and lending opportunities.</p>
<h2>Projecting Potential Returns</h2>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s delve into the hypothetical scenario of a $100 investment in $BBANK, assuming the token price eventually rises to $1. At the current token price of $0.0022, your $100 would get you approximately 45,454 $BBANK tokens. Should $BBANK reach $1, your initial investment would surge to a whopping $45,454.</p>
<p>This means you could pocket a 45,354% profit on your investment.</p>
<h2>The Path Forward: blockbank and Its Promising Prospects</h2>
<p>blockbank represents a significant evolution in the fintech industry, offering a complete financial solution that bridges the gap between traditional banking and DeFi. With the anticipated release of its debit card and potential lending and borrowing features, <a href="https://blockbank.ai/">blockbank</a> is poised to secure its position as a leading player in the digital banking revolution.</p>
<p>However, as with all investments, it&#8217;s essential to conduct thorough research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor. The potential returns may be exciting, but it&#8217;s equally vital to assess the inherent risks. Only invest within your means, and remember the golden rule of investing: never invest more than you&#8217;re prepared to lose.</p>
<p>And last but not the least, <a href="https://bbank.onelink.me/s0LE/ddbitvnm">download the blockbank mobile app</a> or <a href="https://app.blockbank.ai/sign-in">access the blockbank application</a> directly from your browser. Get your KYCs done and start trading like a boss!</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cardanos-defi-industry-might-expand-rapidly-in-2023/">Cardano</a>, a well-known blockchain platform, has experienced an impressive surge of 91% in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume within the past week, as reported by <a href="https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/cardano">DeFiLlama</a> data.<br /><br />The DEX volume on Cardano has now reached a substantial $68.5 million, primarily driven by a notable increase in activity on Cardano-based DEX platforms, particularly Minswap. Minswap, which is the leading DEX on Cardano, witnessed a staggering weekly change of 99.72%.<br /><br />In terms of volume, Minswap accounted for the majority, with $6.91 million in the last 24 hours and $60.52 million over seven days. This impressive figure represents a significant 90.4% of the total DEX volume on the Cardano platform.<br /><br />While other <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cardano-defi-acardex-launches-car-nfts-grants-higher-opportunities-to-its-token-holders/">DEX</a> platforms on Cardano, like WingRiders and SundaeSwap, also contributed to the overall volume, their impact was relatively smaller. Despite the remarkable growth in DEX volume, Cardano&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $91.27 million, which only represents 0.69% of the combined TVL across all platforms.<br /><br />Ethereum maintains its dominance in the DeFi landscape with a TVL of $7.8 billion, accounting for 37.6% of the total. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Arbitrum follow suit with 27.98% and 14.67%, respectively.<br /><br />The surge in DEX volume aligns with a 4.6% increase in the price of Cardano&#8217;s native token, ADA, over the past week. This positive price movement, coupled with the substantial growth in DEX volume, highlights the growing interest and activity within the Cardano ecosystem.</p>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/chinese-law-enforcement-freezes-4000-crypto-bank-accounts-over-illicit-transactions/">Chinese</a> government appears to be shifting its perspective on cryptocurrencies and is now eager to explore the possibilities offered by related sectors. According to local news outlet <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_23250778">The Paper</a>, the government has released a white paper aimed at fostering innovation and development within the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/how-web3-is-shaping-the-future-of-finance/">Web3</a> industry.<br /><br />Titled <em>&#8220;Web3 Innovation and Development White Paper (2023),&#8221;</em> the document was unveiled by the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission (Zhongguancun Chaoyang Park). It emphasizes the inevitability of web3 technology as a future trend in the Internet industry.<br /><br />The white paper focuses on key research areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), XR interactive terminals, and content production tools. It also acknowledges the rapid growth of emerging applications like digital populations and collections.<br /><br />While recognizing the challenges faced in the development of the Internet 3.0 industry in Beijing, including technical capabilities, talent support, and legal norms, the white paper proposes policy changes to address these issues.<br /><br />Yang Hongfu, the director of the Zhongguancun Chaoyang Park management committee, revealed that the Chaoyang district plans to allocate a minimum of 100 million yuan ($14 million) annually until 2025 to support this initiative. Zhongguancun, known as China&#8217;s Silicon Valley, will play a crucial role in driving this ambitious endeavor.<br /><br />The release of the white paper has caught attention, given China&#8217;s history with the cryptocurrency sector. Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, expressed his interest in a <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1662334590332153868">tweet</a>, highlighting the interesting timing of the white paper&#8217;s release alongside the upcoming implementation of crypto regulations in Hong Kong.<br /><br />Recent developments suggest a potential shift in China&#8217;s stance on cryptocurrencies, fueling speculation about a policy change after years of bans. <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1661391542504902664">Zhao noted</a> that the state broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV), aired a segment featuring the Bitcoin logo, which is seen as a significant event. In the past, such coverage has been associated with increased market activity and price surges.<br /><br />The CCTV segment showcased a Bitcoin ATM in Hong Kong, featuring a prominent blue Bitcoin logo and the option to <em>&#8220;Buy Bitcoins,&#8221;</em> further fueling speculation about China&#8217;s evolving perspective on cryptocurrencies.<br /><br />This news is significant, considering the profound impact it carries. In 2021, China implemented a major crackdown on digital assets, particularly mining, which had a substantial impact on the crypto market. However, the market eventually recovered, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high in late 2021.<br /><br />Despite other factors affecting Bitcoin&#8217;s value, such as macroeconomic elements, the cryptocurrency continues to trade below $27,000 and is currently valued at $26,700.</p>

<p>TradeBlock, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), is set to cease operations, as reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-25/digital-currency-group-closes-tradeblock-institutional-platform?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google&amp;sref=3REHEaVI">Bloomberg.</a> <br /><br />A spokesperson from <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/digital-currency-groups-2022-balance-sheet-in-red-with-1-1-billion-loss/">DCG</a> explained that the decision to close down the institutional trading platform side of the business was influenced by the challenging regulatory environment for digital assets in the United States, compounded by the state of the broader economy and the prolonged crypto winter.<br /><br />CoinDesk, another subsidiary of DCG, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210105005308/en/CoinDesk-Acquires-TradeBlock-the-World%E2%80%99s-Leading-Crypto-Index-Provider">acquired</a> TradeBlock in January 2021. Following the acquisition, some aspects of TradeBlock&#8217;s operations were integrated into CoinDesk, while other components were spun off into a separate entity, according to Bloomberg.<br /><br />DCG has faced other setbacks this year, including the closure of its wealth management unit, HQ Digital, due to economic headwinds. Additionally, DCG&#8217;s subsidiary, Genesis, has encountered difficulties with its lending arm, which filed for bankruptcy in January. With a significant debt of $3.5 billion owed to creditors, Genesis has been engaged in discussions with capital providers to address the situation.<br /><br />Furthermore, Genesis has been involved in a dispute with Gemini, a former collaborator, over a missed payment of $630 million related to their Earn product, which enabled users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency investments.<br /><br />DCG&#8217;s other subsidiaries have also been impacted by various circumstances. HQ Digital, the wealth management subsidiary, was closed down in January, while Luno, DCG&#8217;s cryptocurrency exchange, discontinued interest-bearing savings wallets in November 2022.</p>

<p>In a strategic move, <a href="https://twitter.com/HuobiGlobal/status/1661920092215562247">Huobi Global</a> has announced its preparations for the launch of its Hong Kong division on June 1st, catering specifically to users in the city-state. This expansion comes in the wake of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong&#8217;s decision to allow retail trading in cryptocurrencies, signaling a significant shift after a tumultuous year for the industry.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-exchange-huobi-announces-plans-to-lay-off-20-of-its-workforce/">Huobi</a> Hong Kong, the new venue situated in the special administrative region of China, aims to be fully compliant with local regulations while offering customers a wide range of trading pairs and services. Upon its launch, users will have the opportunity to trade popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tron (TRX), and Huobi Token (HT).<br /><br />This venture marks the initial step in Huobi&#8217;s expansion plans, following a rebranding effort in November of the previous year, after being acquired by About Capital Buyout Fund. The company sought to establish its presence in the Caribbean market. Furthermore, Huobi intends to intensify its investments across Southeast Asia, Europe, and other regions, while simultaneously exploring strategic mergers and acquisitions to expand its ecosystem.<br /><br />However, Huobi faced a setback in its engagement with the Malaysian regulatory agency. On May 22nd, the Securities Commission Malaysia (SCM) issued a statement declaring that Huobi Global had failed to register as a crypto exchange operator, resulting in an order to cease all activities. Additionally, the SCM directed the company to disable its website and mobile applications available on the Apple Store and Google Play.<br /><br />Despite these challenges, Hong Kong remains committed to positioning itself as a leading crypto hub, amidst a broader industry crackdown in the Western world. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po reinforced the city&#8217;s dedication to cryptocurrencies during the Hong Kong Web3 Festival in April.<br /><br />In line with this objective, the SFC of Hong Kong recently released a<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/"> report</a> outlining policy recommendations. The report allows licensed virtual asset providers (VASPs) to serve retail investors, provided that operators demonstrate an understanding of the associated risks.<br /><br />Guidelines for VASPs will include requirements concerning asset custody safety, cybersecurity standards, and client asset segregation. All digital asset platforms in Hong Kong must apply for licenses under the new regulatory framework, failure to comply could result in fines and potential jail terms.</p>

<p>Trezor&#8217;s CEO, Mat?j Žák, emphasized the company&#8217;s commitment to ensuring the utmost security and control for its users. He stated, <em>&#8220;At Trezor, we firmly believe that hardware wallets, as cold storage solutions, should never expose the seed phrase to anyone other than the user, ensuring 100% self-custody.&#8221;</em><br /><br />Trezor differentiates itself as a fully open-source company that subjects all its processes to rigorous scrutiny by independent technical experts. This approach guarantees that remote extraction of seed phrases is impossible and has never been implemented in their products.<br /><br />Concerns among users regarding Ledger&#8217;s seed recovery feature, as well as the associated online storage of seed phrases and the need for a know-your-customer process, have further contributed to the increased demand for Trezor wallets. The 2020 data breach experienced by Ledger has already cast doubt on the company&#8217;s data handling practices, leading users to question the security of their devices and seed phrases, even if they opt out of Ledger&#8217;s recovery feature.<br /><br />In response to these concerns, Ledger has decided to pause the feature&#8217;s release to rework the code and prioritize transparency and verifiability. During a recent Twitter space event, Charles Guillemet, Ledger&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer, outlined the company&#8217;s open-source roadmap. He revealed plans to expedite the process and make the white paper on the Ledger Recover protocol and the firmware that implements the feature publicly available.<br /><br />Amidst these developments, a security firm called Unciphered <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-security-firm-unciphered-claims-ability-to-physically-hack-trezor-t-wallet-1032349192">reportedly</a> claimed to have discovered a vulnerability that allowed them to hack into Trezor T&#8217;s hardware wallet. This discovery has raised concerns about the overall security provided by the wallet service provider.<br /><br />Trezor&#8217;s CTO, Tomáš Sušánka, acknowledged the existence of the RDP downgrade attack vulnerability in a <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/our-response-to-the-read-protection-downgrade-attack-28d23f8949c6">blog post</a> from 2020. Sušánka clarified that this type of attack requires the physical theft of a device and a high level of technical knowledge and advanced equipment. <br /><br />Furthermore, he stated that Trezor wallets can be safeguarded by employing a strong passphrase, which adds a layer of security that renders an RDP downgrade useless.<br /><br />To address these concerns, Trezor has taken significant steps by developing the world&#8217;s first auditable and transparent secure element through its sister company, <a href="https://tropicsquare.com/press-releases/tropic-squares-initial-testing-of-their-first-batch-of-prototype-chips-moves-them-one-step-closer-to-production">Tropic Square</a>. This further demonstrates Trezor&#8217;s commitment to providing robust security measures for its hardware wallet users.</p>
