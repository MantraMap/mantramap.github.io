<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>ASIC sues eToro for marketing risky CFD products to unsuitable investors.</em></li>



<li><em>Almost 20,000 eToro clients allegedly lost money trading CFDs.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform faces legal actions in Australia and Italy over its advertising practices.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On August 3, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-204mr-asic-sues-etoro-in-its-first-design-and-distribution-action-to-protect-consumers-from-high-risk-cfd-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> a significant move to protect consumers by launching Federal Court proceedings against eToro Aus Capital Limited (eToro) for its contract for difference (CFD) product.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-187.png"><img decoding="async" width="959" height="540" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-187.png" alt="eToro Faces Legal Firestorm: ASIC&#039;s Battle To Protect Investors From Risky CFDs" class="wp-image-208073" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-187.png 959w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-187-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-187-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-187-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" title="eToro Faces Legal Firestorm: ASIC&#039;s Battle To Protect Investors From Risky CFDs 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The legal action marks ASIC&#8217;s first design and distribution action against high-risk CFD products, indicating a possible crackdown on similar platforms in the future.</p>



<p>ASIC alleges that eToro&#8217;s CFD product was marketed to a target market that was too broad, given the high-risk and volatile nature of CFDs. The platform reportedly used insufficient screening tests when offering leveraged derivative contracts to retail investors. This inadequacy led to almost 20,000 customers losing money between October 5, 2021, and June 14, 2023, according to the claims.</p>



<p>CFDs are leveraged products that allow investors to bet on whether the underlying asset&#8217;s value will rise or fall. While successful bets can yield substantial profits, incorrect predictions can lead to significant losses. <a href="https://coincu.com/169596-asic-targeted-review-of-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASIC</a> has expressed concerns over the risks associated with CFDs, likening them to &#8220;financial heroin hits.&#8221; The sale of CFDs to retail investors is banned in certain countries, including the US and Hong Kong.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-188-1024x649.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="649" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-188-1024x649.png" alt="eToro Faces Legal Firestorm: ASIC&#039;s Battle To Protect Investors From Risky CFDs" class="wp-image-208074" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-188-1024x649.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-188-300x190.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-188-768x487.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-188-750x475.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-188-1140x722.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-188.png 1190w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="eToro Faces Legal Firestorm: ASIC&#039;s Battle To Protect Investors From Risky CFDs 2"></a></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://coincu.com/207463-etoro-agrees-to-sell-120m-in-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eToro</a>, founded in 2007, is an online investment platform with a global reach, boasting over 32 million users across 100 countries. The platform entered the Australian market in 2019, and since then, it has attracted approximately 29,965 CFD clients between October 2021 and June 2023, as <a href="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/s2qdjuat/23-204mr-asic-v-etoro-concise-statement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by ASIC.</p>



<p>ASIC&#8217;s filing notice states that eToro advertised itself through broad mass marketing, raising concerns about the platform&#8217;s approach to reaching unsuitable investors. The regulator alleges that the screening test used by eToro to assess a retail client&#8217;s suitability for CFD trading was &#8220;wholly inadequate.&#8221; Prospective clients could easily amend their answers without limitations, making the test ineffective in excluding those for whom CFDs were inappropriate.</p>



<p>The investment watchdog further contends that eToro&#8217;s CFD target market was too broad, allowing investors with little experience and understanding of the risks involved to invest in the products. This, in turn, increased the risk of consumer harm.</p>



<p>eToro&#8217;s crypto CFDs offer up to two times leverage on certain assets and also cover stocks, currencies, commodities, and precious metals. However, ASIC points out that the risks associated with CFD products are heightened when underlying assets, such as crypto-assets, are already considered high-risk and volatile.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-189-1024x538.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-189-1024x538.png" alt="eToro Faces Legal Firestorm: ASIC&#039;s Battle To Protect Investors From Risky CFDs" class="wp-image-208075" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-189-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-189-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-189-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-189-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-189-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-189.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="eToro Faces Legal Firestorm: ASIC&#039;s Battle To Protect Investors From Risky CFDs 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>Notably, this is the second instance in recent months where eToro has faced regulatory challenges. In July, the Italian Competition Authority imposed a €1.3 million fine on the platform for misleading advertising. These legal actions coincide with eToro&#8217;s efforts to execute a $120 million secondary share sale, providing liquidity to early investors and employees following the company&#8217;s unsuccessful IPO attempt last year.</p>



<p>At the same time, Twitter <a href="https://coincu.com/181925-twitter-now-enables-crypto-stock-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnered</a> with eToro to enable the trading of crypto and stocks. Real-time observation and trading were available on the platform.</p>



<p>With ASIC&#8217;s legal action underway, the outcome of the proceedings against eToro could have broader implications for the regulation of CFD products and their marketing to retail investors in Australia and beyond.</p>

<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum AllCoresDevs Coordinator Tim Beiko&#8217;s Twitter account is suspected of a phishing attack.</em></li>



<li><em>Crypto Twitter users are advised to enhance security with 2FA.</em></li>



<li><em>Coinlist and Binance were also targeted in recent hacking attempts.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent development <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1686906657148993538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by Wu Blockchain, the Twitter account of Ethereum AllCoresDevs Coordinator Tim Beiko came under suspicion of being stolen.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-186.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="740" height="463" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-186.png" alt="Ethereum Developer Tim Beiko Twitter Account Suspected Stolen In Latest Cyber Attack Surge" class="wp-image-208063" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-186.png 740w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-186-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" title="Ethereum Developer Tim Beiko Twitter Account Suspected Stolen In Latest Cyber Attack Surge 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ethereum developer Tim Beiko</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The hacker behind the breach posted a phishing link enticing users with promises of an ETH airdrop. It is essential for users not to click on any links from suspicious sources to safeguard their information and funds.</p>



<p>The incident is part of a broader wave of attacks on Crypto Twitter users&#8217; accounts. Security experts are now urging the adoption of stronger security measures, including the use of Google Authenticator for two-factor authentication (2FA), to enhance protection against such cyber threats.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/60880-tim-beiko-shares-the-first-hard-fork-in-ethereums-post-merger-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Beiko</a> is a prominent figure within the Ethereum Foundation, and his work and updates related to Ethereum are widely cited by major financial news outlets. With extensive experience in the field, Beiko has been actively involved in Ethereum since 2018. He previously worked at Joseph Lubin&#8217;s ConsenSys before joining the Ethereum Foundation in 2021.</p>



<p>As a leader responsible for protocol upgrades and developer meetings, Beiko plays a crucial role in preparing for Ethereum updates. His Twitter account, which boasts over 114K followers, is highly regarded as a reliable source for early updates on Ethereum-related events.</p>

<p>Coincu found that tweets related to the ETH airdrop have been deleted from Beiko&#8217;s Twitter page, indicating that he has regained control of his account.</p>



<p>This incident follows other recent attacks, with the official Twitter account of Coinlist being <a href="https://coincu.com/205052-coinlist-twitter-account-suspected-of-hacking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspected</a> of hacking. Users reported receiving suspicious messages related to a token gifting scam. Coinlist representatives confirmed the situation as a phishing scam, and they advise users to exercise caution when encountering such messages on social media platforms.</p>



<p>Earlier, the Binance CEO also <a href="https://coincu.com/208056-binances-encountered-a-zero-transfer-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> a warning, stating that scammers attempted a trick that put the exchange at risk of losing $20 million.</p>



<p>Phishing scams pose significant threats, as they can lead to the theft of sensitive information or funds. Therefore, it is crucial for users to remain vigilant and verify the authenticity of any promotional offers or giveaways involving cryptocurrencies or sensitive personal data.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow, users must prioritize security measures and stay informed about potential threats to protect their investments and personal information effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance foils a $20 million scam attack targeting its internal address.</em></li>



<li><em>Scammers used clever tactics, generating addresses with matching starting and ending letters and catching unsuspecting users off guard during crypto transfers.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange&#8217;s quick response prevents fund loss.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent announcement, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed that the popular cryptocurrency exchange narrowly averted a sophisticated scam attack that targeted its internal address.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1x-1-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1x-1-2-1024x682.jpg" alt="Binance’s Internal Address Encountered A Zero-transfer Scam Attack" class="wp-image-208058" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1x-1-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1x-1-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1x-1-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1x-1-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1x-1-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1x-1-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1x-1-2.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance’s Internal Address Encountered A Zero-transfer Scam Attack 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The incident occurred yesterday when scammers attempted a zero transfer scam, seeking to siphon off a significant amount of funds. However, the quick-witted operator overseeing the transaction detected the anomaly just in time, preventing the loss of $20 million worth of USDT.</p>



<p>Zhao <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1686764372616515585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recounted</a> the incident, highlighting the cunning tactics employed by the scammers. He explained that they had managed to generate an address that bore the same starting and ending letters as the legitimate address. This manipulation exploited a common habit among crypto users who typically check the beginning and end of an address for verification purposes.</p>



<p>To add to the deception, many wallets use an ellipsis (&#8220;…&#8221;) to conceal the middle portion of an address, improving the user interface&#8217;s appearance. The attackers capitalized on this feature by sending small, inconspicuous transactions to the targeted wallet. As a result, the false address appeared within the operator&#8217;s wallet, increasing the chances of copying the incorrect address when initiating a transfer.</p>



<p>Despite the scammer&#8217;s cunning ploy, the experienced crypto operator at Binance caught the irregularity almost immediately after completing the transaction. In a decisive move, Binance authorities swiftly requested the freezing of the USDT funds, effectively halting any further unauthorized transfers.</p>



<p>In his statement, <a href="https://coincu.com/207808-cz-pushed-shut-down-binanceus-but-stopped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhao</a> stressed the importance of maintaining vigilance in the face of such elaborate scams and warned others in the crypto community to remain cautious. He expressed gratitude that the incident was thwarted successfully, preventing the loss of millions of dollars, but also acknowledged the scammers&#8217; increasing sophistication.</p>

<p>To recover the frozen funds, Binance must now undergo several procedures, including filing a police report. The process may be time-consuming, but it is a crucial step in reclaiming the funds and ensuring that they do not end up in the hands of scammers.</p>



<p>Zhao emphasized that rapid response times are vital in cases like these, and Binance&#8217;s ability to act promptly played a pivotal role in preventing a devastating financial loss. He hoped that by sharing this incident, others in the cryptocurrency world would be better prepared to detect and thwart potential scams in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DOJ mulls fraud charges against Binance, fearing market collapse.</em></li>



<li><em>Alternatives like fines and agreements are explored to protect consumers.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance faces regulatory scrutiny amid market watchfulness.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly considering the possibility of charging cryptocurrency exchange Binance with fraud, according to sources familiar with the matter. However, federal prosecutors are hesitant about taking this step due to concerns over the potential consequences it could have on the broader market, <em>Semafor</em> <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/02/2023/us-prosecutors-worry-binance-charges-could-cause-run-on-exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a></strong>.</h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binance.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="681" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binance-1024x681.jpeg" alt="Binance May Be Accused Of Fraud, But DOJ Worried About Market Crisis" class="wp-image-208042" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binance-1024x681.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binance-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binance-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binance-1536x1022.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binance-750x499.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binance-1140x758.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binance.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance May Be Accused Of Fraud, But DOJ Worried About Market Crisis 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>An indictment against Binance could lead to a similar scenario as seen last fall with <a href="https://coincu.com/207575-ftx-confirms-to-relaunch-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>, where a run on deposits caused the exchange to crumble. To mitigate the risk of such a market upheaval, the <a href="https://coincu.com/151266-binance-once-again-splits-doj/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOJ</a> is exploring alternative approaches, including imposing fines or entering into deferred or non-prosecution agreements with the exchange, as sources revealed.</p>



<p>Binance has been under regulatory scrutiny in the United States for some time. The exchange faced a criminal probe for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Russia. Furthermore, it has been <a href="https://coincu.com/194956-secs-freeze-binanceus-assets-denied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly operating unlawfully and offering unregistered securities. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has also accused the exchange and its CEO, <a href="https://coincu.com/207808-cz-pushed-shut-down-binanceus-but-stopped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a>, of violating trading and derivatives regulations.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-182.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-182.png" alt="Binance May Be Accused Of Fraud, But DOJ Worried About Market Crisis" class="wp-image-208045" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-182.png 640w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-182-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="Binance May Be Accused Of Fraud, But DOJ Worried About Market Crisis 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>In light of these ongoing legal concerns, some former SEC officials speculate that money laundering charges may be brought against Binance, further complicating the situation.</p>



<p>The news of the potential DOJ charges has sparked concern within the cryptocurrency community, and Zhao has cautioned against spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) to manipulate the market. CZ&#8217;s cryptic reference to the number &#8220;4&#8221; has raised speculation, as some interpreted it as a warning against attempts to create panic among investors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="qst" dir="ltr">4</p>&mdash; CZ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f536.png" alt="🔶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1686757050464813056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 2, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The fear of a Binance collapse akin to the FTX incident in 2022 stems from the devastating impact it had on the crypto ecosystem, resulting in significant losses for users. Similar repercussions from any action against the exchange have raised concerns about market stability.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s extensive trading volumes make it a critical player in the market, and recent reports <a href="https://coincu.com/207915-binance-defies-chinas-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> staggering cryptocurrency trades worth $90 billion in a single month, despite a ban on crypto trading in China for two years. Interestingly, these recent reports echo similar news from June 2023.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-183.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="980" height="551" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-183.png" alt="Binance May Be Accused Of Fraud, But DOJ Worried About Market Crisis" class="wp-image-208047" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-183.png 980w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-183-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-183-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-183-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" title="Binance May Be Accused Of Fraud, But DOJ Worried About Market Crisis 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>However, Binance is not the only exchange facing legal battles; Coinbase, the leading U.S.-based crypto exchange, is also grappling with SEC lawsuits related to securities law violations.</p>



<p>In February 2023, Binance&#8217;s former Chief Strategy Officer, <a href="https://coincu.com/202588-binance-appoints-new-general-counsel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Hillmann</a>, expressed the exchange&#8217;s willingness to pay fines to reconcile with U.S. authorities. However, the recent resignation of Hillmann and other senior legal personnel in July has raised questions and left reasons undisclosed.</p>



<p>The DOJ&#8217;s investigation into Binance remains a matter of significant interest to the cryptocurrency market and investors, given the potential implications it could have on the industry. The situation is continuously evolving, and stakeholders are closely monitoring any updates from regulatory authorities.</p>

<p>While CleanSpark has set ambitious <a href="https://coincu.com/191854-cleanspark-sees-increased-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growth targets</a> and has successfully increased its hashrate to an all-time high of 9.0 EH/s, the company acknowledges the inherent volatility and uncertainty in the Bitcoin mining industry. Factors such as government regulations and changes in mining difficulty rates could impact their operations. Nonetheless, CleanSpark remains focused on pursuing sustainable practices while contributing to the growth and advancement of the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>



<p>Overall, CleanSpark&#8217;s July Bitcoin mining and operation update signals the company&#8217;s strong performance, rapid growth, and dedication to sustainability. As they continue to expand their mining capacity and strive to achieve their ambitious goals, CleanSpark remains a formidable force in the ever-evolving world of Bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>The halving involved a reduction in the block subsidy, which is the predetermined reward given to miners for processing transactions and securing the network. Previously set at 12.5 LTC, the block subsidy has now been halved to 6.25 LTC.</p>

<p>The halving took place at block height 2,520,000 on Wednesday, around 15:06 UTC, as reported by litecoinspace.org. With the reward reduction, miners will now receive only half of their previous earnings. The countdown for the next halving has been reset, and it is expected to occur approximately four years from now.</p>



<p>The social dominance of <a href="https://coincu.com/207186-litecoin-price-jitters-ahead-of-halving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Litecoin</a> has experienced a surge as the halving approached, leading to increased anxiety among stakeholders. Many are finding it challenging to navigate the current volatility of LTC. From a pricing perspective, LTC has already seen a decline of around 5.6%, with the potential for further losses. The increase in selling activities is exerting additional downward pressure on the already declining price.</p>



<p>The value of LTC has been trending downward since early July, when it briefly surpassed $110, reaching a level not seen since April 2022. Currently, Litecoin is hovering around $88.6, often referred to as &#8220;silver to Bitcoin&#8217;s gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>The latest halving also marks a significant step towards a state of disinflation for Litecoin. The final halving is projected to take place in 2142, capping the total circulating supply of Litecoin at 84,000,000 LTC.</p>



<p>Litecoin, a fork of <a href="https://coincu.com/205492-bitcoin-hodlers-reach-75-of-circulating-supply/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>, follows a similar halving schedule. Bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, is expected to undergo its <a href="https://coincu.com/184664-365-days-bitcoin-halving-the-block-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">halving</a> in May 2024.</p>

<p>In anticipation of a potential price surge related to the halving event, mid-sized LTC whales and miners have recently acquired substantial amounts of the asset.</p>



<p>Litecoin founder, Charlie Lee, believes that these halvings help promote mass adoption of the cryptocurrency without compromising network security. He also <a href="https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1686353701118918656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addressed</a> the discrepancies between different halving countdown timers, suggesting that the <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/countdown/ltc-halving-2023-08-06-11-00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NiceHash</a> timer was the most accurate. Nevertheless, all sources agreed on the date of August 2nd for the halving event.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Sui Network introduces liquid staking in the latest upgrade.</em></li>



<li><em>The upgrade is community-driven and ensures fully non-custodial liquid staking solutions.</em></li>



<li><em>The unique approach promotes decentralization and user choice.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Sui Network, a revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain that utilizes an object-centric data model to enhance Web3&#8217;s infrastructure layer, has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230802029682/en/Sui-Enables-Liquid-Staking-Functionality-to-Empower-Delegated-Stakers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> a significant update that enables liquid staking as part of its latest network upgrade.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-169.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-169.png" alt="Sui Network Introduces Liquid Staking For A More Decentralized Web3 Ecosystem" class="wp-image-208013" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-169.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-169-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-169-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-169-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Sui Network Introduces Liquid Staking To Enhance Decentralized Web3 Ecosystem 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>The latest network upgrade by <a href="https://coincu.com/179886-sui-has-no-airdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mysten Labs</a>&#8216; Layer 1 blockchain introduces support for <a href="https://coincu.com/193868-sui-network-releases-sip-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liquid staking</a> of its native token. This development comes as a crucial step for the Sui community, as it opens up new possibilities within the network&#8217;s expanding DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>With the implementation of liquid staking on <a href="https://coincu.com/203928-sui-network-sets-new-transaction-record-with-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sui Network</a>, developers can now offer fully non-custodial solutions, allowing token holders to receive derivative tokens in proportion to the value of their staked SUI tokens.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-171.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-171.png" alt="Sui Network Introduces Liquid Staking For A More Decentralized Web3 Ecosystem" class="wp-image-208015" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-171.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-171-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-171-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-171-750x563.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Sui Network Introduces Liquid Staking To Enhance Decentralized Web3 Ecosystem 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>Liquid staking is a process where stakers are rewarded with derivative tokens that reflect the value of their staked tokens. These derivative tokens offer flexibility and liquidity, enabling stakers to access the value that would otherwise be locked up.</p>



<p>One notable advantage of the Sui network&#8217;s unique architecture is that third-party liquid staking apps on Sui will provide the benefits of liquid staking without centralizing staking power in one or a few validators. The process involves two aspects: a third-party Move package issuing a derivative token equivalent to the staked token and the original token remaining staked to secure the network through the consensus process.</p>



<p>Compared to other networks, such as Solana, Aptos, and Sei, Sui&#8217;s formulation for liquid staking stands out in one key aspect. While other networks rely on third-party liquid staking protocols for both issuing the derivative and determining validators for staked tokens, Sui separates these two functions. As a result, Sui stakers can freely choose any validator on the network for their original tokens.</p>



<p>Liquid staking, in general, promotes decentralization by offering greater utility to stakers, encouraging more participants to stake and secure blockchain networks. However, some networks&#8217; constraints on stakers&#8217; choice of validator can concentrate power, which Sui&#8217;s liquid staking formulation effectively avoids.</p>



<p>The Sui Network&#8217;s latest upgrade marks a significant milestone in the development of its ecosystem, promising new opportunities for developers and users alike. As the blockchain space continues to evolve, Sui&#8217;s innovative approach to liquid staking sets it apart from its competitors, fostering a more decentralized and user-friendly environment for the Web3 ecosystem.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-160.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="455" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-160-1024x455.png" alt="Uniswap Community Supports Proposal To Extend V3 To Linea" class="wp-image-207994" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-160-1024x455.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-160-300x133.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-160-768x341.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-160-750x333.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-160.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Uniswap Community Supports Proposal To Extend V3 To Linea 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>This momentous decision came after the proposal successfully passed the temperature check vote, and as a result, the related <a href="https://coincu.com/194743-uniswap-community-approves-proposal-v3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniswap V3</a> contract has already been deployed on the Linea chain.</p>



<p>The proposal aims to establish Linea&#8217;s mainnet launch, further integrating Uniswap with the ConsenSys product ecosystem, which includes well-known products like MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle. By deploying Uniswap V3 on <a href="https://coincu.com/201743-linea-mainnet-alpha-to-launch-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linea</a>, the protocol seeks to become a dominant decentralized exchange (DEX) on the network, thereby encouraging higher trading volume and strengthening ties to existing ConsenSys product users.</p>



<p>One of the notable features of Linea is its impressive handling of more than 47 million transactions on its testnet. The Linea Voyage quest, a crucial initiative designed to stress-test the network, contributed significantly to this number. Stress-testing not only helps identify potential issues and performance impediments but also ensures a smooth transition to Linea&#8217;s mainnet.</p>



<p>For users, Linea offers the convenience of being natively supported in the MetaMask network dropdown list, providing access to a range of <a href="https://coincu.com/181472-consensys-confirms-7000-metamask-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MetaMask</a> curated experiences such as On/Off Ramp, MetaBridge, MetaMask Swaps, Portfolio dApp, and the MetaMask SDK &#8211; all of which can leverage the power of Uniswap&#8217;s protocol.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-161.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="690" height="435" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-161.png" alt="Uniswap Community Supports Proposal To Extend V3 To Linea" class="wp-image-207995" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-161.png 690w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-161-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" title="Uniswap Community Supports Proposal To Extend V3 To Linea 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>Linea aims to be a Type 2 zkEVM 1, achieving EVM-equivalence and handling native EVM bytecode for proving and verification. This enables developers to build using familiar tools and infrastructure at remarkably low switching costs. By directly using compiled bytecode from Solidity, Linea significantly reduces the risk of bugs and hacks.</p>



<p>Moreover, Linea supports EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction), demonstrating its dedication to innovation and pushing the boundaries of the Web3 space. Collaborating with key stakeholders, the network utilizes the single-entry-point contract and runs multiple networks of bundlers and paymasters services.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/188942-consensys-metamask-no-tax-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ConsenSys</a>, since its inception, has been a strong advocate of decentralization worldwide. With extensive experience in managing web3 infrastructure, wallets, developer tools, and public goods, ConsenSys is confident in its ability to guide Linea towards complete decentralization and openness.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-162-1024x512.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-162-1024x512.png" alt="Uniswap Community Supports Proposal To Extend V3 To Linea" class="wp-image-207996" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-162-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-162-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-162-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-162-1536x768.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-162-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-162-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-162-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-162.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Uniswap Community Supports Proposal To Extend V3 To Linea 23"></a></figure></div>


<p>The integration with various platforms like MetaMask, Infura, Truffle, and Besu, alongside compatibility with nearly all EVM-specific development tools, presents numerous benefits to the deployment on Linea. Among the top three highlighted benefits are the early establishment in the Linea AMM Market, increased volume through MetaMask Swaps Integration, and cross-promotion opportunities.</p>



<p>The approval of the Uniswap governance proposal will designate the V3 contracts on Linea as the canonical deployment. As with all canonical V3 deployments, these contracts will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The v3deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain in the uniswap.eth ENS will be amended to include a reference to the V3 contracts on Linea.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bloomberg analysts increase the likelihood of spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US to 65%, up from 1% a few months ago.</em></li>



<li><em>Recent events, including SEC Chair&#8217;s remarks and Grayscale&#8217;s case, contribute to the growing optimism for ETF approval.</em></li>



<li><em>Traditional financial institutions&#8217; interest, like BlackRock&#8217;s involvement, may boost the chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF gaining regulatory approval.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts have recently revised their predictions for the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, raising the odds to 65%.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-155.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="640" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-155.png" alt="Analysts Say Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds Surge to 65% In 2023" class="wp-image-207983" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-155.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-155-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-155-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-155-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="Analysts Say Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds Surge To 65% In 2023 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>This marked increase in likelihood is a significant jump from just a few months ago when the chances were a mere 1%. The shift comes amidst a series of crucial events in the cryptocurrency market and regulatory landscape.</p>



<p>Notably, SEC Chair Gary Gensler&#8217;s recent remarks downplaying his role at the Securities and Exchange Commission have fueled optimism among market participants. The change in Gensler&#8217;s tone suggests a potential opening for Bitcoin ETFs within the regulatory framework.</p>



<p>Moreover, the ongoing Grayscale case has garnered attention as the company attempts to minimize filings, and the SEC faces a loss in front of the same judges. These developments have further stoked speculation about the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, believes that the outcome of the Grayscale case could play a decisive role in the approval process. A victory for <a href="https://coincu.com/206678-grayscale-sec-concurrent-approval-bitcoin-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grayscale</a> over the <a href="https://coincu.com/207484-sec-sues-hex-founder-richard-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> may trigger a series of approvals for various spot Bitcoin ETF filings by the end of the fourth quarter later this year.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-156-1024x512.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-156-1024x512.png" alt="Analysts Say Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds Surge to 65% In 2023" class="wp-image-207984" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-156-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-156-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-156-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-156-1536x768.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-156-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-156-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-156-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-156.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Analysts Say Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds Surge To 65% In 2023 25"></a></figure></div>


<p>The collaboration between BlackRock and Coinbase on a surveillance sharing agreement (SSA) has also significantly influenced analysts&#8217; perspectives. This partnership has altered the analysis of spot Bitcoin ETF prospects and contributed to the growing optimism surrounding its potential approval. Seyffart noted that the Ripple case, while less critical, remains relevant and could also impact the final decision.</p>



<p>The pursuit of a spot Bitcoin ETF gained momentum with <a href="https://coincu.com/206478-blackrocks-bold-move-partners-with-jio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>&#8216;s filing on June 16, which prompted a flurry of applications from other institutional giants such as WisdomTree, Invesco, Valkyrie, and others. Despite previous rejections of spot ETF filings by the SEC, the surge in applications during the second quarter of 2023 indicates that this year could prove crucial for spot Bitcoin ETF approvals.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-157.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-157-1024x683.png" alt="Analysts Say Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds Surge to 65% In 2023" class="wp-image-207985" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-157-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-157-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-157-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-157-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-157-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-157.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Analysts Say Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds Surge To 65% In 2023 26"></a></figure></div>


<p>Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the interest shown by traditional financial institutions, particularly BlackRock, as a potential catalyst for approval. The backing of institutional giants may increase the chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF gaining regulatory approval.</p>



<p>However, Seyffart remains cautious, <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1686709254185463808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emphasizing</a> that the timing of the Grayscale case and its outcome are crucial factors. The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF largely depends on the result of Grayscale&#8217;s ongoing lawsuit against the SEC.</p>



<p>In the midst of the SEC&#8217;s ongoing review of Bitcoin ETF applications, other significant players such as Volatility Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, Roundhill, ProShares, and Grayscale have also filed applications for Ether ETFs, indicating a growing interest in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>The mounting pressure on the SEC and the US Congress to approve <a href="https://coincu.com/204120-sec-adds-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-federal-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin ETFs</a>, and potentially <a href="https://coincu.com/207846-6-investors-bet-on-ethereum-futures-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum ETFs</a>, highlights the significance of 2023 in shaping the digital asset industry.</p>



<p>Grayscale&#8217;s current lead over competitors, such as Ark Invest and 21 Shares, in the Bitcoin ETF race adds further anticipation to the eventual outcome. With a predicted 65% chance of approval, stakeholders in the crypto space are closely monitoring regulatory developments, hoping for a breakthrough in the acceptance of spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
