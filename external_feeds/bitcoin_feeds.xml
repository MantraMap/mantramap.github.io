<h2>NYAG Letitia James Launches &#8216;Landmark&#8217; Crypto Legislation</h2>
<p>The New York State Attorney General (NYAG) Office announced Friday that Attorney General Letitia James has proposed “landmark legislation to tighten regulations on the cryptocurrency industry to protect investors, consumers, and the broader economy.” The announcement states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Attorney General James’ program bill, which proposes the strongest and most comprehensive set of regulations on cryptocurrency in the nation, would increase transparency, eliminate conflicts of interest, and impose commonsense measures to protect investors, consistent with regulations imposed on other financial services.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bill, dubbed “Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency, and Oversight (CRPTO) Act,” would “require independent public audits of cryptocurrency exchanges and prevent individuals from owning the same companies, such as brokerages and tokens, to stop conflicts of interest,” the announcement adds.</p>
<p>“Crypto platforms would also have responsibilities to customers similar to banks under the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act by requiring platforms to reimburse customers who are the victims of fraud. The bill would also strengthen the New York State Department of Financial Services’ (DFS) regulatory authority of digital assets,” the NYAG Office detailed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the announcement explains that the bill would bolster investor protections by &#8220;enacting and codifying &#8216;know-your-customer&#8217; [KYC] provisions&#8221; and &#8220;banning the use of the term &#8216;stablecoin&#8217; to describe or market digital assets unless they are backed 1:1 with U.S. currency or high-quality liquid assets as defined in federal regulations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The NYAG Office continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>The bill would grant the Attorney General jurisdiction to enforce any violation of the law, issue subpoenas, impose civil penalties of $10,000 per violation per individual or $100,000 per violation per firm, collect restitution, damages, and penalties, and shut down businesses engaging in fraud and illegality.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The bill would also codify DFS’ authority to license digital asset brokers, marketplaces, investment advisors, and issuers prior to engaging in business in New York and allow DFS to oversee the digital asset licensing regime,” the announcement notes.</p>
<p>“Rampant fraud and dysfunction have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency and it is time to bring law and order to the multi-billion-dollar industry,” Attorney General James commented. “These commonsense regulations will bring more transparency and oversight to the industry and strengthen our ability to crack down on those that don’t pay respect to the law.”</p>

The new solution is expected to help the startup operate more efficiently and deliver &#8220;excellent customer experiences.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Plugging Gaps in Payment Processes</h2>
<p>Nomba, a Nigerian payments startup, has raised a US$30 million pre-Series B funding round. According to a Disrupt Africa <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2023/05/03/nigerian-payments-startup-nomba-raises-30m-pre-series-b-round/">report</a>, the startup’s oversubscribed equity round was led by San Francisco-based Base10 Partners. Helios Digital Ventures, Shopify, Partech, and Khosla Ventures also participated in the round.</p>
<p>As per the report, Nomba, which was previously known as Kudi, will the investment to produce a payments solution that enables it to plug gaps in its payment processes. The new solution is expected to help the startup operate more efficiently and deliver “excellent customer experiences.”</p>

<p>Commenting on the startup’s successful capital raise, Yinka Adewale, who co-founded the payments firm in 2017, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see payment as a business model, not just a product and we want to make it easier for businesses to take advantage of all that is possible in their payment processes to support their continued growth and success. We have a long list of products we have been working on and the funds we have raised as well as the investors that have backed us gives us a lot of confidence about what can be achieved with more effective payment solutions in the hands of business owners.</p></blockquote>
<p>For her part, Luci Fonseca, a partner at Base10, said Nomba’s record of innovation and capital efficiency is what convinced her organization to support the payments company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to be supporting them to deliver their game-changing solutions to power growth and continued success for businesses in Nigeria and beyond,&#8221; Fonseca said.</p>
<p>With an estimated monthly transaction value of approximately $1 billion, Nomba is already ranked among Africa’s best payment service providers.</p>

Kennedy&#8217;s remarks come after he criticized the Biden administration in mid-March for bailing out Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, emphasizing that the decision to make all depositors whole &#8220;was a bail out,&#8221; regardless of what it was called.</strong></p>
<h2>Senator John Kennedy: ‘Powell’s Gonna Have to Raise Rates Much Higher Than He Normally’</h2>
<p>During a recent interview with CNBC, Louisiana Republican senator John Kennedy <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/05/03/jay-powell-may-have-to-raise-rates-8-10-percent-to-fight-inflation-says-sen-john-kennedy.html">expressed </a>his belief that the U.S. central bank will need to increase the benchmark bank rate from its current level of 5% to around 8-10% to combat inflation. Kennedy went on to <a href="https://youtu.be/MbTVp9JVKaY">state</a> that Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell will have to raise rates much higher than usual if Congress does not slow down its stimulus spending.</p>
<p>On the same day that senator John Kennedy made his remarks, the U.S. Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">increased</a> the benchmark bank rate by 25 basis points (bps), marking the tenth consecutive rate hike and bringing the rate to its highest level in approximately 16 years.</p>
<p>In addition to discussing inflation, Kennedy also addressed the issue of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-us-will-default-on-its-debt-raising-debt-ceiling-will-make-problem-worse/">debt ceiling</a>, calling for president Biden to have a serious conversation with House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) about how to allocate resources and reduce inflation. According to Kennedy, it&#8217;s time for the leaders to have an &#8220;adult discussion&#8221; about this critical issue.</p>
<p>Kennedy added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think you can do it without reducing the spending and debt.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Kennedy Compares Modern Financial Institutions to Pyramid Schemes</h2>
<p>Senator John Kennedy also addressed concerns about the U.S. banking industry, warning that modern technology can quickly turn a small disturbance into a full-blown panic. According to Kennedy, banks today rely heavily on trust, and are far less fortified than they used to be. In fact, Kennedy went so far as to compare modern financial institutions to pyramid schemes, stating that they are essentially &#8220;sophisticated Ponzi schemes.&#8221;</p>
<p>“They’re really just … and don’t take this the wrong way … sophisticated Ponzi schemes,” Kennedy emphasized.</p>

<p>U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">warned</a> that the country could face a potential default on its debt limit in June, which could have dire economic and financial consequences. With the United States currently carrying a staggering $31 trillion in debt, the stakes are high.</p>
<p>However, Republicans are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/republicans-seek-to-repeal-bidens-inflation-reduction-act-in-exchange-for-raising-us-debt-limit/">refusing to raise the debt ceiling</a> unless certain mandates on green energy and climate change are repealed from the Inflation Reduction Act. Senator John Kennedy&#8217;s recent comments on the issue come on the heels of his <a href="https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2023/3/kennedy-three-ways-biden-s-bank-bailout-could-have-been-avoided">criticism</a> of president Biden&#8217;s handling of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in mid-March.</p>

This surge in unconfirmed transactions has resulted in a staggering 343% increase in transaction fees, which have risen from $1.99 per transaction on April 26 to a current rate of $8.82 per transaction as of May 7.

<p><em>**Editor&#x2019;s Note: At 12:38 p.m. (ET) on May 7, 2023, Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655250881997332482?s=20">tweeted</a> that the crypto exchange resumed bitcoin withdrawals. </em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Network Struggles with Unprecedented Traffic and Soaring Fees</h2>
<p>As of Sunday, May 7, 2023, the Bitcoin network is experiencing a major traffic jam due to an overwhelming number of unconfirmed transactions. The latest statistics reveal that a whopping <a href="https://mempool.space">390,000 transfers</a> are currently stuck in limbo, waiting for confirmation.</p>
<p>This backlog can be attributed to the surge in minting and transferring of Ordinal inscriptions and BRC20 tokens, which have flooded the network. In fact, the Bitcoin blockchain is now hosting over 13,000 <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brc20-token-standard-sparks-frenzy-in-bitcoin-community-with-market-cap-surpassing-95-million/">BRC20 tokens</a> and a staggering 4.17 million Ordinal inscriptions, further exacerbating the congestion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-586731 size-full" title="Bitcoin Network Overwhelmed by 390,000 Unconfirmed Transactions and Surging Fees" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memeee.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Network Overwhelmed by 390,000 Unconfirmed Transactions and Surging Fees" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memeee-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memeee-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memeee-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memeee-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memeee-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memeee-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memeee.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>To clear the <a href="https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,all,count">current backlog</a>, a whopping 179 blocks would need to be mined. Given the average block time of 10 minutes, it would take approximately 1.24 days to mine the required number of blocks. This backlog has caused transaction fees to skyrocket by a whopping 343% over the past 11 days. As per bitinfocharts.com data, the average transaction fee currently stands at 0.00031 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3y">$8.82 per transfer.</a></p>

<p>Bitinfocharts.com further shows the median-sized Bitcoin transaction fee currently stands at 0.00018 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html">$5.16 per transfer</a>. However, the situation is far from ideal, as per mempool.space. The website reveals that a low-priority fee will set you back $7.74, while a medium-priority fee costs $7.90.</p>
<p>For those who need their transactions processed urgently, a high-priority fee of $7.99 per transfer. Adding to the frustration is the fact that the current block time is longer than the ten-minute average, with the last block taking a whopping ten minutes and 55 seconds to be discovered.</p>

<p>The clogged mempool has been a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=mempool&src=typed_query">hot topic on social media</a> lately, with users expressing a range of opinions on the matter. While some are excited about the surge in activity, others have labeled the rise of non-financial transactions as a DDoS or an attack.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bitcoin is not under attack.</p>
<p>The anemic block size increases simply weren't sufficient to meet demand, and Lightning didn't see mass adoption.</p>
<p>Quit whining. Either accept that a huge mempool and high fees will be the norm, or properly increase the block size.</p>
<p>&#x2014; Sam Patt (@SamuelPatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamuelPatt/status/1655195099142279168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite the optimism of some, the rise in unconfirmed transactions has not led to a significant increase in Lightning Network adoption. This is because it is still <a href="https://twitter.com/janowitz/status/1655141383487864836?s=20">expensive to open</a> and close a channel, and non-custodial solutions are<a href="https://twitter.com/TheDesertLynx/status/1645618834668175362?s=20"> few and far between</a>.</p>
<p>At precisely 11:07 a.m. (ET), the largest crypto exchange in the world, as measured by trade volume, has temporarily halted bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) withdrawals. The exchange has attributed this decision to a &#x201C;congestion issue&#x201D; that the Bitcoin network is currently grappling with.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our team is currently working on a fix until the network is stabilized and will reopen <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> withdrawals as soon as possible. Rest assured, funds are SAFU,&#x201D; Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655227965062672384?s=20">wrote</a> on Sunday morning. Roughly an hour and a half later, Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655250881997332482?s=20">resumed bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals</a>.</p>

<h2>More Than 13,000 BRC20 Tokens Built on Bitcoin Are Now Worth $279M</h2>
<p>The BRC20 token standard, which is built on top of the Bitcoin network, is gaining momentum and the BRC20 token economy is flourishing. As of Sunday, May 7, 2023, the BRC20 token economy is valued at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230507010250/https://brc-20.io/">$279.07 million</a>, with approximately 13,530 tokens in circulation. This marks a significant increase from just four days ago when the BRC20 token market capitalization was $95 million and there were around 10,487 BRC20 tokens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-586746 size-full" title="Bitcoin's BRC20 Token Economy Skyrockets 192% to $279 Million in Just Four Days" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jjjjjjjj.jpg" alt="Bitcoin's BRC20 Token Economy Skyrockets 192% to $279 Million in Just Four Days" width="1280" height="250" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jjjjjjjj-300x59.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jjjjjjjj-1024x200.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jjjjjjjj-768x150.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jjjjjjjj.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The top ten most valuable BRC20 tokens today are ordi, pepe, piza, meme, moon, punk, domo, oshi, xing, and shib. Ordi is currently the most valuable BRC20 coin, with a single ordi token exchanging hands for $9.46. With a market valuation of $200 million, ordi dominates the entire BRC20 token market capitalization by more than 71%.</p>
<p>Pepe, another BRC20 coin (not to be confused with the ERC20 meme coin with the same name), has a market capitalization of around $17.6 million. The top five BRC20 token market valuations, which include ordi, pepe, piza, meme, and moon, account for 86.55% of the $279.07 million total. Not only is ordi the top BRC20 coin in terms of market capitalization, but it has also generated $3.1 million in 24-hour trade volume.</p>

<p>As of May 7, 2023, Dune Analytics <a href="https://dune.com/cryptokoryo/brc20">recorded</a> 3.11 million BRC20 transactions. Bitcoin miners have earned 214 bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), which is equivalent to $6.2 million, from the BRC20 ecosystem. While creators of these tokens have implemented various supply caps, data from brc-20.io reveals that out of the top 118 BRC20 tokens by market cap, 80 of them have opted for a max supply of 21 million.</p>

<h2 class="article__header__heading">Bitcoin Cash Smart Contracts &#x2018;Comparable to Those on Ethereum&#x2019; Possible via May Upgrade, &#x2018;1000x Efficiency Advantage&#x2019;: Dev Jason Dreyzehner</h2>
<p>Pro-freedom technologies advocate and software developer Jason Dreyzehner recently spoke with Bitcoin.com News via email about the upcoming Bitcoin Cash network upgrade on May 15. One of the most talked about improvement proposals set to go through on that date &#x2014; which proponents view as a boon to economic freedom &#x2014; is the Cashtokens CHIP. Beyond UTXO-level token creation, the upgrade will allow for &#x201C;advanced on-chain applications like higher-security vaults, decentralized exchanges, and bridged sidechains,&#x201D; comparable to ethereum, more scalable, and cheaper, according to Dreyzehner.</p>

After several bank failures, he stressed that Pacwest Bank, Western Alliance Bank, and First Horizon Bank have all been &#8220;subject to financial meltdowns.”</strong></p>
<h2>Swedbank on U.S. Banking Crisis Spreading</h2>
<p>Pär Magnusson, a fixed income strategist at Swedbank, a Swedish bank based in Stockholm, has warned about the spreading of the U.S. banking crisis. He reportedly <a href="https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/usd/18639-u-s-dollar-outlook-position-for-more-u-s-banking-risk-says-swedbank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, First Republic Bank and now potentially Pacwest Bank, Western Alliance Bank, and First Horizon Bank all having been subject to financial meltdowns, the proverbial cat will be very difficult to put back into the bag.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">First Republic Bank</a> was seized by regulators last week and most of its assets were sold to JPMorgan Chase. It was the biggest U.S. bank failure since 2008. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-regulators-close-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-of-the-largest-bank-failures-since-washington-mutual/">Silicon Valley Bank</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ny-regulators-seize-control-of-signature-bank-depositors-assured-by-federal-bailout/">Signature Bank</a> collapsed in March. Following the seizure of First Republic Bank, shares of several banks, including Pacwest and Western Alliance Bank, plummeted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hard not to see the irony of regional U.S. banks having successfully lobbied for less regulations during the Trump administration only to find that less regulations now is making them vulnerable to bank runs,&#8221; Magnusson opined.</p>

<p>The Swedbank strategist further cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. regional bank crisis is spreading. With every bank that succumbs to shrinking deposits and/or market distrust, the probability of more banks falling victim to similar fates grows. A vicious spiral may be about to take hold.</p></blockquote>
<p>“A general risk-off reaction is becoming increasingly likely, and you should position for this risk,&#8221; the strategist concluded.</p>
<p>Despite multiple bank failures, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the U.S. banking system is &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">sound and resilient</a>&#8221; as Fed officials raised interest rates by 25 basis points this week. The Federal Reserve recently revealed that 722 banks reported unrealized losses <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-reveals-722-banks-reported-unrealized-losses-over-50-of-capital-as-concerns-over-us-banking-crisis-grow/">exceeding 50% of capital</a> in the third quarter of 2022.</p>

The spike in the volume has been attributed to Russian companies experimenting with new financial instruments amid limited access to traditional capital.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia’s Digital Assets Market Livens Up as Capital Markets Dry Up for Russian Businesses</h2>
<p>Seven placements of digital financial assets (DFAs) for a total of about 1 billion rubles ($13 million) were made in Russia last month, the Kommersant <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5966395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>. Experts quoted by the business daily note that while this market is still rather small, significant projects may be expected by the end of this year.</p>
<p>DFAs are relatively new instruments in Russia defined in the law “On Digital Financial Assets” that went into force in January 2021. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, which are yet to be comprehensively regulated, these represent “digital rights” to securities or utility tokens and must have an issuing entity.</p>
<p>Most of the DFAs issued in April were sold by the majority state-owned <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sberbank-to-conduct-first-digital-asset-transaction-on-own-platform/">Sberbank</a>, Russia’s largest banking institution, followed by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-largest-private-bank-launches-digital-asset-platform/">Alfa-Bank</a>, the largest private bank in the country. The two are among the operators of DFA platforms authorized by the Bank of Russia, alongside <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-token-issued-in-russia-to-facilitate-investments-in-palladium/">Atomyze</a>, which specializes in the tokenization of commodities, the fintech company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-largest-digital-asset-deal-denominated-in-chinese-yuan/">Lighthouse</a>, and the more recently licensed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-registers-another-digital-asset-issuer/">Masterchain</a>.</p>

<p>In March, less than a year since the central bank-approved entities started issuing DFAs, placements had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-assets-worth-2-billion-rubles-issued-in-russia-in-less-than-a-year/">reached</a> a total of 2 billion rubles ($26 million). Despite the significant increase in the following month, most analysts interviewed by Kommersant are still skeptical. Funds can be raised using existing tools such as corporate bonds, said Roman Nekrasov, co-founder of Encry Foundation which represents Russian IT companies.</p>
<p>The DFA segment remains occupied by select large players, added Mikhail Uspensky, member of the expert council of the working group on cryptocurrency at the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament. At the same time, he admitted that capital markets have dried up for Russian businesses. “And many companies are trying to be creative, including by experimenting with DFAs,” Uspensky elaborated while pointing out that issuing digital assets is still mostly a reputational move.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Western sanctions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine severely restricted Russian access to the global financial markets.

The inquiry is looking into whether the trading platform was used by Russians to circumvent financial restrictions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Exchange Binance Faces Another US Probe, Sources Say</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is trying to establish if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance Holdings</a>, the operator of the world’s largest crypto exchange, has been used to allow Russians to evade Western sanctions, Bloomberg revealed, quoting multiple sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>According to five people who chose to remain anonymous, the Department’s national security division is looking at whether the company or its officials have violated restrictions introduced in relation to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as part of a confidential investigation.</p>
<p>“The probe, which hasn’t previously been reported, is moving on a parallel track with an existing inquiry by the criminal division, one of the people said,” the report detailed, noting that the move adds another layer of scrutiny of the troubled industry’s leading exchange.</p>

<p>The news comes after Russian crypto media reports in late April <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-reportedly-removes-restrictions-on-russian-users/">suggested</a> that Binance has quietly lifted some restrictions on Russian users. According to the information published by different news outlets, Russians can again use their bank cards to make deposits and the trading platform has canceled a limit on their balances introduced in compliance with EU sanctions.</p>
<p>Binance has been in talks with the DOJ in an attempt to resolve complaints related to previous allegations that it was used to bypass sanctions against Iran before introducing stricter compliance controls, Bloomberg added, quoting another person familiar with these developments. In a statement, the company emphasized it complies fully with all U.S. and international sanctions, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2021, Binance launched an initiative to completely overhaul its corporate governance structure, including bringing in a world-class bench of seasoned executives to fundamentally change how Binance operates globally.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also pointed out that its know-your-customer protocols rival any in the traditional banking system and every Binance user is required to pass these procedures which include verifying country of residence and checking personal identification.</p>
<p>“Our policy imposes a zero-tolerance approach to double registrations, anonymous identities, and obscure sources of money,” the exchange stressed. The U.S. Justice Department has so far declined to comment.</p>
<p>Binance has been in the focus of other U.S. investigations, including a probe into its compliance with anti-money laundering requirements led by the Internal Revenue Service and a lawsuit filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been examining if the platform supported the trading of unregistered securities.</p>

Foss expressed his support for &#x201C;hard assets&#x201D; such as real estate, gold, and bitcoin. He believes that bitcoin, the leading crypto asset, is one of the best hard assets available. According to Foss, bitcoin provides insurance against &#x201C;the failure of a basket of fiat currencies.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Foss Supports Holding Hard Assets Like Real Estate, Gold, and Bitcoin</h2>
<p>In less than two months, chaos has erupted in the U.S. banking industry following the second, third, and fourth-largest bank failures in the country&#x2019;s history. During a conversation with Kitco&#x2019;s lead anchor and editor-in-chief, Michelle Makori, <a href="https://twitter.com/foss_sammy">Greg Foss</a> weighed in on Fed chairman Jerome Powell&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">recent statement</a> that the U.S. banking system is &#x201C;sound and resilient.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think Jerome Powell is a horrible poker player,&#x201D; Foss <a href="https://youtu.be/ax-_Tb9zsXQ">opined</a> to Makori. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s another shoe to fall [in the banking industry], or as Elon says, it could be an anvil,&#x201D; Foss added. The Validus Power executive added that he thought Powell&#x2019;s body language &#x201C;reeked of desperation.&#x201D; Foss insisted that the Fed tightened too much because they &#x201C;waited too long to tighten at the outset.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to Foss, the possibility of more banks collapsing is high. While the largest banks are considered &#x201C;too big to fail&#x201D; and will likely receive bailouts, shareholders may not be so lucky. This is where significant financial losses can occur, the Validus Power executive emphasized to Makori. Foss estimates that there is &#x201C;at least $10 trillion of bank equity globally that can literally be wiped out if the system fails.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In his interview, Foss expressed his support for &#x201C;hard assets&#x201D; and specifically mentioned real estate, gold, and bitcoin. While Foss believes that <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> is the best hard asset, he also recognizes the value of gold as an investment. However, Foss advises against selling gold to purchase bitcoin. Instead, he suggests selling a portion of one&#x2019;s bond portfolio to invest in bitcoin. According to Foss, if a person doesn&#x2019;t own bitcoin they are &#x201C;actually taking on more risk.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;You can look at bitcoin as being insurance on the failure of a basket of fiat currencies,&#x201D; Foss told the Kitco anchor. &#x201C;$200 trillion is the liability just of the United States. You take 160 [basis points] times $200 trillion and you get &#x2026; $3.2 trillion would be the implied insurance value on the United States &#x2026; What is bitcoin trading for? Well, about half a trillion dollars,&#x201D; he added. Foss concluded his conversation with Makori by noting that &#x201C;bitcoin is a free and open market,&#x201D; while the &#x201C;Fiat Ponzi is manipulated by guys like Jerome Powell.&#x201D;</p>
