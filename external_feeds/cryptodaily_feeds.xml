			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Michael Saylor&rsquo;s Microstrategy has bought a further 12,333 bitcoins for around $347 million, bringing its total to 152,333 bitcoins.</p>
A last chance to purchase at these prices?
<p>Perhaps seeing the last chance at these prices, Microstrategy has bought more bitcoin over the last month at an average price of $28,136 per bitcoin. The news came to light after the company filed the purchase with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.</p>
<p>All the bitcoin that Microstrategy now owns (152,333) at an average price of $29,668, puts the company above water on its purchases, given that today&rsquo;s bitcoin is worth just over $30,000.</p>
<p>With the bitcoin bull market perhaps just getting started, Microstrategy's purchases are likely to be worth quite a bit more in the next couple of years. It is maybe for this reason that the tech giant chose to make at least one more purchase now, having made its last one only two months ago.</p>

Presidential candidate Kennedy espouses bitcoin
<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. tweeted yesterday that his campaign for the US presidency would accept donations of bitcoin. He was extremely forthright for a US presidential candidate with his views on bitcoin, saying that it was a &ldquo;bulwark against totalitarianism&rdquo;, and defending &ldquo;the right to use and hold bitcoin&rdquo;, calling this right &ldquo;inviolable&rdquo;.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As president, I will make sure that your right to use and hold Bitcoin is inviolable.

</p>
<p>Kennedy also promised to reverse the Biden Administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;growing hostility&rdquo; towards the bitcoin industry and said he would keep this innovation in the US. He added that the ESG agenda should not be used as a &ldquo;smokescreen&rdquo; in order to attack bitcoin.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the latest update in the momentum of the crypto market prices, analysts are beginning to look at predictions for some of the most notable altcoins. Litecoin and Chainlink have specifically grabbed a lot of attention with their upswing, but amidst all of the bullish momentum, another player is on the horizon known as Tradecurve, which is currently in the presale run and has been making waves with its potential for exponential growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, we decided to go to AI-driven tools like Google Bard to see what kind of outlook it has for all three cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>Litecoin is expected to surge to $500 by the end of the year</li>
<li>Chainlink can exceed investor expectations and can climb to $50</li>
<li>Tradecurve can climb in value by 100x, according to Google Bard</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
Litecoin Seen as One of the Best Altcoins According to Google Bard
<p>Google Bard predicts a bullish pattern in the future of the Litecoin cryptocurrency. The key reasons why Google Bard believes Litecoin can grow in value include the increased adoption of LItecoin as a payment method, alongside more people buying LTC as a form of investment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Google Bard noted how there is positive news surrounding the Litecoin cryptocurrency and a lot of speculation that can lead to sudden price movements. Litecoin is predicted to climb anywhere between $200 to $500, according to Google Bard, by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>As of June 26, 2023, Litecoin traded at a value of $88.64. Within the last seven days, the cryptocurrency saw its low point of value at $76.29, while its high point was at a value of $92.50. The overall price increase in the last seven days has been at 14.6%, and in the last year, Litecoin surged by 48.7%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Bullish Future for Chainlink According to Google Bard
<p>Google Bard also had a bullish outlook for the Chainlink cryptocurrency, driven by its appeal in both investor circles and investors on a global scale. Positive news coverage surrounding the Chainlink cryptocurrency can fuel its growth alongside developments in its ecosystem. New features are consistently being rolled out, and 2023 has not been an exception to this growth. As a result, there is an estimation that Chainlink can climb between $25 to $50 by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as of June 26, 2023, Chainlink trades at $6.17. During the past week, the low point for Chainlink was at $5.02, while the high point was at $6.34. The overall price increase in the last seven days for Chainlink was at 20.9%, indicating a bullish pattern.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Google Bard Estimates that Tradecurve Can Explode in Value
<p>Amidst this market rally, alongside Litecoin and Chainlink, another cryptocurrency grabbed attention from the market and grew by 80% since its beginning its Tradecurve, in the last week alone, it went up in value by 20%. Now, at Stage 4 of its presale, Tradecurve trades at $0.018, and at Stage 5 next week, it will climb by 40% to $0.025.</p>
<p>This growth has been fueled due to the array of unique features and the promising roadmap it has. What helps Tradecurve stand out from competitors such as Binance and Kraken, according to Google Bard, is that it will not require any sign-up KYC checks, which will make it inclusive for anyone from anywhere in the world. KYC procedures can be time-consuming and can involve manual verification, delaying the account creation process and removing anonymity completely.</p>
<p>Google Bard also noted how users can trade immediately just by making a deposit in crypto, which will be used as collateral on top of the platform. This fact, combined with the privacy provided by Tradecurve, will make it the most desirable trading platform for those who are conscious about their information and want to avoid it getting leaked from platforms that are heavily centralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other features behind Tradecurve that can help it grow in value, according to Google Bard, include high leverage starting at 500:1, a VIP account system, negative balance protection, and the implementation of Proof of Reserves (PoR) alongside Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) as a security measurement.</p>
<p>So far, the team has raised $2.8 million, and 12,500 users have signed up. The team predicts that they will be able to raise $20 million and that they can onboard 100,000 users during the first three months of operation. According to Google Bard, due to all of these aspects, Tradecurve can climb to $1.8 by the end of Q4 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Web3, with its vision of a digital world where individuals have control over their data and enjoy secure online transactions, holds great promise for the future. However, this vision is currently undermined by the prevalence of hacks and breaches that continue to plague the Web3 ecosystem. In 2022 alone, over 450 security breaches resulted in the theft of a staggering $4 billion USD in cryptocurrency, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures.</p>
<p>Decentralized applications (DApps), including those utilizing traditional multisig wallets, face a myriad of vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. These vulnerabilities range from coding errors in smart contracts to compromised decentralized storage systems and targeted attacks on individual users through phishing and social engineering tactics. The repercussions of such attacks can be devastating, both for the affected individuals and for the broader adoption of Web3 technologies.</p>
<p>"To effectively address these concerns, security must be prioritized from the start," emphasized Junming Tan, Crypto Incident Response Investigator APAC at Chainalysis Inc. To protect their digital assets and identities, Web3 users are advised to utilize hardware wallets, enable two-factor authentication, and stay vigilant against phishing attempts. Martinet Lee, Head of Developer Relations at Quantstamp, emphasized the significance of verifying application authenticity and staying informed about potential threats.</p>
<p>Following industry standards can ensure higher security in Web3 projects. Tu Phan, Founder and CEO of Desig Labs, highlighted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To keep users from harm in Web3, projects need to proactively prioritize security measures such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, and secure key management in the battle against hacks and exploits. Desig, for example, employs innovative techniques that eliminate the need for passphrases and leverages zero-knowledge technology to protect private keys from phishing attempts and key recreation by attackers.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>
<p>However, addressing security challenges in Web3 requires more than just individual efforts. The establishment of regulatory frameworks and standards that cover secure development practices, data protection, privacy standards, and auditing requirements is paramount. Collaboration between regulatory bodies, industry experts, and technologists is essential to striking a balance between innovation and security. Open-source initiatives within the Web3 space, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), encourage community collaboration to enhance security practices and foster a more secure ecosystem.</p>
<p>Bug bounty programs and responsible disclosure programs play a crucial role in the Web3 security landscape. These initiatives incentivize ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities, allowing developers to proactively address them. Responsible disclosure programs provide a platform for reporting vulnerabilities, ensuring timely mitigation, and reducing the window of opportunity for potential exploits.</p>
<p>Fortunately, emerging trends and technologies offer promising avenues for improved security in Web3 applications. Zero-knowledge proofs, for instance, enable private transactions and verifiable computations, bolstering privacy and security. Advancements in decentralized identity systems and blockchain interoperability contribute to stronger security measures. Projects like Desig Protocol are leveraging these novel technologies early on, aiming to provide a safe and secure environment for Web3 users, enabling them to explore and enjoy the space with confidence.</p>
<p>In their workshop session during the event, Tu Phan, Founder and CEO of Desig Labs, demonstrated how users can leverage Desig to enhance security, manage team finance, DAO or gaming guild operations, and explore any Web3 DApp on any chain with a single Desig wallet. The beta version of Desig will be officially launched in June, followed by activation campaigns with multiple prominent and emerging Layer 1s. Details will be released on their Twitter page.</p>
<p>By addressing security concerns head-on, both developers and users can contribute to creating a safer Web3 ecosystem. This approach will unlock the full potential of decentralization and the enhanced security offered by Web3, paving the way for a brighter and more secure digital future. With collaborative efforts, robust security measures, and the integration of cutting-edge technologies, we can build a Web3 ecosystem that ensures the protection of user data and facilitates secure online transactions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The much-awaited Azuki Elementals NFT collection has sold out in a record 15 minutes and has raked in a whopping $38 million.&nbsp;</p>
Elementals Rakes In $38M In Presale
<p>The fervor around Azuki Elementals has resulted in the collection being whisked off just 15 minutes after its drop. The third iteration of the highly popular Azuki universe, the Elementals collection, covers four different domains - Lightning, Earth, Water, and Fire. Although there were 20,000 NFTs in the collection, they did not even make it to the public sale market. The first 10,000 NFTs were directly airdropped to Azuki holders during the recent Vegas event. The remaining 10,000 NFTs were put up for presale, first for Azuki holders and ten minutes later for Beanz holders. The initial plan was to follow the presale up with a public auction. However, the entire collection got sold out within 15 minutes of minting for 20,000 ETH, which is around $38 million.&nbsp;</p>
Frustration And Disappointment?&nbsp;
<p>The minting process evoked diverse responses, with numerous individuals, primarily Azuki holders, expressing joy and satisfaction over their successful minting experience. However, there was an overwhelming sense of frustration from those who were unable to secure a mint and disappointment from those who were not happy with the NFTs themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there was no minting cap imposed on the presale, many Azuki holders took the opportunity to mint more than 10 NFTs, with one user minting a total of 332 Elementals. As a result, even many Beanz holders were unable to participate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, many users commented on the Elementals collection, claiming that the anime art bore a striking resemblance to the original Azuki collection.&nbsp;</p>
Azuki&rsquo;s Response
<p>The Azuki team has taken the negative feedback in its stride and responded to it on Twitter, claiming that the goal was to create characters that felt consistent with the Azuki aesthetic while offering something new by introducing the domains and the unique traits and features tied to the specific domains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's always both challenging &amp; exciting opening up the gate to the Garden. This time, we missed the mark. We hear you - the mint process was hectic, the PFPs feel similar and, even worse, dilutive to Azuki&hellip;However, our ambitious goals led to a new collection which confused the community on the tangible differences with the original Azuki collection&hellip;Azuki&rsquo;s vision is to build a decentralized brand. Doing so requires great communication and execution, both of which were lacking with the Elementals sale. We know that we lost a piece of trust today, but nothing gets us more motivated to make things right.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Swiss National Bank (SNB) will pilot a wholesale CBDC on the Swiss SIX digital exchange.</p>
<p>It was announced by the chairman of the SNB at a conference on Monday that the central bank will pilot a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>
<p>Chairman Thomas Jordan, quoted by Reuters, said of the pilot:</p>

<p>"This is not just an experiment, it will be real money equivalent to bank reserves and the objective is to test real transactions with market participants,"&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the subject of retail CBDCs Jordan was more circumspect. He admitted that they implied a risk to the financial system and that their use was &ldquo;more difficult to control&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We do not exclude that we will never introduce retail [CBDCs] but nevertheless we are a little bit prudent at the moment,"</p>

<p>The chairman of the SNB may say that he is being &ldquo;a little bit prudent&rdquo; but behind the scenes, as well as openly, many countries&rsquo; central banks are racing to complete their CBDCs in what they would probably perceive as the only way to keep the fiat monetary system going.</p>
<p>The Bank of International Settlements (BIS), which is considered the central bank of all the world&rsquo;s central banks, has urged all countries to speed up their development of CBDCs, stating its concerns over crypto and stablecoins.</p>
<p>As fiat currencies become more worthless at an ever-increasing rate, it is likely to be far more difficult for governments and central banks to maintain the narrative that it is right and proper for citizens to keep cash in the bank.</p>
CBDC in the UK
<p>In the UK, inflation is higher and more persistent than in most other European countries, and with mortgage owners already screaming with the pain of interest rates that have tripled in the last two years, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.</p>
<p>The UK does appear to be taking consumer concerns into account with its own potential CBDC rollout. Privacy is being dealt with by the integration of zero-knowledge proof technology. However, that is not to say that this particular element might be withdrawn once CBDCs are fully implemented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter how they may be dressed up, CBDCs will only ever be another manifestation of fiat currency. Every single fiat currency in the history of the world has failed and has gone to zero.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin is outside of this system, is sound money with a fixed supply and cannot be manipulated or confiscated by any government or agency. It is incumbent on every citizen to educate themselves on this asset. Their future may depend on it.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Swiss National Bank (SNB) will pilot a wholesale CBDC on the Swiss SIX digital exchange.</p>
<p>It was announced by the chairman of the SNB at a conference on Monday that the central bank will pilot a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>
<p>Chairman Thomas Jordan, quoted by Reuters, said of the pilot:</p>

<p>"This is not just an experiment, it will be real money equivalent to bank reserves and the objective is to test real transactions with market participants,"&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the subject of retail CBDCs Jordan was more circumspect. He admitted that they implied a risk to the financial system and that their use was &ldquo;more difficult to control&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We do not exclude that we will never introduce retail [CBDCs] but nevertheless we are a little bit prudent at the moment,"</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Nevada&rsquo;s Financial Institutions Division has placed crypto firm Prime into receivership, having taken control of the company, and has frozen its businesses and operations.</p>
<p>The Financial Institutions Division had earlier indicated that Prime Trust had a significant deficit on its books, alleging that it had lost access to several legacy crypto wallets in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
Prime Trust Holds A Fraction Of What Is Owed To Clients&nbsp;
<p>Prime Trust was previously a financial infrastructure provider for Binance US and several others. According to the receivership request filed in Nevada, Prime Trust owes its clients over $85 million in fiat but currently has only around $3 million available on hand. Furthermore, the company also owes its clients $69.5 million in crypto but holds around $68 million in crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move by the Nevada Financial Institutions Division comes just days after BitGo called off its bid to acquire the embattled crypto firm. Furthermore, it also follows a cease-and-desist order filed by the state alleging that Prime Trust was on the verge of insolvency. The filing also added that the crypto custodian was operating with a $12 million equity deficit. According to the filing, at least some part of this shortfall comes from Prime Trust losing access to its legacy crypto wallets.&nbsp;</p>
The Fireblocks Agreement&nbsp;
<p>In 2020, Prime Trust entered into an agreement with Fireblocks, with the latter to manage its crypto assets. In 2021, Prime Trust&rsquo;s new management set up &ldquo;legacy wallet forwarding&rdquo; for wallets that were earlier on the Fireblocks platform. After reverting back to legacy wallets in January 2021, the company discovered in December 2021 that it could not access its legacy wallets, losing access to all the cryptocurrencies held within them as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was alleged that while Prime Trust could not access these wallets, it allegedly used its clients&rsquo; fiat currency accounts to purchase crypto assets, which were used to process crypto-denominated withdrawals. The company&rsquo;s efforts to access its legacy wallets have proven unsuccessful. The filing stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is understood that from December 2021 to March 2022, to satisfy the withdrawals from the inaccessible Legacy Wallets, [Prime] purchased additional digital currency using customer money from its omnibus customer accounts. [Prime] is reported to have been making efforts to regain access to the Legacy Wallets. However, as of the date of this Petition, [Prime] has been unable to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The filing also stated that the company&rsquo;s financial condition could only worsen as customers withdraw their funds. According to Fireblocks communications head Gaby Hui, the legacy wallets in question are all controlled by Prime Trust, and no Fireblock funds are in limbo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After Prime Trust became a Fireblocks customer, new management made a decision to deposit Prime Trust&rsquo;s customer assets in old legacy wallets. Once management moved those assets to the legacy wallets, the customer assets were not recoverable. These legacy wallets were not Fireblocks wallets.&rdquo;</p>

Prime Trust And FID Both Requested Receivership&nbsp;
<p>The filing also indicated that both Prime Trust and the Financial Institutions Division requested the receivership. It also asks for preliminary injunctive relief, stating that such relief would be in the public&rsquo;s interest, given there is a threat of immediate, irreparable harm. A press release by a spokesperson for the Financial Institutions Division stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The petition asks the court to appoint a receiver to take over the day-to-day operations of the company and thoroughly examine all its finances to determine the best option to protect Prime&rsquo;s clients, either by rehabilitating and returning the company to private management or by liquidating the company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The filing has also asked for a ban on Prime Trust, along with its officers, directors, stakeholders, and others associated with the firm, from disposing of its assets or conducting transactions on behalf of the firm. In an affidavit signed by Nevada Commissioner Sandy O&rsquo;Laughlin, both FID and Prime Trust agreed that Meadows Bank Director Paul Huygens, Bank of Nevada CEO John Guedry, or former Meadows Bank CEO Arvind Menon could be possible receivers.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Major asset manager Fidelity is preparing to submit its own application for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), joining other big money asset managers such as BlackRock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BlackRock had recently submitted its own spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund on the 15th of June, sparking considerable interest from other asset managers.&nbsp;</p>
Fidelity Preparing Bitcoin ETF Filing As Race Heats Up&nbsp;
<p>With its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, Fidelity will join a growing list of institutions that are competing to be the first to introduce and get approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The filing sees Fidelity follow BlackRock, the world&rsquo;s largest asset manager, in filing for an ETF. According to reports, Fidelity&rsquo;s application could be filed as soon as this week and would be Fidelity&rsquo;s second attempt at launching a spot bitcoin ETF. Fidelity also filed an application in 2022 but failed to get approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past couple of weeks, several asset managers, such as Invesco (IVS.N), WisdomTree (WT.N), Bitwise, VacEck, and the already mentioned BlackRock, have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot Bitcoin ETF. As a result of the applications, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has also seen a considerable increase, rising to a one-year high of over $31,000 on the 23rd of June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fidelity is a prominent player in the financial space, with over $11 trillion in assets under management. Additionally, it has been involved with the crypto ecosystem since 2018, operating trading and institutional custody services. It has also offered fund products to its European clientele since February 2022 through Fidelity International.</p>
A Game-Changing Development&nbsp;
<p>According to market experts, the potential launch of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund could be a game-changing development, giving investors exposure to the crypto market without requiring them to acquire or hold the underlying asset. BlackRock&rsquo;s filing for an ETF has aroused considerable interest in bitcoin ETFs once again, given the firm&rsquo;s significance, size, and standing. According to senior market analyst at Oanda, Edward Moya, there is considerable optimism in the markets at present.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of optimism here that you&rsquo;re going to get a bitcoin ETF. If that does get done, it could open the door for much more institutional money and probably some high-net-worth retail traders to get back into crypto.&rdquo;</p>

Will The SEC Change Its Stance?&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has allowed Futures-based bitcoin ETFs since October 2021. These track the price of bitcoin futures contracts. However, when it comes to spot bitcoin ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected several applications. Spot bitcoin ETFs are publicly traded investment vehicles that track the price of Bitcoin, stating that it had concerns that the underlying markets could be manipulated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, many feel that BlackRock applying for a spot bitcoin ETF could be a game changer because the asset manager files for ETFs only when it knows it can get them approved. The filing has also helped to reverse the negative perception of Bitcoin and the larger cryptocurrency markets to some degree. According to Alex Adelman from the crypto rewards fund Lolli, the recent spot ETF filings could act as a vote of confidence for the larger crypto ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity provide the expertise and custodial services top retailers rely on to serve global consumers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crypto markets have been rattled by a series of adverse events and shutdowns, the most prominent being the collapse of FTX, which authorities alleged was running a multi-billion dollar fraud. More recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and Coinbase, alleging that both violated several rules, an accusation both entities deny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC itself has come under legal troubles, with Grayscale Investments suing the regulator over its rejection of Grayscale&rsquo;s application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The case hinges on the fact that the Securities and Exchange Commission having previously approved certain surveillance agreements to prevent fraud in bitcoin futures-based ETFs. Grayscale has argued that the same should apply to its spot fund.&nbsp;</p>
BlackRock&rsquo;s Filing&nbsp;
<p>BlackRock filed its spot bitcoin ETF application on the 15th of June, 2023. According to the filing by the Nasdaq stock exchange with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coinbase Custody Trust Company will be the custodian of the fund&rsquo;s Bitcoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon will be the custodian of the fund&rsquo;s fiat currency. If approved, BlackRock&rsquo;s ETF will be the first crypto spot ETF in the United States of America.</p>

As a result of the applications, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has also seen a considerable increase, rising to a one-year high of over $31,000 on the 23rd of June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fidelity is a prominent player in the financial space, with over $11 trillion in assets under management. Additionally, it has been involved with the crypto ecosystem since 2018, operating trading and institutional custody services. It has also offered fund products to its European clientele since February 2022 through Fidelity International.</p>
A Game-Changing Development&nbsp;
<p>According to market experts, the potential launch of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund could be a game-changing development, giving investors exposure to the crypto market without requiring them to acquire or hold the underlying asset. BlackRock&rsquo;s filing for an ETF has aroused considerable interest in bitcoin ETFs once again, given the firm&rsquo;s significance, size, and standing. According to senior market analyst at Oanda, Edward Moya, there is considerable optimism in the markets at present.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of optimism here that you&rsquo;re going to get a bitcoin ETF. If that does get done, it could open the door for much more institutional money and probably some high-net-worth retail traders to get back into crypto.&rdquo;</p>

Will The SEC Change Its Stance?&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has allowed Futures-based bitcoin ETFs since October 2021. These track the price of bitcoin futures contracts. However, when it comes to spot bitcoin ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected several applications. Spot bitcoin ETFs are publicly traded investment vehicles that track the price of Bitcoin, stating that it had concerns that the underlying markets could be manipulated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, many feel that BlackRock applying for a spot bitcoin ETF could be a game changer because the asset manager files for ETFs only when it knows it can get them approved. The filing has also helped to reverse the negative perception of Bitcoin and the larger cryptocurrency markets to some degree. According to Alex Adelman from the crypto rewards fund Lolli, the recent spot ETF filings could act as a vote of confidence for the larger crypto ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity provide the expertise and custodial services top retailers rely on to serve global consumers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crypto markets have been rattled by a series of adverse events and shutdowns, the most prominent being the collapse of FTX, which authorities alleged was running a multi-billion dollar fraud. More recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and Coinbase, alleging that both violated several rules, an accusation both entities deny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC itself has come under legal troubles, with Grayscale Investments suing the regulator over its rejection of Grayscale&rsquo;s application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The case hinges on the fact that the Securities and Exchange Commission having previously approved certain surveillance agreements to prevent fraud in bitcoin futures-based ETFs. Grayscale has argued that the same should apply to its spot fund.&nbsp;</p>
BlackRock&rsquo;s Filing&nbsp;
<p>BlackRock filed its spot bitcoin ETF application on the 15th of June, 2023. According to the filing by the Nasdaq stock exchange with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coinbase Custody Trust Company will be the custodian of the fund&rsquo;s Bitcoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon will be the custodian of the fund&rsquo;s fiat currency. If approved, BlackRock&rsquo;s ETF will be the first crypto spot ETF in the United States of America.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Law Commission recommends reform and development of the law on digital assets to secure UK&rsquo;s position as a global crypto hub.</p>
Summary Overview
<p>The Law Commission recommends:</p>
<ul>
<li>First-ever Government-commissioned common law analysis showing how the law in England and Wales can accommodate digital assets, like NFTs and crypto-tokens.</li>
<li>Law Commission report advocates for common law reform and development to provide greater clarity to users and attract technological innovation.</li>
<li>Recommendation for legislation to confirm the existence of a distinct category of personal property which can acknowledge the unique features of digital assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Law Commission of England and Wales has today (Wednesday, 28 June) published recommendations for the reform and development of the law relating to digital assets.</p>
<p>Digital assets &ndash; which include crypto-tokens (sometimes referred to as &lsquo;cryptocurrencies&rsquo;) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) &ndash; are used for an increasing variety of purposes in modern society, such as for investment, for making payments, and for linking to or embodying debt and equity securities.</p>
<p>Over the last 15 years, personal property law in England and Wales has proven sufficiently flexible to accommodate digital assets. However, as the digital asset market and related technology continue to change, there remains some residual legal uncertainty and complexity.</p>
<p>The Government therefore asked the Law Commission to carry out a first-ever rigorous common law analysis, showing how the law in England and Wales can respond to this kind of emerging technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s recommendations for reform and development of the law aim to provide a comprehensive legal foundation for digital assets which will allow these new technologies to flourish, enabling a diverse range of market participants to interact with and benefit from them.</p>
UK Law is Well Suited to Accommodate Crypto
<p>In its report, the Commission shows that the common law of England and Wales is well placed to provide a coherent and globally relevant regime for existing and new types of digital asset.</p>
<p>Because digital assets are not tangible and differ significantly from physical assets, and from rights-based assets like debts and financial securities, they do not fit within traditional categories of personal property. Nonetheless, the Commission argues that the flexibility of common law can accommodate a distinct category of personal property to better recognise and protect their unique features. The Commission also recommends legislation to confirm the existence of this category and remove any uncertainty.</p>
<p>To ensure that courts can respond sensitively to the complexity of emerging technology, the Commission calls on Government to create a panel of industry experts who can provide guidance on technical and legal issues relating to the control of digital assets.</p>
<p>The Commission also makes recommendations to provide market participants with legal tools that do not yet exist in England and Wales, such as new ways to take security over crypto-tokens and tokenised securities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s recommendations for reform and common law development aim to create a clear and consistent framework for digital assets that will provide greater clarity and security to users and market participants. The recommendations also support the Government&rsquo;s goal of attracting technological development to cement the position of England and Wales as a global hub for crypto-tokens and crypto-assets.</p>
<p>Professor Sarah Green, Law Commissioner for Commercial and Common Law, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The use and importance of digital assets has grown significantly in the law few years. The flexibility of the common law means that the legal system in England and Wales is well placed to adapt to this rapid growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recommendations for reform and development of the law therefore seek to solidify the legal foundation for digital assets. We also aim to ensure that the private law in England and Wales remains a dynamic, globally competitive and flexible tool that enables further technological innovation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Justice Minister Mike Freer commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The UK is a world leader in legal innovation and these findings demonstrate the strength of English and Welsh law in responding to the fast-paced changes caused by emerging technologies in the law sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must ensure our law remains equipped to meet the complexities of these technologies well into the future, and we will carefully consider these findings as we look to further strengthen the future of our globally-renowned legal system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew Griffith, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our reputation for straight dealing, use of the English language and flexible common law attracts business across the world.</p>
<p>This, combined with our straightforward approach to regulating crypto-assets puts the UK at the vanguard of innovation to drive growth in digital assets and boost our economy.</p>
<p>I firmly welcome the Law Commission&rsquo;s Final Report on Digital Assets and the work done to meet the complexities of these technologies well into the future &ndash; and will carefully consider their findings and recommendations.&rdquo;</p>

The Law Commission&rsquo;s recommendations for reform of the law on digital assets are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Legislation to confirm&nbsp;the existence of a distinct third category of personal property&nbsp;under the law which can better recognise, accommodate and protect the unique features of digital assets. The report does not set out clear boundaries for this third category, arguing instead that common law is the best vehicle to determine which objects can fit within it. This will allow for a nuanced approach to recognising that things such as crypto-tokens, export quotas or different types of carbon emissions allowance can be objects of personal property rights.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Creation of a&nbsp;panel of industry-specific technical experts, legal practitioners, academics and judges&nbsp;to provide non-binding advice to courts on complex legal issues relating to digital assets.</li>
<li>Creation of a&nbsp;bespoke legal framework&nbsp;that better facilitates the entering into, operation and enforcement of collateral arrangements relating to crypto-tokens and crypto-assets.</li>
<li>Statutory law reform to clarify whether certain digital assets fall within the scope of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003.</li>
</ol>
What Is A Digital Asset?
<p>Digital asset is a broad term which covers a variety of non-tangible assets in digital form. These can include digital files, email accounts, domain names, and crypto-tokens, including cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technology used to create these assets and the characteristics of each asset can vary greatly.</p>
What Is A Crypto-Token?&nbsp;
<p>A crypto-token is a type of digital asset that uses cryptography &ndash; the process of coding information so that it can be transferred securely. Crypto-tokens are digital tokens that can be traded, used to record, embody or link to another asset or legal right, or used as a store of value.</p>
<p>One type of crypto-token is a&nbsp;non-fungible token (NFT), which is a crypto-token that is unique or capable of being differentiated from other crypto-tokens. NFTs are often linked to data, such as data representing digital artwork, but they can also be used to link to a wide range of assets and rights.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;crypto-token&rdquo; is sometimes used interchangeably with &ldquo;cryptocurrency&rdquo;. While they have many overlapping features, cryptocurrency is a term that generally refers to crypto-tokens that are largely intended to be used for making payments as digital currencies, while crypto-tokens are used for this and a number of additional purposes, outlined above.</p>
<p>The law treats crypto-tokens, NFTs and cryptocurrency as things that exist through the combination of the active operation of software by a network of participants and specific data used by that software and network.</p>
Next Steps
<p>It is now for the Government to decide whether it intends to take the commission&rsquo;s recommendations forward.</p>
<p>An embargoed summary of the digital assets report is&nbsp;available here.</p>
<p>The full report will be published&nbsp;on this page&nbsp;of the Law Commission website on Wednesday 28 June.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Eden Island, Republic of Seychelles, June 27th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>A new PEPE memecoin is launching, following hot on the heels of its Ethereum namesake. Issued as a BEP20 on BNB Chain, PEPE is a novel memecoin with a number of unique mechanisms programmed into its tokenomics.</p><p>Like the original PEPE token, which has proven a runaway success in 2023, the BEP20 PEPE draws its cues from the mischievous frog of the same name, whose design was derived from the webcomic "Boy's Club."</p><p>The market capitalization of the original PEPE token, which debuted on Ethereum in April, exceeded $1 billion on May 5th, prompting a new wave of memecoins, including a number of frog-themed efforts. Unlike subsequent memecoins, the PEPE (BEP20) has several unusual features programmed in including a syndication system designed to support price stabilization.</p><p>The team behind the BNB Chain PEPE aren&rsquo;t settling for just one memecoin either: they plan to launch multiple PEPE projects, all based on the loveable frog. 13 such launches have been cued up for 2023 alone.</p><p>Although each PEPE project will operate independently, the introduction of a "Burn &amp; Drop" system will govern the consortium. Burn &amp; Drop is a first-of-its-kind system in which burning one token leads to the airdrop of another.</p><p>To initiate a Burn &amp; Drop, two types of tokens are required. For example, this could involve a scenario in which Token A is priced at $1 and PEPE (BEP20) is also priced at $1. However, if the price of Token A were to drop to $0.8, Token A holders would have the option to burn their tokens on the Burn &amp; Drop platform, automatically receiving PEPE (BEP20) through an airdrop, and with Token A having been burned, its total supply would decrease.</p><p></p><p>By initiating the Burn &amp; Drop process between tokens, excess volatility can be reduced while possibly providing trading opportunities for arbitrage and intra-token trading. This logic is a fundamental component of PEPE (BEP20), and one which users can engage with directly within the platform.</p><p>In addition, PEPE (BEP20) has plans to introduce numerous services that will further extend the token&rsquo;s utility. To further increase interest in the project, PEPE (BEP20) is currently running an airdrop campaign on Twitter that&rsquo;s open to everyone.</p><p>About PEPEBEP20</p><p>PEPE is a project launched on the Binance Smart Chain, taking the form of a BEP20 token. The Pepe Syndicate and the unique "Burn&amp;Drop" mechanism of Pepe are designed to manage the token's price volatility.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Road Town, BVI, June 27th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, listed Disney (DIS) on June 27, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the DIS/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading.</p><p>Disney (DIS) is a meme token issued by the relevant communities of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and mining.</p><p>Introducing Disney</p><p>LBank Exchange is thrilled to announce the upcoming listing of Disney (DIS), a meme token that was initiated by Miningtw Technology Co., Ltd., a collaborative team based in Hong Kong and Taiwan. This token was issued by various communities involved in blockchain, cryptocurrency, and mining. The token is intended for use in various capacities such as interactive activities, event rewards, gifts, charitable endeavors, and aspirational purposes. With an economic model in which 50% of its circulating supply is committed to pledge mining for a period exceeding 5 years, users are rewarded proportionately per second based on the total amount of their pledges. The goal is to create a value that is worth holding and collecting over the long term. However, it's worth noting that DIS has no association with Walt Disney and their similar names are purely coincidental. Despite sharing a similar name, they operate in distinct domains and scopes, with the meme tokens existing purely for the sake of amusement and enjoyment.</p><p>DIS token is a meme cryptocurrency, created with the intention of fostering fun and innovation. It is committed to building a democratic, transparent, and equitable community grounded on blockchain technology. The token was conceived by DaddyPig, a Hong Kong native who immigrated to Taiwan in search of democratic freedoms. In collaboration with Taiwan, DaddyPig established Miningtw Technology Co., Ltd. Starting off as a cryptocurrency miner, the company branched out to construct large mining facilities, dedicating itself to the development of several blockchain projects. These projects include the creation of a decentralized exchange (DEX) and several other blockchain ecosystem initiatives. DaddyPig has actively participated in blockchain development endeavors, such as Ethereum's PoS fork, the maintenance of EthereumFair (ETHF) under a PoW consensus mechanism, and the fork of DogeCoin from the Scrypt algorithm to the ETHASH algorithm, resulting in DogeW. Upholding the principle of decentralization, DaddyPig has invested significant resources in anticipation of the potential and future prospects of Web3.</p><p>About DIS Token</p><p>Based on BEP-20, DIS has a total supply of 100 million (i.e. 100,000,000). In a move to incentivize DIS token holders, a five-year liquidity mining program has been launched, dedicating 50 million tokens, or half of the total issuance, to the staking mining reward pool. Approximately 27,397 DIS tokens will be distributed daily, or around 0.317 DIS per second, based on the total number of staked tokens. Additionally, 10% of the total DIS issuance, which equates to 10 million DIS tokens, will be locked for staking over a five-year span, with economic model and deflation mechanism, please refer to the white paper for details. It was listed on LBank Exchange at 9:00 UTC on June 27, 2023, investors who are interested in DIS can easily buy and sell it on LBank Exchange now.

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/plynk-kucoin-offer-warm-welcome-as-caged-beasts-coin-joins-top-passive-income-cryptos</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency is not merely about acquiring and holding altcoins; its potential for passive income cannot be overlooked. Picture yourself earning revenue effortlessly, without having to lift a finger. Moreover, crypto exchange platforms are upping the ante with their enticing welcome rewards. Among these are KuCoin and Plynk, but a newcomer is making waves: Caged Beasts Coin has joined the rank of Top passive income cryptos. Unlock the secrets of these offerings and maximise your profits.</p>
Plynk Has &ldquo;$50 For You&rdquo;
<p>Plynk is an SEC-regulated trading app designed for US investors. It provides a user-friendly platform where beginners can trade various instruments like stocks, fractional shares, mutual funds, and ETFs. In collaboration with Paxos Trust Co., Plynk introduced crypto trading in 2022. Users can trade and hold popular coins such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) through Paxos. Existing Plynk app users can apply for a crypto account offered by Paxos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, Plynk is offering a $50 promotion. To qualify, open a new account on the app and link a bank account. You receive a $10 bonus just for signing up. When you&nbsp; deposit at least $25 within 15 calendar days of linking their eligible bank account,&nbsp; $50 will be credited to your account within 30 days of the Qualification Period, which starts when the bank account is linked.</p>
Avail KuCoin&rsquo;s New User Rewards
<p>The crypto exchange Kucoin offers great advantages such as high liquidity, low fees, and fast withdrawals. It was established in 2017 by Leon Kuensingh, who observed a shift of traders from Binance to Coinbase due to the recent ban on crypto trading on US exchanges.</p>
<p>New users who register on KuCoin can enjoy rewards of up to $100 USDT. These rewards are earned when users complete their first deposit or crypto purchase, make their first trade, and engage in pro trading. The rewards include USDT and valuable coupons, which can add up to a total worth of 3200 USDT. To receive these rewards, users need to fulfil the designated tasks within 60 days of signing up for their KuCoin account. It's important to note that each user can only receive each reward once.</p>
Caged Beasts&rsquo;s 20% USDT Commission
<p></p>
<p>Caged Beasts Coin (BEASTS) is no ordinary cryptocurrency. Aiming to overthrow the dominance of a privileged few and redistribute financial power to the masses, the BEASTS are out to start the DeFi Revolution and here&rsquo;s why they might just do it.</p>
<p>Community is at the heart of the BEASTS ecosystem. The referral scheme, for example, allows holders to bag a 20% USDT commission instantly. All you have to do is visit the website, select the 'Earn USDT' option, connect your wallet and generate a referral code to share. Each user can earn a generous 20% of any deposits made by their referrals, which is automatically added to their wallet. That&rsquo;s not all: the user who uses the referral code also receives a 20% share.</p>
<p>The token tells the tale of Rabbit 4001, who embarks on a quest to gather a group of rebels. During the token's presale journey, Rabbit 4001 bestows young animals with mutagens and cybernetic enhancements, symbolising the growth and accumulation of locked funds over time. The name itself, Caged Beasts, is a clever take on the concept of Caged Liquidity. The referral system aims to cultivate a united and expanding community that rewards its members, while the project as a whole thrives through active involvement and contributions from individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
The Takeaway
<p>With their respective welcome bonuses, KuCoin &amp; Plynk are top-notch platforms to consider for trading crypto. However, in the quest for the top passive income cryptos, Caged Beasts Coin emerges as a contender. Brace yourself for the imminent DeFi Revolution, spearheaded by none other than the mighty BEASTS.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Circle, the issuer of the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin, has announced the operationalization of its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) on Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This integration enables faster and more secure transfers of USDC across several blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Avalanche, and now Arbitrum.</p>
Enhanced Functionality with CCTP
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">CCTP facilitates the movement of USDC across different blockchain networks by employing a burn-and-mint mechanism. Native USDC tokens on the original chain are burnt, and an equivalent amount is minted on the receiving chain. This mechanism enhances the efficiency and security of USDC transfers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Arbitrum is the third chain to support CCTP, and the protocol is live on the official Arbitrum Bridge. The addition of CCTP to Arbitrum follows Circle's recent announcement of a native version of its stablecoin on the Arbitrum network.</p>
Integration with Other Protocols
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Several other bridge projects and interoperability-centric protocols, such as Celer Network, Li.Fi, Wormhole, O3 Labs, Wanchain, and Router Protocol, have incorporated CCTP into their systems. These integrations enable USDC transfers via their respective platforms.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, the integration of CCTP with Arbitrum is expected to replace the traditional "lock-and-mint" bridging process typically used for transferring tokens between chains. This conventional mechanism has been associated with security issues in the past. Using CCTP instead can expedite bridge transfers, improving efficiency and security.</p>
The Growth of USDC
<p class="md-end-block md-p">USDC is currently the second-largest centralized stablecoin in the market after USD Tether, boasting a supply close to $28 billion. Its increasing adoption and the integration with Arbitrum underline the significant role it plays in the crypto landscape.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Circle expressed its enthusiasm for the CCTP integration with Arbitrum in a series of tweets. The company highlighted that the integration simplified the process of moving USDC natively to Arbitrum, enabling direct transfers to and from Ethereum and Avalanche.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As a many-to-many messaging protocol, CCTP can now burn and mint USDC through six unique routes between its three supported chains. Each new chain added automatically connects to all existing CCTP chains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Users receive native USDC with CCTP, eliminating the need for lock-and-mint bridging. This development brings added security and capital efficiency to the process of sending USDC across supported chains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The protocol also allows for a swift return of USDC to Ethereum, bypassing withdrawal delays when moving liquidity from Layer 2 solutions to Layer 1.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Circle's CCTP offers developers the opportunity to build applications offering native cross-chain deposits, swaps, purchases, and more. As such, the integration promises significant improvements to the cross-chain capabilities of the ecosystem.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Circle, the issuer of the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin, has announced the operationalization of its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) on Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This integration enables faster and more secure transfers of USDC across several blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Avalanche, and now Arbitrum.</p>
Enhanced Functionality with CCTP
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">CCTP facilitates the movement of USDC across different blockchain networks by employing a burn-and-mint mechanism. Native USDC tokens on the original chain are burnt, and an equivalent amount is minted on the receiving chain. This mechanism enhances the efficiency and security of USDC transfers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Arbitrum is the third chain to support CCTP, and the protocol is live on the official Arbitrum Bridge. The addition of CCTP to Arbitrum follows Circle's recent announcement of a native version of its stablecoin on the Arbitrum network.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Despite the recent price recovery in the crypto market, Polygon is still struggling with bearish pressure as the bulls try to surpass the $0.60 mark, leaving investors and supporters eagerly awaiting a potential breakthrough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tradecurve (TCRV) has emerged as a promising player in the crypto market, fueled by its unique approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). Tradecurve's native token is aiming for a more bullish price movement after crossing the $0.018 mark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Polygon (MATIC) Struggling To Break Past $0.60
<p>In recent days, Polygon has experienced a significant price decline, dropping below the crucial $0.750 support level and entering a bearish zone. However, the cryptocurrency has found some stability as a low point formed near $0.5432. Currently, it is attempting to regain its value and follow the upward trend observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notably, there has been a positive development in Polygon's price movement. At first, bulls struggled to cross the resistance around $0.605 before finally soaring above&nbsp; $0.64 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours), signaling a potential recovery. However, it faced resistance around the $0.725 level. To continue its upward momentum, MATIC would need to break above this resistance level with the next significant resistance awaiting near $0.78.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, failure to surpass the $0.725 resistance level could lead to a fresh decline in MATIC's price. In such a scenario, immediate support can be expected around the $0.65 level. At present, Polygon is trading at $0.666567, a decline of 4.40% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve Aiming For A Further Increase
<p>While Polygon is aiming to surpass the $0.725 resistance, Tradecurve's utility token, TCRV, is aiming for a further increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last week, the TCRV token experienced a 20% price surge to set a new trading high of $0.018. Based on its current trajectory, market analysts have predicted that the token has gathered enough momentum to potentially reach $0.025 in the coming week.</p>
<p>The strong bullish performance of TCRV can be linked to the growing attention its parent Tradecurve exchange is enjoying. Unlike other exchanges such as OKX and Kraken, Tradecurve offers more tradable assets apart from cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>These tradable assets include forex, commodities, stocks, indices, and CFDs. Additionally, Tradecurve offers several advantageous features, including low trading fees and access to a diverse range of tradable assets and derivatives. As a hybrid trading platform, Tradecurve will also allow users from around the world to trade anonymously.</p>
<p>TCRV token holders enjoy various benefits, such as staking rewards, voting rights, and discounts. Now in the fourth stage of its presale, crypto market experts predict that the price of the token price could increase by a further 40% in the fifth stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As demand for Tradecurve and its TCRV token increases, leading industry experts predict a potential 50x increase in value before the end of its presale. Furthermore, market analysts anticipate a remarkable surge of 100x by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Advances from 30342 Technicals:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 28 June 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought to add to recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair reached the 30782.06 area before consolidating some advances, the latest renewal of upside pressure that strengthened around the 29900 area.&nbsp; Bulls continue to eye the 30994.30 area as an upside hurdle that represents the 23.6% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 29539.57 to 31443.67.&nbsp; Buying pressure also recently intensified just above the 30198.14 area and 29863.96 area, retracement levels associated with buying pressure that rallied around the 26165.98 and 24750 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently elected above the 30127.80 area during the ongoing appreciation, an upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.</p>
<p>Stops were also triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.&nbsp; Following recent upside price activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 30192, 29863, 29423, 28886, 28179, 28096, and 27293 areas.&nbsp; Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29365.77 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30400.23.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As bitcoin makes its break higher the spark this has given to the whole crypto sector has set the altcoins alight.</p>
Altcoins demonstrate persistence
<p>Just when everyone thought that the crypto space was dead it has just got up and started walking around again. Like Lazarus from the dead, the altcoins have started to come back to life.</p>
<p>The SEC seeking to destroy the fiat on/off ramps, its targeting of the two biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in Binance and Coinbase, the pulling down of the three main banks associated with the crypto sector - all designed to bring the entire crypto industry crashing to its knees.</p>
<p>Obviously these actions, as well as many others, have affected the crypto sector. However, who would have thought that after such anti-crypto news had dropped, that within just a couple of weeks or so crypto would have made back all the losses and more.</p>
<p>Gary Gensler of the SEC might want to look into how new technology will always rise, no matter what any heavy handed regulator might think about it. Even the banks are now finally starting to recognise the potential for such crypto innovations as tokenisation and alternative payments systems.</p>
USDT Dominance struggling at support
<p>Back to the altcoins, and USDT Dominance is fighting for survival at the 7.25% level. It has lost 7% over the last couple of weeks, and granted, much of that will have been lost to bitcoin, but even so, a rising bitcoin floats all altcoins.</p>
<p>Having said that, &ldquo;all altcoins&rdquo; most certainly will not be the case. The vast majority of altcoins are arguably going to zero, and it might be said, the sooner the better. "The vast majority" will definitely leave a handful of incredibly disruptive altcoins that will be able to flourish and fulfil their incredible potential.</p>
<p>Total 3, which charts all altcoins without bitcoin or ethereum, tells this story. The chart is still in a downtrend but there are signs that it is picking up, having been down to the 0.786 Fibonacci level, and having followed a downward channel since mid-2022.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, altcoins will still for now have to rely on the ascension of bitcoin. The pattern would appear to be a strong upwards move from BTC and then accumulation. It is at this point that value will be diverted out of bitcoin and into altcoins, with the best of these making the running.</p>
Can there still be an altcoin season?
<p>The altcoin seasons of before have been epic in their proportions. If enough liquidity comes into bitcoin and the crypto space in general, then why not? However, with far more regulation coming to crypto there are more uncertainties as to how altcoins will behave.&nbsp;</p>
