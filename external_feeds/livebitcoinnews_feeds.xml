										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A series of fake bomb threats aimed at some of America’s largest retailers <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/hoax-bomb-threats-target-major-164837472.html?ref=upstract.com">has law enforcement baffled</a>. The threats involved perpetrators asking for gift cards and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a> in exchange for not setting off explosives or doing lots of damage.</p>
<h2>Bomb Threats and Bitcoin&#8230; A Deadly Match?</h2>
<p>Among the big-name stores being targeted by the bomb threats are Kroger, Meijer, Walmart, and Whole Foods. The threats also took place in several states rather than isolated regions. Several individuals have allegedly called in and threatened to detonate bombs if bitcoin, cash, or gift cards were not provided in a timely manner. Thus far, an investigation has turned up little to no evidence regarding who could have been involved.</p>
<p>Per police statements, the callers have repeatedly used blocked numbers as a means of preventing their identities from being discovered. One call, for example, was made to a Chicago-based Whole Foods store. The caller said that if $5,000 in BTC wasn’t delivered to a specific address within a set period, a pipe bomb would be detonated within its walls.</p>
<p>A separate call placed to a Kroger grocery outlet in New Mexico demanded over $5,000 in Apple gift cards. Failure to comply, per the perpetrator, meant a bomb would go off and people would be hurt.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued the following statement regarding the matter and its subsequent investigation:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FBI remains vigilant and continues to work closely with our law enforcement partners on a state and local level. The FBI asks members of the public to maintain awareness of their surroundings and to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Crypto-related crime is nothing new, but this is arguably the first time it’s taken on such a devastating tone. Robbing individual wallets or even an exchange is one thing, but this time around, lives are being threatened, property is in danger of being damaged, and many more harmful effects could be set to take place. The only good news, at the time of writing, is that these calls appear to be fake, though that doesn’t offer any excuses.</p>
<h2>May Not Be Real</h2>
<p>Still, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies don’t want to take any chances that there could be elements of reality to the calls. Thus, should stores receive similar messages in the future, they’re advised to get in touch with the FBI or local police forces and tell them about the occurrence(s) so more research and investigating can be done.</p>
<p>Lisa Bruno – a senior executive vice president of retail operations at the Retail Industry Leaders Association – commented in a recent interview that this is just another “evolving scam” for U.S. retailers, and that while still scary, incidents like these have occurred many times in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chen Zhuling – founder and CEO of Rock X – is confident <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/crypto-veteran-chen-zhuling-says-blockchain-innovations-set-to-skyrocket/ar-AA1d0OWD">blockchain is going</a> to reach new levels of usage and popularity in the coming months.</p>
<h2>Chen Zhuling on Blockchain&#8217;s Future</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The attraction of leading technology developers to the blockchain industry represents a broadening recognition of blockchain as more than just a financial instrument. It is a foundation for the new digital frontier. Blockchain is akin to a new-age internet, being increasingly utilized as a robust, decentralized platform for innovation. This evolution is still nascent, predominantly scrutinized through a financial lens by regulators. As the industry matures and regulations broaden to embrace the technological potential of blockchain, we will see a global surge in blockchain-enabled innovations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding current market sentiments and the overall trends being witnessed in the web3 arena, Zhuling further mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like any other, the cryptocurrency market is subject to fluctuations and periods of downturn. However, those who see the long-term potential of these digital assets and the technology underpinning them may find it worthwhile to weather these volatile periods. The future of web3, the decentralized internet, is ripe with promise. Though we can&#8217;t predict the exact timing of a market rebound, we can expect continued growth and development in this sphere, driving new applications and opportunities.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said that the full adoption of crypto is critical if the finance industry is to stand strong in the coming future. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>The institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies is a critical indicator of their viability and future potential. Assets like bitcoin and Ethereum have been embraced by increasing financial institutions, which indicates a strong confidence in their value as investment instruments. As the industry matures, we are likely to see more sophisticated products emerge, from passive staking yields to hedging mechanisms, all aimed at optimizing the potential returns of these crypto assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also discussed the future developments and upgrades involving <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, the world’s second largest digital asset by market cap:</p>
<blockquote><p>The recent transition of Ethereum from a mining-centric, proof of work model to a more energy-efficient, proof of stake mechanism marks a significant leap forward for the platform. This change has boosted participation in the Ethereum network and attracted institutional attention. The Shapella upgrade, successfully implemented in April, has further bolstered Ethereum&#8217;s appeal, leading to a surge in ETH being staked. While current staking yields of four to six percent may appear modest, they represent a sustainable method of earning crypto returns without the inherent risks associated with trading or lending.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Who Could Beat ETH?</h2>
<p>Regarding ETH’s biggest rivals Cosmos and Polkadot, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Emerging blockchains like Cosmos and Polkadot, while still younger than Ethereum, are rapidly carving out their niches. Cosmos is recognized for its innovative scalability solutions, while Polkadot stands out for its interoperability.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zachery Ty Bryan is a former child star famous for his role on the television program “Home Improvement,” starring comedian Tim Allen. He went <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/celebrity/zachery-ty-bryan-discusses-substance-abuse-issues-says-he-started-drinking-at-14-while-on-home-improvement/ar-AA1cU9tn?OCID=ansmsnnews11">from acting as a child</a>, to garnering a fortune in bitcoin, to earning a reputation as a potential fraudster.</p>
<h2>Zachery Ty Bryan Went from Child Acting to BTC</h2>
<p>Bryan referred to his times on the show as some of the best of his life, but eventually, things spiraled out of control thanks to alcohol habits that brought him into the doldrums. He commented in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dude, I started drinking when I was 14. Back then, I was going to nightclubs, and they would just let me in because I was the kid from ‘Home Improvement.’</p></blockquote>
<p>After his time on the show, Bryan continued to act, doing a few movies here and there, though he eventually became a reporter for <em>The Daily Wire</em> and <em>Fox News</em>. He was also able to switch from acting to producing television and film productions like “The Kindergarten Teacher” and “Skin,” and he was able to fund all his productions through the fortune he made in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a> as an early investor.</p>
<p>His attachment to crypto garnered him a partnership with an ag-tech startup called Producers Market. It was here that things really started to fall apart, as he would often name drop people as a means of attracting investors. He would tell people that he knew Luke Bryan, Tom Brady, and others as a means of impressing investors and garnering funds. Travis Aaron Wade – an actor and friend of Bryan – mentioned in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>He would be dating someone, a random girl that he met on Bumble or Tinder, and he would save their name as someone famous so that when his phone would ring, it would pop up as Angelina Jolie or whatever. The guy has two sides. His dark is dark, but his light is [really] light. It&#8217;s sad because you really do fall in love with him. He&#8217;s a great guy, but I see it as my responsibility to not let other people get taken advantage of.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Ending the Partnership</h2>
<p>Eventually, Bryan disappeared from the Producers Market’s website, and investors grew restless. It’s alleged that Bryan stole as much as $50K worth of digital tokens by selling them when the company had initially decided they were <em>not</em> to be sold or given away. This eventually caught the ugly eye of the company, who ended his advisory role and issued a cease-and-desist order to him. They company said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Bryan misrepresented our company without our knowledge, participation, or permission. When we found out, we immediately issued a cease-and-desist demand to him. This activity is unacceptable and not a reflection of our mission to support the well-being of farmers and our food systems.</p></blockquote>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is getting very popular in Palestine and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/23/why-bitcoin-cant-replace-paypal-in-palestine/?sh=79ef60c9db4c">particularly in the Gaza Strip</a>, the big reason being that PayPal has decided not to offer its services in this corner of the world.</p>
<h2>Palestine and BTC Get Close as PayPal Drives Away</h2>
<p>The reason <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/paypal/">PayPal</a> isn’t setting foot in Palestine is because of the alleged dangers that stem from endless conflict with its geographic neighbor Israel. At least 12 congressmen, at the time of writing, have signed a proposal supporting the financial company’s decision, which is now being enforced by its CEO Dan Schulman. The proposal they’ve signed reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>PayPal has a responsibility to ensure its services and operations are provided in a non-discriminatory manner and in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.</p></blockquote>
<p>Without PayPal, the people of Palestine have had to find other ways of getting the items they need to survive… The goods and services necessary for everyday life. As a result, many have turned to bitcoin.</p>
<p>One of those people – Fadi Elsalameen – is a Palestinian activist and adjunct senior fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute. In an interview, Elsalameen commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I stopped sending wires to Palestine and now only make payments with bitcoin. Bitcoin solves issues of high banking or transfer fees, or extreme and invasive government overreach and unfair treatment of Palestinians by international monetary organizations as in the case of PayPal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eric Sype of 7amleh – a digital rights group in Palestine – shares this ideology. He believes PayPal has become extremely frustrating over the years, and that bitcoin’s popularity is growing thanks to the simplicity and levels of trust that surround it. He commented that while there are several individuals who are still skeptical of using bitcoin as a method of payment, tensions are easing slowly. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vast majority of online freelance service providers exclusively use PayPal, so that cuts off many freelance opportunities for Palestinians.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is just another example of bitcoin’s original usage intent coming into play. Initially, when first created, bitcoin was designed as a payment tool. Something that could potentially replace all fiat currencies, checks, and credit cards down the line. However, its volatility has gotten in the way.</p>
<p>Thus, there are several companies out there that refuse to accept BTC as a payment method because they could wind up losing money, and there are still many people who don’t think to use it considering its lack of mainstream appeal.</p>
<h2>Making Things Easier</h2>
<p>Elsalameen, however, has hope that all this is going to change, and he says the opportunities that arise through bitcoin payment options are endless. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>I reach the account of those I need to send bitcoin to without anyone weaponizing my transactions against me. Today, I can even buy art in Palestine with bitcoin.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cameron Winklevoss – one half of the Winklevoss Twins who run the Gemini crypto exchange in New York – is confident bitcoin is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/23/open-the-floodgates-crypto-billionaire-warns-the-window-is-closing-fast-amid-100-billion-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-boom/?sh=650f482f1eef">about to burst out of</a> its shell and reach a new bullish peak nobody is prepared for.</p>
<h2>Cameron Winklevoss on the Future of BTC&#8217;s Price</h2>
<p>At the end of June, the price of bitcoin rose beyond $31,000. This is the highest bitcoin’s been all year, and certainly higher than where it was for most of 2022, arguably the most bearish period on record for the world’s number one digital currency by market cap. Cameron Winklevoss believes that if people are going to take advantage of bitcoin still being somewhat low, they need to get involved now. Otherwise, they’re going to be paying a lot more for units. In an interview, he commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>The great accumulation of bitcoin has begun. Anyone watching the flurry of ETF filings understands the window to purchase pre-IPO bitcoin before ETFs go live and open the floodgates is closing fast.</p></blockquote>
<p>The warning comes after BlackRock – one of the biggest financial investment companies in the world – announced it was planning to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/blackrock-etf-application-causes-btc-eth-to-surge/">submit a bitcoin-based</a> exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The news came as a surprise to many people for several reasons, a big one being that in the long run, BlackRock is considered a traditional finance company, and many of these institutions won’t go anywhere near crypto.</p>
<p>Another big reason is that the SEC is going after several crypto companies right now, huge ones like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">Coinbase</a>. It’s become clear that the SEC doesn’t care who gets victimized so long as it can follow through on its agenda of eliminating crypto from America and having complete control.</p>
<p>However, many believe that BlackRock may pave the way for a bitcoin-based ETF (<a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-sec-delays-its-decisions-on-several-btc-etfs/">something the SEC has</a> long rejected) thanks to its high-ranking record with the financial agency. Thus far, BlackRock has enjoyed over 500 accepted proposals with the SEC and only one rejection.</p>
<h2>This New ETF Could Really Pave the Way</h2>
<p>Markus Thielen – head of research at Matrix Port – was quick to agree with Cameron Winklevoss and believes the bulls may return sooner than investors think. Discussing the new ETF, he commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>While crypto still needs more than favorable macroeconomic tailwinds and institutional inflows into bitcoin, this is a welcoming development that reminds investors that crypto is here to stay. We can imagine that this BlackRock iShares &#8216;commodity&#8217; bitcoin ETF will attract an allocation in the range of around $20 billion to $50 billion over time as ETFs that are focusing on gold alone hold around $100 billion. This BlackRock announcement has a high probability of being approved by the SEC and will drive continuous adoption from institutional investors for bitcoin.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>El Salvador is really gaining traction as a leading bitcoin haven.</p>
<h2>El Salvador was Smart to Implement Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Not long ago, professional surfer Kelly Slater commented on social media:</p>
<blockquote><p>The government has really put an emphasis on surfing (and bitcoin).</p></blockquote>
<p>A crypto winter and bear market were both responsible for bitcoin shedding quite a bit of value in 2022, and while we’re not entirely out of the woods yet, El Salvador continues to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/21/emphasis-on-surf-and-bitcoin-attracts-investments-to-el-salvador/?sh=2c37c76671dc">gain a lot of talent</a> and business in terms of bitcoin companies that want to make the Central American nation the land of their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/el-salvador/">El Salvador</a> has made a partner out of Fold, for example, a bitcoin rewards app. That company is now working hand in hand with Visa to help boost crypto payment options throughout Central and South America. Will Reeves, the CEO of Fold, explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>El Salvador really was the shining option for us there. There was no second-best option. Bukele has announced and implemented some very serious benefits to entities operating out of El Salvador. Not only protections, but incentives that are almost unmatched and especially unmatched in North America, Central America, and South America.</p></blockquote>
<p>U.S. ambassador to El Salvador Milena Mayorga also threw her two cents into the mix, claiming that the notions of bitcoin have attracted huge investments into the country thanks to the fact that crypto is now getting integrated into the nation’s politics.</p>
<p>For example, in April of this year, a new law was developed for crypto and tech companies. These businesses become exempt from both income and capital gains taxes for 15 years granted they invest funds into the nation’s infrastructure. Mayorga said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every day, companies are calling us here at the embassy to ask us how they can transfer their operations. We try to get rid of the bureaucracy. We try to accompany them in different meetings, according to the needs of each company.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stacy Herbert – an advisor with Bitcoin Office – further mentioned that forming crypto companies in nations like El Salvador is quite easy, and the group is considering setting up shop there as a means of avoiding all the red tape and other troubles that come with the current U.S. landscape. She stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Company formation is also a lot easier now, as is the process of returning or moving to El Salvador with the removal of red tape and taxes.</p></blockquote>
<h2>So Many People Want to Move There</h2>
<p>According to Mayorga, several Americans are also looking to make their homes in the nation she represents. She says the country can offer them a lot of benefits and mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many North Americans are asking for Salvadoran citizenship, and it&#8217;s one of the greatest interests worldwide. How can they obtain a residence or citizenship; how can they become Salvadoran.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Faroe Islands, which are part of the Kingdom of Denmark, have been issuing postage stamps for close to 50 years, but the island chain is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2023/06/22/faroe-islands-historic-postal-service-embraces-blockchain-with-weather-influenced-crypto-stamps/?sh=6a286c5c3e5a">now embracing blockchain</a> and adding a little crypto to its postal mix.</p>
<h2>Crypto Stamps Are Now Available</h2>
<p>Known as the “Stamps of Maybe,” a stamp collection being issued by the Faroe Islands is entirely digital and being released through a partnership with crypto firm Varius Systems. The stamps are unique in that not only are they considered collectible forms of art, but they also aid in the tracking of packages and other items. They’re designed by artist Heiðrik á Heygum, and they’ve been decorated with images of animals, plant life, and seasons.</p>
<p>Discussing his influence for the stamps and what he was trying to accomplish, Heygum said in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each stamp features its own distinctive bouquet, carefully crafted to encompass the flowers, plants, birds, and animals that symbolize the essence of each season on our islands. The Faroese people have always shared a deep connection with nature and its abundant resources, which is why many of these flowers and animals have become national symbols in our music and art. In fact, our traditional national costume proudly showcases embroidered representations of these flowers, often on black or dark tones of fabric. Through these crypto stamps, I aimed to infuse the technological world with the rich tapestry of Faroese culture, uniting tradition and innovation in a visually captivating manner. It is my hope that these stamps will not only serve as a means of postage, but also as a testament to the profound connection we share with our environment and our commitment to preserving our unique traditions for generations to come.</p></blockquote>
<p>Varius Systems hasn’t always been a crypto or blockchain-themed company, but it’s always been a technology innovator. Started in the 1970s by Frank Dorner, the company is now run by his son Michael, and they take pride in the fact that Varius is family owned. Michael commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>After meeting with several leaders of postal companies around the world at the Universal Postal Union from the United Nations summit in Frankfurt earlier this week, we felt an enormous interest not only in the NFT stamps, but in blockchain technology as such. Countries from all around the globe, from Iceland to Togo, from Portugal to Singapore, are interested in how this digital revolution with decentralized blockchains can help their businesses grow and stay ahead of the curve.</p></blockquote>
<h2>They&#8217;re Like NFTs</h2>
<p>The stamps, in many ways, are like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have seen their popularity decrease heavily over the past 15 months or so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/nfts/">NFTs</a> are still relatively new, having first come to the crypto scene in 2020, but interest really began sinking during the early days of last year’s crypto winter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scams, scams, and more <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/scams/">scams</a>… Lately, it feels like all we really hear about anymore in the world of crypto are the number of scams that have been hitting the streets, but not too long ago, Roundtable anchor Rob Nelson hosted a meeting with Jordan Edelson, the co-founder of Trade Zing, and asked him what <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/cryptocurrency-scams-unveiling-the-truth-with-trade-zing/ar-AA1cSkNl">people can do to prevent themselves</a> from falling victim to these ongoing issues.</p>
<h2>Trade Zing Works to Lessen Crypto Scams</h2>
<p>The event began with Nelson asking:</p>
<blockquote><p>People are hungry for information. Nobody knows what to believe anymore. There&#8217;s so much confusion about the difference between all these. How do you address that? What [are] your thoughts on addressing it and does your platform help address it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Responding, Edelson claimed that communities need to educate themselves. They need to ensure they have all the data necessary on hand to make proper decisions, and they need to check in on certain crypto investments before they get involved to make sure issuing companies have histories of transparency. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>The solution is really community and transparency, and that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been missing. A lot of these current social networks and platforms out there were never built ground up for financial information. Because of that, a lot of people are taking advantage of the weaknesses of these platforms.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also mentioned that while crypto scams appear largely aimed at individual investors and traders, he said they do the most damage to the crypto arena in general, and that many companies are also largely affected. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you have these types of scams and these issues and problems, it hurts it across the board. I think adding a layer of transparency is the way to grow future tokens and digital assets and bring back truth to the sector.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Knowing the Differences Between Good and Crap Coins</h2>
<p>Lastly, he said Trade Zing is always about making sure people have what they need to make informed decisions. Trade Zing has worked hard to ensure it remains an integral part of the crypto space, and its morality is always at the highest points. He also said it’s striving to separate the good coins from the bad:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re still kind of in that vetting process. We&#8217;re also kind of in a time right now of consolidation, where you&#8217;re seeing different projects consolidate, and ultimately, the best breed starts to bubble up to the top. Trade Zing, as a platform, is going to highlight a lot of that, amplify the messaging around it, allow a lot of that, as well as highlight the bad as well because it&#8217;s just important to be educated on the bad and the good. This way, people are properly educated about the risk involved when they get involved in these different types of assets.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum – the world’s largest cryptocurrencies by market cap – <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/06/32966846/the-great-accumulation-of-bitcoin-etf-filings-signal-a-new-era-for-crypto-investment-say-e">rose to new levels in late</a> June following several weeks of traveling through the doldrums, and the moves appear to stem from some new bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications from two of the largest financial companies around: Wisdom Tree and BlackRock.</p>
<h2>BlackRock Does Big Things for BTC</h2>
<p>Both bitcoin and Ethereum weren’t doing so hot throughout the month of June prior to this news. The assets were slipping a bit more each week, largely due to headlines that both <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">Coinbase</a> were being sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It got to the point where bitcoin, briefly, fell into the $24K range, while Ethereum itself wasn’t doing much better. Then, suddenly, the tables really turned.</p>
<p>Cameron Winklevoss – one half of the Winklevoss Twins, which run the popular Gemini crypto exchange in New York – was quick to comment on the situations surrounding the two ETFs from both BlackRock and WisdomTree. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone watching the flurry of ETF filings understands the window to purchase pre-IPO bitcoin before ETFs go live and open the floodgates is closing fast. If bitcoin was the most obvious and best investment of the previous decade, this will likely be the most obvious and best trade of this decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michael Saylor – the former CEO of software giant and major BTC institution MicroStrategy – was also there to throw his two cents into the mix, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The window to front-run institutional demand for bitcoin is closing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the sentiments that are stemming from the news around the ETFs is that BlackRock, at least, has a chance of getting its application supported and approved by the SEC given how close it’s been with the federal financial agency. The company has had more than 500 applications approved by the SEC. To this day, it only has one rejection on its record.</p>
<p>What’s also interesting about the BlackRock application is that Coinbase – a company now getting sued by the SEC – is listed as the custody partner of the company. What this could potentially do regarding the lawsuit the agency has against the exchange remains a mystery, but it should at least throw a monkey wrench (albeit a small one) into the mix.</p>
<h2>A Huge Step Forward?</h2>
<p>The news of the price surges surrounding bitcoin and Ethereum is a huge and welcome change from what we’ve been seeing in recent days, and especially from where both assets were last year. During 2022, arguably the worst period on record for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, the digital asset fell from about $68,000, it’s new all-time high (which it achieved in November of 2021), to around $16,600, thus constituting a near 70 percent fall from grace.</p>
<p>Ethereum and several leading altcoins were quick to follow in BTC’s footsteps.</p>
