					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum is consolidating below the $1,230 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could start a steady increase if it clears the $1,230 and $1,250 resistance levels. Ethereum is slowly moving higher from the $1,190 support zone. The price is now trading above $1,210 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,215 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a clear move above $1,230 and $1,250. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price remained well bid above the $1,180 and $1,190 levels. ETH formed a base above the $1,190 level and started an upward move. There was a clear move above the $1,200 resistance zone and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Ether price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,237 swing high to $1,193 swing low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,215 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair is now consolidating near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,237 swing high to $1,193 swing low. An immediate resistance is near the $1,230 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,250 level. A clear upside break above the $1,250 resistance could start a steady increase. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise towards the $1,300 resistance. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance could be $1,350. If there is an upside break above the $1,350 resistance, the price might rise towards $1,400. Any more gains might send the price towards the $1,500 resistance zone. ETH Still In a Range? If ethereum fails to climb above the $1,230 resistance, it could start another drop. An initial support on the downside is near the $1,215 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The next major support is near the $1,200 level. The first major support is near the $1,190 level. A downside break below $1,190 might spark a move towards the $1,150 support.

					<description><![CDATA[2022 is coming to an end, and our staff at NewsBTC decided to launch this Crypto Holiday Special to provide some perspective on the crypto industry. We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto. Related Reading: WAVES Gets Dragged Down By USDN, Despite Pumping Investor Distribution In the spirit of Charles Dicken&#8217;s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances.  Yesterday, we spoke with investment firm Blofin on their perspective on the past, present, and future of crypto. Today, we continue the series with David Shwed, former Global Head of Digital Assets Technology at BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian and securities services provider, and current COO at Halborn. Shwed: &#8220;What changed was the reality that too good to be true yields are exactly that, too good to be true.  The money needs to come from somewhere, and it turns out that it was coming from risk loans and other business practices that relied on the steady increase of the price of crypto (&#8230;).&#8221; This major financial institution, along with some of the biggest banks in the U.S., Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, finally embraced cryptocurrencies in 2021 and 2022. Still, recent events in the industry might impact crypto and digital asset adoption for legacy financial institutions. Shwed: &#8220;I haven’t seen any slowdown from TradFi when it comes to entering/expanding into the crypto markets.&#8221; Traditional Finances (TradFi) and Crypto Finances, in their many forms (CeFi, DeFi, etc.), have been converging. Will the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX push these institutions away from crypto? What is the likeliest regulatory outlook for 2023? We asked this former BNY Mellon executive this and much more. This is what he told us: Q: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid? A: What changed was the reality that too good to be true yields are exactly that, too good to be true.  The money needs to come from somewhere, and it turns out that it was coming from risk loans and other business practices that relied on the steady increase of the price of crypto.  As the price fell and the loans were due, many faced liquidation of their collateral and margin calls.  That being said, we are seeing adoption in many other areas besides finance.  Many major retailers are also entering the ecosystem, such as Nike, Matterl, Samsung, and LVMH. Q: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision? A: The narrative today needs to be risk management and security.  Had 3AC/Voyager/Celsius and others had more institutional risk management practices, their demise may have been avoided.  The same thought goes into security.  There is a fundamental difference between crypto native security vs what we see in more mature financial institutions.  We need to improve both drastically in order to restore trust. Q: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right? A: The most significant moment was the FTX crash.  The progression of SBF from the hero who will save us all to a criminal in a matter of weeks is evidence of the lack of transparency in the ecosystem.  We will certainly feel the impact as we head into 2023 . I don’t believe we’ve seen the full impact as it relates to other organizations who have some exposure to FTX or are generally over-leveraged.  I believe by the end of 2023 we will be back to where we were in the beginning of 2022 in part due to the institutional/enterprise markets.  I’ve heard “Crypto is dead” many times throughout the years and they’ve been wrong every time.  While the current situation is much different since the price decline is a result of many systemic failures, the same can be said for many crashes observed in TradFi Wall Street, the most similar being the 2008-2009 crisis and TradFi is still alive and kicking. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Poised To Rally Big-Time On Today’s PCE Release Q: Traditional finances (Tradfi) and crypto are merging in many ways. Will the collapse of FTX affect this trend? And in this context, do you see regulations leaning toward adopting an approach that will halt the integration between legacy and crypto financial companies? A:  While the collapse of FTX and the resulting collateral damage has shown to have negatively impacted the crypto market, I haven’t seen any slowdown from TradFi when it comes to entering/expanding into the crypto markets.  In fact, many of the G-SIBs (Globally Systemically Important Banks) that I have spoken to have not changed or altered their roadmaps as it relates to crypto.  I haven’t seen any indication of regulations halting the integrations between traditional and crypto.  That being said, I believe we will see sweeping regulation in the crypto markets similar in size and scope of the Dodd-Frank Act. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $16,800 with sideways movement across the board. Image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview.]]></description>

<p><strong>Q: Traditional finances (Tradfi) and crypto are merging in many ways. Will the collapse of FTX affect this trend? And in this context, do you see regulations leaning toward adopting an approach that will halt the integration between legacy and crypto financial companies?</strong></p>
<p>A:  While the collapse of FTX and the resulting collateral damage has shown to have negatively impacted the crypto market, I haven’t seen any slowdown from TradFi when it comes to entering/expanding into the crypto markets.  In fact, many of the G-SIBs (Globally Systemically Important Banks) that I have spoken to have not changed or altered their roadmaps as it relates to crypto.  I haven’t seen any indication of regulations halting the integrations between traditional and crypto.  That being said, I believe we will see sweeping regulation in the crypto markets similar in size and scope of the Dodd-Frank Act.</p>

Evidently, it has been negative for the past few days, although there has been improvements but it still isn’t peaking to $12.

					<description><![CDATA[2022 is coming to an end, and our staff at NewsBTC decided to launch this Crypto Holiday Special to provide some perspective on the crypto industry. We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Is Up 5% On This News In the spirit of Charles Dicken&#8217;s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances.  We kicked us this special with an institutional guest, asset management firm Blofin. In early December, they wrote an essay called “Catastrophe, Survival, and Evolution: Writing After November’s Crypto Markets” which inspired this series. Blofin: “One of the apparent signals is that in December 2022, monthly crypto spot volumes have returned to 2020 levels.” In their essay, the firm argues that the crypto industry has been heavily impacted by the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, FTX, Terra (LUNA), and others. These events forced crypto investors into inactivity as their confidence in the sector shattered. Blofin: “There is no doubt that crypto is the future direction of finance. Still, a series of previous events have shown that if investors&#8217; money cannot be protected, they will eventually give up the crypto market (…).” But there is light at the end of the tunnel for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; albeit a long recovery is ahead, the nascent asset class will emerge from its ashes. For Blofin, the crypto industry is on the brink of a critical evolution. Once completed, the sector will rise again on the back of new institutional support. This is what they told us: Q: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid? A: The most significant difference comes from two aspects: liquidity and investor confidence. In 2021, the liquidity of the crypto market is still sufficient, and the impact of the liquidity contraction in the risk asset market has not yet fully manifested. In 2022, with the Fed&#8217;s (U.S. Federal Reserve) continuous interest rate hikes, Luna&#8217;s collapse, 3AC Capital&#8217;s (Three Arrow Capital) bankruptcy, and chapter 11 of the FTX exchange, the liquidity of the crypto market is basically squeezed dry. One of the apparent signals is that in December 2022, monthly crypto spot volumes have returned to 2020 levels. In addition, the blow to investor confidence from a series of events in 2022 will be huge. At Christmas 2021, institutions and retail investors feel they have a lot to do in the crypto market. At the end of 2022, even professional investment institutions have lost so much due to the collapse of exchanges. As a result, they no longer trust the crypto industry; they feel that there are Ponzi schemes and scammers everywhere. In the end, institutions choose to withdraw funds, followed by retail investors. However, the number of investors in the crypto asset market is still high. Many people are just not active in a bear market, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they have left the crypto market. They are watching and waiting for the best time to buy the dip. Non-Zero on-chain addresses are still increasing steadily, and the hash rate of miners has not been significantly affected by the bear market in 2022. The influence of fundamentals is still valid for the crypto market, but it is mainly concentrated on the macro perspective. During the bear market period, liquidity is concentrated in BTC and ETH, and it is difficult for altcoins to obtain more liquidity. Therefore, macro factors such as interest rate hikes and strong USD significantly impact BTC and ETH. At the same time, because of the bad liquidity status, improvements in the fundamentals of altcoins and project tokens are difficult to bring about sustained performance improvements. Q: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision? A: In our opinion, the changes in the market in 2022 depend on the position of the crypto market in the risk asset system. There is no doubt that crypto assets are at the tail end of the risk asset market due to the high volatility levels of the crypto market and the &#8220;Wild West&#8221; era it is in. Therefore, once there is any trouble, it is easier for investors to choose to sell and form a run, causing a more significant crisis. The crypto market in 2022 is somewhat like the Nasdaq in the late 1990s. Adventurers and warriors gained a lot of wealth before 2000 and in 2021, which stimulated more people to come and take risks. Most people ignore the risks and end up with nothing. Therefore, compliance and security should be an integral part of the future narrative of the crypto market. There is no doubt that crypto is the future direction of finance (faster speed, more programmatic, more global, more reasonable credit system, and more substantial innovation potential). Still, a series of previous events have shown that if investors&#8217; money cannot be protected, they will eventually give up the crypto market and will not continue to pay for the potential of the market and new technologies, even if these technologies have potential and attractiveness. Q: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right? A: The collapse of FTX is the culmination of the 2022 bear market in the crypto market. The incident interrupted the slow recovery process of the crypto market and aroused widespread concern from regulators in major markets such as the US and the EU. In addition, many institutions have closed down due to the collapse of FTX or encountered operational difficulties and urgently need rescue. It can be expected that in 2023, the aftermath of the FTX incident may eventually cause some institutions to go bankrupt, and more regulatory policies will also be introduced. In addition, from a macro perspective, due to the continuation of high interest rates, it is difficult for the crypto market to usher in new liquidity, and it will take longer to recover. However, in the above questions, we have mentioned some characteristics of the crypto market that are difficult to be replaced by traditional markets (faster speed, more programmatic, more global, more decentralized, more reasonable credit system, and more substantial innovation potential). Therefore, as long as investors have trading needs, the crypto industry will continue to exist, but it will become more compliant and secure. Q: To summarize for our readers, what sectors have been the most resilient in this crisis? Which ones are the most likely to recover in 2023? And how do you see the evolution of the nascent industry playing out? A: Considering the degree of acceptance, mainstream currencies such as BTC and ETH are still the most resilient sectors in the crypto market. Public chains and crypto infrastructure are also one of the most resilient sectors in the crypto market in the future, for all applications in the crypto market need their support. In addition, the exchange sector is also quite resilient, for as the market stabilizes and gradually recovers, the trading needs of investors still exist and will start to grow again. Looking back at the history of the crypto market, many exchanges will go bankrupt in each bear period, but new exchanges will emerge in the bear market and shine in a new round of bull. However, it is difficult to determine who will be the first to recover in 2023. Since there is still a long time before the liquidity faucet reopens, the current liquidity shortage situation is still difficult to improve. The crypto market will likely continue to consolidate at a low level for a long time. Related Reading: MATIC Price Enters Recovery Mode But Can It Touch $0.90? The crypto market is now at the end of the &#8220;Wild West&#8221;. As the crypto market continues to develop and mature, after the events of 2022, lawmakers will gradually have examples to help, and the regulatory and compliance framework will also take shape. The above may limit the crypto market&#8217;s development in some directions, but it is also good for the long-term growth of the crypto market. Under the compliance framework, more funds from traditional markets and other sources can enter the crypto market, and the builders of the crypto market will have more opportunities to obtain investment.

The incident interrupted the slow recovery process of the crypto market and aroused widespread concern from regulators in major markets such as the US and the EU. In addition, many institutions have closed down due to the collapse of FTX or encountered operational difficulties and urgently need rescue.</p>
<p>It can be expected that in 2023, the aftermath of the FTX incident may eventually cause some institutions to go bankrupt, and more regulatory policies will also be introduced. In addition, from a macro perspective, due to the continuation of high interest rates, it is difficult for the crypto market to usher in new liquidity, and it will take longer to recover.</p>
<p>However, in the above questions, we have mentioned some characteristics of the crypto market that are difficult to be replaced by traditional markets (faster speed, more programmatic, more global, more decentralized, more reasonable credit system, and more substantial innovation potential). Therefore, as long as investors have trading needs, the crypto industry will continue to exist, but it will become more compliant and secure.</p>
<p><strong>Q: To summarize for our readers, what sectors have been the most resilient in this crisis? Which ones are the most likely to recover in 2023? And how do you see the evolution of the nascent industry playing out?</strong></p>
<p>A: Considering the degree of acceptance, mainstream currencies such as BTC and ETH are still the most resilient sectors in the crypto market. Public chains and crypto infrastructure are also one of the most resilient sectors in the crypto market in the future, for all applications in the crypto market need their support.</p>
<p>In addition, the exchange sector is also quite resilient, for as the market stabilizes and gradually recovers, the trading needs of investors still exist and will start to grow again. Looking back at the history of the crypto market, many exchanges will go bankrupt in each bear period, but new exchanges will emerge in the bear market and shine in a new round of bull.</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to determine who will be the first to recover in 2023. Since there is still a long time before the liquidity faucet reopens, the current liquidity shortage situation is still difficult to improve. The crypto market will likely continue to consolidate at a low level for a long time.</p>



<p>The crypto market is now at the end of the &#8220;Wild West&#8221;. As the crypto market continues to develop and mature, after the events of 2022, lawmakers will gradually have examples to help, and the regulatory and compliance framework will also take shape. The above may limit the crypto market&#8217;s development in some directions, but it is also good for the long-term growth of the crypto market. Under the compliance framework, more funds from traditional markets and other sources can enter the crypto market, and the builders of the crypto market will have more opportunities to obtain investment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Litecoin price has continued to face rejection after it failed to topple over the $80 price level. In the last 24 hours, it barely registered any price movement. It just depreciated by 0.8%. It was an indication of sideways trading for the altcoin. The past week for LTC has been choppy owing to constant volatility amongst major market movers. Bitcoin has dropped in price over the last 48 hours, dragging most altcoins down with it. The technical outlook of the Litecoin price showed signs of struggle as the bears were still around. Demand for LTC slowed down, as did the accumulation. Buyers have continued to sell short as and when LTC lost its local support. From the technical outlook, the Litecoin price may present shorting opportunities for traders at some levels. For the coin to move on the upside, demand has to return in the market. Bitcoin has to move back above the $17,000 price level for most altcoins to gain momentum. The market capitalization of Litecoin declined in the last 24 hours, reflecting bearish pressure in the market at press time. Related Reading: Polkadot Price Can Fall To This Level Before Christmas Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LTC was exchanging hands at $65 at the time of writing. Even though the coin is consolidating at the moment, it can lose its local support. The immediate resistance for the coin stood at $68, and clearing that level will take the coin to $73. On the flip side, the inability to remain over $64 will bring the coin to $63 and then to $61. When the coin falls to $63 and then to $61, this would be a shorting opportunity for sellers as the coin will start correcting after that. The amount of Litecoin traded in the last session was in red, which indicated bearishness and more selling in the market. Technical Analysis The buyers were in control of the price of the asset for most of December. With increased market price volatility and Litecoin price consolidation, there was increased liquidation, causing buying strength to decline. The Relative Strength Index was near the 30-mark, which was a sign of overselling. In accordance with the selling pressure, the Litecoin price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, and that meant sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Sellers continue to have leverage in the market, but an indicator shows that buyers could step in now. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) reads the price trend and reversals within it. AO portrayed green histograms, which were buy signals for the coin. If buyers act on it, the price of the altcoin can momentarily go up before it descends. The Directional Movement Index indicates the price direction of the asset. DMI was negative as the -DI line (orange) was above the +DI line (blue). The Average Directional Index (red) was dipping near the 20-mark, meaning that the current price direction lacked strength. Related Reading: MATIC Price Enters Recovery Mode But Can It Touch $0.90?

					<description><![CDATA[The Polkadot price has been on a downtrend ever since the beginning of August. The coin has pierced through several price floors in that duration. In the past 24 hours, the coin has lost 1.6%. In the last week, DOT sustained double-digit losses. At this moment, DOT has again resumed its lateral trading, but signs point towards the coin losing further momentum. The technical outlook depicts that the bears have taken over the market completely. The altcoin was undervalued as it was oversold on the chart. The demand for DOT had completely faded, which resulted in less accumulation. As DOT continued to lose value over the past several months, investor interest faded, which also resulted in the shorting of the altcoin. Presently, the Polkadot price is sandwiched between the $4.60 and $4.30 price levels, and going by the technicals, DOT is eyeing a fall below the $4.30 mark before it starts correcting itself. At press time, the Polkadot price was trading 91% below its all-time high secured in 2021. Related Reading: MATIC Rising: Why Investors Are Upbeat On This Crypto For 2023 Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was trading at $4.50 at the time of writing. The coin has recently lost a $5.06 support line, and since then, Polkadot price has been consolidating. Continued consolidation will see a further loss of value because sellers will lose interest in the asset again. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $5 and then at $5.71. If the altcoin moves above the $5.71 price level, the chances of Polkadot price revisiting the $6 zone increase. On the other hand, due to a lack of demand, the coin will inevitably fall below the $4.30 level and sit at $4.16. The amount of DOT traded in the last session remained low, signifying bearish strength. Technical Analysis The altcoin was mostly under considerable selling pressure for most of this month. Over the last week, it was hovering around the oversold territory. The Relative Strength Index was near the 20-mark which signifies heavily oversold tendencies and it means that the bears have completely taken over the market. The same idea reflects in the other indicator. DOT price was below the 20-mark which meant that the sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. The coin confirmed that sellers had taken over the market momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates market momentum and trend reversals. MACD displayed red histograms, which were the sell signal for the altcoin. Parabolic SAR portrays the price direction; dotted lines were above the price, which signified bearishness and a lack of strength in the current price direction.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum is still closely mirroring the price of bitcoin through the bear market and that has seen its price basically stall in the last day in tandem with BTC. ETH’s price is presently resting just above $1,200, and while this would have served as a good bounce-off point for the digital asset, it shows no signs of doing so. Ethereum Price Stuck At $1,200 Given the current market circumstances, Ethereum at $1,200 presents one of the best prices that the market will see for the digital asset before 2022 runs out. The momentum in the market was already on a decline but the 49% jump in Ethereum’s trading volume in the last day put a perhaps temporary stop to that decline. Short-term indicators pointing towards sell points to this being temporary. Now, for the lull in price, it can be explained by ETH’s price sitting so close to the 20-day moving average of $1,247. Since there isn’t much movement in the market, it makes sense that the digital asset would only try to maintain its price at just above $1,200 at this time.

ETH price struggling at $1,200 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Why Is ETH Struggling? Ethereum has received some bad press over the last couple of days. One of the most prominent was when the Paxful peer-to-peer exchange announced that it was delisting Ethereum. CEO Ray Youssef presented the reason as “Integrity over revenue” as the exchange believes that the network was not decentralized. This stoked fears that had previously subsided following the move to proof of stake. For many, this move made Ethereum much easier to control and Youssef said, “One day you will need permission to use it.” Related Reading: Exchange Inflows, Outflows At A Stalemate As Bitcoin Refuses To Budge Given this, the price of ETH has buckled under the pressure of the FUD it created. If bulls are unable to hold the $1,200 support, then it could send the digital asset into free fall, with no significant support until $1,140. The cryptocurrency is already headed for a close below its year-to-date peak but a close below $1,200 would see it start the new year with a very bearish outlook. ETH is trading at $1,224 at the time of this writing, according to data from Coinmarketcap. It is up 0.64% in the last 24 hours and boasts a market cap of $149.8 billion.

		<title>FTX Token Jumps 65% As SBF Returns Home, Can FTT Hold The Gains?</title>

					<description><![CDATA[FTX Token (FTT) saw massive gains on Thursday as news of former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried making bail spread across the space. The rapid uptick in the price of the token showed the positivity, albeit brief, that had spread across investors in the token. However, as the dust settles on the disgraced founder, the question now becomes whether the digital asset can hold the gains from yesterday. FTT Jumps 65%  On Thursday, Bankman-Fried’s parents had put their home up to raise money for the $250 million bond put on the former CEO, with friends and associates speculated to have helped come up with the 10% collateral required for his release. However this was achieved, Sam was released under house arrest. Related Reading: Exchange Inflows, Outflows At A Stalemate As Bitcoin Refuses To Budge Soon after the news broke, the price of FTX’s native token FTT made a significant jump. After trending just below $1 for the better part of the week, the 65% push had brought it above $1.1. This brought renewed vigor to the market and momentum rightfully picked up. FTT price spikes following SBF making bail &#124; Source: FTTUSD on TradingView.com The problem now is that FTT has not done a good job of holding onto these gains. Naturally, the brief surge in price had triggered sell-offs among investors looking to take out some profit, triggering another fall below $1. In the early hours of Friday, there had been a 9% jump that brought FTT’s price above $1 once more, but even this would not hold. Support remains weak at $1 and it is now a battle between the bears and the bulls to turn this critical level in their favor. Right now, the bears remain in control of the digital asset with the price sitting at $0.96, and FTT has struggled to break the resistance mounting at $1. What About FTX? For many in the space who lost money when the FTX crypto exchange collapsed, this is just the beginning of the battle. Charges have already been brought against Bankman-Fried and his associates in what is being called the ‘largest fraud of the generation’ but there is still a long way to go. On Thursday, it was reported that Paul Hastings LLP had been appointed by a committee to represent the interests of creditors in the FTX bankruptcy case. So far, the new FTX CEO John J. Ray III said he and his team had been able to recover around $1 billion worth of assets. Related Reading: Ethereum Classic Hashrate Dumps Almost 50% In 3 Months, What About ETC? Former Alameda Research executive Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang have already pled guilty to fraud charges and agreed to work with authorities.

Given this, investors should exercise caution when investing and trading the cryptocurrency. Featured image from Bitcoinist, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>
