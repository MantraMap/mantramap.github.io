			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Memecoins had a heavy rally in the past few weeks, and it felt like the 2021 bull season again. But the excitement was short-lived, as most new memecoins that emerged in that timeframe have gone back to oblivion, but there&rsquo;s Pepe (PEPE) with some exciting narratives working in its favor. While the memecoin hype dies down, Uwerx also has taken center stage in the market with impressive presale rounds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on to learn the potential it has to grow massive and how you can take advantage of the presale for profit:</p>
Pepe (PEPE) Hype Train is Down
<p>Pepe (PEPE) is impressive as a new memecoin considering the rallying strength it exhibited in just some weeks after emerging. PEPE moved to become a $1.8 billion market cap project in just two weeks, but the hype train is dying. There&rsquo;s only so much a project can do in a bear market, and PEPE holders can now wait for the bull market to launch another full-blown rally.</p>
<p>The Pepe (PEPE) community is growing, and in the past few weeks, the memecoin craze has been shipped to other blockchain networks, including Bitcoin (BTC), which is fairly new to memecoins. Pepe as a meme had existed way before it got a derived cryptocurrency, but now crypto enthusiasts are confident that it can flip Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to become the biggest memecoin in the market.</p>
<p>Pepe (PEPE) has fallen to around $600 million market cap, and with the prospects of passing Dogecoin ($10 million market cap) and Shiba Inu ($5 billion market cap), that&rsquo;s some 10x - 20x potential to look forward to. We could see such happen in a bull market considering Shiba Inu(SHIB) once pulled it off against Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>
<p>However, memecoins always remain a risky play, and if you want to get a crypto asset with less risk, then you should be learning more about Uwerx.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Gaining Momentum on Presale
<p>Uwerx is a decentralized freelance platform looking to help democratize the freelance economy and create more value for active participants, including freelancers, clients, and other businesses worldwide that find the global gig market valuable. A report from Forbes has shown top companies like Google, Meta, and Unilever were able to create workforce synergy between full-time employees and freelancers, and the results were impressive. </p>
<p>With this level of attention coming to the gig market, Uwerx might just be the most valuable solution the landscape has seen. For a start, Uwerx charges only 1% on contracts established on the platform. Uwerx also enables a host of blockchain-enabled features like incentivization, community governance, transparent pricing, personalized matching, and some special collaboration tools.</p>
<p>Uwerx is a Web3 platform but will be as intuitive as any existing freelance platform. WERX will be the native token of the platform and will power utility and governance. WERX is selling for cheap on presale at $0.047725, and this opportunity only lasts for a short while.</p>
<p>This week, a presale is launching a fully interactive prototype, which will include registration pages for freelancers and clients. Moreover, the much-anticipated feature, the Uwerx Vault, is set to be revealed next week. To decide the date for the test airdrop, a poll will be carried out.</p>
<p>Take the opportunity to join the WERX presale with the links below and enjoy a 15% bonus on your purchase.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Gemini Dollar and Tether are two of the world's most popular stablecoins. Both have gained traction during the recent banking crisis, in which several high-profile banks collapsed. However, their reliance on the U.S. dollar could potentially cause issues in the future. If inflation continues to rise throughout financial markets, both Gemini Dollar and Tether could struggle in the DeFi space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, new projects like Tradecurve are making waves in the DeFi space. Tradecurve has raised $3 million during its presale, and following an 80% surge in value, analysts now believe that an additional 40% price rise could be on the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Tether Makes A Huge Investment In Bitcoin Mining&nbsp;
<p>As the world's number one most traded cryptocurrency, Tether is considered an extremely safe crypto investment. The project recently invested $1 billion into a new Bitcoin mining farm in El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This investment is designed to help create an eco-friendly mining solution, with Tether offering expertise in green energy alternatives. This particular farm will utilize Volcano energy to produce 241 MW of power and will also install photovoltaic cells to produce solar energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This investment is a huge development in the Tether ecosystem, and has helped to solidify the project's reputation. As Tether continues to invest in DeFi, its popularity is only going to grow, which has made Tether the number one option for investors looking to buy stablecoins,&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Gemini Dollar Trading Volume Surges&nbsp;
<p>Gemini Dollar is an alternative to Tether with a number of benefits. It&rsquo;s been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, which makes it a safe investment despite the recent SEC lawsuits. Furthermore, Gemini Dollar has been audited by Trail of Bits Inc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gemini Dollar is also a stable investment due to being pegged to the U.S. Dollar. As of July 2023, Gemini Dollar has a daily trading volume of $1.8 million, a significant increase from June. This increase suggests that more investors are looking for stable investments, with Gemini Dollar becoming a top option in the process.&nbsp;</p>
Tradecurve Attracts Thousands Of New Investors&nbsp;
<p>Although Tradecurve may not be as stable as Gemini Dollar or Tether, the project offers significantly higher returns. Since its presale started, Tradecurve has raised over $3 million and offered investors returns of 80%. This ROI is expected to increase again soon, with stage four of the Tradecurve (TCRV) presale already 60% sold out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve offers an exciting new alternative to traditional investing. Its hybrid exchange lets investors buy the widest range of assets of any platform, including traditional and DeFi options. Assets such as commodities, forex, and CFDs can be traded by investors who can use cryptocurrency as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a decentralized platform, all of these assets can be traded anonymously. Tradecurve lets investors trade assets without needing to pass KYC or intrusive background checks. This is expected to be a big selling point for the project, as thousands of investors left centralized platforms following lawsuits from the SEC in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve Is Predicted To 100x Post Presale
<p>Tradecurve is now ranked among the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in the DeFi market. Its value has continuously increased in June, and now experts believe its value could 50x before its presale ends. Post presale, price predictions are going as high as 100x once TCRV tokens are listed on major exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With such high price predictions, Tradecurve&rsquo;s current price of $0.018 is believed to be a huge bargain, though, with hundreds of investors buying tokens daily, TCRV is expected to increase in value again before mid-July.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>London, United Kingdom, July 6th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Nayms SAC Ltd., the leading crypto-native insurance marketplace, is proud to announce the issuing of the world&rsquo;s first crypto-denominated industry loss warranty (ILW) through the second segregated account or &lsquo;cell&rsquo; within its marketplace. This type of instrument is index-based and used for providing retrocessional reinsurance protection to property reinsurers.</p><p>In this program, Nayms provides coverage for US named windstorm, attaching above a loss trigger of $60 billion. The basic structure aligns with other ILWs, but Nayms innovates on the traditional approach by using USD Coin (USDC) as the collateral within the segregated account on its independently audited Ethereum smart contract, and by securing that collateral through new mechanisms and concepts, including a digital multi-signature process, for enhanced transparency and efficiency.</p>&ldquo;This deal demonstrates so nicely the benefits of our business model and technology for a broad range of parties and opportunities. Notably, insureds gain access to alternative capital and investors can earn a return on their crypto that is fully regulated yet not correlated to most other financial instruments,&rdquo; observed Dr. David Verbeeten, Chief Commercial Officer at Nayms.<p>The purchaser is Prospero Re, a Bermuda insurer, wholly owned by Resolute Global Partners, with a strong commitment to innovation. For underwriting, Nayms was assisted by the deep domain knowledge of Daniel Vestergren, CEO of Varius Capital Partners Ltd. and former head of ILS at Hiscox Bermuda, who acted as general advisor. For seamless placement, both the purchaser and Nayms were guided by Guy Carpenter, who acted as sole placing broker.</p>Tom Libassi, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Resolute Global Partners, said, &ldquo;We're proud to partner with Nayms to offer the first-ever property catastrophe reinsurance contract denominated in cryptocurrency. This contract is also the first ILW with a loss trigger based on the advanced catastrophe modeling technology behind our Footprint product, which provides coverage for severe losses along with a transparent, timely, and highly efficient way for investors to access the property catastrophe market.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The ILW market is part of the larger global property catastrophe reinsurance market, which generates more than $300 billion of annual renewal premium, presenting significant opportunities for insurers, insureds, and investors alike. Moving forward on the success of its innovative ILW, Nayms remains committed to deploying emerging technologies to reshape the insurance industry. The company invites interested parties to explore other pending investment opportunities. The company made estimates of the potential incomes in prospective segregated accounts within Nayms&rsquo; marketplace as such:</p><p>a.

Captive insurance for smart contract protection services, 8-12% ROI</p><p>d. Captive insurance for digital asset recovery services, 10-15% ROI</p><p>About Nayms</p><p>Nayms is the world&rsquo;s leading crypto-native insurance marketplace.

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) attempted to retain recent strong advances early in the Asian session as the pair was lifted to the 31525.10 area, a fresh twelve-month high, after Stops were elected above the 31443.67 area that had represented a recently-established yearly high.&nbsp; Buying pressure emerged around the 30328.79 area and follow-on technical activity around the 30439.66 and 30575.66 areas accelerated the move.&nbsp; &nbsp;During a volatile pullback, buying pressure initially emerged around the 31828 level, a move lower to test the 38.2% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 30189.56 to 31525.10.&nbsp; Stops were eventually elected below the 31014, 30857, and 30699 areas during the eventual profit-taking depreciation, and additional downside retracement levels include the 30504 and 30475 areas.</p>
<p>Above the market, additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.&nbsp; Following recent activity, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30604.81 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30714.61.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Israeli foreign residents may soon benefit from a tax exemption on the sale of digital currencies. </p>
<p>A new bill that would afford certain tax benefits to Israel&rsquo;s crypto sector has passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset, the country&rsquo;s parliament.</p>
<p>A proposed bill that would exempt foreign residents from capital gains tax on the sale of digital assets and reduce tax on crypto options from 50% to about 25% passed its preliminary reading on Wednesday.</p>
Israel Vies to Attract Investment
<p>The bill, sponsored by Knesset member Dan Illouz, has the full support of Israel&rsquo;s coalition government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Illouz explained the bill is part of a larger economic strategy to attract investors and companies to the country.</p>
<p>The bill&rsquo;s explanatory note details:</p>

<p>Despite the growth potential of Israeli companies in the field, the regulatory reality in Israel is not adapted to the digital currency industry. Therefore, it is proposed to make a number of legislative amendments that will reduce the regulatory gap.</p>

<p>If passed, the bill would grant tax benefits similar to those afforded to high-tech firms to Israel&rsquo;s crypto sector. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Illouz said in a press statement:</p>

<p>Up until now, workers in the crypto industry had to pay double the tax on their options compared to workers in the traditional high-tech industry. Moreover, foreign investors in the blockchain industry were not entitled to the same benefits as those entitled to investors in the traditional high-tech industry.</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>This law amendment aims to balance the situation and eliminate the discrimination in taxation.</p>

<p>The bill further proposes that &ldquo;digital currency&rdquo; be used separately from &ldquo;security.&rdquo;</p>
Move Signals That Israel is Embracing Crypto
<p>The country&rsquo;s decision to equal taxation for crypto investors is a clear sign of actively embracing the industry.</p>
<p>Israel has been working toward integrating crypto into its economy. The country&rsquo;s central bank, the Bank of Israel, issued principles for regulating stablecoin activity in February.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange also revealed the Israeli government would conduct testing of a blockchain-based platform for issuing digital bonds. The project, dubbed &ldquo;Eden&rdquo;, aims to reduce costs and optimise the procedure of national bond issuance.</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s largest bank, Bank Leumi, also stated it would become the first Israeli bank to enable crypto trading, following a partnership with Paxos. The bank&rsquo;s digital platform, Pepper Invest, said that collaborating with Paxos would allow its customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blur founder, Pacman, defends his NFT marketplace against accusations that the platform&rsquo;s strategies crashed the NFT market.&nbsp;</p>
Are NFTs In Trouble Because Of Blur?&nbsp;
<p>NFT marketplace Blur faces a public backlash over the falling NFT prices as investors and traders point fingers at its incentivized trading model. The upstart marketplace surpassed OpenSea as the leading Ethereum NFT trading platform by volume in February but now faces scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the NFT market faces turbulent times, questions about the long-term sustainability of incentivized trading models are being raised. Bored Ape Yacht Club prices hit a two-year low, and other notable projects have also seen sizable price declines. Traders and investors are reevaluating the underlying value of NFTs and whether the current market downturn is a natural correction or a symptom of larger systemic issues.</p>
Blur&rsquo;s Controversial Stance On NFTs
<p>Blur's stance that NFTs are not unique assets but rather "altcoins with pictures," as controversially tweeted by crypto influencer Cobie last year, has reinforced this sentiment.</p>
<p>Blur made its debut as a marketplace in October, positioning itself as the platform for professional NFT traders. The promise of a token airdrop enticed users to choose Blur over competitors like OpenSea. When the BLUR token was finally launched in February, Blur quickly overtook OpenSea, becoming the top marketplace in terms of trading volume.</p>
A Short-Lived Success For Blur
<p>Traders began rapidly flipping NFTs to earn rewards, treating assets like Bored Apes and Otherside land plots as if they were fungible tokens. The surge in trading volume on Blur propelled the market-wide tally above $2 billion in February. As a result, some firms, like data platform CryptoSlam, denounced it as "wash trading,&rdquo; and the initial craze for the Blur marketplace died down pretty soon.</p>
<p>In recent months, overall market trading has sharply declined, resulting in whale traders, who initially benefited from exploiting the rewards model, now suffering losses and withdrawing funds from Blur's NFT bidding pool.&nbsp;</p>
Founder Pacman Responds
<p>Blur founder Tieshun Roquerre, who is more popularly known as Pacman, responded to the allegations against Blur, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We launched in October 22. Since then, some floor prices have gone up, some floor prices have gone down. One of the few times floor prices went up in concert was when we injected liquidity into nfts via our airdrop. One of the few times floor prices went down in concert was when $40m of liquidity was removed via the Azuki mint (not throwing stones, the market just moves based on liquidity more than anything else).&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance no longer supports deposits and withdrawals for several cross-chain bridge tokens linked with the Multichain project.&nbsp;</p>
Binance Suspends Multichain Support
<p>In a recent development, Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has announced that it is ending support for withdrawal and deposit for several Multichain-bridged tokens. From July 7 onwards, customers on networks like BNB Smart Chain, Fantom, Ethereum, and Avalanche will be unable to deposit or withdraw bridged tokens until further notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to note that the suspension only applies to specific tokens bridged to Multichain and does not affect the trading of other cryptocurrencies on Binance. Users can still trade and engage in transactions with the wide range of tokens available on the exchange.</p>
<p>Some of the tokens affected by this decision are Polkastarter (POLS), Alchemy Pay (ACH), Beefy.Finance (BIFI), Harvest Finance (FARM), tokens minted through the bridge on Fantom, like Beefy.Finance (BIFI) and Alpaca Finance (ALPACA), and a token minted on Ethereum&rsquo;s bridge, Travala (AVA).</p>
Binance Assures Funds Safety
<p>Multichain is a cross-chain interoperability protocol. It enables the seamless transfer of assets between different blockchain networks and currently oversees over $1.3 billion in assets, with $698 million minted on Ethereum, $339 million minted on BNB Smart Chain, and $92 million on Fantom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Binance is taking no chances when it comes to safeguarding user funds. Although the team has assured customers that funds remain secure, the uncertainty around the matter is worrying users whose funds are stuck in the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a Binance spokesperson, the temporary suspension of these services on the Binance platform is only a temporary risk management measure. Users can still trade the tokens on Binance and withdraw them using alternative networks. This means that as long as the assets do not involve the Multichain project, they can proceed as normal.&nbsp;</p>
The Multichain Complication
<p>Although the team has not specified the exact reason behind this decision, it is implied that it is in response to the protocol&rsquo;s difficulties that occurred in May. During that period, the project experienced transactional difficulties with processing bridge transfers. Kava, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, and several other pathways of the cross-chain bridge were not functioning properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multichain CEO Zhaojun was also unreachable and rumored to be taken into police custody. As a result, Binance suspended deposits for Multichain-bridged tokens on May 25, citing complications within the protocol. The recent suspension is just a follow-up to the previous action against Multichain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, Binance's decision to suspend transfers of several tokens tied to Multichain is a proactive measure to ensure the security and stability of its users' funds. Users are advised to stay informed through official channels and await further updates from the exchange.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps on the back of incredibly bullish statements by Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, Bitcoin has set a new yearly high with expectations that it will go much higher.</p>
Bitcoin bull market is building
<p>The crypto bull market looks to be very much on this morning as bitcoin touches $31,500, a new high for this year. All that is needed is for bitcoin to get above this level and stay there for a few days in order to give the signal that the break is confirmed and that bitcoin can start traversing higher.</p>
<p>This new bullish environment may have been caused in part by the CEO of Blackrock, the biggest AUM company on the planet, saying on national TV yesterday that bitcoin was "digitising gold", and that it was an &ldquo;international asset&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also after Blackrock had filed for a Spot Bitcoin ETF along with some other large institutional entities. With Blackrock&rsquo;s experience and fantastic success in getting the regulators to sign off on their many ETF filings, this one extra filing has the hallmarks of being an extremely good bet.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s current good fortune is also shared with some of the cryptocurrency market. If bitcoin rides high then most of the crypto market will follow suit, at least as long as impending regulation will allow.</p>
Solana
<p>One of those high riders today is Solana. Itself a target of the SEC, which has labelled it a security. This lightning fast layer 1 has been beaten to a pulp, falling from its November 2021 high of $260 to as low as $8 in December of last year.</p>
<p>However, at $8 it could be imagined that the bottom was in for Solana, with a wick down to $12.60 possibly signalling a double bottom. A descending trendline has suppressed the price since July of 2022 and therefore the $SOL break of this line today could herald much greater things as long as the break is confirmed.</p>
Stacks
<p>Stacks (STX) is another cryptocurrency to watch. It happens to be one of the only SEC-approved cryptocurrencies. It should certainly also benefit from the bitcoin narrative given that it's one of the very few bitcoin layer 2s, which enable apps to be built on top of bitcoin. It hit the 0.786 Fibonacci level yesterday and looks primed to go higher from here.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Investigators from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have concluded that Celsius and its former CEO, Alex Mashinsky broke several US laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has emerged that if a majority of commissioners from the CFTC agree with the conclusion, then the regulator could file a case against Mashinsky in federal court later this month.&nbsp;</p>
Mashinsky Broke Rules&nbsp;
<p>The United States Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has announced the conclusion of its probe into Celsius Network. According to attorneys from the regulator&rsquo;s enforcement unit, Celsius and Mashinsky deliberately misled investors and broke several of the country&rsquo;s investment laws before the firm&rsquo;s eventual collapse in 2022. The CFTC revelations come a year after Celsius had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and left thousands of customers, creditors, and investors in the lurch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New York Attorney General had sued Mashinsky on the 5th of January, 2023, alleging that the former Celsius CEO had misled investors, resulting in losses of billions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m suing the former CEO of cryptocurrency platform @CelsiusNetwork for defrauding investors out of billions of dollars. Alex Mashinsky lied to people about the risks of investing in Celsius, hid its deteriorating financial condition, and failed to register in New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The New York Attorney General stated at the time that Mashinsky had defrauded investors, including 26,000 residents of New York State, out of billions of dollars worth of crypto. She added that Mashinsky&rsquo;s actions leading up to the Celsius bankruptcy led to significant investor losses as he misrepresented the platform&rsquo;s financial condition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the former CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin. &ldquo;The law is clear that making false and unsubstantiated promises and misleading investors is illegal. Today, we are taking action on behalf of thousands of New Yorkers who were defrauded by Mr. Mashinsky to recoup their losses.&rdquo;</p>

CFTC Could File Lawsuit Against Celsius&nbsp;
<p>According to reports, the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission attorneys believe that Celsius misled investors. They also added that the crypto lender should have registered itself with the CFTC. According to sources close to the matter, the CFTC could initiate the filing of a federal case against Celsius if a majority of its commissioners agree with the conclusion that the crypto lender misled investors and customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Court filings have also revealed that the bankrupt crypto lender was under scrutiny from several federal agencies. These include the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), The Washington Department of Financial Institutions Securities Division, and the Massachusetts Securities Division. As a result of these developments, the platform&rsquo;s native CEL token has seen a 12% drop in value. Currently, the token is trading at $0.15.&nbsp;</p>
Fahrenheit To Acquire Celsius Assets&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, it was revealed last month that crypto consortium Fahrenheit won the bid to acquire Celsius Network&rsquo;s assets after a successful bid. Fahrenheit beat fellow bidder NovaWulf, while the Blockchain Recovery Investment Consortium (BRIC) was shortlisted as a backup. Fahrenheit&rsquo;s winning consortium was backed by mining company US Bitcoin Corp, Arrington Capital, Ravi Kaza, Steven Kokinos, and Proof Group. Court filings revealed that Celsius Network&rsquo;s assets were previously valued at $2 billion. The successful bid will see Fahrenheit acquire Celsius&rsquo;s institutional loan portfolio, staked cryptocurrencies, mining units, and additional alternative investments.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The CEO of Blackrock, Larry Fink, said on national television last night that Bitcoin is &ldquo;digitised gold&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That the institutions have arrived there can no longer be any doubt. Blackrock is the biggest asset management company in the world with more than nine trillion dollars in assets under management.</p>
<p>Larry Fink, the CEO of this company, was interviewed on Fox Business Network last night and gave no doubt at all as to his view that Bitcoin was an &ldquo;international asset&rdquo; and that it was &ldquo;digitising gold&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is a 180 degree turn around from someone who back in 2017 said that bitcoin was an &ldquo;index of money laundering&rdquo;. Whether he said this through ignorance or by design we shall probably never know, but Fink appears to now have full conviction in the number one cryptocurrency.</p>
Blackrock knows the game
<p>The Fox Business Network interviewer referred to the 575/1 batting average of Blackrock when it comes to getting its ETFs accepted by the regulators. With that kind of record it might be imagined that Blackrock&rsquo;s filing for a Spot Bitcoin ETF cannot be too far from a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Fink&rsquo;s own words were that &ldquo;we work really closely with our regulators&rdquo; and he went on to say that if the regulators found any particular issues, his company would work around that in order to &ldquo;get the filing approved one day&rdquo;.</p>
Bitcoin is an international asset
<p>The Blackrock CEO said that his company was a believer in &ldquo;digitising products&rdquo; and that he saw the future as tokenisation of assets and securities which would lead to a revolution in finance. Fink continued that his company wanted to &ldquo;democratise crypto&rdquo; and make it &ldquo;much cheaper for investors&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said that bitcoin was something that could be held as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the devaluation of any particular currency. He stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lets be clear, Bitcoin is an international asset. It&rsquo;s not based on any one currency, and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative&rdquo;.</p>

Bitcoin rises on the news
<p>After a couple of days of red price action, bitcoin is up 1% this morning and is looking strong. It can be expected that Fink&rsquo;s statements last night will be taken very seriously by the market. Some more positive price action can be expected, and with bitcoin only just below the most important level of $31,000 the bull market is just beginning.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As CryptoDaily&trade; covered earlier, Choise.com, a revolutional crypto platform connecting CeFi and DeFi, secured a sponsorship deal with the Vienna Vikings, the reigning champions of the European League of Football (ELF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you have missed it, the partnership aims at bridging the worlds of sport and crypto against the backdrop of the American football boom in Europe. Choise.com will support the Vikings throughout their second season in the ELF, inspired by the team&rsquo;s huge potential and gritty determination to augment their collection of trophies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Viennese club has already added the Choise.com branding to its game helmets and social media content, while also providing the company with exposure in Hohe Warte Stadium. The next step in this evolving relationship will be the launch of a special fan-style collection of Crypterium VISA cards honoring the Vienna Vikings&rsquo; players and team officials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We sat down with the Choise.com CEO Vladimir Gorbunov to discover even more exciting details about the company&rsquo;s sensational initiative to support the favorites of Europe's most spectacular American football league.</p>
Seems like the convergence of sports and crypto is a trend that&rsquo;s showing no sign of stopping. What made Choise.com ride this wave?&nbsp;
<p>The phenomenon of the crypto brands scooping up big sports partnerships comes as no surprise; sport, just like cryptocurrency itself, has no boundaries or limits. Effectively, it boasts an extraordinary power to bring together people from all over the world, which can benefit crypto companies in terms of their coverage. By collaborating with the top sports rights holders, crypto advertisers reach out to a multi-million audience of fans who can further become their potential customers and loyal supporters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overriding objective of creating such an alliance is to help as many people as possible to understand crypto banking through the use of products with seamless experience. This is exactly what we took into account when joining forces with the Vienna Vikings. By jumping into the sports sponsorship race, Choise.com got an excellent opportunity to make the crypto lifestyle accessible to all.</p>
How will collaboration with the Vienna Vikings help Choise.com stand out from the competition?
<p>To start with, Choise.com takes precedence as the first crypto firm to team up with the American football club from Europe. Prior to that, we saw a tide of blockchain sponsorships reinforcing teams from the National Football League which is the premier tournament in the USA and Canada. The emergence of the ELF marked a crucial milestone in the history of American football in Europe and the sport itself deservedly gained popularity across the region. In Germany alone, American football experienced a real fan boom, becoming the number two sport behind only football.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Vienna Vikings are the ELF&rsquo;s defending champions. On the road the 2023 season, they are undefeated, which, we believe, is just the beginning of their grand journey to clinching the title once again. The Vikings&rsquo; accomplishments assure a strong presence for Choise.com, allowing us to make the most out of the team&rsquo;s growing influence in Europe and effectively communicate our mission and values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s also important is that this partnership takes place following the &ldquo;crypto winter&rdquo; which made many sports rights holders abandon crypto sponsorships. After all the 2022 collapses, they feel like crypto firms can be unstable partners posing particular financial and reputational risks to the whole industry. In this context, the Vienna Vikings&rsquo; trust in Choise.com and our products serves as a sign of credibility that the whole crypto industry acutely needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
As a result of your joint efforts, Choise.com will give a unique appearance to one of its distinct products &ndash; Crypterium VISA card. Do you plan to expand your partnership with the Vikings into other sectors of your business?&nbsp;
<p>All this is yet to be discussed with our colleagues from the Vienna Vikings. On the Choise.com side, we see enormous potential for our cooperation in many spheres. The NFT market is a fairly promising direction to consider, given that non-fungible tokens are the most common point of contract between crypto and sports. Not to mention that we have already built up high-flying experience in creating digital collectibles &ndash; our latest Chobies NTO Collection was a resounding success, with total sales exceeding $1.9 million.</p>
Are you a fan of American football yourself?
<p>Yes, I absolutely love it! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m even more happier to see our partnership with the Vikings gaining momentum. Doing an honorary toss before the Vikings&rsquo; inaugural game in the 2023 ELF season was a very special moment for me and my son. The overwhelming feeling of unity with the team that I saw and experienced that day, I will never forget.</p>
<p>American football is quite a tough sport bringing a lot of emotions and impressions to its lovers. At the same time, all fans and players seem pretty respectful to each other. For example, it&rsquo;s quite a common case to savor applause to those who were injured, even if they are members of the opposing team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some other subtleties which make American football an extremely appealing experience. We at Choise.com hope it will continue to make a whole lot of noise across the global sport industry, winning the hearts of new fans and onboarding them to a thriving world of crypto assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Polygon has formed its second significant partnership with the Indian government.&nbsp;</p>
A 3-way partnership
<p>The Indian government has partnered with Polygon and Airchains in order to develop a blockchain-based land ownership system. Under this agreement Polygon will closely collaborate with government bodies and stakeholders to explore and implement blockchain solutions across various sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary goal of this partnership is to utilise Polygons' expertise in scalable blockchain infrastructure to enhance existing government initiatives and streamline operations. By integrating blockchain technology into critical systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Airchain, a prominent player in the logistics industry, will also play a vital role in the partnership between Polygon and the Indian government. With its expertise in supply chain management and logistics solutions, Airchain will collaborate with Polygon to streamline and optimise the movement of goods within the blockchain-powered ecosystem.</p>
Two areas where blockchain provides the solution
<p>Land document mutation is a real issue in India and can often lead to landowners unlawfully losing possession of their land. The implementation of a system based on the transparency of blockchain will aim to bring trust back into land ownership transactions.</p>
<p>An additional and exciting new development that can become a reality through blockchain is that of fractional property ownership. Once properly implemented, the door will be open for many citizens to be able to own a fractional share of land, something that was unthinkable not so long ago.</p>
A Digital India
<p>This collaboration aligns with the Indian government's vision of a Digital India by accelerating the country's journey towards digital transformation. Polygons' established reputation, technical proficiency, and commitment to scalability make it an ideal partner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As demand for blockchain based solutions continues to rise, Polygon's infrastructure and expertise can play a crucial role in realising India's digital aspirations. This collaboration has the potential not only to unlock new possibilities but also drive innovation while establishing India as a global leader in blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By actively pursuing partnerships with prominent projects like Polygon the Indian government demonstrates its proactive approach towards embracing cutting edge technologies. Such collaborations foster cooperation, knowledge sharing, and innovation&mdash;an ecosystem that can keep India at the forefront of digital progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its endeavour to further engage with the Indian government, Polygon aims to create ripple effects that surpass national boundaries. This distinctive partnership paves the way for other governments globally, exhibiting how blockchain technology can bring about transformative changes in addressing tangible obstacles and stimulating socioeconomic advancement.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Popular walk-and-earn platform Sweat Economy has unveiled its latest initiative, Sweat Hero, this Wednesday. The hyper-casual community-based NFT game allows players to compete against friends on the Sweat Wallet mobile app, which uses data from other apps on your smartphone or smartwatch to monitor your physical activity. The game is created based on sustainable token economics, aiming to enhance the overall competition levels and maintain a thriving gaming ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sweat Hero introduces a unique approach to how gaming works. In contrast to the &ldquo;pay-to-play&rdquo; models adopted by legacy games, Sweat Hero offers new players a free non-fungible token (NFT) to start the game - basically, paying the users to play. Users connect with each other via the Sweat Wallet app and battle against each other to upgrade their NFTs or win $SWEAT token rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offering a free-to-play model also contrasts with most of the move-to-earn games today. Sweat Hero revolutionizes this industry by creating a sustainable tokenomics (token economics) model that doesn&rsquo;t involve asking players to purchase NFTs worth hundreds of dollars before playing. Many of these NFT games and M2E platforms sustain their economy by expecting new users to join and purchase an NFT. Additionally, the teams may limit the number of NFTs to induce artificial scarcity and potentially increase their value, preventing some players from ever getting their hands on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the contrary, Sweat Hero launches a &ldquo;token sink model&rdquo; that solves these problems and increases the economic viability of the game&rsquo;s ecosystem. The token sink system works by retaining 20% of the total battle wager as a battle fee, with 80% of the wager going to the winner. The battle fee is sent to Sweat Wallet&rsquo;s token sink and burned to reduce the total number of circulating $SWEAT tokens. As more people join the battle, more tokens will be burned, meaning there will be fewer idle and liquid tokens in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;"We're leaving behind the times of scarcity in the NFT space and breaking the old standard of 'pay to play' in the M2E gaming space,&rdquo;&nbsp; Oleg Fomenko, Co-founder of Sweat Economy, shared. &ldquo;With Sweat Hero, millions of people can engage with free NFTs, and the more players we have, the more $SWEAT goes into the token sink, making token economics sustainable."</p>

<p>As players win battles and challenges by increasing their daily steps, they will enhance their NFT Power, giving them an in-game advantage. These NFTs are dynamic and will evolve based on users' gameplay progression, physical activities, and engagement within the Sweat Wallet app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from rewards and earnings in the game, the gamification of physical activity on Sweat Hero makes exercising more fun and motivates users to follow their daily exercise routines. These factors can have an overarching effect on the overall health of the users by motivating users to walk more, creating a daily habit and driving engagement through battles with friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future upgrades on Sweat Wallet will introduce seven Arenas that players can level up into to secure a higher earning potential and a new dynamic NFT evolvement framework expected to launch in Q4 this year.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bears Eye Stops Below 30635:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 6 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to orbit the 31000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair remained within striking distance of testing the recent twelve-month high around the 31443.67 area, just below an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area. Decent selling pressure intensified around the 31142.38 area and this elevates the risk of another test of the 29427 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;Below that area, the 28604.83 level represents the 50% retracement of that appreciating range.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30576.33 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30698.91.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A good way to track this is by taking a look at the future long-term plans of some of the best platforms around, such as Scorpion Casino (SCORP), Fun Token (FUN) and Stake.com. Scorpion is especially worth paying attention to at the moment - read more to find out why.</p>
Scorpion Aims To Change The Game!
<p>Scorpion Casino is currently in the midst of a widely successful presale, which will end with the launch of its native Scorpion Token (SCORP). SCORP will be a deflationary token that improves alongside the platform through automatic burns every single time a user makes a transaction and every single time the casino generates profit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of the upcoming token is important due to the position it holds as the asset that empowers the platform&rsquo;s ecosystem and its total 370 licensed games (210 casino games and 160 live games) as well as all the sports betting opportunities for popular sports such as American Basketball and International Football. The token will join a short but solid list of top cryptos users can bet with, including the biggest crypto of all time, Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
Have All The FUN You Want With The Token
<p>As suggested by its name, Fun Token is a platform focused on becoming the home of all the fun users can have online when it comes to crypto gaming. The platform prides itself on being a diverse place that offers fairness and transparency to all of its player base, meaning that everyone can bet and play amongst each other using the assets in their wallets without any worries of being taken advantage of or worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the latest developments being made in the world of Fun token are about accessibility. The project has partnered with Now Payments that has made for users to pay with FUN easier than before and the integration with ChangeNOW DEX, ensures faster and more secure FUN token swaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Stake.com Builds An Empire
<p>Stake.com is an online sportsbook and casino that debuted in 2017 and shot to fame right away. They quickly rose to the position of becoming one of the world's largest online casinos, thanks to its numerous sponsorship agreements. The success of Stake.com is proof that the merger of crypto and betting will become a telling tale in the near future!</p>
<p>According to rumours, Rush Street Interactive may be on Stake.com's list of prospective targets as it seeks acquisitions that could provide it access to the US iGaming market. The platform wants to expand into more regulated gambling areas in the US and abroad. Furthermore, Stake is also aiming to obtain a licence in Australia's regulated online gambling industry. It also has an application for iGaming in Ontario, Canada, that it is currently waiting to hear back from. Considering the fact that Stake is based out of Cura&ccedil;ao and already has offices all over the world, global domination is clearly on its agenda!</p>
<p></p>
How Scorpion Claws its Way To The Top
<p>One of the platform's primary focuses is its community, ensuring that all its users have an enjoyable and lucrative experience on the platform to make sure they keep coming back for more. Users can create a passive income avenue on the platform, potentially earning up to $10,000 per day by betting with SCORP, thanks to its integrated distribution. On top of that, users can earn rewards of $1000 upwards if they take part in other platform features, such as signing up for the VIP Members Club and much more. There&rsquo;s even more about the platform that could establish it as the go-to place once the presale is over, but for now, when it comes to earning opportunities - it's unmatched!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In its latest blogpost, Choise.com, a gateway crypto platform blending CeFi and DeFi in one concept, has revealed their exclusive partnership with the ELF (European League of Football) champions Vienna Vikings. According to the official statement, this effort is intended to encourage cryptocurrency adoption among numerous fans of American football around the world.</p>
<p>The collaboration with the Vienna Vikings marks the Choise.com&rsquo;s active involvement in the sports industry. As American football is now booming across Europe, this newly forged alliance promises a global wave of interest to the ever-growing crypto ecosystem. Choise.com has already onboarded more than 1 million users in over 170 countries to its platform and keeps spreading awareness about digital assets by joining efforts with the leading brands from various sectors.&nbsp;</p>
Why the Vienna Vikings?
<p>The Vienna Vikings have dominated American football in Austria for the past two decades. The club boasts a truly rich heritage which includes winning the national Austrian Bowl 15 times in their history, as well as capturing the Eurobowl title 5 times from 2004 to 2007 and in 2013. The beginning of the Vikings&rsquo; journey in the ELF, the Europe&rsquo;s biggest American football tournament, turned out to be striking &ndash; they triumphantly won their first season in 2022, beating the Hamburg Sea Devils in the Championship Game with a score of 27-15.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, the Viennese club is committed to Running It Back and repeating their resounding success in the third season of the ELF. After a continuous streak of 4 wins over the Berlin Thunder, the Prague Lions, the Leipzig Kings, and the Fehervar Enthroners, the Vikings opened further their lead in the standings ahead of matchups against the Raiders Tirol and the Panthers Wroclaw.</p>
<p>Next to that, the Vienna Vikings, rooted in the American Football &amp; Cheerleading Club of the Vikings, have established themselves as a powerhouse program with great youth development. Among their most famous inmates are Bernhard Raimann (OL Indianapolis Colts) and Bernhard Seikovits (TE Arizona Cardinals) who are currently shining in the NFL.</p>
<p>All this coupled with a persuasive fanbase resulted in the Vienna Vikings becoming the right partner for Choise.com, making its grand entrance into the thriving American football space.</p>
The Mutually Beneficial Relationship
<p>Choise.com is assured of a beneficial association because of the Vienna Vikings&rsquo; palpable affluence within Europe. Meanwhile, by collaborating with the reigning ELF champion, the platform will enhance the club&rsquo;s branding in several aspects such as the team&rsquo;s apparel, social media presence, and stadium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of the Choise.com logo featuring prominently in all official helmets, there is another joint initiative that has been planned for execution as well. Through their partnership with the Vienna Vikings, Choise.com intends to launch a unique line of Crypterium cards with a bespoke design celebrating the club and its team members. Crypterium card is a VISA card available for order in over 30 countries. Choise.com users can issue both virtual and plastic versions of the card, replenish it from their wallets, make worldwide payments wherever VISA is accepted, as well as withdraw cash from ATMs in more than 200 countries.To date, the product already serves over 50,000 clients.</p>
<p>On June 24, the Vikings demonstrated their newly branded helmets for the first time. This happened during their inaugural matchup against the Leipzig Kings. The game started with the opening ceremony during which the CEO of Choise.com Vladimir Gorbunov together with his son did the honorary coin toss in the center of the Hohe Warte stadium. But the real cherry on the cake was the incredible victory of the Vienna Vikings who defeated their rivals 47-14 in acknowledgment of a longstanding cooperation with the crypto platform. Since that day, the team has remained unbeaten and only strengthened their positions in the standings after the latest triumph over the Fehervar Enthrodes, 41-12.</p>
<p>Choise.com is an all-purpose crypto platform offering a broad set of crypto banking services at the junction of CeFi and DeFi. This includes purchasing and earning crypto in interest accounts, Web3 staking, generating profits from NFTs, as well as trying out dual-currency investments with high yields. You can also enjoy all the platform&rsquo;s features on the go by downloading the Choise.com mobile app.</p>
<p>What else makes Choise.com stand out from the competition is its latest state-of-art product &ndash; BitDriven index token overseen by acclaimed cryptocurrency researchers and analysts. Through this tool users can gain exposure to the portfolio of the most promising coins with a persuasive performance history and good fundamental reasons for substantial growth. The collective value of this portfolio is supposed to grow up to x12 after the 2024 Bitcoin halving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choise.com will provide support to the Vienna Vikings throughout the entire 2023 season, bringing digital assets closer than ever before to thousands of its enthusiastic fans.</p>
