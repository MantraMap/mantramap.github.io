Olga Skorobogatova, first deputy governor of the Bank of Russia, stated that customers of these banks will be able to apply to join the pilot &#8220;after some time.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Bank of Russia Digital Ruble Test Will Include 13 Banks</h2>
<p>The Bank of Russia is completing preparations for the upcoming digital ruble pilot test that will start on August 15. The bank recently announced that all banks that expressed their desire to be part of this test have already confirmed their participation in the pilot, making technical arrangements specifically directed for this test.</p>
<p>According to the Russian state news agency Tass, the first deputy governor of the Bank of Russia, Olga Skorobogatova, <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1658291" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>13 banks completed all the preparatory activities as regards technical preparations and development of their own mobile apps and ready to start transactions with real clients together with us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The level of involvement of banks in this pilot was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-launch-digital-ruble-transactions-with-real-users-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> earlier by the chairman of the board of Ingosstrakh Bank, Stanislav Danysh, who explained that the participating banks would allow users and corporations to transact using the digital ruble. However, the first phase, he stated, would be limited, only including bank partners and employees.</p>

<h2>Retail Users&#8217; Involvement Confirmed</h2>
<p>While Skorobogatova did not offer a time frame for the activities of the pilot test, she did explain that customers of the banks would be able to participate directly in the pilot.</p>
<p>Skorobogatova declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Retail clients of banks participating in the pilot project will be able after some time to submit applications for digital ruble testing in real transactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other banks not participating in the test this year are expected to be part of the pilot test. Skorobogatova revealed that sixteen more banks will be part of the digital ruble test network next year.</p>
<p>In July, the Bank of Russia also considered integrating the digital ruble network with other digital currencies to interconnect different payment systems. This would allow the bank to harness the digital ruble as a cross-border payment currency. At the time, the governor of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-russia-discusses-digital-ruble-integration-with-other-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that several ways for reaching this integration were being discussed with friendly countries.</p>

He is convinced that a digitized greenback and other digital fiats represent a threat to democracy in the United States.</strong></p>
<h2>CBDC Is the ‘Latest Trojan Horse of the Great Reset,’ Opponent Ramaswamy Says</h2>
<p>Vivek Ramaswamy, one of the runners in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries, has criticized the U.S. government for considering a digital version of the dollar. “It’s telling that Janet Yellen is pushing for the U.S. to adopt CBDCs, begging Americans to keep up with the Jinpings,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1689035239417393152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy believes that “CBDCs are just the latest Trojan horse of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great Reset</a> and are a clear path to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social credit system</a> that will permanently embed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESG</a> into our currency itself.” In his view, “the dollar will be *stronger* if we protect it from digitization.”</p>
<p>In a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, the American entrepreneur said he is a “big opponent” of central bank digital currencies, which he considers to be “a grave threat to liberty in this country,” for the same reason that China is adopting them. He elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the U.S., that’s become an argument to say we need to do that to keep up. I view it the other way — precisely for the reasons that Xi Jinping wants to adopt it, is exactly the reasons why we in the United States shouldn’t.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Fed Should Focus on Stabilizing Dollar, White House Hopeful Suggests</h2>
<p>Vivek Ramaswamy also slammed the U.S. Federal Reserve for its behavior in the past couple of decades, calling the central bank “a bad actor” for “trying to hit two targets with one arrow, inflation and unemployment, which has proven to be a disastrous 25-year experiment.”</p>
<p>“I think what the Federal Reserve needs to do is go back to focusing on what it did focus on, even after it went off the gold standard … stabilizing the U.S. dollar as a unit of measurement. That, too, is a big impediment to GDP growth,” the presidential candidate explained.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy’s comments on CBDCs come after last month, another contender to become the Republican nominee for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/done-dead-desantis-to-nix-central-bank-digital-currency-on-day-1/">vowed</a> to “nix central bank digital currency,” if he is elected president, describing it as a “massive threat to American liberty.”</p>

The motion, filed in the Southern District of New York, argues that Gemini&#8217;s allegations of fraudulent misrepresentations related to the Gemini Earn program are without merit and inadequately substantiated. DCG&#8217;s legal team asserts that the lawsuit lacks actionable evidence and calls for the court to dismiss the complaint.</strong></p>
<h2>Digital Currency Group Seeks Dismissal of Gemini Lawsuit, Citing Lack of Evidence and Inadequate Allegations</h2>
<p>In the preliminary statement of the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67665383/16/gemini-trust-company-llc-v-digital-currency-group-inc/">motion</a>, DCG outlines Gemini&#8217;s claims related to the Gemini Earn program, formerly operated by Gemini in coordination with Genesis Global Capital, LLC (Genesis). DCG argues that Gemini&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-files-lawsuit-against-digital-currency-group-and-barry-silbert-alleging-fraud-and-deception/">allegations</a>, aimed at holding DCG and Barry Silbert responsible for Genesis&#8217;s actions, are unfounded.</p>
<p>DCG&#8217;s motion further points out that Gemini&#8217;s allegations fail to adequately allege fraud by the defendants. The argument section of the motion elaborates that none of the statements made by the defendants are actionable and that the defendants are not liable for alleged misrepresentations by Genesis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gemini argues that defendants aided and abetted Genesis’s alleged fraud through various corporate transactions and paperwork. This effort fares no better,&#8221; <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.603648/gov.uscourts.nysd.603648.17.0.pdf">the letter</a> supporting the motion to dismiss filing published on August 10, 2023, explains. &#8220;There are no well-pled allegations that Defendants had actual knowledge of any alleged fraud, and Gemini does no more than rely on Defendants’ corporate relationship with Genesis to argue otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the lack of evidence for fraudulent actions, DCG&#8217;s motion accuses Gemini of failing to plead knowledge of the alleged fraud. They further dismiss Gemini&#8217;s accusations as baseless, criticizing the lack of substantial support for the claims. “The rest of the complaint is a hodgepodge of conclusory allegations against non-defendant Genesis,” DCG’s attorneys insist. The motion continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gemini tries in various ways to hold defendants responsible for alleged misrepresentations by Genesis, but Gemini’s efforts to impute them to defendants fail as a matter of law. It is a settled principle of law that parents are not liable for the conduct of their subsidiaries, and Gemini does not even try to allege any theory of alter ego. Instead, it asserts that defendants are liable for not affirmatively correcting the alleged misstatements of Genesis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Digital Currency Group&#8217;s response to the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-files-lawsuit-against-digital-currency-group-and-barry-silbert-alleging-fraud-and-deception/">lawsuit</a> comes after Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss publicly announced legal action against DCG and CEO Barry Silbert. Gemini&#8217;s lawsuit seeks to recover damages and losses incurred as a result of alleged false and misleading representations by DCG and Silbert. At the time, DCG <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1677346741409173508?s=20">stressed</a> that the lawsuit was simply “another publicity stunt from Cameron Winklevoss to deflect blame.”</p>

The executive cited his contacts at Blackrock, the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager, and investment management firm Invesco. Both companies have filed to launch a bitcoin ETF with the SEC.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Novogratz Discusses Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval, Says Ripple Ruling Is &#x2018;a Big Deal&#x2019;</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings, Mike Novogratz, revealed during his company&#x2019;s Q2 earnings call on Tuesday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) within four to six months.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Commenting on the likelihood of the SEC greenlighting spot bitcoin ETF filings by Blackrock and Invesco, Novogratz shared:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Both our contacts, from the Invesco side and from the Blackrock side, get you to think that this is a question of when, not if, that the outside window is probably six months.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
The Galaxy Digital executive added that it may take &#x201C;four to six months if you had to put a &#x2018;pin the tail on the donkey&#x2019; on it that the SEC is going to approve a bitcoin ETF.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In June, Blackrock <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filed</a> to launch a spot bitcoin trust ETF. Blackrock CEO Larry Fink explained that the asset manager is seeking to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-seeks-to-democratize-crypto-ceo-says-bitcoin-can-hedge-against-inflation-currency-devaluation/">democratize crypto</a>. He believes that crypto will &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-says-crypto-will-transcend-any-one-currency-sees-broad-based-global-interest/">transcend any one currency</a>.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Novogratz further said on Tuesday&#x2019;s earnings call: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s significant that Larry Fink who runs the largest asset manager in the world &#x2014; Blackrock runs $7 trillion &#x2014; is out, having been orange pilled, talking very positive about bitcoin and the crypto universe, bitcoin as the first global money. That&#x2019;s a huge change of heart from where he was, five, six years ago, where the institutional world was.&#x201D; Novogratz opined:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Once we get this ETF &#x2026; it just makes it very easy for people to make large allocations into the space.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Invesco and Galaxy Digital partnered last September to offer investors exposure to a range of products in the digital asset ecosystem. According to Bloomberg analysts specializing in ETFs, the likelihood of the SEC approving a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/etf-analysts-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-at-65-amid-pressure-from-blackrock/">surged to 65%</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Novogratz also explained the significance of the Ripple ruling, stating:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s a big deal, mostly because the SEC and Gary Gensler have been saying over and over: &#x2018;Hey, the rules are clear. Just come in and register.&#x2019;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
However, the Galaxy Digital boss pointed out that District Judge Analisa Torres &#x201C;made it really clear, the rules aren&#x2019;t clear,&#x201D; emphasizing that &#x201C;They&#x2019;re nothing close to clear.&#x201D; Novogratz added that in his opinion, the Ripple decision &#x201C;pressures the Democrats to finally come to the table with the Republicans and try to put forward some legislation to give us clarity.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On Wednesday, the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-to-appeal-ripple-xrp-ruling-requests-stay-of-proceedings/">informed</a> Judge Torres that it intends to file an appeal to her ruling in the SEC v. Ripple case regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>. The securities regulator also seeks a stay of court proceedings.&#13;<br />

<h2>SEC Not Disputing Whether <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> Is a Security</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has informed District Judge Analisa Torres that it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-to-appeal-ripple-xrp-ruling-requests-stay-of-proceedings/">intends to appeal</a> her ruling in the Ripple case. However, the securities regulator is not appealing the non-security status of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, Jeremy Hogan, partner at law firm Hogan & Hogan, explained on Twitter Wednesday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The SEC continues making questionable decisions, requesting an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-to-appeal-ripple-xrp-ruling-requests-stay-of-proceedings/">interlocutory appeal</a>,&#x201D; Hogan tweeted, emphasizing:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Note that it is NOT appealing whether <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> itself is a security &#x2014; just its losses on the programmatic and individual sales issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
In another tweet, he clarified that challenging programmatic sales and challenging the non-security status of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> are &#x201C;two separate issues.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
While reiterating Judge Torres&#x2019; ruling that &#x201C;<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is not a security,&#x201D; Hogan explained: &#x201C;If the SEC wins the appeal on sales, then Ripple couldn&#x2019;t use exchanges to facilitate sales.&#x201D; The lawyer added that the big question is whether crypto exchanges would keep <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> listed. &#x201C;I think yes, as long as they can verify the sales are not being made by Ripple,&#x201D; he stated.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following Judge Torres&#x2019; ruling on the Ripple case last month, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-disappointed-with-xrp-ruling-on-retail-investors-chair-gensler-hints-at-more-crypto-industry-enforcement/">said</a> the securities regulator is &#x201C;disappointed&#x201D; with what the judge said about retail investors. Nonetheless, he affirmed that the SEC will continue its enforcement actions against cryptocurrency companies that fail to comply with regulations. The SEC chief believes that crypto is &#x201C;a highly speculative asset class&#x201D; and a field that is &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-says-crypto-is-a-highly-speculative-field-rife-with-fraud/">rife with fraud</a>.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In a filing for its lawsuit against Terraform Labs and Do Kwon, the SEC claimed that some decisions in the Ripple court ruling on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> were &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-says-xrp-ruling-in-ripple-case-wrongly-decided-signals-appeal/">wrongly decided</a>.&#x201D; Moreover, District Judge Jed S. Rakoff <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-district-judge-rejects-approach-in-sec-v-ripple-ruling-on-xrp/">disagreed</a> with the approach taken by Judge Torres in the SEC v. Ripple case concerning <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>.&#13;<br />

This latest development follows the recent discovery of Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm chips being used in a commercial setting, a milestone in the industry. TSMC&#x2019;s 2nm chips, boasting processing speeds 10% to 15% faster than their 3nm counterparts, could significantly transform industries like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/study-generative-ai-could-add-trillions-to-global-economy/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-network-adjusts-mining-difficulty-rises-0-12-to-52-39-trillion/">bitcoin (BTC) mining</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Nikkei <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-to-make-cutting-edge-2-nm-chips-at-new-plant-in-southern-Taiwan">reports</a> that the Kaohsiung plant, currently under construction, will be the second hub for these advanced semiconductors, following Hsinchu county. The decision comes after a board meeting on Tuesday, where the company allocated roughly $6 billion for capital investments in Taiwan, with a portion going toward the Kaohsiung facility.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The company&#x2019;s plans reflect a shift in focus, as it originally intended to produce older legacy semiconductors in Kaohsiung. However, a change in plans was considered following the flagging demand for computer chips, which started after the pandemic. The new venture towards 2nm chips aligns with the global trend of advancing chip technology, aiming to meet the demands of fields like AI and cloud computing.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Nikkei staff reporter Hideaki Ryugen disclosed that Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai expressed support for TSMC&#x2019;s new initiative, committing to adjustments to water and electricity supply to ensure smooth construction. Ryugen further noted that TSMC is also seeking a site for a new plant in Taichung, which could become its third 2nm chip hub in Taiwan.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the context of the broader industry, TSMC&#x2019;s advancement towards 2nm chips echoes the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/samsungs-3nm-gaa-chip-discovered-in-microbts-next-gen-bitcoin-mining-rig/">recent discovery</a> of Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm Gate-All-Around (GAA) semiconductor in Microbt&#x2019;s Whatsminer M56S++ bitcoin mining rig. This marked the first known application of the 3nm technology, discovered by Techinsights. Samsung&#x2019;s breakthrough has long been speculated, and its commercialization can aid in the production of even more advanced chips.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The discovery of Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm chip in the bitcoin mining machine is a crucial development, enhancing performance and energy efficiency. The Whatsminer M56S++ bitcoin mining rig produces an estimated 230 to 254 terahash per second (TH/s), and the utilization of Samsung&#x2019;s technology could be a harbinger of things to come in the industry. For instance, Microbt&#x2019;s rival, Bitmain, is believed to utilize chips supplied by TSMC, the same company venturing into 2nm technology.&#13;<br />

Furthermore, the survey details that the BMC accounts for 43.4% of the global mining network.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Insights From the Bitcoin Mining Council&#x2019;s Latest Survey</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The Bitcoin Mining Council, a collaborative global forum of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> mining companies and associated businesses, <a href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/bitcoin-mining-council-survey-confirms-year-on-year-improvements-in-sustainable-power-and-technological-efficiency-in-h1-2023/">announced</a> the findings of its recent survey on August 9, 2023. Focused on electricity consumption, technological efficiency, and sustainable power mix, the survey reveals that BMC&#x2019;s membership hashrate has increased from 24 exahash per second (EH/s) in Q1 2022 to 158 EH/s in Q2 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The survey&#x2019;s results highlight a significant shift toward sustainable energy within the bitcoin mining industry. Members of the BMC are utilizing electricity with a 63.1% sustainable power mix, reflecting a positive trend in environmental consciousness.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Based on this data, the global bitcoin mining industry&#x2019;s sustainable electricity mix has improved marginally to 59.9% and remains one of the most sustainable industries globally,&#x201D; the report stated.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Additionally, a year-on-year comparison reveals that the technological efficiency of the global Bitcoin network rose by 24%, growing from 21.1 EH/s per gigawatt (GW) in the first half of 2022 to 26.1 EH/s per GW in the corresponding period of 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Entering 2023, the Bitcoin network has never been stronger or more secure,&#x201D; Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer of Bitfarms stated. &#x201C;Despite the macro headwinds in the second half of 2022, the industry has continued to deploy new miners, increasing hash rate and improving energy efficiency and network security.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Gagnon added:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>In H1 2023, we also saw a significant increase in curtailment, with BMC members reporting 2.5 GW worth of Bitcoin mining operations participating in curtailment programs and 815 GWh of energy released back to local grids during times of peak demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Gagnon added that most of this curtailment is identified in the United States and Canada, where the available interruptible load equals roughly 25% of all installed utility battery storage across these two nations. Through such initiatives, Bitcoin mining manifests itself in various regions as an essential tool for grid stabilization and as the &#x201C;buyer of last resort,&#x201D; Gagnon said.&#13;<br />

This monthly surge aligns with June&#8217;s 0.2% escalation, where food costs and automobile insurance similarly contributed to the inflationary computation.</strong></p>
<h2>3.2% Inflation in July: U.S. Economy Faces Growing Pressure Amid Rising Costs</h2>
<p>The U.S. economy is experiencing pressure as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) demonstrates a hastened year-over-year increment for July, per <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf">data</a> unveiled on Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI climbed 3.2% from the previous year, marginally accelerating from June&#8217;s 3% annual growth. Prices also advanced by 0.2% in July compared to the preceding month, echoing June&#8217;s 0.2% monthly enhancement. This moderate inflation hike has economists, policymakers, and consumers on guard.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: July CPI inflation data shows US inflation rate RISES to 3.2%, below expectations of 3.3%.</p>

<p>This is the first monthly increase in CPI inflation since July 2022.</p>
<p>The Fed&#39;s job just got a lot harder.</p>
<p>&mdash; The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) <a href="https://twitter.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1689615202273128448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>July&#8217;s inflation statistics have rekindled discussions regarding the viability of the current economic resurgence. With a 3.2% surge in CPI, analysts are meticulously observing indications of a greater upward trajectory in the approaching months. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s outlook on fiscal policies and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-governor-hints-at-more-interest-rate-hikes/">interest rates</a> may be swayed by these figures, prompting potential shifts that could affect borrowing expenses and investment tactics.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve beaten inflation but prices keep going up.</p>
<p>&mdash; Sven Henrich (@NorthmanTrader) <a href="https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1689617966533398528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Upon publication of the news, economist and gold proponent Peter Schiff offered his perspective. “Don&#8217;t believe the financial media&#8217;s spin that July&#8217;s 3.2% YoY CPI rise, with YoY core at 4.7%, means the Fed is winning its war against inflation,” Schiff <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1689619258622304261?s=20">stated</a>. “Core is bottoming, and the headline number is about to rise sharply led higher by surging oil prices. The Fed has already lost.”</p>
<p>Economist and president of the Brownstone Institute, Jeffrey Tucker, shared his viewpoint <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffreyatucker/status/1689616938974978048?s=20">proclaiming</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>CPI same in July as it was in June, namely 50% higher than target, which will no doubt be reported as continued cooling and easing. Look, this was supposed to be continuing to fall to the target. This wicked tax has been eating through the dollar&#8217;s value for 31 months!</p></blockquote>
<p>The market&#8217;s response to the CPI figures was divided, mirroring the ambiguity encompassing the greater economic landscape. While certain investors perceive the inflation acceleration as evidence of strong economic growth, others are concerned about potential overheating and ensuing policy tightening requirements. On a month-to-month basis, the 0.2% price augmentation remained consistent with June.</p>
<p>This stability could be construed as an indication that inflation is not skyrocketing uncontrollably but is adhering to an anticipated pattern. Such a perspective may bolster those advocating for a cautious strategy regarding policy intercession.</p>
<p>All four benchmark stock indexes dropped on the news, and the <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">crypto economy</a> hardly stirred, with bitcoin, ethereum, and other prices remaining unchanged. Gold and silver spot prices, conversely, exhibited distinct reactions — both precious metals markets <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">experienced</a> gains following the publication of the CPI report.</p>

As consumer prices rose to a reading of 3.2% in July, traders so far seem unsure on how to process this data. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> fell by nearly 5% today.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Chainlink (LINK) was back in the red during today&#x2019;s session, as bulls retreated following a recent three-day win streak.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
After moving to a peak of $7.86 on Wednesday, LINK/USD slipped to a floor of $7.57 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Thursday&#x2019;s decline sees chainlink slip away from a move towards a long-term ceiling at the $8.00 level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One reason for the drop off appears to be due to a collision with a ceiling of 58.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, price strength is at a reading of 57.27, with the next visible floor at the 52.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should bears hit this target, LINK will likely be trading at $7.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Another notable token to fall today was <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, which fell by as much as 5% during today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
After peaking at $0.6623 during yesterday&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD plunged to a bottom at the $0.6253 level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Overall, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, has been on the decline since its peak of $0.9479 on July 13, which was a 20-month high.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The latest drop coincided with the RSI failing to break out of a key resistance zone at the 46.00 region.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the event momentum remains bearish throughout the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> could be moving towards $0.5000.&#13;<br />

Citing inconsistencies in onchain data, Cryptoquant has questioned the authenticity of the identified wallet&#x2019;s connection to Tether. This challenge adds a new twist to the ongoing discussions about Tether&#x2019;s reported bitcoin holdings.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Alleged Tether Bitcoin Wallet Under Scrutiny: Cryptoquant Finds Inconsistencies in Onchain Data</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-suggest-11th-largest-bitcoin-wallet-belongs-to-stablecoin-giant-tether/">claim began</a> when a research analyst from 21.co suggested a specific bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) address (the 11th largest) as Tether&#x2019;s official <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet. Crypto journalist Yogita Khatri further <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/243310/tether-bitcoin-11th-largest-holder?utm_source=telegram2&utm_medium=social">reported</a> that a source had confirmed Tether&#x2019;s ownership. This claim was later <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1689515834497191937?s=20">challenged</a> by Cryptoquant, which analyzed the onchain data and found discrepancies.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to Cryptoquant, the so-called Tether bitcoin holding <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qjasf9z3h7w3jspkhtgatgpyvvzgpa2wwd2lr0eh5tx44reyn2k7sfc27a4">wallet</a> did not match the description in Tether&#x2019;s quarterly report. While the wallet started accumulating <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, no holdings were reported in last year&#x2019;s Q4 report. Cryptoquant <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1689515842441248768?s=20">highlighted</a> that this could not be the only <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet Tether possesses, casting doubt on the connection.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Cryptoquant&#x2019;s analysis further reveals a blind spot in onchain data when monitoring <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> &#x2018;whale&#x2019; behavior. The term &#x2018;whales&#x2019; often refers to entities holding significant amounts of bitcoin. However, the firm emphasizes that it&#x2019;s possible to miss individual characteristics or mislabel wallets on exchanges, leading to misinterpretation of the data.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The skepticism from Cryptoquant stems from the complex nature of defining and identifying wallet ownership. A significant movement of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from May to July was observed, but it appeared to be a movement associated with Robinhood. This exemplifies the difficulty in precisely determining wallet ownership, and Cryptoquant&#x2019;s warning against hasty conclusions.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Tether&#x2019;s Bitcoin reserves have been a topic of intense scrutiny in the crypto community, and Cryptoquant&#x2019;s challenge adds more uncertainty to the ongoing debate.&#13;<br />
