<p>Geneva, Switzerland, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>TRON DAO, a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps, today announced that it has joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). As an EEA member, TRON DAO will collaborate with EEA and its members, the leading business adopters, innovators and leaders within the Ethereum ecosystem, to accelerate the pace of Ethereum business advancements and adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TRON DAO is accelerating the progression of Web3 adoption across a global scale by creating novel and useful solutions for builders and consumers. &ldquo;TRON and Ethereum have grown and matured together over the years,&rdquo; says TRON blockchain Founder, H.E. Justin Sun. &ldquo;We want this affiliation to be a step forward for the industry to showcase that progress comes in many forms. Blockchain has the potential to change the world in manners we cannot fathom and we need to coordinate together to make it happen. I am optimistic that partnerships like this are one of the healthiest moves we can collectively do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The EEA&rsquo;s membership base represents companies from every region of the world. The EEA&rsquo;s Interest Groups, Working Groups, and events bring together the top Ethereum and global business leaders, technologists, and industry experts to learn about the latest business reference implementations, real-world use cases, and technical innovations. The EEA&rsquo;s educational primers, designed specifically for non-technical entrants to the Ethereum ecosystem, offer introductions to many of the different concepts and facets of Ethereum, and blockchain as a whole, to help more professionals get started on the platform. </p>

<p>About TRON DAO</p>
<p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of December 2022, it has over 130 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.4 billion total transactions, and over $9.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government&rsquo;s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (&ldquo;DMC&rdquo;), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica&rsquo;s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p>
