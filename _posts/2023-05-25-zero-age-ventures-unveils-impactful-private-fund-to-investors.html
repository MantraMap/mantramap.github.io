<p>Perth, Australia, May 25th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>The team behind the Australian Kosmos Ventures is excited to unveil their new investment vehicle, Zero Age Ventures, focusing on blockchain technology.</p><p>The new fund looks to build on the successful legacy of the Kosmos Fund I. Originally established in 2017, Kosmos made numerous seed investments in prominent protocols such as Solana, Algorand, Polkadot and Fantom. Zero Age Ventures aims to continue this legacy by driving innovation and growth in the industry.</p><p>From very early on, the team recognized the immense potential of blockchain technology. Their successful investment legacy has earned them a remarkable 50x multiple on invested capital from 2017 to 2023.</p><p>As the team transitions into the next phase of its growth, all new investments will be managed under Zero Age Ventures. While Kosmos Fund I will continue to provide support to existing portfolio companies, it will be gradually phased out, with no new investments being made under its umbrella.</p><p>Zero Age Ventures aims to open up early-stage investment opportunities in blockchain technology to a wider array of external LPs. Building on their predecessor's success, the team intends to expand their in-house engineering and research teams, produce research articles, and supply market analytics to bolster their investment strategies. By increasing visibility and sharing their insights, they strive to build a strong reputation in the industry, ultimately gaining a competitive advantage and elevating their brand.</p><p>Zero Age Ventures has formulated a compelling investment thesis, stating,</p>"We believe that distributed consensus and the abstraction of trust will unleash the greatest economic potential since the advent of the internet. Our commitment to this vision drives our investment strategies, as we seek to support the technologies and projects that will revolutionize the way we interact, transact, and build trust in the digital era.&rdquo;<p>To achieve this vision, Zero Age Ventures will focus on bootstrapping network effects through token/product design, governance, community building, and go-to-market strategy.</p><p>Following a successful initial close and with General Partners pledging up to $10 million of their own capital, Zero Age Ventures is well-positioned to allocate considerable funds in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>Zero Age On the Move</p><p>The decision to transition the Fund II to Zero Age Ventures was driven by the team's desire to create a distinct brand, elevate competitiveness, and carve out a unique identity in the crypto investment arena. The team's legacy of successful investments will be leveraged to attract high-quality Limited Partners to the venture.</p><p>General Partner of Zero Age Ventures and co-founder of the successful project Opulous, Miles Carroll, discussed the team's blockchain investment journey. He said,</p>"As early participants, our team has reviewed thousands of deals and invested in 160+ projects over six years. We've seen what works and what doesn't, and we've been there to support teams and founders, helping them avoid common pitfalls. Having experienced various market cycles, we recognized the importance of a solid foundation, leading to Kosmos evolving into a registered fund and upholding our commitment to industry growth and innovation."<p>About Zero Age Ventures</p><p>Zero Age Ventures is a promising new investment vehicle that seeks to support the technologies and projects that will revolutionize the way we interact, transact, and build trust in the digital era.
