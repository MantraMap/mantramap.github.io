<h2>Robert Kiyosaki on U.S. Debt Crisis</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has shared his perspective on the U.S. debt crisis and the lengthy negotiations surrounding the debt ceiling. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>“Politicians debating raising $30 trillion U.S. debt limit bad comedy, ‘Kabuki theater,’” Kiyosaki tweeted Wednesday, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Facts are: U.S. bankrupt. Unfunded liabilities as Social Security are over $250 trillion. Financial market ‘derivative assets’ measured in quadrillions … thousands of trillions.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then reiterated his usual recommendation of buying gold, silver, and bitcoin. The famous author previously explained that the three investments are &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-stocks-bonds-mutual-funds-says-bitcoin-best-for-unstable-times/">best for unstable times</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kiyosaki believes that the U.S. debt exceeds the commonly mentioned figure of $31.4 trillion, indicating a more severe situation. A study shows that off-the-books obligations or unfunded liabilities of the U.S. amount to <a href="https://www.midasgoldgroup.com/news/off-the-books-obligations-250-trillion/">over $250 trillion</a>.</p>
<p>In March, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author predicted that the next crash will be the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-fed-rate-hikes-will-crash-stocks-bonds-real-estate-and-us-dollar/">$1 quadrillion derivatives market</a>. He cautioned that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate hikes will crash stocks, bonds, real estate, as well as the U.S. dollar.</p>

<p>In a follow-up tweet on Friday, Kiyosaki raised concerns about Germany&#8217;s recession, warning that the U.S. could fail next. The German economy experienced a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/25/german-economy-enters-recession-as-first-quarter-gdp-data-is-revised-lower.html">technical recession</a> in the first quarter of this year. Referencing the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/swedbank-strategist-says-us-banking-crisis-is-spreading-warns-of-more-banks-failing-in-vicious-spiral/">banking crisis</a>, where several major banks failed, the renowned author wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>First banks. Countries next? Will Germany be the first country to fail? Go bankrupt? if Germany fails which country will be next? Will America default after Germany?</p></blockquote>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has revised her estimation of the potential date for the U.S. to default on its debt obligations to June 5, from the previous date of June 1. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that a U.S. default could occur in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-faces-significant-risk-of-default-in-june-congressional-budget-office-warns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first two weeks of June</a>. Global investment bank Goldman Sachs, however, said the “<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-insists-us-could-default-on-june-1-goldman-sachs-estimates-real-deadline-is-a-week-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real deadline</a>” for a U.S. default is more like June 8-9. On Saturday, the White House and Republicans reached a tentative <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/27/white-house-and-republicans-reach-a-tentative-deal-to-avoid-us-default.html">deal</a> to avoid a U.S. default.</p>

She warned that the Treasury “will have insufficient resources to satisfy the government’s obligations if Congress has not raised or suspended the debt limit by June 5.”</strong></p>
<h2>Yellen Warns US Could Default on June 5</h2>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has revised her estimate for the potential date of a U.S. default. In a letter she sent to all congressional leaders Friday regarding the debt limit, Yellen wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on the most recent available data, we now estimate that Treasury will have insufficient resources to satisfy the government’s obligations if Congress has not raised or suspended the debt limit by June 5.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We will make more than $130 billion of scheduled payments in the first two days of June, including payments to veterans and Social Security and Medicare recipients. These payments will leave Treasury with an extremely low level of resources,” Yellen clarified.</p>
<p>“During the week of June 5, Treasury is scheduled to make an estimated $92 billion of payments and transfers, including a regularly scheduled quarterly adjustment that would result in an investment in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds of roughly $36 billion. Therefore, our projected resources would be inadequate to satisfy all of these obligations,” the Treasury secretary added.</p>

<p>Yellen previously said that the Treasury will not be able to pay all of the government’s bills as early as June 1. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that a U.S. default could occur in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-faces-significant-risk-of-default-in-june-congressional-budget-office-warns/">first two weeks of June</a>. Meanwhile, global investment bank Goldman Sachs said the “<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-insists-us-could-default-on-june-1-goldman-sachs-estimates-real-deadline-is-a-week-later/">real deadline</a>” for a U.S. default is more like June 8-9.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is expecting some tax payments on June 15. However, Yellen has stated that “the odds of reaching June 15, while being able to pay all of our bills, is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-insists-us-could-default-on-june-1-goldman-sachs-estimates-real-deadline-is-a-week-later/">quite low</a>.”</p>
<p>Many people have warned of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/146-top-executives-urge-biden-to-prevent-us-default-warns-of-disastrous-consequences/">disastrous consequences</a> of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations. Yellen said the consequences would be &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-urges-congress-to-act-quickly-on-debt-limit-states-defaulting-would-be-unthinkable/">unthinkable</a>.&#8221; The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-warns-of-very-serious-repercussions-if-us-defaults-on-debt-obligations/">very serious repercussions</a>&#8221; if the U.S. defaults on its debt. Harvard Professor Kenneth Rogoff said it could spark a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/harvard-economics-professor-us-default-could-spark-global-financial-crisis/">global financial crisis</a>.</p>

While conversing with Dana Loesch on The Dana Show, DeSantis criticized the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a &#8220;corrupt organization&#8221; and no ally to the typical American citizen.</strong></p>
<h2>DeSantis Discusses Single-Rate Tax Proposals, Insists IRS Is No Friend of the Average American</h2>
<p>Following <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-president-joe-biden-extends-sanctions-against-russia-has-argued-alternatives-would-involve-waging-third-world-war/">Joe Biden</a>&#8216;s inauguration, he substantially <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-budget-proposal-targets-crypto-investors-using-like-kind-exchange-provision-plan-aims-to-tax-crypto-miners-30/">expanded</a> the IRS, and his 2024 budget plan aims to further enlarge the U.S. tax agency. Biden recently said he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-says-he-wont-agree-to-deal-that-protects-wealthy-tax-cheats-and-crypto-traders-as-us-default-looms/">will reject</a> Republican negotiations regarding the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-us-will-default-on-its-debt-raising-debt-ceiling-will-make-problem-worse/">debt ceiling</a> that would constrain his plans to bolster the nation&#8217;s tax revenue service. Subsequent to Ron DeSantis&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-joins-us-presidential-race-promises-to-protect-bitcoin/">announcement</a> last week, the Florida governor expressed his viewpoints in interviews with Ben Shapiro and Dana Loesch.</p>
<p>During his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/desantis-welcome-bill-abolish-corrupt-irs-need-something-totally-different">dialogue</a> with Loesch, DeSantis addressed the IRS when The Dana Show host inquired about his stance on various tax proposals, such as a flat tax. &#8220;I&#8217;ve supported all of the single-rate proposals,&#8221; DeSantis remarked to Loesch. &#8220;I think they would be a huge improvement over the current system.&#8221; He emphasized to the show&#8217;s host that the existing state of the IRS is corrupt, advocating for a change. The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-prohibiting-use-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-in-florida/">Florida governor</a> asserted:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the IRS is a corrupt organization and I think it&#8217;s not a friend to the average citizen or taxpayer — We need something totally different.</p></blockquote>

<p>Contrary to Biden administration&#8217;s claims that IRS expansion aims solely to tax America&#8217;s billionaire class, DeSantis disagrees. The Republican presidential hopeful believes ordinary Americans and hard-working, middle-class individuals are bearing the burden of Biden&#8217;s drive for heightened taxation. In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/us/politics/desantis-trump-crime-covid.html">interview</a> with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/american-conservative-pundit-ben-shapiro-endorses-bitcoin-hinting-at-libertarian-holy-grail/">Ben Shapiro</a>, DeSantis also discussed his Republican rival <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/donald-trump-urges-republicans-to-let-us-default-on-debt-if-democrats-dont-agree-to-spending-cuts/">Donald Trump</a> after Trump&#8217;s spokesperson labeled the Florida governor as a &#8220;swampy politician.&#8221;</p>
<h2>DeSantis Criticizes Trump&#8217;s Handling of Dr. Fauci</h2>
<p>Conversing with Shapiro, DeSantis openly criticized Trump for magnifying Dr. Anthony Fauci&#8217;s influence during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. “He responded by elevating Anthony Fauci and really turning the reins over to Dr. Fauci, and I think to terrible consequences for the United States,” DeSantis contended. “I was the leader in this country in fighting back against Fauci. We bucked him every step of the way.” Reflecting on Trump&#8217;s former leadership, DeSantis stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the fact that Donald Trump gave Anthony Fauci a presidential commendation on Trump’s last day in office, that was a gut punch to millions of people around this country who were harmed by Fauci’s lockdowns.</p></blockquote>

The use of national currencies in the bloc’s transactions has reached around 90%, the official pointed out.</strong></p>
<h2>EAEU Replaces Dollar in Trade With National Currencies, Russian Official Says</h2>
<p>Trade between member states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) has been “de-dollarized,” Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Aleksey Overchuk told media on the sidelines of the organization’s summit in Moscow.</p>
<p>Asked by journalists whether it’s realistic to completely give up on the U.S. dollar, Overchuk noted that the greenback did have its role but emphasized it was not Russia who “weaponized” it, referring to multiple statements in that vein by Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>“When we are cut off from the dollar and from the euro, we will definitely not sit idly by. We will look for other currencies for mutual settlements,” the representative of the executive power in Moscow elaborated, quoted by the Belta news agency, and added:</p>
<blockquote><p>As to how long the dollar will last &#8230; Well, we do not really care.</p></blockquote>
<p>Overchuk pointed out that national currencies were used in 89% of the intra-EAEU transactions for the purchase and sale of goods during the first quarter of 2023. “In March, this figure was 90%. Therefore, we believe that de-dollarization is already a reality in the Eurasian Economic Union,” he concluded.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union#:~:text=The%20Eurasian%20Economic%20Union%20(EAEU,force%20on%201%20January%202015." target="_blank" rel="noopener">EAEU</a> unites some of the former Soviet states in Europe and Asia. The trade bloc was established in 2014 by Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan while the accession of Armenia and Kyrgyzstan was agreed the following year. Moldova and Uzbekistan have been granted observer status.</p>

<p>Also this week, the Chairman of the Board of the Eurasian Economic Commission, the EAEU’s executive body, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eaeu-official-urges-brics-and-sco-for-joint-use-of-digital-currencies-new-payment-card/">urged</a> two other international organizations with Russian participation to adopt joint policies on the use of digital currencies.</p>
<p>According to Mikhail Myasnikovich, the EAEU, BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) should also launch a common card payment system. Both <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-to-promote-national-currencies-before-issuing-common-one/">BRICS</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worlds-largest-regional-organization-to-switch-to-settlements-in-national-currencies/">SCO</a> are taking steps to move away from the dollar, too.</p>
<p>Transition to payments in national currencies has been a key goal for Moscow’s ‘<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/de-dollarization-has-already-started-says-russias-foreign-minister-lavrov/">de-dollarization</a>’ policy. It has won support from allies and partners amid an ongoing clash with the West that has severely restricted Russia’s access to global finances and markets since its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

The agency lowered the rating from AAAg to AAg+ and attributed this decision to the escalating political discord, rising inflation, and the ongoing impasse over the debt ceiling.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Credit Rating Suffers Downgrade by Chinese Credit Agency Amidst Debt-Ceiling Issues</h2>
<p>China&#8217;s Chengxin International Credit Rating (CCXI) has joined the chorus of credit agencies expressing concern over the United States&#8217; credit rating. Following earlier <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/moodys-on-de-dollarization-rating-agency-labels-us-debt-default-a-near-term-danger-to-the-dollars-position/">warnings</a> from Moody&#8217;s, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-credit-risk-looms-former-sp-officials-see-2011-downgrade-vindicated-2023-05-26/">S&amp;P</a>, and Fitch regarding the debt ceiling standoff, CCXI has now downgraded the U.S. credit rating.</p>
<p>In alignment with its counterparts, CCXI <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3221941/us-debt-ceiling-chinese-agency-first-downgrade-us-credit-rating-after-fitch-warning#">points</a> to the lingering debt ceiling issue as a primary reason for the downgrade. Additionally, the agency highlights the exacerbation of political divisions, which has further complicated the negotiation process.</p>
<p>“The intensification of political divisions between the two parties in the United States has increased the difficulty of resolving the debt-ceiling issue,” CCXI’s downgrade notice details. Beijing’s credit agency added that a “deterioration in fiscal strength and frequent breaches of the debt ceiling continue to erode the credit base of the U.S. dollar.”</p>
<p>While CCXI took the bold step of downgrading the U.S. credit rating, the credit agencies Fitch, Moody&#8217;s, and S&amp;P have chosen a different path. Rather than downgrading the rating like CCXI, these three agencies have opted to place the U.S. rating of &#8220;AAA&#8221; on watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Rating Watch Negative reflects the mounting political partisanship that hampers the timely resolution to raise or suspend the debt limit, with the approaching x date adding urgency,&#8221; Fitch <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/united-states-may-be-cut-by-fitch-ratings-on-debt-limit-fight">elaborated</a> in their assessment.</p>

<p>CCXI&#8217;s downgrade notice echoes this sentiment, emphasizing that even in the event of a consensus, confidence has been adversely affected. “Even if a consensus is reached, the brinkmanship would pose uncertainty to the U.S. government’s policy path and dampen economic confidence, which could trigger further volatility in U.S. politics and the economy,” the CCXI notice explains.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of credit agencies <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/moodys-downgrades-us-banking-sector-to-negative-after-collapse-of-three-major-banks/">downgrading</a> the U.S. banking sector due to the collapse of three major U.S. banks, the country now faces the repercussions of a credit rating downgrade. Notably, this marks the first instance of a Chinese institution openly stating concerns about the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-us-will-default-on-its-debt-raising-debt-ceiling-will-make-problem-worse/">U.S. debt ceiling</a>. The impact of sovereign rating declines extends beyond the immediate, as they have the potential to elevate short-term borrowing costs across various sectors.</p>

These unique digital collectibles will be minted on the Bitcoin blockchain using Ordinal inscription technology. Schiff&#x2019;s surprising entry into the NFT market through Bitcoin has piqued the curiosity of onlookers, prompting them to speculate whether the once vocal Bitcoin critic has experienced a change of perspective.</strong></p>
<h2>Schiff: &#x2018;I&#x2019;m Still Not a Member of That Club&#x2019;</h2>
<p>For a very long time, Peter Schiff has been a vocal critic of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, repeatedly asserting that the cryptocurrency&#x2019;s value would eventually plummet to zero. He has engaged in numerous debates where he consistently highlighted <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s perceived lack of intrinsic value as one of its fundamental vulnerabilities. However, despite his longstanding stance, Schiff is now venturing into the realm of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), conducting a sale that will utilize the very blockchain technology he has criticized over the years.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m pleased to announce an art project with one of my favorite artists, Market Price,&#x201D; Schiff <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1662210584178475008?s=20">stated</a> on Twitter. &#x201C;This collaboration features the original painting &#x201C;Golden Triumph&#x201D; as well as a series of prints and Ordinals inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain,&#x201D; the economist added. Schiff also shared a website showcasing the NFT collection created by Market Price.</p>

<p>Derived from a painting called &#x201C;Golden Triumph,&#x201D; the collaborative artwork has given rise to a limited edition of 50 prints, each with the signatures of Schiff and the artist. Every print will possess its own exclusive Ordinal inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain, adding a touch of digital uniqueness. The collection will be unveiled through a two-part auction, set to commence on June 2, with the conclusion on June 9. Schiff and the artist will be present in person at the event taking place in the city of New York.</p>
<p>Udi Wertheimer, a prominent advocate of Ordinals and Taproot Wizard, expressed immense satisfaction at the successful influence of Ordinals supporters in swaying Schiff towards embracing the Bitcoin movement. After Schiff&#x2019;s announcement, Wertheimer <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1662228275211501568?s=20">declared</a>, &#x201C;Breaking &#x2014; Ordinals enjoyers manage to on-board Peter Schiff to Bitcoin in 3 months; laser-eyes seething after failing to get him to join for 10 years.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Notably, Bitcoin proponent Layah Heilpern seized the opportunity to respond to Schiff&#x2019;s tweet about his NFT collection. With conviction, Heilpern <a href="https://twitter.com/LayahHeilpern/status/1662231691593654273?s=20">tweeted</a>, &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve always loved Bitcoin; you pretend otherwise for clout.&#x201D; Unable to resist the conversation, Schiff took the opportunity to address Heilpern&#x2019;s tweet directly. He <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1662265616760205315?s=20">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is art, and it&#x2019;s a tribute to gold. But there is something here for Bitcoiners as well. But I&#x2019;m still not a member of that club.</p></blockquote>

The token rose for a third consecutive day, as bulls returned to the market to start the weekend. Cardano was another notable gainer today.</strong></p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> (formerly ripple), moved to a one-month high on Saturday, as bulls began to gradually renter the market.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.4614 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD raced to a peak of $0.4777 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of the surge, the token climbed to its highest level since April 30, when it was last above $0.4800.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the move came as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> bulls broke out of a key resistance level at the $0.4750</p>
<p>This occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) also moved beyond a ceiling at the 57.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index is now at a reading of 58.18, with the next target for bulls potentially at 62.00.</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>), was also in the green to start the weekend, with prices moving further away from a recent support level.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD hit an intraday high of $0.3667 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes following a low of $0.3564 on Friday.</p>
<p>The move has resulted in cardano climbing to its strongest point since Wednesday, moving away from the aforementioned floor at $0.3550 in the process.</p>

<p>From the chart, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> has begun to consolidate, with price now retreating from its earlier highs, following a collision with a ceiling on the RSI.</p>
<p>Price strength has failed to move past a point of resistance of 44.00 which has pushed the token to a current reading of $0.3638.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> rallied towards $27,000 to start the weekend, as prices reacted to the latest Personal Consumption data in the United States.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD climbed to a peak of $26,916.67 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which came a day after trading at a low of $26,370.55.</p>
<p>The move sees bitcoin climb for a third straight session, moving past a floor at $26,3000 in the process.</p>

<p>From the chart, the latest surge in price came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a support point at 39.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 43.02, with the next visible point of resistance at 45.00.</p>
<p>Should this point be broken, then there is a strong possibility that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will move back over the $27,000 level.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a> also moved higher on Saturday, remaining above the $1,800 level.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,810.37 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD managed to hit an intraday high of $1,837.87 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This surge led to the world&#x2019;s second-largest cryptocurrency breaking out of its recent ceiling of $1,830.</p>

<p>However, as the day has progressed, earlier gains have somewhat fallen, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> now trading at $1,828.18.</p>
<p>It appears that market uncertainty has also risen, as the RSI neared a ceiling of its own at the 49.00 mark.</p>
<p>Price strength is now tracking at 48.75, and should it break out of this point, then there could be further highs from <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> this weekend.</p>

According to reports, Economy Minister Sergio Massa would be in talks to expand the current swap line to double the available amount from $5 to $10 billion, lent in Chinese yuan.</strong></p>
<h2>Argentina Seeks to Expand Swap Line Agreement With China On De-Dollarization Push</h2>
<p>The government of Argentina would be seeking to expand the access it has to a Chinese yuan swap line in order to reduce the use of its scarce dollar reserves. According to local <a href="https://buenosairesherald.com/economics/argentina-in-talks-to-expand-china-currency-swap-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, Economy Minister Sergio Massa and Central Bank of Argentina President Miguel Pesce will be traveling to China on May 29 with the objective of doubling the free amount of money available in the swap line, taking it to $10 billion in Chinese yuan.</p>
<p>China had allowed the Argentine government to freely <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-to-settle-chinese-imports-in-yuan-to-safeguard-dwindling-dollar-reserves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">access</a> $5 billion of the swap line, of which almost $2 billion were used during April and part of May, according to estimations. The total of the credit line amounts to almost $19 billion, or 130 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Massa had hinted at this possibility two weeks ago, stating that &#8220;if political conditions are met and if the Chinese Central Bank agreed,&#8221; this free amount should be expanded.</p>

<h2>Dollar Reserves and IMF Agreement</h2>
<p>Argentina has been facing a dangerous decrease in its foreign currency reserves, taking them to their lowest level during the last seven years. According to Bloomberg, dollar-denominated international reserves <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-03/argentina-reserves-slump-to-7-year-low-as-crisis-deepens-chart?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plunged</a> to $36 billion in May. The situation is further aggravated by the continuous devaluation of the Argentine Peso, and the high <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-bolivia-mulls-chinese-yuan-for-trade-settlements-steve-hanke-proposes-30-day-solution-for-venezuelan-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflationary</a> levels of more than 108% year on year calculated in April.</p>
<p>The economic team of President Alberto Fernandez has been forced to take several measures to limit the flow of dollars from the local economy, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/argentina-hauls-in-oil-firms-for-meeting-amid-dollar-shortage#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting</a> oil companies from access to official dollars, and having to finance import payments for 90 days.</p>
<p>Argentina is also seeking to renegotiate the terms of its debt agreement with the International Money Fund (IMF), to accelerate the disbursements of the institution, which would have to deliver $10.6 billion between June and December.</p>
<p>However, the deal is being torpedoed by Vice President Cristina Kirchner, who called to ditch the repayment deal in a rally, risking the delivery of future disbursements of the institution.

He also believes the international organizations should develop a new payment system with its own bank cards.</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS, SCO, and EAEU May Launch Common Payment Card System</h2>
<p>BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) can issue a common payment card, the Chairman of the Board of the Eurasian Economic Commission, Mikhail Myasnikovich, has stated and elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We invite our colleagues from the SCO and BRICS to pool our resources. I am talking about the joint approaches to the use of digital currencies and the launch of the common payment card system. We already have appropriate solutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Myasnikovich was speaking during the second edition of the Eurasian Economic Forum in Moscow on Wednesday and was quoted by the Belta news agency. The Belarusian heads the EAEU’s executive body since 2020. The Commission is responsible for implementing decisions and upholding the organization’s treaties.</p>
<p>The EAEU official also pointed out that the share of settlements in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/push-to-use-national-currencies-in-sco-cannot-be-stopped-russias-lavrov-says/">national currencies</a> between its members already stands at around 80%. The estimate comes after Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin recently revealed that 70% of settlements between Russia and China are already conducted in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-and-china-carry-out-most-settlements-in-yuan-and-ruble-russian-pm-mikhail-mishustin-says/">ruble and yuan</a>.</p>
<p>The transition to payments in national fiats, part of Moscow’s ‘<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/de-dollarization-has-already-started-says-russias-foreign-minister-lavrov/">de-dollarization’</a> push, has been a major task for the Russian Federation and its allies amid heightened geopolitical tensions with the West and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-expands-unprecedented-global-sanctions-on-russia-with-over-300-new-targets/">unprecedented sanctions</a> imposed over Russia’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRICS</a>, which unites five of the largest emerging economies, was formed in 2006 as an alternative to the Group of Seven (G7) format comprising the most advanced economies. According to research published in March, BRICS has already <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-emerges-as-the-worlds-largest-gdp-bloc-propelled-by-chinas-rapid-expansion/">become</a> the world’s largest bloc by share of global gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCO</a> is the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worlds-largest-regional-organization-to-switch-to-settlements-in-national-currencies/">world’s largest</a> regional organization, in terms of territory and population, which functions as an economic, political, and defense alliance. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EAEU</a> was established in 2014 by Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia and added two other former Soviet republics, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, as members in 2015.</p>
