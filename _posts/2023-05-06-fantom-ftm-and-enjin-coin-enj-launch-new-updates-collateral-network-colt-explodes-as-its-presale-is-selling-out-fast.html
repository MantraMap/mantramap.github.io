<p class="s6">Fantom received a major push recently when iME, a messaging platform-come-crypto wallet, released a new feature allowing FTM to be traded via Twitter.

<p class="s10">Collateral Network (COLT) Shows Skyrocketing Potential</p>
<p class="s6">With the advent of Collateral Network (COLT), gone are the days when lending was an extremely draining and complex task.</p>
<p class="s6">Collateral Network (COLT) is the first decentralized cross-chain network that allows crowdlending against non-traditional assets like luxury watches, fine art, wine, and more. The platform assesses and evaluates physical assets, and mints an NFT against them. These NFTs are broken up into multiple pieces, letting the community fund loans backed by them on a fixed amount of interest rate.</p>
<p class="s6">This revolutionary ecosystem is beneficial to both borrowers and lenders. Borrowers can get a fast and low-cost loan that is secured on the blockchain, and private in terms of footprint on credit history. On the other hand, lenders enjoy the security of their investments, and earn a fixed passive income. </p>
<p class="s6">Powered by the project&rsquo;s utility token, COLT, holders will get special discounts on borrowing and trading fees along with voting rights on key matters.</p>
<p class="s6">The liquidity pool is locked for 33 years, and merely 38% of the total supply of 1.4 billion COLT tokens is available for presale. Collateral Network is currently selling at a price of $0.014. Therefore, investors and whales across the globe are seizing this great opportunity to invest in Collateral Network (COLT) as it is set to increase 35x in the next few months.</p>
