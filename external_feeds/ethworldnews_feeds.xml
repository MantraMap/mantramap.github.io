<ul><li>Jane Street Group and Jump Trading are reportedly retreating from crypto trading in the United States.&nbsp;</li><li>The top market makers decided to retreat in light of the crackdown on crypto by U.S. regulators.&nbsp;</li><li>Jane Street will also scale down its crypto operations globally, while Jump Crypto is seeking to expand international crypto operations.</li></ul>



<p>Popular market-making firms Jane Street Group and Jump Trading are significantly scaling down their crypto trading activities in the United States. The top market makers are reportedly retreating from the American crypto market in light of the crackdown on the crypto industry by regulators in the country.</p>



<h2><strong>Jane Street Plans To Scale Back Crypto Operations Globally</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-09/jane-street-jump-pull-back-crypto-trading-amid-us-crackdown?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the hostile stance of regulators against crypto firms in the United States has prompted Jane Street and Jump Crypto to pull back from the country. A person familiar with the matter revealed that Jane Street is planning to go one step further and scale back its crypto operations around the world. The regulatory uncertainty around crypto has reportedly made it difficult for the company to comply with internal standards. </p>



<p>As for Jump Trading’s digital asset-facing unit Jump Crypto, the retreat from crypto will be limited to the United States. Two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that the market-making firm is planning to expand its international crypto trading operations. Both firms are reportedly still involved in market-making for crypto but on a smaller scale. The market makers have declined to comment on the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crackdown campaign on crypto renewed at the beginning of 2023 with multiple federal agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), initiating enforcement actions against crypto firms. Both market makers were named in a probe launched by the U.S. Department of Justice in March 2023 to investigate the collapse of Terra last year. Jane Street also made an appearance in a civil enforcement action brought by the CFTC against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/jane-street-binance-vip-in-cftc-lawsuit/">Binance</a> last month. </p>

<ul><li>The Digital Currency Group is looking to refinance the $1.7 billion debt it owes to its bankrupt subsidiary Genesis.&nbsp;</li><li>Barry Silbert’s crypto behemoth is in talks with investors to raise capital to facilitate further growth.&nbsp;</li><li>DCG has indicated that it won’t be able to repay a $630 million loan from Genesis that will mature this week.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Digital Currency Group, the digital conglomerate behind crypto heavyweights like GBTC issuer Grayscale Investments, appears to be on the path to default on a half-a-billion-dollar loan owed to its bankrupt subsidiary Genesis. The loan is part of an approximately $1.7 billion exposure that Genesis has to DCG, which consists of a loan and a promissory note.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Digital Currency Group Is Looking To Raise Capital</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/barry-silberts-digital-currency-group-seeks-to-refinance-debt" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the Digital Currency Group, led by crypto entrepreneur Barry Silbert, is seeking to refinance the debt owed to Genesis, which is made up of a $630 million loan and a $1.1 billion promissory note. While the promissory note is due in June 2023, the $630 million loan is set to mature this week, between May 9 and 11 to be precise. </p>



<p>Genesis is currently undergoing a restructuring process as part of its Chapter 11 proceedings. Last week Genesis agreed to enter a 30-day <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-genesis-agree-on-mediation-process/">mediation period</a> with DCG, Gemini, and its Unsecured Creditors Committee, in order to fast-track the resolution and work out repayment. Gemini and its UCC have a vested interest in DCG’s repayment to Genesis since it will pave the way for allowing its creditors to be made whole. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are committed to reaching a fair outcome for all and look forward to a productive resolution during this mediation period.”</p><cite>Digital Currency Group</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Digital Currency Group has stated that it is in talks with investors to raise additional capital to further its growth. The extra capital will also provide financial flexibility with regard to the outstanding obligation to Genesis. However, in the meantime, the crypto conglomerate seeks to refinance the loans owed to its subsidiary. As for the $630 million loan that matures this week, it is safe to assume that it will not be paid back to Genesis.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Ishan Wahi, a former product manager at Coinbase, has been sentenced to two years in prison.&nbsp;</li><li>A federal judge handed Wahi the sentence for his role in an insider trading scheme involving crypto tokens.&nbsp;</li><li>Wahi’s brother was sentenced to ten months last year on wire fraud conspiracy charges in the same matter.</li></ul>



<p>Ishan Wahi, the former product manager at Coinbase, has been handed a 24-month prison sentence by a federal court in New York for his role in one of the first insider trading cases in the crypto industry. Wahi’s sentencing comes almost ten months after he was arrested and charged by the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The Ex-Coinbase Employee Will Likely Be Deported</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-09/ex-coinbase-manager-ishan-wahi-gets-2-years-for-insider-trading?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Judge Loretta Preska of the Manhattan Federal Court handed Ishan Wahi a two-year sentence in federal prison for perpetrating an insider trading scheme with crypto tokens. The Judge highlighted a “massive abuse” of Coinbase’s trust on Wahi’s part during the 10-month period where he used confidential information to purchase tokens that were scheduled to be listed on the crypto exchange, making $1.5 million in the process. The judge noted that it was not a one-time event. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I’m very sorry for my actions. My position in the company gave me access to confidential information. I knew it was wrong.”</p><cite>Ishan Wahi in court today</cite></blockquote>



<p>Wahi’s sentencing comes nearly three months after he pled guilty earlier this year to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He initially entered a non-guilty plea to the charges brought by the Justice Department in July last year. In parallel action, the SEC charged Wahi and his associates including his brother Nikhil Wahi, with violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws at the time. Nikhil Wahi pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in September 2022. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison in January this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ishan Wahi has been ordered to surrender by June 21, 2023, to begin serving his sentence at the Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution in New Jersey. His sentence will be followed by two years of supervised release. As per Bloomberg, the former Coinbase product manager will likely be deported to India. Wahi’s sentencing comes less than a week after an <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ex-opensea-exec-guilty-insider-trading/">OpenSea</a> executive was convicted by a federal grand jury in New York in what was described as the first case of insider trading in the crypto industry.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Wallets controlled by Alameda Research received millions of Tether&#8217;s stablecoin USDT and MASK tokens from OKX on Tuesday.</li><li>The wallets in question are in full control of the FTX Bankruptcy Estate that took over November&#8217;s crash.</li><li>FTX&#8217;s meteoritic crash grew into a legal saga with criminal charges and multi-million bail bonds as federal prosecutors argue one of America&#8217;s biggest fraud cases.</li></ul>



<p>Wallets controlled by Alameda Research received millions of Tether&#8217;s stablecoin USDT and MASK tokens from OKX on Tuesday. Alameda wallets saw $57 million in USDT inflows coupled with $300,000 worth of Mask tokens, per on-chain data cited by <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1655885122946867200?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1655885122946867200?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Peckshield</a>. </p>



<p>The wallets in question are completely controlled by the FTX Bankruptcy Estate, led by bankruptcy CEO John Ray III who took over after November&#8217;s crash, and holds over $240 million in cryptocurrencies. </p>



<h2>Missing Funds From FTX/Alameda&#8217;s Empire</h2>



<p>Shortly after the collapse of FTX, a hacker <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-hacker-tips-launder-400-million-loot/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-hacker-tips-launder-400-million-loot/" rel="noreferrer noopener">looted</a> nearly $600 million from its wallets fueling fears that FTX accounts on other exchanges were compromised. This led to the investigations carried out by crypto exchanges and trading venues to protect users and restore trust. </p>



<p>OKX, one of the biggest centralized crypto exchanges by trading volume, and a leading Web3 technology company, recently announced that it conducted investigations to identify any FTX-related transactions on its exchange. The platform froze $157 million in digital assets belonging to FTX and its sister company Alameda Research before turning over the assets to the Bankruptcy Estate.</p>



<p>OKX has now returned over $210 million to the failed crypto exchange and its affiliates. </p>



<p>The FTX Bankruptcy Estate continues to hunt down missing funds and consolidate accounts managed by Sam Bankman-Fried and his associates. </p>



<h2>Criminal Charges</h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX and Alameda Research, stares down the barrel of America&#8217;s biggest fraud case. &#8220;Not guilty&#8221; SBF pleaded to all 13 criminal charges even as his colleagues like former Alameda CEO Caroline Elisson and former FTX Engineering Chief Nishad Singh <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/former-ftx-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/former-ftx-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty/" rel="noreferrer noopener">negotiate</a> plea deals with prosecutors. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyers moved to throw out the case, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/indicted-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-urges-court-to-toss-charges.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/indicted-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-urges-court-to-toss-charges.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">arguing</a> to the court that charges should be civil and not criminal. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Rather than wait for traditional civil and regulatory processes following their ordinary course to address the situation, the Government jumped in with both feet, improperly seeking to turn these civil and regulatory issues into federal crimes.</p></blockquote>

<ul><li>Crypto exchange Bittrex has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the state of Delaware.&nbsp;</li><li>The U.S. Treasury Department’s OFAC is listed as the bankrupt exchange’s largest creditor.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankruptcy filing comes less than a month after the crypto exchange was sued by the U.S. SEC.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Bittrex Inc. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the state of Delaware. The Seattle-based crypto exchange’s bankruptcy filing comes less than a month after it was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The exchange announced last month that it was winding down operations in the United States in light of the deteriorating regulatory landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Bittrex Owes $25 Million To Treasury Department’s OFAC</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-08/crypto-platform-bittrex-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-in-delaware?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Bittrex’s Chapter 11 filing listed assets and liabilities reaching up to $1 billion each. Court papers viewed by Bloomberg revealed that the crypto exchange’s affiliated entities including Desolation Holdings LLC, Bittrex Malta Holdings Ltd., and Bittrex Malta Ltd also filed for bankruptcy.  The exchange has clarified that the operations of Bittrex Global will not be impacted by its American entity&#8217;s bankruptcy. As for customer assets, the exchange assured its users that their funds are safe and secure on the platform. </p>

</div></figure>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This announcement does not impact Bittrex Global, which will continue operations as normal for its customers outside the U.S.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Ironically, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is listed as the bankrupt exchange’s largest non-insider creditor. Bittrex owed a whopping $25 million to OFAC as part of a settlement both parties reached in October last year. OFAC imposed the multi-million fine on the crypto exchange over alleged violations of multiple sanctions programs as well as the Bank Secrecy Act’s (BSA’s) anti-money laundering (AML) and suspicious activity report (SAR) reporting requirements. At the time, the enforcement action on the exchange was OFAC’s largest ever. </p>



<p>Bittrex’s bankruptcy filing comes less than a month after it was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-bittrex-violation-federal-laws/">sued</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over alleged violations of federal laws. The securities regulator charged the exchange and its former CEO Bill Shihara, with operating an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The regulator also charges its foreign affiliate with failing to register as a national securities exchange in connection with its operation of a single shared order book along with the American entity.</p>

<ul><li>Paxful has announced the resumption of operations after being suspended for over a month.&nbsp;</li><li>The P2P crypto platform suspended operations last month following the departure of key staff members.&nbsp;</li><li>The Paxful wallet remained active throughout the platform’s suspension period.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Paxful has announced that it is resuming operations after being offline for more than a month. The P2P bitcoin exchange shut down operations last month following the departure of key staff members and increasing scrutiny from regulators in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conflict Among Paxful’s Top Management </strong>Continues</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://paxful.com/sign-up-transition" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> from Paxful earlier today, the peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace is now back online. Over the next two days, the platform will gradually restore functionality to the marketplace. The platform took to Twitter earlier today to inform its community that it is back and is “better than ever”. Its staff has reportedly been working for the past month to bring the marketplace back online without compromising the safety and security of users. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We know it has been a difficult time for many of our users, who were understandably surprised by the sudden suspension, however, we are delighted to be back so that we can continue to serve millions of people without financial access.”</p></blockquote>



<p>News of the resumption of services comes as a positive development for its users. The exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paxful-shutting-down-amid-regulatory-challanges/">suspended </a>operations on April 4, 2023, amid growing scrutiny by American regulators and the departure of the company’s key staff members including Paxful co-founder Artur Schabeck. Paxful Wallet remained fully operational throughout the suspension period. Its users were also offered multiple P2P crypto avenues to continue trading. </p>



<p>Schabeck told <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/08/paxful-marketplace-back-online-following-temporary-suspension/" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinDesk </a>earlier today that he is actively looking for a settlement with Paxful in relation to the wrongful termination lawsuit he filed following his departure from the firm. The former executive further revealed that the P2P firm is owned by a custodian who serves as one of the company’s three directors. The third board member plays an instrumental role, given his power to act as a tiebreaker in a conflict involving the other founders.</p>

<p>The Banque du Canada (Bank of Canada) is considering issuing its own central bank digital currency (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/swift-moves-to-second-phase-cbdc-testing/">CBDC</a>) to keep up with the growing adoption of crypto assets around the world. The central bank has invited public feedback to determine the features that could be integrated into a digital Canadian dollar. </p>



<h2><strong>CBDC Issuance Will Have No Impact On Bank Notes</strong></h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/05/bank-canada-launches-public-consultations-digital-dollar/" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> earlier today, the Bank of Canada announced that it was launching public consultations on a digital Canadian dollar to explore the design and use cases of a potential CBDC. The consultation opened today and will remain open for public participation until June 19, 2023. The central bank revealed that it was exploring a digital version of the country’s national currency, citing the rapidly evolving payments space around the world. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As Canada’s central bank, we want to make sure everyone can always take part in our country’s economy. That means being ready for whatever the future holds.” </p><cite>Carolyn Rogers, Senior Deputy Governor, Banque du Canada</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Canadian central bank acknowledged the growing adoption of private cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies and the possibility that they may become a popular mode of payment in Canada soon. In order to maintain the status quo and avoid compromising the Canadian dollar’s role as the official and centrally issued currency, the Bank of Canada is considering offering a digital alternative to its citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the central bank, a CBDC would ensure that every citizen takes part in the economy. That being said, the Bank of Canada noted the role of banknotes as a safe, accessible, and trusted method of payment. To that end, the bank stated that it would continue offering bank notes to those who prefer them over CBDCs in the future. “Cash isn’t going anywhere,” the central bank added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Coinbase executive team and its CEO Brian Armstrong are in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to engage local regulators on crypto policies as the company expands to offshore jurisdictions. </p>



<p>The visit to the UAE, particularly to meet with policymakers in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, comes amid souring relations with regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange, and effort to establish operations outside America&#8217;s borders. </p>

<h2>Dubai&#8217;s Crypto Allure</h2>



<p>In March of 2022, the UAE Prime Minister declared his intention to establish the UAE as a key player in the future of crypto. The region&#8217;s crypto ecosystem has since gained significant growth, welcoming industry players like Binance and Kraken. </p>



<p>Last year, Dubai&#8217;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority was formed to issue a crypto regulatory framework, laying out a concrete licensing regime for crypto service providers. Last month, the registration authority of ADGM issued a consultation paper to explain the proposed Distributed Ledger Technology Foundations Regulations 2023.   </p>



<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s UAE Strategy</h2>



<p>Armstrong <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/the-uae-recognising-the-transformative-potential-of-the-cryptoeconomy" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/the-uae-recognising-the-transformative-potential-of-the-cryptoeconomy" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">admired</a> the UAE for its proactive and progressive regulatory approach to crypto in a tweet, saying the region &#8220;deserves a lot of credit for being forward thinking on crypto&#8221;. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>‘There is no doubt that UAE has the potential to be a strategic hub for Coinbase, amplifying our efforts across the world, and this week we are delighted to be on the ground in Dubai and Abu Dhabi meeting key local stakeholders and commending in person the role they have played in creating such a welcoming environment.</p></blockquote>



<p>CEO Armstrong will provide a keynote address at the inaugural Dubai Fintech Summit while Coinbase is also working with Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) regulators to further expand the licensing and availability for Coinbase International Exchange.</p>



<p>Coinbase has also been engaging with Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), a dedicated regulator for virtual assets, as they put forward a comprehensive retail framework built on the principles of economic sustainability and cross-border financial security.  &#8220;This expands our global footprint, helping get us closer to bringing 1 billion users to crypto,&#8221; Brain said.  </p>

<p>According to on-chain data, BTC transaction fees reached as high as $19.21, a two-year high. The cost of sending a transaction on BTC&#8217;s blockchain has not climbed so high since April 2021 when fees skyrocketed to $62. </p>

<h2>Ordinals Drive Bitcoin Network Congestion</h2>



<p>The Ordinals protocol introduced by developer Casey Rodarmor in January 2023 allows users to inscribe data on every satoshi, the smallest BTC unit. This incentivized users to experiment with fungible token standards and non-fungible tokens also known as NFTs.</p>



<p>Data from Dune Analytics indicated that over 3 million NFTs have been issued on BTC&#8217;s blockchain since Ordinals debuted. The majority of these NFTs are text-based and created through a process called &#8216;inscription&#8217;. </p>



<p>Shortly after Rodarmor unveiled the Ordinals protocol, a developer known by the pseudonym Domo leveraged the protocol to build the ‘Bitcoin Request for Comment’ (BRC-20) token standard. BRC-20 allows transferable assets on BTC&#8217;s blockchain allowing users to issue and trade tokens on crypto&#8217;s largest network by market cap.</p>



<p>Indeed, it seems the BRC-20 token standard has breathed new life into BTC&#8217;s blockchain as over 11,000 tokens have been issued using Domo&#8217;s standard. OrdSpace data showed tokens created under BRC-2O boast almost $1 billion in combined market cap. </p>

<p>ORDI, believed to be the first BRC-20 token and native token of Ordinals marketplace, leads the pack with over $220 million in marketcap and more than 7,000 unique holders. BRC-20 also opened up BTC&#8217;s blockchain to memecoin hysteria as tokens like Pepe, VMPX, and Meme garnered hundreds of millions in daily trading volume. </p>



<p>Notably, the Pepe token on BTC&#8217;s network is not to be confused with the Pepe memecoin issued on Ethereum. </p>



<p>Crypto commentators and BTC Maxis suggested that Ordinals beckons a new era for BTC and its network, beefing up utility and propelling network activity. The extra network demand also affected a major crypto exchange. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Aave DAO completely voted in support of a proposal to launch the third iteration of its lending service on Metis, an L2 scaling network built atop Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain.</li><li>Launching on Metis will allow users of the popular DeFi lender to access lower transaction fees and enjoy liquidity incentives offered by Metis.</li><li>The move could bootstrap activity on Metis and drive adoption on the L2 amid growing competition in Ethereum&#8217;s scaling protocol landscape.</li></ul>



<p>Ethereum L2 scaling network Metis will welcome DeFi lending protocol Aave to its ecosystem after a community voted in support of the move. Indeed, members of the Aave DAO community backed deploying the lenders&#8217; third iteration or version 3 service on Metis. </p>



<p>The proposal <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=212" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=212" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opened</a> for voting on May 2 and concluded last Friday. Not a single voter or community member opposed the move, signaling total support for deploying V3 on Metis. </p>



<p>Aave&#8217;s launch on the Ethereum L2 network beckons fresh rewards for Metis users who borrow and lend digital assets via the decentralized finance service. The move could also galvanize activity on Metis as the protocol competes with other scaling networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. </p>



<p>While the last bull run propelled Metis to the limelight, the network&#8217;s adoption has suffered blows amid market downturns and increased market competition. Metis boasts cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum, giving users a more cost-effective alternative without giving up transaction security. Providing cheaper transaction costs is usually a common offering from L2 networks. </p>



<p>In a bid to encourage adoption and leverage Aave&#8217;s V3 launch, Metis will offer liquidity incentives to users. Liquidity miners will receive 100,000 METIS coins within a 6-month timeline after deployment. Also, 4,000 METIS tokens will be distributed to token miners as part of a reward program. </p>

<h2>Aave Fuels Expansion Campaign</h2>



<p>The DeFi lender seems on a mission to expand beyond Ethereum&#8217;s base layer with a dearth of governance proposals. In April, the governance DAO <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aave-v3-lending-bnb-chain-uniswap-polygon/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aave-v3-lending-bnb-chain-uniswap-polygon/" rel="noreferrer noopener">voted</a> to launch V3 on BNB Chain, a major liquidity hub for decentralized finance users. The move was announced shortly after leading decentralized exchange Uniswap moved to launch on the Binance blockchain. </p>



<p>Aave DAO also voted to <a href="http://The move could bootstrap activity on Metis and drive adoption on the L2 amid growing competition in Ethereum&#039;s scaling protocol landscape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">remove</a> BUSD from lending markets on Ethereum. The proposal argued that regulatory actions against stablecoin issuer Paxos and the token&#8217;s declining supply greatly diminishes BUSD&#8217;s utility. </p>
