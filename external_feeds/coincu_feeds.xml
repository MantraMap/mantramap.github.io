<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Deus Finance&#8217;s stablecoin DEI has been hacked on the Arbitrum network.</em></li>



<li><em>The stablecoin has been hacked before.</em></li>



<li><em>A core implementation error in the token contract is a bug in the code of the token contract that affects the functionality or security of the contract.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DEI, a stablecoin project owned by Deus Finance, has been hacked on the Arbitrum network.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-178.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-178-1024x538.png" alt="Deus Finance&#039;s Stablecoin DEI Was Hacked, Token Price Drop More Than 30%" class="wp-image-185596" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-178-1024x538.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-178-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-178-768x403.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-178-750x394.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-178-1140x599.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-178.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Deus Finance&#039;s Stablecoin DEI Was Hacked, Token Price Drop More Than 30% 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>The DEI token has already been hacked and has already lost its $1 peg. The token was recently pegged at $0.3 and lost that peg during the assault. The cause of the attack was discovered to be a fundamental technical issue in the token contract. The stablecoin is currently trading at $0.2 at the time of writing.</p>



<p>The project is also now calling for the community&#8217;s help to overcome the consequences. Currently, the DUES token has dropped more than 33% after the above news.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For all white hackers that were able to rescue funds during the DEI exploit from today 05/05/2023<br>We are confirming 0x7f5ae1dc8d2b5d599409c57978d21cf596d37996<br>As a DEUS team owned multisig on Arbitrum.<br>Please get in touch with us if you have not already. <a href="https://t.co/7w5y6Nh2EM" target="_blank">https://t.co/7w5y6Nh2EM</a></p>&mdash; DEUS (@DeusDao) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeusDao/status/1654614967084101633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 5, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>A fundamental implementation mistake in the token contract is a problem in the token contract&#8217;s code that impacts the contract&#8217;s functioning or security.</p>



<p>For example, a fundamental implementation error in the DEI stablecoin&#8217;s token contract allows anybody to issue additional DEI tokens with no constraints or controls. This enabled a hacker to take advantage of the token contract and influence the price of the DEI.</p>



<p>Every financial instrument and protocol designed on the Deus Finance infrastructure use DEI as collateral.</p>



<p>Deus Finance is a project that intends to make enterprise-grade blockchain derivatives available to the general public. It serves as the foundation for hopeful on-chain digital derivatives such as synthetic stocks, commodities, FX, and cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Hackers compromised Deus Finance on April 28. According to PeckShield, the incident resulted in a loss of up to $13.4 million, with the majority of stolen assets being Ethereum (ETH). </p>



<p>The hack is made feasible by the use of a flash loan to manipulate the price oracle, which reads from the StableVW AMM &#8211; USDC/DEI pair. It was triggered using 800 ETH, which was withdrawn from Tornado Cash and transmitted to Fantom through MultiChain. The stolen monies were converted to ETH and put in the hacker&#8217;s account at the conclusion of the assault.</p>

<li><em>Binance said that it abides by all US and international banking restrictions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/binance-faces-us-probe-of-possible-russian-sanctions-violations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, the US Justice Department is examining whether Binance was improperly exploited to allow Russians to avoid US sanctions and transfer money via the cryptocurrency exchange.</strong></h5>

<p>The investigation into the world&#8217;s biggest crypto exchange is linked to Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine. The probe is being led by the Justice Department&#8217;s national security division, which is concurrent with another investigation being conducted by the agency&#8217;s criminal division. The revelation adds an additional degree of scrutiny to the operator of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, which is reeling from a string of startling bankruptcies and high-profile scandals.</p>



<p>Binance has been in contact with the Justice Department to settle past concerns that the exchange was used to circumvent sanctions against Iran prior to the implementation of strict compliance procedures.</p>



<p>Authorities throughout the globe have long urged for stronger regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, the world&#8217;s biggest, to avoid unlawful activity ranging from money laundering to terrorist funding.</p>



<p>Binance confirmed to <em>Bloomberg</em> that it abides by all US and international banking restrictions. The company said in a statement to Bloomberg:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“In 2021, Binance launched an initiative to completely overhaul its corporate governance structure, including bringing in a world-class bench of seasoned executives to fundamentally change how Binance operates globally.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company&#8217;s know your customer (KYC) processes are on par with those in the conventional banking system, and every client is subject to the controls, which include checks on country of residence and personal identity.</p>



<p>The announcement comes as law enforcement and US officials expand their investigation of the cryptocurrency business. In a March enforcement action, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission accused Binance of willfully violating federal law and running an unlawful digital asset derivatives market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Voyager Digital will now liquidate its assets after plans to sell them to FTX.US and, most recently, Binance.US fell through.</em></li>



<li><em>A portion of the platform&#8217;s digital assets that cannot be removed will be liquidated and refunded to clients.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Voyager Digital&#8217;s lawyers, the insolvent crypto lender will self-liquidate its assets and cease operations after failing to reach an agreement on a sale to either FTX.US or Binance.US.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-173.png"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="475" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-173.png" alt="Voyager Now Moves To Liquidation Plan After Failed Deals With Binance.US" class="wp-image-185581" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-173.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-173-300x178.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-173-768x456.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-173-750x445.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Voyager Now Moves To Liquidation Plan After Failed Deals With Binance.US 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to a Friday filing, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185390-voyager-creditors-may-be-optimistic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voyager</a> will liquidate and restore to consumers a number of digital assets on the platform that cannot be removed. Among them are big cryptocurrencies such as Algorand (ALGO), Celo (CELO), and Avalanche (AVAX).</p>



<p>According to the filing, a number of other major cryptocurrencies on the platform will not be liquidated but will instead be returned to customers in digital form, albeit at a recovery rate of around 36% &#8211; an appallingly low recovery rate compared to both estimates of their recovery rate of 72-73% if either of the acquisition plans were successful, as well as recovery estimates for creditors of other bankrupt crypto platforms. Celsius&#8217; creditors, for example, are expected to collect around 70% of their shares.</p>



<p>If collapsed crypto trading company Alameda Research&#8217;s quest to recoup $446 million from Voyager&#8217;s estate fails, the recovery rate might grow. In addition to reserving $446 million of the estate&#8217;s assets for the Alameda action, Voyager&#8217;s attorneys are retaining an additional $259.6 million for litigation fees, administrative claims, and various other holdbacks.</p>

<p>Creditors with any of the 67 supported tokens, including BTC and ETH, will be able to withdraw the maximum percentage of their crypto immediately. Voyager will sell any of the 38 unsupported tokens, including SOL and ALGO, and pay customers back in USDC, a stablecoin.</p>



<p>The statement comes only ten days after Binance.US suddenly backed out of a $1 billion agreement to buy Voyager Digital&#8217;s assets when the US government intervened to prohibit a portion of it. Binance.US, the crypto exchange Binance&#8217;s sibling company that purports to be controlled separately, backed out of a $1.3 billion restructuring plan to purchase Voyager assets last week. It noted the United States hostile and unpredictable regulatory environment.</p>



<p>Prior to the agreement with Binance.US, the crypto lender made a similar offer to FTX. As FTX went bankrupt with Voyager in November, the first agreement was canceled.</p>



<p>Since then, the company has been figuring out ways to restore assets to investors who employed its services.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The hottest memecoin PEPE has reached a market cap of nearly $1.5 billion in just a few weeks of its launch.</em></li>



<li><em>Market capitalization increased sharply after the market&#8217;s most prominent exchange Binance, and then Kucoin announced the listing.</em></li>



<li><em>Meanwhile, both platforms urge users to exercise caution as PepeCoin has rallied 132% on the day of listing and now appears to be over-leveraged.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The latest memecoin that is catching the attention of the PepeCoin market has reached a capitalization of nearly $1.5 billion just hours after Binance and Kucoin announced their listings.</strong></h5>

<p>The incredible rise of Pepecoin turned a payout into a profit of nearly 5,000,000% Meme Coin. It marked another 80% gain in the past 24 hours, while its market cap skyrocketed above $1.4 billion in just a few weeks of its launch.</p>

<p>Pepe holders rejoice when major exchanges announce controversial memecoin <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185502-listing-on-binance-floki-and-pepe-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listings</a>. On Friday, May 5, Binance announced that it would be listing the popular meme coins Pepe (PEPE) and Floki Inu (FLOKI). Binance has added PEPE to its Innovation area with PEPE/USDT and PEPE/TUSD spot trading pairs. Shortly after Binance&#8217;s announcement, rival exchange KuCoin also listed the Pepe token, and KuCoin has introduced the PEPE/USDT trading pair.</p>

<p>The listing then increased trading activity, with PepeCoin&#8217;s daily trading volume reaching 284.24%. This increased the price of the token, by a staggering 132% on the same day. This causes both exchanges to warn users to be cautious about the risks.</p>



<p>The rapid price increase has negatively affected traders who bet on a drop in PEPE. Coinglass revealed that the number of traders selling PEPE using leverage has skyrocketed, and the total loss is over $10 million on a daily scale.</p>



<p>Another big problem for the Pepe token is the possibility of a copyright dispute because Pepe the Frog has a creator and an owner. The creator of Pepe has successfully targeted blockchain projects using Pepe with legal action.</p>



<p>However, the amazingly rapid rise of this memecoin is creating enormous fortunes for those who are undaunted by warnings that this is a fad that will end badly.</p>

<li><em>The action was taken before the government seized and sold the bank to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</em></li>



<li><em>It has not been identified which former executives are the focus of the investigation. No one formerly or currently employed by the bank has been accused of misconduct.</em></li>

<p>One of the persons, who requested anonymity because the investigation hasn&#8217;t been made public, said the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185301-sec-10-days-to-respond-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> is looking into whether any former First Republic executives inappropriately traded on inside information.</p>



<p>It was not immediately clear who former executives were the investigation&#8217;s subject. No one has been charged with wrongdoing in the past or present at the bank, and the inquiry may come to a close without any charges being brought against anybody.</p>



<p>On May 1, US authorities officially took over First Republic Bank and sold its assets to the largest bank in the country, JPMorgan Chase. According to CNN, this is US history&#8217;s second largest bank failure.</p>



<p>Like Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), or Signature Bank, the collapse of First Republic was partly caused by the Fed&#8217;s prolonged interest rate hike campaign. When interest rates rise, bank investments &#8211; especially long-term bonds &#8211; depreciate, and this leads to the banking system in the US suffering billions of dollars in paper losses. First Republic was seized by regulators and sold to JPMorgan on Monday in a government-led deal following a dramatic weekend.</p>

<p>Separately, the SEC probed the trading activity of Silicon Valley Bank executives before it collapsed in March.</p>



<p>Under the pressure of the Fed to raise interest rates, banks also had to increase deposit rates to compete with other competitors to attract customers. That puts great pressure on regional and mid-range banks, typically those that customers massively withdrew during the crisis in March.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Miles Deutscher&#8217;s Twitter thread on meme coin investing is a must-read for those interested in high returns. He advises caution and a gambling mindset, but you may find the next big coin with the right strategy.</strong></h5>



<p>Miles Deutscher&#8217;s Twitter thread on how to find meme coin gems and trade them for high returns has attracted significant attention in the crypto community. </p>

<cite>Miles Deutscher wrote</cite></blockquote>



<p>In the thread, he covers the basics of meme coin investing, finding and researching strong meme coins, the best meme coin buying strategy, and how to know when to take profits.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Deutscher acknowledges that investing in meme coins is a gamble since those coins have fewer fundamental drivers than typical investments. As such, the investment should be approached cautiously and treated as a gamble, much like games at a casino. Deutscher reminds readers that, like the house in a casino, the L1s such as Ethereum + exchanges always win.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Despite the risks, there are ways to tip the odds in your favor when investing in meme coins. Deutscher suggests monitoring which coins perform well, verifying that the token has a strong culture, researching the fundamentals, and following the smart money.</p>



<p>When buying and taking profits, Deutscher recommends treating it like a casino. He advises only trading meme coins on a separate on-chain wallet, using technical analysis to help get entries, and taking your initial entry out after a 2x. For those more willing to take risks, he suggests laddering out a predetermined percentage per additional 100% gains.</p>



<p>Deutscher cautions that meme coins can generate significant profits quickly, but investors must be careful to utilize that money to improve their lives. He recommends not roundtripping profits and reducing risk when top signs appear, such as 24h trading volume flipping market cap, lower highs being formed on a higher timeframe, number of holders decreasing, holder growth significantly slowing, large whales starting to sell, and funding rates shifting from negative to positive.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in investing in meme coins, it&#8217;s essential to approach it with a gambling mindset and to conduct thorough research before investing. With the right strategy, you may be able to find and invest in the next big meme coin that could change your life.</p>

<p>BNP Paribas China will be able to link to the Bank of China&#8217;s (BOC) system and develop an e-CNY management system for its corporate customers as a result of the agreement. So far, China has approved ten banks, all of which are local institutions, to handle its digital currency operations.</p>



<p>BOC is one of eight banks in China permitted to conduct digital currency transactions.</p>



<p>Moreover, the French bank will investigate the possibility of extending the use of China&#8217;s central bank digital currency (CBDC) to smart contracts, supply chain financing, and utilities and cross-border payments.</p>



<p>CG Lai, chief executive officer of BNP Paribas China, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The collaboration has once again demonstrates our commitment to the China market, and we will continue to enhance our customer service capabilities through digital innovation and contribute to China’s economic development.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>China&#8217;s digital yuan development is the most advanced among major nations&#8217; CBDC programs, with testing beginning in 2020.</p>



<p>According to a 2021 study by the nation&#8217;s central bank, Beijing began researching a possible sovereign digital currency in 2014, and one of its aims was to provide unbanked individuals, especially those traveling from outside, access to digital banking in China.</p>



<p>The digital yuan, also known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment in China, is being tested in 26 cities and areas spread over 17 provinces. It has been employed in shopping, transportation, and even salary payments.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/183570-digital-yuan-used-to-pay-servants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, Changshu, a city in China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province, has released a notice saying that starting this month, all government personnel under its jurisdiction would be paid in digital RMB or digital yuan.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>A giant whale recently bought 313 billion PEPE at a price of 0.000003973, deposited all acquired PEPE to Binance, and may sell after opening trading, potentially stirring up the crypto market.</em></li>



<li><em>A SmartMoney investor reportedly earned $7.5 million on SHIB and made significant transactions involving other cryptocurrencies such as PEPE, WOJAK, AFY, Dione, DMTR, and VAI.</em></li>

<p>A whale has emerged, purchasing a large amount of PEPE at a price of 0.000003973. This <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1654539476172148736" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1654539476172148736" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchase </a>amounted to a staggering 313 billion PEPE, which was exchanged for 1.24 million USDT.

<p>The whale, dubbed a &#8220;giant whale,&#8221; deposited all their acquired PEPE to Binance just 30 minutes ago. This deposit included a 4.23 trillion token, valued at $15.6 million. With an average buying cost of 0.0000002535, the giant whale&#8217;s profit is estimated at approximately $14.5 million. It remains to be seen whether the Whale will sell their acquired PEPE after the opening of trading, but this is an intriguing development in the crypto world.</p>

<p>These transactions are not the only ones to attract attention recently, as a SmartMoney individual reportedly made $7.5 million on SHIB, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies. The individual purchased six MEME coins and PEPE, WOJAK, AFY, Dione, DMTR, and VAI. They were even fortunate enough to receive 179 million FLOKI from Flokitars Deployer.</p>

<p>SmartMoney also purchased 58.66 billion PEPE with 10 ETH, selling for 16.55 ETH. They then bought 47 billion PEPE with 17.3 ETH, 320 million WOJAK with 150 ETH, 43.5 billion AFY with 10 ETH, 1.97 million Dione with 5 ETH, 114,924 DMTR with 5 ETH, and 135,470 VAI with 7 ETH.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The FCA has launched yet another crackdown on cryptocurrency ATMs in the nation.</em></li>



<li><em>It carried out raids in Exeter, Nottingham, and Sheffield this week.</em></li>



<li><em>Local organized crime forces in the region assisted in the raids as part of a combined effort to combat illicit usage.</em></li>

<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The FCA <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-continues-action-against-unregistered-crypto-atms-across-uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that it had assessed premises in Exeter, Nottingham, and Sheffield in collaboration with the local police. The devices used to convert fiat cash into cryptocurrency are considered a money laundering risk, and none are registered with the FCA as needed by law, the agency said in a statement on Friday.</p>



<p>Some nations, though, are adopting a very different strategy. Crypto ATMs are becoming more prevalent in the United States and Australia, despite efforts by some to connect them to money laundering and prohibit their usage.</p>



<p>In the lack of any <a href="https://news.coincu.com/167266-uk-fca-issues-warning-letters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FCA</a> permission, the operation of crypto ATMs is prohibited in the United Kingdom. Their usage is associated with organized crime, according to officials. Local organized crime forces in the region assisted in the searches this week as part of a coordinated operation targeting unlawful usage.</p>



<p>The FCA said that it was analyzing the information gathered during its examination but did not clarify what if any, additional action would be taken. The searches follow enforcement actions launched in March in Leeds and East London.</p>



<p>Economic Crime Unit Manager of the South West Regional Organized Crime Unit (SWROCU), Peter Highway, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Criminals will use crypto ATMs to launder illegally obtained cash, so we were pleased to assist our colleagues at the FCA in targeting businesses in the region displaying these machines without authorization.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The regulators in the United Kingdom do not adopt a hands-off attitude. According to the FCA&#8217;s website, practically all financial businesses in the United Kingdom must be approved or registered.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/country/225/bitcoin-atm-united-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinATMRadar</a>, there are 17 crypto ATMs in the United Kingdom, but the FCA maintains that none of the 40 or so registered crypto firms are authorized to provide that service.</p>



<p>The UK is in a very different position than other advanced economies and financial systems when it comes to crypto ATMs. Last month, Australia&#8217;s total number of cryptocurrency ATMs topped that of the rest of Asia.</p>

<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s network difficulty and hashrate are two critical factors that determine the health and stability of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency. The difficulty level sets the level of complexity required for miners to solve the cryptographic puzzle and receive rewards, while the hashrate measures the total computing power dedicated to mining Bitcoin.</p>



<p>As of May 5, 2023, Bitcoin&#8217;s network difficulty is 48.01T, representing a 1.45% decrease from the previous adjustment. This adjustment occurs after every 2016 block have been mined, ensuring a consistent block production rate of approximately 10 minutes per block.</p>



<p>However, despite the decrease in difficulty, the network&#8217;s overall hashrate remains high, with an average of 347.25 EH/s over the past 24 hours, according to <a href="https://explorer.btc.com/btc/insights-difficulty" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://explorer.btc.com/btc/insights-difficulty" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC.com</a>. This represents a slight decrease from the previous week&#8217;s average of 348.60 EH/s.</p>



<p>The high hashrate indicates the immense computing power devoted to mining Bitcoin, which is crucial for maintaining the network&#8217;s security and preventing attacks. The increase in hashrate has been primarily driven by the growth of mining farms and the deployment of more powerful ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) designed specifically for mining Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Despite the high hashrate, Bitcoin&#8217;s mining industry fluctuations are inevitable due to changes in market conditions, regulations, and hardware advancements. For example, a significant increase in the price of electricity or new mining hardware could lead to a decline in the hashrate as miners struggle to maintain profitability.</p>
