Although I am not a prophet, it was clear to me that this would be a critical time for Bitcoin. When the bear market hit this year, we saw a "cleansing" of the Bitcoin ecosystem and an opportunity to refocus on its main mission of monetary freedom.</p><p>The snowball started in the heat of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/celsius-bankruptcy-judge-orders-return-some-crypto-assets-customers-2022-12-07/">July with the Celsius bankruptcy</a>, which was the first sign that the ecosystem we were building was not healthy. The fact that we were using a decentralized currency to mirror the centralized financial system did not match the vision for Bitcoin.</p><p>This once again highlighted the existence of two alternate and diverging realities for Bitcoin: "real" Bitcoin, which is rising from the bottom up and focuses on the value Bitcoin can bring to the world, and "regulated" Bitcoin, which is focused on price and committed to regulatory systems and adoption through speculation.</p><p>I <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-exchange-coincorner-acquires-coinfloor-customer-base-domain">sold Coinfloor in 2021</a> because I realized that exchanges like ours were too often dedicated to keeping their users trapped in regulated Bitcoin land. As we near the end of 2022, the negative effects of this have been painfully demonstrated by the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">collapse of FTX</a>, the regulatory fallout and the losses incurred by so many innocent people.</p><p>On the other hand, real Bitcoin is flourishing in the Global South and post-Soviet regions, where innovation is addressing the narrative that Bitcoin has no good use cases. For instance, a new version of <a href="https://twitter.com/obi/status/1602719065394626561?s=20&amp;t=Q3N3roPSGa5IRrFRNrmC2g">frontier towns</a> is emerging, combining renewable energy, Bitcoin mining, internet connectivity and community custody. As I have long suspected, real Bitcoin adoption can only come from the people, and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fediment-evolution-of-bitcoin-custody">Fedimint</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/fedi-global-bitcoin-adoption-tech">Fedi</a> seek to be key in achieving hyperbitcoinization. The world will experience the most primitive form of protection — humans united — translated and turbocharged through the highest technology.</p><p>In the coming years, communities will play a crucial role in defining the path for Bitcoin. Bitcoiners are already empowering communities around the globe, but it is vital that our global community also stays united to win this battle. As I predicted in my 2020 post, we will certainly succeed in this endeavor and so <a href="https://twitter.com/obi/status/1603395290198904843?s=20&amp;t=70xvNHh_VdPiZBIvaxhh-g">I am more convinced than ever that Bitcoin will win in 2023</a>.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Obi Nwosu.

We’re at a turning point. It is clear that Bitcoin is starting to cut the dead weight of speculation. All eyes are on us and it’s our responsibility to educate people and governments about why Bitcoin has real-life use cases that will allow money to flow freely and include billions more into the global economy. I’m ready to onboard the next billion Bitcoiners.</p><p>Here are my 2022 takeaways and predictions for 2023:</p><h2>The Global South Will Continue To Lead Bitcoin Adoption</h2><p>I just came back from the<a href="https://www.afrobitcoin.org/"> Africa Bitcoin Conference</a> in Ghana — an inspirational event bringing together pan-Africa and international leaders to talk about Bitcoin’s purpose over its price (thank you <a href="https://www.afrobitcoin.org/about-us">Farida Nabourema</a>!). As a legacy for the event, our team at<a href="https://www.builtwithbitcoin.org/"> the Built With Bitcoin Foundation</a> opened the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/built-with-bitcoin-opens-bitcoin-technology-center-in-ghana">Bitcoin Technology Center (BTC), a learning and training center in Kumasi, Ghana</a> — which is set to educate 400 people in its first year. </p><p>This trip reenergized my hope for the future. Even in a bear market, trade volume in Africa continues to press forward. Looking at our volume on Paxful, we predict further increases in both Ghana and Nigeria for 2023. Why? We’re still seeing growth in Africa because of the necessity for Bitcoin on the continent — it offers a cheaper and more efficient solution for people to send money back home, make payments and preserve their wealth. And that does not go away because of market conditions. I expect Africa to continue to lead the way heading into the next year. </p><h2>The Divide Between Bitcoin And The Rest Will Grow</h2><p>Bitcoin is backed by human work and has proven its utility beyond the West’s obsession with speculation. It has the ability to bank the unbanked and finally shift the tides of economic apartheid — Bitcoin’s impact cannot be overstated. The bulk of “cryptos” are for wild speculation and investing, relying on the morals of these shady authorities. </p><p>As we’ve seen with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, people’s life savings can be demolished when there is only a single point of failure. This narrative is the same game the banks have been running for centuries. I’m not buying it. Next year, we will see more Bitcoin-only companies and conferences as the Bitcoin community works to clean up the mess of misinformation caused by these bad actors.</p><h2>Governments Need A Rethink</h2><p>Smart regulation fosters safety, but poor- or overregulation stifles innovation and growth. We need to strike a balance and that comes with education. My hope for next year is that more Bitcoin companies come together to share why Bitcoin cannot and should not be regulated as you would, for example, stocks or wheat futures. </p><p>It’s our responsibility to also advocate for transparency — like requiring companies to share their proof of reserves. Without this, we’re going to see more far-reaching regulation like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sen-warren-unconstitutional-crypto-bill">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act</a>, which pegs more consumer surveillance as the savior and touts Western Union as an example to lead the industry. We know how that narrative will play out... </p><h2>‘Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins’ Will Get Louder </h2><p>The trust of the people was tested this year and I don’t blame them for shying away. Life savings were destroyed because of despicable morals and we need to earn back that trust. This is why I<a href="https://paxful.com/university/why-you-should-hold-own-bitcoin/"> advocate</a> for decentralization and for users to self custody their savings. </p><p>Using a non-custodial wallet means that users are their own banks, managing their own money and controlling the future of their own finances. In 2023, we’ll see more of a narrative and product push around self custody. I am already doing my part to amplify this message, including sharing a<a href="https://paxful.com/university/bitcoin-self-custody/"> step-by-step process</a> on how to self custody your bitcoin.</p><h2>Bear Markets Will Build A Stronger Industry</h2><p>I am a natural builder and I have gone back to my roots this year. I’ve come to realize that we are not building products for how people live their daily lives in the Global South. There is too much focus on the unrealistic dream of minting millionaires and not enough around the pain points that keeps billions of people enclosed in economic apartheid. Next year, you will see more products that cater to the true needs of everyday people and offer them solutions for remittance, payments, e-commerce, wealth preservation and basic communication. </p><p>Bitcoiners, 2023 is looking brighter than ever. This is the way!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ray Youssef.

Every year millions of Americans save between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/travel/medical-tourism-coronavirus-pandemic.html">40-80% in medical fees</a> by crossing the border or taking a short plane ride to receive the care they need. Even after the pandemic slowed international travel, more people looked abroad for shorter wait times, better service, and lower fees. </p><p>Bitcoin can boost the medical tourism sector and help patients get the treatment they need at a price that is affordable. Bitcoin can make transactions abroad easier and ensure that everyone gets a fair deal. </p><h2>Medical Tourism</h2><p>Medical tourism has a bad reputation. It’s commonly associated with experimental treatments, suspicious surgeons, and concerning cosmetic procedures. However, these issues are largely overplayed and overstated. For millions, medical tourism is a lifeline that helps folks get the treatment they need at a price they can afford. </p><p>The <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism">CDC defines medical tourism</a> as the practice of traveling to another country for medical care. Common medical tourism destinations include Canada, as well as countries in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. </p><p>The CDC does warn that medical tourism carries risks. Flying shortly after surgery increases the patient’s risk of deep vein thrombosis. Medical tourists may be exposed to bacterial infection due to a lack of immunity and should research any care providers thoroughly before going through with treatment. </p><p>People elect to travel abroad for many different treatments. However, medical treatments are particularly popular for treatments that have <a href="https://sanantonio-lasik.com/cataracts/how-soon-after-cataract-surgery-can-you-drive/">shorter recovery times like cataract surgery</a>. People who have cataract surgery can usually drive the day after treatment, so negotiating an airport shouldn’t be an issue. </p><p>Patients who are considering medical tourism should consult with their primary care provider before moving forward. The primary provider has a complete medical history and will know whether or not a procedure is viable. They’ll also be able to arrange follow-up care when patients arrive home. </p><h2>Transactions Abroad</h2><p>Bitcoin transactions may be particularly important in the future, as the U.S. medical economy appears to be set for a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/us-economy-medical-debt-black-swan-event">black swan event</a> following the pandemic. Trillions of dollars of medical debt have accumulated in the U.S., which may push folks to seek better service and lower costs abroad. </p><p>Medical debt is a serious issue in the U.S., though most people can <a href="https://www.nationaldebtrelief.com/proactive-ways-to-avoid-medical-debt/">avoid medical debt</a> by researching billing codes and negotiating a payment plan that works for them. This may involve negotiations with partial payments in bitcoin, too. </p><p>Bitcoin has the potential to make medical tourism more affordable for all. This can close the care gap, and ensures that everyone has access to high-quality, reliable medical care. </p><p>This sentiment is echoed by Renée-Marie Stephano, CEO of Global Healthcare Resources and the Medical Tourism Association. Stephano <a href="https://www.magazine.medicaltourism.com/article/cryptocurrency-medical-tourism">notes</a> that there has been a “sharp uptick in the utilization of cryptocurrency” to pay for medical treatment abroad.</p><p>Decentralized currencies like bitcoin return power to the patient and make it easier for patients to pay for their treatment. Bitcoin can help patients avoid issues with currency conversions and international payments. Bitcoin payments to clinics are fast and come with minimal charges compared with traditional transactions. </p><p>Providers who accept bitcoin find that the process is easy and can be quickly converted to national currencies. Ken Fryer, a spokesperson for Vinci Hair Clinic in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hair_clinics_in_london_spain_dubai_and_brazil_accepting_bitcoins">admitted</a> that their clinic had to cancel previous treatments for international patients due to issues with fund transfers and banking restrictions. </p><p>Fryer says that Bitcoin solved these issues and gave patients the ability to pay quickly in large sums if needed. </p><h2>Countries Accepting Bitcoin For Medical Tourism</h2><p>Medical tourism often occurs in less economically developed countries (LEDC). Bitcoin can help these nations close the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-opening-to-financial-inclusion">wealth inequality gap</a> by encouraging a fair, free-flowing exchange of funds in return for legitimate healthcare services. </p><p>Despite the recent downturn in cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin utilization remains high in many countries where medical tourism is popular. </p><p>Currently, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/china-back-among-top-10-crypto-using-countries">top 10 countries for Bitcoin adoption</a> include Brazil, India and Pakistan. Many of these countries are popular <a href="https://shifainternationalpatients.com/blog/medical-tourism-in-2021/">destinations for medical tourism</a>.</p><p>India is a particularly popular destination for medical tourism in Asia. India has a favorable medical visa policy, which allows family members to stay with patients. India also scores highly in Bitcoin adoption and is ranked first in centralized service value received and retail centralized service value received. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Bitcoin has the potential to improve medical tourism and help everyone get the treatment they need. Bitcoin is particularly important in today’s post-pandemic world, where medical bills are spiraling and the U.S. medical sector holds trillions of dollars of debt. </p><p>Bitcoin can be particularly useful when traveling to countries with tricky transfer laws. Treatment can be delayed or even canceled if patients aren’t able to pay on time. Bitcoin can negate this issue, and help everyone get a fair deal. </p><p>Before paying for medical treatment in Bitcoin, patients should consult with their primary care provider to ensure that they get the treatment they need when they return home. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Frankie Wallace.

"But to pay for foreign trade transactions, we still assume the possibility of using cryptocurrencies, for example, for parallel imports."</p><p>Russian officials have teased at this possibility for almost a year, following an intense package of Western sanctions deployed in the wake of the nation’s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Russia laid out a roadmap for bitcoin regulation <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/russia-prepares-roadmap-for-bitcoin-crypto-regulation-report">in January 2022</a>, and the Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/russia-submits-first-bitcoin-bill-proposal">in the following month</a>. Around the same time, U.S. President Biden announced the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-imposes-sanctions-on-russia-bitcoin-jumps-to-39k">first tranche of Russian sanctions</a>, blocking five of the biggest Russian banks and freezing all the assets they held in America.

If they want bitcoin, we will trade in bitcoin," the chairman of the country’s Congressional energy committee, Pavel Zavalny, said in a press conference at the time.</p><p>Soon, the idea gained steam and different areas of Russia’s government began endorsing it. In April, the country’s tax authority <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/russian-entities-could-soon-use-bitcoin-in-foreign-trade">proposed a change</a> to the local cryptocurrency bill to let entities accept cryptocurrency as payment in foreign trade.

Although once-touted as a non-correlative asset compared to equity markets, bitcoin’s beta is ultimately well past one as it falls at a rate nearly twice that of the struggling stock market.</p><p>But, recently, it appears that the coin is <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-price-crypto-markets-today-51667468347">stagnating below</a> $20,000. In this apparent consolidation, some fear that it may simply be butting up against a previous support floor and that any additional bad bitcoin news will cause a further drop.</p><p>Some are more confident in the coin.</p><p>According to them, this consolidation is a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-price-tests-critical-support-levels">strong sign of a bottom</a>, and the support making bitcoin range-bound is a sign of a strong future. Whether the coin will shoot back up to close to its previous all-time-high of nearly $70,000 remains to be seen – but some are cautiously optimistic. </p><h2>Gathering Statistics</h2><p>According to the crypto research giant Kaiko, the volatility of the<a href="https://www.compareforexbrokers.com/forex-trading/statistics/"> $201B cryptocurrency market</a> fell below standard market benchmarks. This is a harbinger of solid consolidation, even as a stronger US currency and more attractive fixed-income assets distract investors. </p><p>In fact, for some, that bitcoin stability is the best news of the year.</p><p>Luno exchange head Vijay Ayyar reinforced the thesis that consolidation is an indicator of future stability or moves upward rather than further crashing, saying that “Bitcoin has largely been range bound between $18-25K for four months now, indicating consolidation and a probable bottoming out pattern, given we are seeing the Dollar Index top out as well.”</p><p>Calling the bottom (or the top) is as much art as science, with a healthy dose of luck needed, but Ayyar relies on past trends to make his assessments: “We’ve seen BTC bottom when DXY has topped in the past, as in 2015, so we could be witnessing a very similar pattern again.”</p><p>Others in the industry agree; Antoni Trenchev of the lending firm Nexo says that the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/discussing-the-revenge-of-the-nodes">consolidation and reduced volatility</a> are “strong evidence that the digital assets industry has matured and is becoming less fragmented.”</p><h2>Has Spring Sprung?</h2><p>As the rest of the equities market fell by “only” <a href="https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/is-a-market-correction-coming.html">around 20%</a>, bitcoin dropped by a multiple of that, losing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/bitcoin-has-lost-more-than-50percent-of-its-value-this-year-what-to-know.html">nearly $2</a> trillion in net value and falling by over 50% just this year. It has dropped almost 70% compared to its<a href="https://youngandtheinvested.com/cryptocurrency-statistics/"> $68,543 peak</a> in November 2021. This fall was devastating to the class of investors who saw bitcoin as a hedge or means of diversification in a portfolio, as the coin proved substantially correlated with stocks.</p><p>As we’ve said, and you’ve undoubtedly heard parroted endlessly since October 2021, that fall is mainly due to the Federal Reserve’s attempts to tamp down inflation. Those attempts have proven to be largely insubstantial thus far, requiring a further rate increase of 75 BPS at a time with no end.</p><p>Compounding the correlation issue was that many large institutional crypto bulls built heavily leveraged positions they were then forced to unwind to avoid margin calls, ultimately driving the price down further as the assets were sold for relative scraps.</p><p>Some call this nuclear fallout in the crypto sphere, aptly, a crypto winter. Some, like Three Arrows Capital, even lost their entire firm as they unwound too slowly — the firm lost <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/battered-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-considers-asset-sales-bailout-11655469932">more than $3B</a> of investor money before collapsing.</p><p>Going back to Ayyar, the stability indicates an “accumulation period.” That accumulation may indicate a willingness to tentatively return to bitcoin for funds, firms and investors, as the modeling shows the $20,000 range undervalued.</p><p>“The fact that bitcoin is trapped in such a range makes it boring, but this is also the point at which retail investors lose interest, and smart money begins to amass,” Ayyar said.</p><p>Not only that, but many family offices are expanding their crypto holdings as they, too, seek diversification and increasingly move towards alternative investments for clients. Digital asset management fund president Matteo Dante Perruccio reinforced this trend by pointing to a “counterintuitive spike in demand” from big money and smart money. This could be a move towards diversification or, just as likely, seeking substantial upside as they think the bottom is in.</p><p>Bitcoin miners, too, have reduced their crypto sales. As this happens, selling pressure also falls, another harbinger of positive movement in the coin’s future and the mining industry at large. Analysts from Goldman Sachs say that publicly traded bitcoin miners sold <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/boring-could-be-beautiful-for-xbtf">around 3,000 bitcoins</a> in September compared to 12,000 in June.</p><p>Back to Perruccio: he predicts that the crypto winter will break in Q2 of 2023. “For the market to advance,” he said, “we’ll have seen a lot more failures in the DeFi [decentralized finance] arena and a lot of the smaller firms.”</p><p>Even financial service providers haven’t abandoned crypto.</p><p>Joining the trend, Mastercard just rolled out options for banks that enable crypto trading alongside traditional accounts. Also, Visa is collaborating with the FTX exchange to bring debit cards to market that direct links to trading accounts and help users <a href="https://www.waveapps.com/blog/accounting-and-taxes/cash-flow-projection">ensure cash flow</a> as they speculate, spend, and manage the transition from cash to crypto (and vice versa). </p><h2>Fed Watch</h2><p>Head of Crypto Research at the alternative asset management company CoinShares James Butterfill is a bit more cautious, reminding investors that it’s difficult to make too many predictions before more information and data come out. “We err on the side of higher upside possibilities rather than further price declines,” he said.</p><p>“The largest fund withdrawals recently have been in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/earn-interest-on-bitcoin-short-sellers">short-bitcoin positions</a>, whereas we have seen tiny but consistent inflows into long bitcoin over the last six weeks,” he said to CNBC via email. He later added, “A statement from the Federal Reserve that it intends to ease its aggressive tightening would be the major factor driving uptake of bitcoin.”</p><p>The Fed is expected to continue the 75 BPS incremental hikes. Still, some also see a pivot on the horizon back to the days of easy (or easier) money: “Clients are telling us that they will start increasing positions to bitcoin once the Fed pivots, or is close to it,” Butterfill said. “The recent liquidations of net shorts are consistent with what we observe in terms of money flows and suggest that short sellers are starting to give in.”</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So what’s the bottom line? Unfortunately, the future is impossible to predict, and we can only manage expectations in line with past trends, data, and our thesis about the coin. For bullish investors, though, the recent <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/buyers-of-last-resort-and-bitcoin-price-volatility">reduction in volatility</a> is a good sign indeed – and institutions appear to agree.</p><hr><h2>Addendum – FTX And Its Dramatic Effect On The Crypto Capital Market</h2><p>Sometimes you speak too soon, and in the case of Bitcoin's reduced volatility, unforeseen circumstances are forcing the metaphorical groundhog back into his hole for another extended period of crypto winter. </p><p>Midway through the month, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, previously the third largest and seen as broadly beyond reproach, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">collapsed</a> in a spectacular mess of financial mismanagement and tabloid-style personal intrigue. </p><p>While the latter is undoubtedly good for gossip fodder, the crux of what happened and how it will affect Bitcoin moving forward lay in the former. In short, the appearance of mismanagement led to the uncovering of real abuses as the largest exchange, Binance, announced they'd be closing their positions in FTX's proprietary coin FTT based on perceived conflicts of interest between FTX and trading firm Alameda. That announcement led to an effective bank run on FTX as thousands of customers pulled or cashed in their coins, triggering a liquidity crisis as FTX failed to deliver on customer withdrawals.</p><p>I told you it was complicated, and that's just scratching the surface. But what matters now is the effect we see on Bitcoin capital markets. </p><p>Despite a period of consolidation and accumulation as Bitcoin stayed effectively "flat," the news of FTX's collapse and shadow of doubt cast over the crypto arena. After just a week of increasingly concerning information, Bitcoin fell to a two-year low of $15,480, bringing the total market loss for the year to a round $1.5T. </p><p>Some look to the FTX collapse as a final nail in the crypto coffin, rounding out stablecoin UST's loss of stability and widespread failure of former monolithic crypto-focused funds that appeared to bring legitimacy to the markets as a safe(ish) store of value. It's unclear whether the winter will continue. Still, increased regulations are almost a sure bet as agents from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice, and other government giants converge on the scraps of FTX to find out what happened and how to prevent it in the future. </p><p>Even the most optimistic Bitcoin bulls see the crypto winter extending through 2023, so it's best to be prepared to hunker down for another rough ride. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><em>Francois Moreau</em><em>.

Allen. The hearing, entitled "<a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/crypto-crash-why-the-ftx-bubble-burst-and-the-harm-to-consumers">Crypto Crash: Why the FTX Bubble Burst and Harm to Consumers</a>," had all the markings of political theater and provided a stage to misinform senators and the public. It coincided with Elizabeth Warren's new financial surveillance bill, which <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/20/elizabeth-warrens-new-financial-surveillance-bill-is-a-disaster-for-privacy-and-civil-liberties/">is a disaster for privacy and civil liberties</a>. On December 18, the Senate Banking Committee Chair Senator Sherrod Brown divulged on “Meet The Press” that the hearing was intended to “educate the public” on the dangers of cryptocurrencies and <a href="https://youtu.be/gzqJahHvhsY?t=513">floated the idea of banning them</a> altogether.</p><h2>Mr. McKenzie Goes To Washington</h2><p><br>Actor Ben McKenzie, who has starred in “The O.C.<em>,</em>” “Gotham” and “Southland,” lacks the qualifications and expertise one would expect for being called before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee to testify on the inner workings of financial technology. It should therefore come as no surprise that he made basic errors in his testimony, and could have been avoided altogether had witnesses with actual expertise been called. According to Mr. McKenzie:</p><blockquote><p>"Bitcoin cannot work as a medium of exchange because it cannot scale. The Bitcoin network can only process 5 to 7 transactions a second. By comparison, Visa can handle tens of thousands. To facilitate that relatively trivial amount of transactions, Bitcoin uses an enormous amount of energy. In 2021, Bitcoin consumed 134 TWh in total, comparable to the electrical energy consumed by the country of Argentina. Bitcoin simply cannot ever work at scale as a medium of exchange.</p><p>–<a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Schenkkan%20Testimony%2012-14-22.pdf">Written testimony of Ben McKenzie Schenkkan</a>, December 14, 2022, U.S. Senate Banking Committee</p><p> </p></blockquote><p>McKenzie’s testimony leaves one with the impression that he intentionally sought out the most biased and unreliable sources to confirm his own predetermined conclusions. Unfortunately, it was false information.</p><p>Leaving aside the fact that he referenced Digiconomist, an<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/not-science-digiconomist-bitcoin"> unreliable, exaggerated</a> and<a href="https://blog.zorinaq.com/serious-faults-in-beci/"> seriously flawed</a> electricity consumption estimate from a<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/questionable-ethics-of-bitcoin-esg"> Dutch central bank employee's personal blog</a> that<a href="https://medium.com/@nic__carter/comments-on-the-white-house-report-on-the-climate-implications-of-crypto-mining-8d65d30ec942"> lacks peer review</a> (Cambridge University’s data is well respected and estimates that Bitcoin consumed<a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index"> 105 terawatt hours (TWh)</a>, or roughly 22% less energy than Digiconomist estimated, for 2021), McKenzie is effectively comparing a car engine to a wheel and not realizing how they relate to each other.</p><p>In technical terms, McKenzie conflated Visa’s transaction network with Bitcoin’s final settlement network, to make the illogical claim that Bitcoin cannot scale. This is a novice mistake. One could use the same faulty logic to make the erroneous claim that millions of retail payments within the banking system should be impossible because banks typically <a href="https://www.theclearinghouse.org/payment-systems/chips">wait until the end of the business day to settle funds with each other</a>. That, of course, is not true, as gross settlement is precisely how high-volume retail payments are batched between banks.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/bluepnume/status/1393857753559420930"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Visa is a credit-based transaction network. It’s not a financial institution, so it does not actually transfer money and cannot perform final settlement like Bitcoin can. Visa is effectively an IT company that<a href="https://youtu.be/i9timulsE4o"> informs its member banks how to clear and perform gross settlement with each other</a> during business hours. If you’ve ever waited a few days for a check to clear, you know that payments between two bank accounts are not instantaneous. Credit card transactions take <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-posting.asp">one to three days to post</a>. And <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1605946168667766784">90 to120 days to settle</a>.</p><p>The Visa system works well and offers services such as risk assessment, fraud prevention and clawbacks, but can incur high fees from the banks and intermediaries along the way. Member banks aren’t actually sending each other tens of thousands of payments every second. Instead, they batch millions of transactions together into a small number of final settlement payments. The settlements are typically routed through lower-volume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_gross_settlement">real-time gross settlement</a> (RTGS) networks operated by central banks, such as <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/wires">Fedwire</a> in the U.S. or <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/target2/html/index.en.html">TARGET2</a> in the EU.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin and Fedwire can perform about the same number of transactions per year. In December of 2020, Bitcoin<a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1363877250744152069"> performed 26 million transfers</a> (counting multiple outputs) across 9.6 million transactions, while Fedwire settled<a href="https://frbservices.org/resources/financial-services/wires/volume-value-stats/monthly-stats.html"> 18 million transactions</a> during the same time period. Just as Visa operates on transactional layers that batch transactions into gross settlement layers, Bitcoin is designed to scale in a similar manner.</p><p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning Network</a> was formally <a href="https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf">theorized</a> as a scaling solution <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/lightning-network">at MIT</a> in 2016 and today is a burgeoning Layer 2 open payments protocol, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">layered on top of Bitcoin</a>. The Lightning Network enables instant payments, and micropayments down to a fraction of a penny, and can scale up to the entire world. Micropayments alone could change e-commerce and the internet itself as we know it. Imagine machines or people <a href="https://podcastindex.org/podcast/value4value">streaming fractions of pennies for content</a> or APIs and you can already begin to see a new future for the internet emerging. Traditional finance simply cannot achieve this.</p><p>The Lightning Network allows high throughput Layer 3 retail payment apps and services such as <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a>, <a href="https://strike.me/">Strike</a> and many other apps to efficiently batch transactions into Bitcoin's "blocks" for final settlement. Services on Layer 3 <a href="https://youtu.be/276N9y293_k?t=4775">can offer the same protections</a> we are used to in the legacy financial system, but anyone can freely access Bitcoin’s Layer 2 or Layer 1 whenever they want.</p><blockquote><p>"While it would require time and investment, Visa’s payment network could sit on top of the bitcoin network to fulfill payments much the same way it sits on top of the existing banking system."&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-is-not-too-slow/">Parker Lewis</a></p></blockquote><p>While Fedwire adheres to <a href="https://app.frbservices.org/resources/financial-services/wires/operating-hours.html">limited operating hours</a>, shutting down on weekends and <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/about/holiday-schedules/">holidays</a>, Bitcoin never shuts down and it continues settling transactions roughly every 10 minutes — 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Bitcoin has achieved a<a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-uptime/"> similar uptime to Fedwire since Bitcoin's inception</a> and has demonstrated<a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-uptime/"> better uptime</a> than Fedwire since 2013. Fedwire experienced a<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/the-feds-system-that-allows-banks-to-send-money-back-and-forth-is-down.html"> major outage in 2021</a>.</p><p>There is no doubt that the larger cryptocurrency industry has become rife with fraud, scams and deception and it's commendable that McKenzie makes an effort to warn the public about those dangers. However, in his haste to condemn the entire industry, he failed to fundamentally understand<a href="https://youtu.be/RI4xEHI7tGg"> what sets Bitcoin apart</a> from the seemingly endless “crypto” scams and fraud that have sprung up around Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention. </p><p>Bitcoin's Lightning Network has a<a href="https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/1456088664132440069"> theoretical throughput of 40 million transactions per second</a>. Just as the internet took more than a generation to achieve today's levels of connectivity and reach, the Lightning Network would need time to grow its liquidity for it to achieve this theoretical maximum throughput. The performance of the Lightning Network is already astounding and is <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeNakamoto/status/1551546953934278660">faster than traditional contactless payments</a>. Thus, the testimony McKenzie provided to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee that, "Bitcoin simply cannot ever work at scale as a medium of exchange" was not only misleading, it was false.</p><p>Bitcoin uses multi-layered architecture,<a href="https://www.layeredmoney.com/"> modeled after the existing financial system</a> and banking systems going back to <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1604368939428958209">at least the 15th century</a>. Layered architecture is an ideal pattern for<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture"> well-built information technology systems</a> — including<a href="https://5g.systemsapproach.org/arch.html"> mobile networks</a> and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite"> the internet itself</a>. This kind of deliberate and intelligent architecture is what enables Bitcoin to become a decentralized medium of exchange for the entire planet.</p><p>In his written testimony, McKenzie <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Schenkkan%20Testimony%2012-14-22.pdf">highlighted</a> the issues plaguing El Salvador’s Bitcoin banking system, <a href="https://www.chivowallet.com/">Chivo</a> — a privately-built, government-controlled Layer 3 system that plugs into the Lightning Network. However, he failed to inform senators that users in El Salvador are free to use high-quality open-source wallets, such as <a href="https://muun.com/">Muun</a> or <a href="https://www.bitcoinbeach.com/">Bitcoin Beach</a> wallet and a wide range of others. More importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ibw7YA39s-M">the technology is starting to make a difference</a> in the lives of those who would otherwise be unbanked, as <a href="https://youtu.be/Ibw7YA39s-M">journalist Sharyn Alfonsi of “60 Minutes” discovered on a visit to El Salvador</a> earlier this year.</p><p>McKenzie, who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2022-11-24/counting-the-ways-the-world-hates-crypto-crypto-irl">after getting high one evening</a> decided to write a book on the rampant fraud in the crypto industry, has since begun a collaboration with journalist Jacob Silverman on the endeavor. McKenzie <a href="https://uvamagazine.org/articles/before_batman">earned his bachelor of arts degree from the University of Virginia in 2001</a>, majoring in foreign affairs and economics. That the U.S. Senate Banking Committee felt that an actor with an atrophied undergraduate degree in economics would somehow make an expert witness for a particularly complicated financial innovation suggests that the hearing was solely intended as political theater.</p><h2>Senators Regurgitate Ben McKenzie’s Fallacious Testimony</h2><p>When it was Senator Mark Warner’s turn to ask questions, he remarked:</p><blockquote><p>“I do think it’s curious that China made the decision to basically take that kind of risk, to ban crypto, because of their, at least, risk/reward analysis... The clunkiness of the technology behind Bitcoin, it could never go to scale no matter what! If you can only do 5 or 6 transactions per second, that is not a scalable tool and obviously a technology at a power and environmental cost. It just doesn’t make sense to me.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1603260817251745792">Senator Mark Warner</a></p></blockquote><p>Ignoring for a moment that Senator Warner thought it was “curious” that an authoritarian country made the risk/reward calculation to ban free speech of code and software — which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_v._United_States">protected under the First Amendment</a> — McKenzie’s false testimony had misinformed the senator into thinking that Bitcoin cannot scale when it is in fact already <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-lightning-network-surges-6746790">rapidly scaling</a>.</p><h2>The Energy Debate</h2><p>Earlier this year,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/style/ben-mckenzie-crypto.html"> McKenzie toured</a> Riot Blockchain’s<a href="https://www.riotblockchain.com/bitcoin-mining/whinstone-u-s"> Whinstone U.S.</a> — North America's largest Bitcoin mining facility, located about an hour outside Austin, Texas. When it was Senator Tina Smith's turn to ask questions, she turned to McKenzie and, doing her best to act confused,<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1603823473524187137"> asked what appeared to be a series of pre-scripted questions</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>SMITH: </strong>As I understand it, crypto mining is built on a process that becomes more and more energy intensive, over time. Is that correct?</p><p><strong>MCKENZIE:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>SMITH:</strong> So, it's inherently inefficient. Is that correct?</p><p><strong>MCKENZIE:</strong> The technology is bad.</p><p><strong>SMITH: </strong>And so, where is the benefit of this kind of innovation? How should we think about the impacts when it comes to the climate and energy impacts? Because when crypto mines are located in communities, those communities often see their energy prices go up — their energy rates go up — is that correct?</p><p><strong>MCKENZIE:</strong> That's right. I visited the largest crypto mine in the country, Whinstone, which is in Rockdale, Texas, just outside of my hometown of Austin, Texas. Local citizens are upset. It raises the cost of electricity for all citizens. And it also uses an enormous amount of energy. It took over a former Alcoa aluminum smelting plant that had been abandoned and now we are using it to mine ephemeral digital assets of no productive value.</p></blockquote><p>While it's convenient that McKenzie just happened to have visited a mining operation and could provide Smith with the exact answers that confirmed her biases, unfortunately he has zero expertise on energy markets,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_response"> demand response</a> programs, power engineering or mining and has no qualifications to inform congress or policy on the matter.</p><p>The idea that Bitcoin mining is an "inefficient" technology and therefore needs the government to reign it in is nonsensical. If it were as inefficient as claimed, there would be no need to stop it, since more efficient technologies would be able to outcompete it and easily replace it. This is precisely the reason we have markets — to let the most efficient and cheapest technologies win over the inefficient and expensive technologies that will fail. Those who are willing to take the risk on those technologies are either rewarded or bear the consequences.</p><p>McKenzie doesn't divulge that<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2003/08/why-texas-has-its-own-power-grid.html"> ERCOT, the Texas grid, is isolated</a> and therefore is required to have excess dispatchable energy for extreme weather events. That excess energy needs to be consumed by large scale flexible customers who are willing to pay for it is an open market when it’s not needed. Buying energy that would otherwise go wasted, for computation, keeps dispatchable energy profitable and officially classifies Bitcoin miners as beneficial<a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/11/29/SARA_Winter2022-23.pdf"> large flexible loads (LFLs)</a> by the ERCOT grid. A<a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/11/29/SARA_Winter2022-23.pdf"> recent ERCOT study</a> showed miners are<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/applied-direct-response-ercot-study-shows-bitcoin-mining-is-beneficial-to-the-texas-grid/"> essential to its demand response strategy</a>. </p><p>As demand response consumers, miners purchase wholesale energy in advance and buy private insurance products that incentivize them to turn off their machines when prices rise during periods of increased consumer demand — thus<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1548550264218583040"> balancing the grid and its prices, while increasing grid reliability</a>. The idea that McKenzie or any critic could isolate escalating power prices to a single consumer in a deregulated wholesale market is extremely dubious. Such a claim ignores the recent <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/natural-gas-prices-tripled-diesel-oil-2021-almost-no-ceiling-2022-5">tripling in natural gas prices</a>, as well as the recent build out of over <a href="https://tppa.com/texas-expected-to-add-10-gw-of-solar-by-2023-according-to-eia/">10 gigawatts of solar power</a> and Texas load growth from non-mining customers, such as the<a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-gigafactory-texas-3k-model-y-per-week/"> Tesla Gigafactory</a>.</p><p>While the Tesla Gigafactory may be considered a more productive use of energy, it is not nearly as<a href="https://youtu.be/TpqoJnpzK9g"> flexible at demand response as miners</a>. Miners<a href="https://www.seetee.io/podcast/s2e10/shaun-connell-bitcoin-mining-is-the-holy-grail-for-power-grids/"> de-risk excess renewable power</a> and will<a href="https://youtu.be/-k0eRTcMJQ4"> instantly shut down for high consumer demand when prices rise</a>. In fact, contrary to what McKenzie claims, The U.S. Department of Energy<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/activities/technology-development/grid-modernization-and-smart-grid/demand-response"> explains that demand response technologies are beneficial</a> for "balancing supply and demand" and says "such programs can lower the cost of electricity in wholesale markets, and in turn, lead to lower retail rates."</p><p>While McKenzie may have come across local residents of Rockdale, Texas who were "upset" about the Whinstone mining operation replacing the town's <a href="https://grist.org/article/rockdale-texas-alcoa-luminant-sandow-lakes-ranch/">abandoned Alcoa aluminum plant</a>. In reality, the new mining facility<a href="https://www.governing.com/community/a-small-town-in-texas-turns-to-bitcoin-mining-to-survive.html"> is a net positive for the struggling community</a>, boosting its economy, local tax collection and<a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/11/29/SARA_Winter2022-23.pdf"> grid stability</a>.</p><p>Senator Smith and McKenzie's suggestion that mining becomes "more and more energy intensive over time" is highly misleading and shows a lack of understanding of the technology. Like any publicly-traded commodity<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@customerprotection/documents/file/oceo_bitcoinbasics0218.pdf"> such as bitcoin</a>, the energy required is economically linked to the public's demand for its declining issuance, and unfolds in a highly-competitive open energy market. There is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/03/05/the-frustrating-maddening-all-consuming-bitcoin-energy-debate/">nothing about the technology</a> that requires the consumption of more and more energy over time. Bitcoin's four-year "halving" cycle reduces the rewards that miners receive to purchase energy. In fact, Bitcoin's critics claim that miners <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/interview-vitalik-buterin-creator">may not be able to afford to buy as much energy</a>, decades from now — a topic which is hotly debated. Eventually, critics will need to get their stories straight. Either miners will have the money to purchase energy in the future or they won’t, however, both outcomes cannot be true.</p><p>Using energy to remove the need for <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/proof-of-stake/">equity-based governance</a> is not “bad.” Equity-based governance was a common <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/proof-of-stake/">criticism of proof-of-stake "crypto"</a> networks in the hearing. Using energy for issuance and security is breakthrough technology that has <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1549805288269701120">many applications for energy innovation</a> that we are only just beginning to discover.</p><p>None of the witnesses or senators were even aware, or cared, that Bitcoin is<a href="https://twitter.com/DSBatten/status/1570624374927167489"> on track to becoming CO₂e carbon negative by 2024</a>, by<a href="https://batcoinz.com/quantifying-the-potential-impact-of-bitcoin-mining-on-global-methane-emissions/"> mitigating CH₄ methane emissions</a>.

Or that Bitcoin can bring<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-unlocks-ocean-energy"> clean baseload power to one billion people</a> in developing nations by monetizing stranded pilot plants that would be too expensive to test, prove and scale on a highly-competitive grid.

    </figure><p>The Senate’s thespians don't care that Bitcoin mitigates waste methane emissions<a href="https://twitter.com/denverbitcoin/status/1549693747935461376"> from oil and natural gas exploration</a> where there is no other use for waste CH₄, which would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere and would heavily contribute to warming forces. To them, Bitcoin is "bad" simply because people having the voluntary<em> </em>option for a digital sound money, without counterparty risk, threatens their politics.</p><h2>Professor Allen Fails Bitcoin 101</h2><p>Professor Allen, an <a href="https://www.wcl.american.edu/community/faculty/profile/hjallen/">associate professor at American University Washington College of Law</a>, made a fallacious claim about Bitcoin’s decentralization during her testimony:</p><blockquote><p>"It's not decentralized... Bitcoin is controlled by a few core software developers — fewer than 10. And they can make changes to the software and that software is implemented by mining pools and there's just a few of them."&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1603214594012598273">Professor Hillary J. Allen</a></p></blockquote><p>Allen's assertion is factually incorrect and shows a fundamentally flawed understanding of how Bitcoin works and why it is valued for being extremely difficult to change. Even if you believe that the<a href="https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin-core/people"> project's maintainers</a>, who have the elevated commit and publishing privileges, could persuade the largest mining pools to support their own whims, they would still need to persuade a majority of the world's independent miners to stay loyal to existing mining pools. Creating new competing pools <a href="https://bestfinancier.com/how-to-create-your-own-mining-pool/">is trivial</a> and any software update supported by pools that miners disagreed with could easily be avoided by creating new pools for defectors to join.</p><p>And what if miners unanimously supported a software update that users didn't want? In 2017, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/786sfo/if_rbitcoin_are_apposing_segwit2x_why_has_it/">83% of the global hash rate</a> attempted to force an update to increase Bitcoin's block size and failed because the users, who are actually responsible for propagating and interacting with the Bitcoin network through their own full nodes, refused to install the new software. The Bitcoin network simply doesn't exist or propagate without the user nodes, so miners defecting to their own network is pointless unless they convince users to come with them. The history of this critical test for Bitcoin was carefully documented by Jonathan Bier in his book, "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM">The Blocksize War: The Battle Over Who Controls Bitcoin’s Protocol Rules</a>."</p><p>Running a full node<a href="https://thebitcoinmanual.com/behind-btc/nodes/full-node/"> is fairly easy</a>. At minimum, all it takes is a hard drive, a Raspberry Pi and an internet connection. Since Bitcoin updates with soft forks (backwards-compatible software updates), users who find themselves in the minority always have the <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9mm9uem3k?t=343">right to dissent</a> and oppose contentious updates by just continuing to run the software with the rules they signed up for. Additionally, even if the entire Bitcoin Core team went rogue, users would be able to install <a href="https://bitcoin.eu/bitcoin-core-alternatives-dont-fork-blockchain/">alternative competing clients in their nodes</a>, without forking the blockchain.</p><p>Other so-called innovative “crypto” projects use <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ethereum-is-coercive-bitcoin-is-not">coercive techniques to force updates</a> while they try to rapidly innovate like software companies. No other project offers the kind of user rights that Bitcoin offers. As such, there is no incentive for Bitcoin users to run a fork that fundamentally changes Bitcoin's properties — its resistance to change is the core value proposition that its users are drawn to and demand. </p><p>Is it plausible that Bitcoin could be tested again and fail the same test in the future? Of course. But for Professor Allen to ignore the fact that users ultimately decide Bitcoin's fate — as well as its well-documented history proving its resilience to unwanted changes from miners and developers — shows Allen was either woefully unprepared to be discussing such technical aspects of Bitcoin or is intentionally misleading senators and the public with her testimony.</p><h2>A Performance Of Misinformation</h2><p>If anything was evident from the hearing, it was that there was zero effort to ascertain nuance or truth — the hearing was political theater. Unfortunately, having an undergraduate degree in economics, or reaching the higher echelons of<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-does-academia-have-a-bias-against-bitcoin"> Bitcoin-resenting academia</a>, does not automatically qualify one to have the expertise to inform the Senate on how Bitcoin works. If only it were that easy. Understanding Bitcoin requires an open, multidisciplinary mind and hours upon hours of research just to begin scratching the surface. Perhaps Kanye West's recent public statement on Bitcoin could have gone a long way for McKenzie and Allen.</p><blockquote><p>"As far as Bitcoin, I'm just not knowledgeable enough to speak on that subject."&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://twitter.com/BTCGandalf/status/1584085032523530241">Kanye West</a></p></blockquote><p>Warren's rapid-fire question and answer session with Allen<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1603873902211522562"> showed Allen nervously reading, verbatim, pre-scripted answers to Warren's questions</a>. McKenzie on the other hand had the discipline to memorize and perform his lines with poise and confidence. If only they each had the expertise required to address the U.S Senate Banking Committee on Bitcoin — a technology that quite literally enables self custody and solves the breaches of trust that the hearing was ostensibly concerned with.</p><p>While Allen, McKenzie and the senators who invited them to testify were eager to perform their anti-technology, anti-free speech propaganda, the rest of the world is capitalizing Bitcoin for energy innovation. Just last week, Japan's<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tepco-to-mine-bitcoin-with-excess-power"> TEPCO announced it is mining Bitcoin with surplus energy</a>. And now Russia is <a href="https://cryptonewsland.com/russia-to-pass-bill-legalizing-bitcoin-btc-mining/">set to pass a bill</a> to legalize Bitcoin mining. Meanwhile, a distinguished U.S. national defense fellow is <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery/status/1594475293275656192">advising the White House on the strategic benefits of Bitcoin</a>.</p><p>Whether the hearings participants realized they were being manipulated by politicians or not, participating in political theater means they are normalizing the loss of privacy rights as they lobby for legislation to limit the right to<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-journey-to-self-custody-bitcoin"> self custody</a> digital property and<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/dids-built-on-bitcoin-fix-the-web"> one's identity</a>. Such action not only empowers governments to enact greater monitoring controls, install social credit systems and strip personal freedoms, but it also exposes consumers to the prying eyes of corporations and any hackers that can infiltrate highly-centralized data. Ironically, such restrictions will empower their<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1552313697736998914"> political opponents</a> when our political pendulums invariably swing in the other direction.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1603084958502903814"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>While those unfamiliar with Bitcoin may believe they are siding with a morally superior government, Satoshi Nakamoto's invention is seen by many as <a href="https://youtu.be/Amcj-IKmGKA?t=949">American technology</a> that<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-the-american-idea"> digitally enshrines personal freedoms afforded to Americans by the Founding Fathers</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, Warren is headed in the opposite direction. She recently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/business/elizabeth-warren-bipartisan-crypto-crackdown/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twCNN&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_content=2022-12-14T11%3A54%3A07">introduced a bipartisan bill</a> with Senator Roger Marshall to aggressively close crypto money laundering loopholes by imposing Orwellian controls on all users. The bill seeks to make self-custody technology illegal — a dangerous policy that would expose Americans to <a href="https://twitter.com/ODELL/status/1603078096097255424">mandated government surveillance</a> and only increase the chances of the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ftx-founder-indicted-fraud-money-laundering-and-campaign-finance-offenses">fraud</a> that FTX committed against its users when funds were rehypothecated and stolen through their custodial platform. Stopping this kind of fraud was what the hearing was supposed to be about and is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-helps-users-avoid-the-downfall-of-ftx">exactly the kind of protection that Bitcoin already empowers through self custody</a>.</p><p>Warren <a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1603033907968049154">argues</a> that “rogue nations, oligarchs and drug lords are using crypto to launder billions, evade sanctions and finance terrorism.” This is <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/articles/bitcoin-wont-save-russia-from-western-sanctions">fear mongering</a>. The reality is that public, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/haileylennon/2021/01/19/the-false-narrative-of-bitcoins-role-in-illicit-activity/">immutable ledgers are too transparent for most crimes</a>. Physical <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cash-still-king-criminals-prefer-cash-for-money-laundering">cash is far better</a>. Firms that do on-chain analysis for law enforcement have <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-Crypto-Crime-Report.html">documented that cryptocurrency usage for criminal activity is rather low</a> and is trending downwards. Warren’s eagerness to make self-custody technology illegal would be like banning the internet because phishing scams exist.</p><blockquote><p>"Regardless, the good news is two-fold: Cryptocurrency-related crime is falling, and it still remains a small part of the overall cryptocurrency economy."&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-Crypto-Crime-Report.html">The Chainalysis 2022 Crypto Crime Report</a></p></blockquote><p>However, this is not to say that crypto doesn’t have a problem with fraud. To Allen and McKenzie's credit, 99.99% of the "crypto" market is indeed scams, and they should be commended for calling them out. Yet, to blindly call Satoshi Nakamoto's invention a scam shows a lack of critical thinking and expertise. To attack Bitcoin — an open, global and neutral economic protocol layer for the internet<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI4xEHI7tGg"> with no issuer</a> and no central control — simply because one does not like it or understand it, shows a lack of humility and unwillingness to recognize<a href="https://hrf.org/why-bitcoin-matters-for-freedom/"> real-world benefits</a> with an open mind.</p><p>If they are willing to engage in thoughtful and meaningful discussion, Professor Allen and Mr. McKenzie would likely find a lot of common ground with members of the Bitcoin community, who<a href="https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1597254469750001664"> commonly criticize the scams</a> as well as the <a href="https://tomerstrolight.medium.com/bitcoiners-are-not-toxic-they-have-integrity-bd866d2773e9">lack of ethics and integrity that pervade the industry</a>. If not, it suggests they have an agenda.</p><p>If the U.S. Senate Banking Committee has any desire to preserve freedoms and keep the United States from falling behind other nations, it would do well to seek out actual experts who <a href="https://youtu.be/eAIR83im8Us">work in Bitcoin mining</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/TpqoJnpzK9g">energy markets</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZpKa1fzEKr4">those who are using its layered payments architecture</a> to build the next generation of commerce. Political theater will only cause the U.S. to fall further behind the rest of the world in all of these areas.</p><p>Alas, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, led by <a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1603033907968049154">Warren’s disdain for technology</a>, seems more interested in preserving the power of big banks and <a href="https://twitter.com/ODELL/status/1603078096097255424">mandating government surveillance</a>. Progressives, such as Warren, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/elizabeth-warren-progressives-should-love-bitcoin">should love Bitcoin</a> as an open payment rail that empowers the freedom of economic expression, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/wealth-gap-black-america-bitcoin">financial inclusion</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/elizabeth-warren-ironic-war-on-bitcoin">circumvents predatory banking practices</a> — something that <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1552313697736998914">progressives might one day find themselves in need of</a>. </p><p>Instead, they appear to be flirting with the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/cbdcs-orwellian-new-world-order">authoritarian playbook of China and its social credit system</a>. Perhaps it’s just as well that the committee was misinformed by its unqualified witnesses, as they now have no idea <a href="https://twitter.com/tatumturnup/status/1605048106848075778">how to stop a technology that manifests itself as free speech</a>. Information wants to be free, a lesson the United States and its misinformed senators will need to learn one way or another.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Level39.

Though I don't agree with its conclusion or reasoning, the fact that traditional outlets were asking questions like that was a massive signal that perhaps the normies are starting to catch on. </p><p>More recently, the Iranian government announced that it would be <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/iran-set-to-freeze-bank-accounts-of-women-who-refuse-to-wear-a-hijab">freezing the bank accounts</a> of women who refuse to wear hijabs, traditional Muslim head covering, in public. This came after the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/11/iran-stop-sentencing-peaceful-protesters-death-say-un-experts">threat of imprisonments and executions</a> in order to quell ongoing protests for the freedom of expression there. As of December 8, 2022, one protester had already been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-first-execution-protests-rcna60703">executed by hanging</a> by the Iranian government. </p><p>The fact is, nobody is going to save you. Ethereum insists on being the new decentralized money of the internet, and yet, the protocol is enforcing Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/ethereum-opac-compliant-blocks-in-decline-after-touching-80/">sanctions</a> on its base layer. It’s becoming pretty clear that Bitcoin is perhaps the only easily-transportable freedom money left. I think this distinction became all the more clear as 2022 continued. </p><h2>The Altcoin Bonanza Goes Down in Flames</h2><blockquote><p>“The same technology that allows for peer-to-peer money has allowed for peer-to-peer scams.”</p><p>–<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2oTSvVlzamB9aG1KvtZU0w?si=-4qKTAbYRNKxp-NibQTuvg">Lyn Alden, “Swan Signal” episode 92</a></p></blockquote><p>From <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a>, to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">Three Arrows Capital</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/lfg-bitcoin-reserves-at-risk">Luna</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy">BlockFi</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/voyager-digital-files-for-bankruptcy">Voyager</a>, and <a href="https://futurism.com/winklevoss-twins-crypto-exchange-halts-withdrawals">even Gemini</a>, companies that deal in altcoins all felt pain in one form or another — Leverage, rehypothecation, algorithmic Ponzi schemes and the like. It seems to be that the biggest use case for crypto is making a quick buck at the expense of others, while rug pulling normies as your exit liquidity. It’s like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">1990s tech boom</a> all over again. </p><p>One of the most interesting parts of this whole debacle were the accusations of a <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ftx-leaked-balance-sheet-visualized/">lack of bitcoin held at FTX</a> after its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2022/12/12/centralized-exchanges-like-sam-bankman-frieds-ftx-arent-needed-for-bitcoin-to-thrive/?sh=69a499f97e90">balance sheet was revealed in bankruptcy filings</a>. Whether or not the accusations are true, the fact that it’s a legitimate question is illuminating. It appears to have sparked a fire. I think, slowly but surely, people are starting to see the difference and realize that Bitcoin and crypto really aren’t the same things after all.</p><h2>The Turning Point Of 2023</h2><p>Bitcoin has differentiated itself not only from the traditional banking system in a meaningful way, but from crypto as well. </p><p>The FTX debacle has highlighted the necessity for self custody: that your coins may not actually exist and the only way to find out if they’re real is to take custody. Bitcoin is now <a href="https://worldnewsera.com/news/finance/stock-market/investors-withdraw-record-levels-of-coins-from-crypto-exchanges/">leaving exchanges</a> in droves.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Could this be a turning point for Bitcoin? Could people be waking up to the importance of self custody en masse? Only time will tell. I am optimistic that this trend will continue, taking the power from centralized exchanges and their ability to enforce censorship on behalf of hostile regimes. As far as I’m concerned, the more bitcoin in self custody, the better. </p><p>If you’re still hesitant to take self custody I recommend watching some <a href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UChzLnWVsl3puKQwc5PoO6Zg">BTC Sessions</a> demonstrations. It’s really not that difficult and the peace of mind is priceless. I nearly <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/multisignature-for-the-nontechnical-bitcoiner">lost everything</a> earlier this year when Celsius blew up. Don’t be like me. Stop procrastinating and take possession of your bitcoin today. Only then will you truly understand why and how it’s different. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

As <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/brazil-approves-use-of-bitcoin-as-payment">previously reported</a>, the new rules recognize bitcoin as a digital representation of value that can be used as a means of payment and as an investment asset in the South American nation.</p><p>A virtual asset is "a digital representation of value that can be negotiated or transferred electronically and used for payments or as an investment," per the bill’s text.</p><p>The new law, which goes into effect 180 days after today’s signature, does not make bitcoin or any cryptocurrency a legal tender in the country. Notwithstanding, the legitimacy conferred upon BTC’s use case as payment is meaningful, and has the potential to spur greater activity in the country. The extent to which that happens, however, is dependent on the actions of the regulator in charge.</p><p>The executive branch will select the government bodies that will oversee the market. The expectation is that the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) will be in charge when bitcoin is used as payment, while the country’s securities and exchange commission (CVM) will be the watchdog when it is used as an investment asset. Both the BCB and the CVM, along with the federal tax authority (RFB), helped lawmakers craft the overhaul legislation.</p><p>If the BCB gets confirmed as the sector’s watchdog, the outlook isn’t the best. While the regulator can’t override the aforementioned definition of a virtual asset determined by the law, there is little reason to believe that the BCB will go out of its way to push greater adoption of bitcoin as payment. Its President Roberto Campos Neto has said multiple times that he doesn’t see cryptocurrencies as a great alternative to fiat payments, citing mainly volatility. More importantly, the BCB is working to release its own digital currency, the Real Digital, which is currently planned to go live by 2024.</p><p>But the greater regulatory clarity given by the legislation encourages businesses to explore the burgeoning payment method more closely. This, in turn, can translate into more widespread adoption of bitcoin as a medium of exchange in Brazil, irrespective of whether an active endorsement by the BCB comes or not.</p><p><br><em>Read a detailed breakdown of the legislation </em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/heres-whats-in-brazils-crypto-bill"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MTAxMTcwMzk2OTk3Mjk3/26812213289_f460d63e07_k.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[CoinCorner Partners With Pouch To Bring Instant Remittance Payments To The Philippines Utilizing Bitcoin's Lightning Network]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Philippines’ remittance market now has a faster, cheaper option through the use of the Lightning Network.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/coincorner-pouch-bring-send-globally-to-philippines</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/coincorner-pouch-bring-send-globally-to-philippines</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Philippines]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[CoinCorner]]></category><category><![CDATA[Remittances]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxOTg4NDM3NTk3ODg5OTkx/20220830_better-the-four-pillars-of-bitcoin-adoption---stefan-ristic.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The Philippines’ remittance market now has a faster, cheaper option through the use of the Lightning Network.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Customers in the U.K. and Europe can now use CoinCorner’s Send Globally feature to transfer funds to the Philippines after partnering with Pouch, a Lightning service provider based in the Southeast Asian country.</p><p>Send Globally utilizes the Lightning Network to convert one fiat currency into bitcoin, which is then sent over the Lightning Network to a receiving entity which converts the bitcoin into another fiat currency, effectively making global payments instant. <br><br>Send Globally was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-enables-instant-fiat-transfers-to-africa">recently</a> enacted for both <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-enables-instant-fiat-transfers-to-africa">CoinCorner</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/strike-launches-instant-african-remittances">Strike</a> through partnerships with Bitnob.

This simultaneously introduced a new mixing tool as well as the first wallet to implement a new second-layer scaling solution. The team built off of Ruben Somsen's original statechain proposal with some changes to make it work without the needed <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-sighash-anyprevout-and-eltoo-could-improve-the-lightning-network">ANYPREVOUT/Eltoo sighash flag</a>, and integrated a new CoinSwap design to allow users to mix multiple times without needing to transact on chain for each mix. </p><h2>Background</h2><p>To just quickly summarize for those who didn't read my previous piece: a statechain is an off-chain mechanism for transferring freely between anyone completely off-chain. The original owner/user collaborates with a statechain operator to construct a ECDSA-MPC address where the private key is sharded with one half held by the user and the other half by the operator, then a timelocked, pre-signed withdrawal transaction is created and signed, with the operator before sending funds to the new address. </p><p>Neither side fully controls the private key, and the user has a pre-signed transaction that allows them to unilaterally take the coins back after the timelock. When the user wishes to transfer the statechain, they notify the operator who then collaborates with the receiver. The receiver and operator generate a new set of private key shares that correspond with the same address, and generate a new pre-signed transaction with a lower timelock than the last one, and then the operator deletes their old keyshare. </p><p>The way the cryptography works, the operator's new keyshare will only work with the new user's keyshare, so if they delete the old one, it is not even possible for them to collaborate with the old user to spend the coins. Also, with the newer withdrawal transaction having a lower timelock, that transaction can always be confirmed before the prior owner's. This limits the number of times the statechain can be transferred before it has to be closed, but if the operator acts honestly, this prevents older owners from stealing funds. </p><h2>A Lightning Channel On Top of A Statechain</h2><p>Commerceblock is now working on a <a href="https://github.com/commerceblock/blip-XXXX/blob/main/blip-XXXX.md">new BLIP</a> (Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal) to implement a design for something proposed in Somsen’s initial statechain proposal: establishing a Lightning channel on top of a statechain.</p><p>One of the shortcomings of a statechain by itself is that the entire UTXO has to be transferred at once. If, however, the statechain withdrawal transaction spends into a Lightning channel instead of a single user's address, then fractions of the statechain can be transferred through the initial balance distribution in a channel and that channel can be used conventionally to make Lightning payments afterward. </p><p>The process first begins with a user creating a statechain. The creator and operator go through the normal process of creating the sharded key and signing a backup withdrawal transaction with a timelock, then the creator (Alice) finds a counterparty (Bob) that will accept statechains. Alice and Bob engage in the same protocol used to create a sharded key that Alice did with the statechain operator and generate their own shared key. Both of them then share both the cumulative public key and their individual public key shares to the statechain operator. This allows the operator to challenge both of them to individually sign and prove that they agree on the current balance for cooperative closes without waiting for the statechain withdrawal timelock to expire. </p><p>From here, with Bob's authorization, Alice and the statechain operator sign a transaction directly spending the statechain into the Lightning channel multisig and handle the Lightning channel transaction creation. At this point, the statechain address is still controlled by just Alice and the operator but the transaction opening a Lightning channel is now in Bob's possession with a lower timelock than the original statechain withdrawal, guaranteeing it can be confirmed before Alice can unilaterally close the statechain to herself. Then Alice and Bob finalize the protocol by completing one last update with the statechain entity, creating a final statechain transaction with a further decremented timelock using their combined key with the operator's to make a withdrawal transaction that spends the funds to the Lightning channel. They can both now advertise the Lightning channel as open and the protocol is complete.</p><h2>Improving The Utility Of Statechains</h2><p>This proposal would greatly improve the utility of a statechain by loosening the strict liquidity dynamics of how they work. Whenever someone would be willing to accept a statechain but the denomination doesn't match the payment, the sender can simply open a Lightning channel between them instead and wait until they need to spend the rest of the funds (or wind up receiving what they sent back) to finalize a transfer of the entire statechain balance. Such a possibility not only increases the utility of a statechain, but also increases the utility of the Lightning Network if properly supported. </p><p>Channel rebalancing is a necessity for nodes on the network, both routing nodes as well as edge nodes simply sending and receiving transactions. When funds flow completely to one side of a channel, it makes the channel useless for passing payments in one direction (if all of the money is on your side, then you can't receive payments; if it's on the other side, then you can't send payments). This necessitates shuffling money from one channel to another, which also contributes to unbalancing the channels along the way to rebalance your own. Eventually this dynamic gets to a point where things must actually be rebalanced by swapping funds between Lightning and the base layer on-chain. </p><p>Statechains allow liquidity to be moved around with the same freedom provided by doing so on-chain, without needing to create the on-chain footprint or pay fees for it. Say you have a depleted channel, with all of the liquidity on the other side leaving you, no spending capacity and you also have a statechain. That statechain can be freely transferred to anyone who will accept it, and it can even have a Lightning channel on top of it if you aren't sending the entire value, and it can be used to rebalance funds in your regular channel on your side. </p><p>This allows for much more efficiency in terms of how many channels you have to route through in order to rebalance your channel (remember, you are contributing to shifting the balances of every other channel you route through), in the best case literally sending it directly to the same peer that you have the channel that you are rebalancing open with. If you wish to close a channel with one peer and open it with another, you can even rebalance things so you have all of the balance of the channel and move it entirely off-chain to the new peer if it is built on top of a statechain. </p><h2>The Future Of Statechains And Lightning</h2><p>Discussing their plans going forward, Nicolas Gregory from Commerceblock said: "Our goal is to establish a standardized approach for combining statechains and Lightning technology in order to facilitate off-chain balancing of Lightning channels through the use of state channels. This specification will serve as the foundation for achieving this objective." </p><p>From the very beginning, statechains were always proposed to interact with Lightning in order to solve the issue of using them by themselves: that you must transfer the entire value of the whole UTXO. They also provide a degree of flexibility to Lightning that it does not have on its own in terms of how liquidity is managed and transferred around the network. </p><p>Now that Lightning is at a healthy stage in its early growth, and a concrete implementation of statechains has existed for over a year, it's time to start considering how these two technologies can interact together. Lightning as a network is a system for atomically-escrowing transfers between two parties that are not directly connected on the network graph. How each connection on that graph works, strictly speaking, should not matter to senders and receivers of payments, as long as it works. </p><p>Statechains and Lightning channels both have a lot to offer each other in terms of benefits, all that needs to be done is to work out standardizing the two interacting with each other. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shinobi.

I will use specific people’s quotes for my examples, but my intent is to respectfully challenge ideas, not attack people. Healthy debate of ideas in good faith helps Bitcoin, so I hope they understand.</em></p><p>In Gigi’s article, “<a href="https://dergigi.com/2021/12/30/the-freedom-of-value/">The Freedom of Value</a>,” he breaks down what’s broken with the monetization of information, “The problem with the internet is that information wants to be free.”</p><p>As a content creator, in my case a writer, this problem with the internet hits home. It’s a lot of work to write good content, and I don’t work for free. I look to be compensated for my proof-of-work. As the Joker says, “If you’re good at something, never do it for free.”</p><p>Gigi breaks down the problem of just trying to sell information (like a written book/article) behind a paywall into two distinct reasons, the “MTX problem” (Mental Transaction problem) and the “DRM paradox” (Digital Rights Management paradox).</p><p>I acknowledge the “DRM paradox” has no solution: “content will only stay locked behind paywalls if it sucks. If it's good, it will be set free.”</p><p>Additionally, Gigi explains: “The MTX problem, with MTX being short for ‘mental transaction,’ refers to the problem of irreducible mental transaction costs inherent to every transaction. Every time you hit a paywall, you have to make a conscious decision: ‘Do I want to pay for that?’”</p><p>Since Gigi “believe[s] that the MTX problem is a bigger deal than the DRM paradox,” that will be the focus of this article. Gigi acknowledges the traditional solution to spare the consumer of the headache of mental transactions is the subscription model, but then so many different subscriptions are needed for exclusive content that it becomes impractical again.</p><p>With an open mind, willing to see not just black and white but entertain shades of gray, please consider how lightning microtransactions, deployed the right way, can work towards solving the mental transaction problem. As <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/micropayments.html">Nick Szabo</a> states:</p><p>“A micropayments system assumes a solution to the mental accounting problem. If somebody could actually solve this problem … the savings would be enormous even in existing business ... not to mention all the new possibilities possible by lower transaction costs.”</p><p>To begin, why do people enjoy just outright buying a book? <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf">Nick Szabo</a> answers this concisely: “A flat fee constitutes an embedded, implicit insurance contract.”</p><p>When I offer my ebook at a flat price, the reader is safe. They know they own it and can read it at their leisure. However, this flat price creates a barrier to entry. It becomes all-or-nothing if they want to read the ebook. But if I break this barrier into pieces, and make each chapter a mini paywall pay-per-click lightning transaction, then the reader only pays for what they enjoy! </p><p>Enter: the pay-as-you-enjoy model. If the reader enjoys the chapter, they can pay-per-click to read the next one, and the next one. If they’re done reading before having reached the end, they’ll have spared themselves from having to pay to read the whole book. It wasn’t all-or-nothing!</p><p>Through pay-as-you-enjoy, the reader loses the insurance that I won’t increase the cost per chapter as they continue to read through the book over time, but hold onto that thought for a bit.</p><p>Nick Szabo points out the flaws of the pay-per-click monetization model: “There has been floating for a while the idea of ‘pay per click,’ a micropayment for every click on the Web to pay its owner for content. However, since there has been no chance to browse the content, there is no way to directly ascertain whether it meets tacit preferences: there is no accurate customer observable explicit preference. Browsing a preview or book cover is still inaccurate, and entails increasing mental costs the more accurate it is.”</p><p>Again, I’m building towards a solution to the mental transaction problem. “Attribute observation costs” are still present, and that’s ok. There’s no attribute observation cost in Value4Value because the reader can keep reading without paying anything at all. No cost per click. Even still, Value4Value confronts the same final problem that pay-as-you-enjoy tackles head-on. As Nick Szabo concludes:</p><p>“Assuming, for the moment, perfect information on the product at hand, and no uncertainty as to future cash flows, a third and more basic source of customer cognitive cost remains, namely the cost of making decisions with a large, but nevertheless very incomplete, set of alternatives.”</p><p>Even if the reader already knew everything about the content, and knew for sure their budget, how can they know for certain they should spend their money on this instead of something else?</p><p>In practice, consumers just make decisions because they have to. The mental transaction problem persists because they’re either deciding whether to give value back once they’ve finished reading, or they’re freed of this because they’ve already spent the money to read the work in the first place. </p><p>Value4Value is just delaying the mental transaction problem until after the reader has finished reading. As <a href="https://value4value.info/pieces/the-ask/">Adam Curry</a> explains, “<em>The Ask</em> is the most important piece of the puzzle. The #1 reason why people do not give to charities and the like is because they weren’t asked, and the same is true for the Value4Value model.”</p><p>Since part of the Value4Value loop is “The Ask,” it hasn’t fixed the “costly decision making” piece of the Mental Transaction Problem. Versus pay-as-you-enjoy, my readers can finish reading and feel good that they’ve paid a price I felt was fair, rather than wrestle internally on who to support.</p><p>In fact, with lightning, I think we’ve come close to solving the intelligent agent problem <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/micropayments.html">Nick Szabo</a> describes:</p><p>“There seems here to be a fundamental cognitive bottleneck. One proposed solution to this has been "intelligent agents". But since these agents are programmed remotely, not by the consumer, it is difficult for the consumer to determine whether the agent is acting the consumers' best interests, or in the best interests of the counterparty -- perhaps, necessarily, at least as difficult as reading the corresponding full statement of charges. Furthermore, the user interface to enable consumers to simply express their sophisticated preferences to an agent is lacking, and may represent another fundamental cognitive bottleneck.”</p><p>Nick describes an “intelligent agent” as someone the consumer delegates to make purchases on their behalf - sparing them the headache - but then they still have to explain to the agent what they enjoy. As part of pay-as-you-enjoy, once the consumer sets up their budget (their “flat fee” insurance mentioned above), they are free to engage in pay-per-click reading without worry about overspending! This agent which deducts sats per click is not programmed remotely, but by the consumer. Moreover, the consumer sees the author’s monetary policy up front when they set their budget. They know the price per chapter, but also how much to spend to get one month of free access - an incentive to give the author what they see as the full value for their work! The pay-as-you-enjoy user interface is slick. The consumer sets their budget and then it’s pay-per-click!</p><p>Nick Szabo summarizes the MTX problem as the following:</p><p>“We have seen how customer mental transaction costs can derive from at least three sources: uncertain cash flows, incomplete and costly observation of product attributes, and incomplete and costly decision making. These costs will increasingly dominate the technological costs of payment systems, setting a limit on the granularity of bundling and pricing. Prices don't come for free.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In the table above, they are tied.

Integrity over revenue," Youssef said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/raypaxful/status/1605529289054527488">tweet</a>, calling on fellow exchange runners to follow suit.</p><p>A screenshot of Youssef’s statement to clients accompanied the tweet. The text provided more details as to why the CEO chose to remove ETH from his P2P exchange. Youssef mentioned three overarching reasons for kicking Ethereum out: its move to proof-of-stake (PoS), a lack of decentralization, and the ever-growing dissemination of scams in its ecosystem.</p><p>Ethereum will be officially off the platform by 12:00 UTC, December 22. Paxful will maintain stablecoins up for trades, however, as Youssef claimed they have "real use cases."</p><p>Youssef argued that PoW is the innovation in Bitcoin and what enables it to be "the <em>only</em> honest money there is." The consensus mechanism that is often touted as an alternative to PoW, PoS, "has rendered ETH essentially a digital form of fiat," the executive added.</p><p>Next, the CEO of Paxful delved into the decentralization aspect of Ethereum, denouncing the small group of insiders who manage to exert enormous influence on the cryptocurrency project to this day.</p><p>Finally, Youssef explained that while "ETH had some utility on real use cases, such as credit and lending," it "thrives because of tokenization." Such a reality, he continued, has led to "scams that have robbed people of billions."</p><p>"They have stolen valuable momentum away from Bitcoin and cost us years on our mission."</p><p>"In short, our industry is under attack right now –– which means our responsibility to protect our users is greater than ever before," Youssef said in the statement. "We are not perfect, but we’ll always do the right thing, even if it’s not popular, and even if it costs us money. The pay off for all humanity will be so great that the billions scammers have stolen via tokens will seem like pennies in comparison."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3NzkxOTgxMTM1NTU1/paxful-announcement.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Remnant Returns: Bitcoin Is Right]]></title><description><![CDATA[Virtue signaling and altruistic positions on Bitcoin are a farce.

Choose Bitcoin because it’s right, not because you’re here to “help others.”</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Aleks Svetski, author of “</em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B837FN63"><em>The UnCommunist Manifesto</em></a><em>,” founder of The Bitcoin Times and Host of the “Wake Up Podcast with Svetski.” It is part four of his “</em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/the-remnant"><em>Remnant Series</em></a><em>.”</em></p><p>I grew up as an extreme empath. But the last few years have radicalized me and made me cold, dissociated and distant toward much of the world and its hordes of mindless inhabitants.</p><p>I traveled to 20 countries during 2020 to 2022, and no matter where I went, I was surrounded by compliant lemmings who either lacked the intelligence to recognize blatant lies, or the courage to call them out, or who were simply devoid of the dignity necessary to stand up for what is true and self-evident.</p><p>What’re more, I have seen a growing number of these creatures simply abdicate all responsibility and fill this vacuum with an ever-increasing diet of sludge for the mind (like Netflix, CNBC, Disney and Facebook), body (sugar water, seed oils, sunscreen and injection subscriptions) and soul (Scientism, Communism, Reddit Atheism and Moral Relativism).</p><p>It’s as disgusting as it is pathetic.</p><p>It is everything that our ancestors hoped we as humans would not become. Rivers of blood were literally spilled by those who came before us in order to build civilization from the soil of the earth itself. It is now being consumed by mindless zombies roaming around aimlessly, virtue signaling about their medical compliance paperwork, their gender dysphoria and their nihilism.</p><p>There is no more dignity in the mind, body or soul of the mindless masses. There is only emptiness. The <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=NPC">NPC</a> is real, and <em>it</em> is everywhere.</p><p>As such, I am no longer under the illusion that I am in Bitcoin for “the good of the masses.” No. Fuck that.</p><p>I do not care about the masses. I am in Bitcoin because it is right. Because it is just. Because it is sound. Because it is true.</p><p>I am in Bitcoin because it is the best thing I can do for me and my family and it is what any self-respecting individual would do. A dignified individual would not degrade themselves to the level of modern serf by trading the product of their blood, sweat, time and tears for digital Monopoly money issued by parasites.</p><p>It’s an absolutely ridiculous state of affairs that both our ancestors and forebears will be embarrassed by.</p><p>I doubt anyone with a sense of self would go and work all week at a cafe only to be paid in coffee grounds, or build a business only to sell products and services for mere hugs and high fives. </p><p>If you’re not accepting or demanding payment in bitcoin, or at least swapping out your surplus toilet paper money in exchange for bitcoin savings, then I don’t know what you’re doing.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Fair</h2><p>I am in Bitcoin because it is fair, and I want to play a fair game because it’s the <em>only</em> way to truly satisfy my soul. My pursuit in life is to become the best version of myself and to do so requires that I contend with my opponents on a battlefield with transparent rules of engagement.</p><p>To become better, I must play a fair game, not some rigged stupidity where I “win” because the other guy had his hands tied behind his back. There is neither honor nor dignity in that. One does not get better nor advance by cheating. That’s what the plutocrats and parasites do not understand, that’s why they are inferior, and that’s why they will forever be bitter and envious of the natural elite.</p><p>The parasites who run the central banking and planning offices of the globalist cabals are not “elite.”</p><p>They are pathetic worms who cannot compete, so they spend their entire lives cheating. The price they pay for winning a fake prize is a soulless existence, and cheap, frivolous obedience from the mindless masses.</p><p>They earn no respect or reverence from those who count, and they will go to their graves hated and irrelevant. Imagine living a life as pathetic as that: To be literally hated by anyone that matters, and obeyed by everyone who doesn’t matter. It’s quite sad, actually.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is For Anyone, But For Everyone</h2><p>Much to the chagrin of many of the egalitarian ilk of Bitcoiners, I do not believe that Bitcoin will “help” the masses of the world in the short term, nor is it likely to do so in the medium term. </p><p>The world is likely to continue to bifurcate in the coming decade(s), and largely be defined by the Bitcoiners and no-coiners (which includes shitcoiners and fiat maxis). Of course there will be sub-categories, and we always have the third class, known as parasites, as described in parts one and three of this Remnant Series, but for simplicity, let’s just think about it as the following image:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDY3NDM1NTQ0MzIzNzYx/freedom-vs-slavery.png" height="621" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The latter, the no-coiners, are the masses, and if anything, they will walk right into their central bank digital currency (CBDC) gulags with smiles on their faces (which won’t be visible behind their three-layer face diapers), and the continued monetisation of Bitcoin will actually <em>impoverish</em> them, relatively speaking.</p><p>The purchasing power of their fake money, coupled with the continued deterioration of their health and their productivity will mean that, in comparison to bitcoin-denominated strongholds, filled with healthy, strong, dignified and productive people, their relative wealth will crater.</p><p>They are categorically fucked, along with their parasitic overlords who they blindly worship. </p><p>And rightly so. I’m here for it. There is nothing more moral than a fair game, with just consequences borne by the actors themselves. You want to walk into the lava? By all means do so, but it’s <em>you</em> who burns. I won’t be jumping in to save you. In fact, I won’t even know, because I’ll be too busy building the walls around my citadel to keep your dumb ass out.</p><p>Bitcoin is the come-to-Jesus moment for all of humanity and mark my words: </p><p><em>In the short term, it will hurt more people than it helps, but in the long run, it will save us all.</em></p><p>Bitcoin is the long-term cure for a cancerous civilization that is eating itself alive. Every short-term opium hit that was injected to help obfuscate reality has led us down this path, step by step. We have weakened the corpus of humanity through this short-termism. Bitcoin changes this and will wreak havoc in the immediate future, in exchange for a much brighter, fairer and truer long-term future.</p><h2>But Aleks, Why Are You Such An Asshole?</h2><p>I’m not here to bring you sunshine and roses, or blow smoke up your butthole. There are British podcasters available for such deeds. </p><p>I’m here to preach <em>reality</em>.</p><p>I seek not to be a preacher for the masses, <em>but for the Remnant.</em> Despite my inherent empathy, I no longer care for the welfare of those who have neither the respect, courage nor dignity to care for it themselves.</p><p>I will help those who choose to help themselves first, but I will not be a martyr for the masses. I will not jump into the lava to save the lemmings. I will no longer sacrifice my time helping the unhelpable, when I could be using it to provide for my wife, my family and those who have first sought to help themselves.</p><p>I’m in Bitcoin for me, for those I love and, most importantly, because it is <em>right</em>.</p><p>Believe it or not, <em>you</em> are in it for the same reasons. You’re most likely just ashamed of admitting it, so you sugarcoat your own naturally-selfish, honorable desire with some fake, politically correct “crusade for the unfortunate.”</p><p>Please. Stop bullshitting me. I can see right through you.</p><p>The only people wanting to “altruistically” help others are either wolves in sheeps’ clothing, liars or the do-gooders who put their noses in everyone’s business. You know, that loser you didn’t invite or ask for an opinion, but who came to your house to tell you how you should run it. People like Bill Gates, Yuval Harari or Sam Harris. The kinds of walking turd most likely to become a Statist, Communist, intellectual or bureaucrat.</p><p>They project their own inadequacies on the rest of the world and proceed to push their flavor of “help” onto everyone under the often naively-believed guise of “helping the disadvantaged.”</p><p>I do not subscribe to such frauds. </p><p>A human with dignity helps himself and his family first. He extends that if it makes sense, but he does <em>not</em> impose that help. He does not meddle, and he leaves space for others to rise up of their own accord.</p><p>Only responsibility can fix the world, and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-responsibility-go-up-technology">Bitcoin is responsibility go up technology</a>. There is no more important force in the world today, and long term it will help everyone at the short-term cost of the comfortable, complacent life of many.</p><h2>Fitness Equals Rightness</h2><p>That which is right is that which fits.</p><p>This is the essence of fitness, and in my opinion, morality. Morality is doing the “right thing.” That which most fits and is of the greatest good for the most impacted. The golden thread, so to speak.</p><p>To me, this is “why Bitcoin.” It is the most right and fit money. There is no better money than one which respects and adheres to the conservation of energy and the direction of time.</p><p>This will have monumental consequences on civilization, and as I said, long term, it will help everyone by leveling the playing field and thus creating a realm in which people orient toward noble competition and cooperation rather than cheating in order to get ahead. People must orient toward responsibility in order to succeed on a Bitcoin standard, and for many, this will be painful.</p><p>But it’s necessary, because it’s right. And this is what I implore you to understand. Come to Bitcoin and embrace it, not for some altruistic, politically-correct notion of “I want to help the masses,” because that’s bullshit and deep down you know it.</p><p>Come to Bitcoin because it’s right. It’s the dignified individual’s choice. It’s your greatest advantage and the highest truth you will discover on your path through life.</p><p>You can be unapologetically honest and truthful, or a politely confused altruist and liar. The former will earn you respect, from your own self first, then everyone else. The latter will make you a simp, without dignity, always degrading yourself for some cause.</p><p>Ignore me, or allow these seeds to take root. The choice is yours.</p><p>Only remember…</p><p>Bitcoin will help those mostly who can help themselves. Bitcoin is just, fair and true. Bitcoin is right</p><p>The Remnant knows this. That’s why they love Bitcoin, and that’s why they are true Bitcoiners.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Aleks Svetski, author “The UnCommunist Manifesto” and founder of The Bitcoin Times.

Nor do I like just shoveling out a few extra billions and billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air. So I think I should say modestly that I think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization. And I’ll leave the criticism to others.” — <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffett-and-munger-on-bitcoin-213317653.html">Charlie Munger</a></p></blockquote><p>It’s time we condense into a couple of bullet points some of the ways in which bitcoin will likely contribute to civilization. For some of its contributions have by now become apparent. Afterwards, we’ll analyze Munger’s arguments. So, to start off, bitcoin:</p><ol><li>Reduces administrative bloat. By making the ledger public, much of the work needed to verify and audit wealth transfers is obliterated.</li><li>Cheaply transfers large sums of wealth across the globe.</li><li>Can potentially work like a treasury bond but delivering higher yield returns. This is because the real return on bonds is always lower than the nominal expectation, due to inflation.</li><li>Will increasingly function as a secure store of wealth or even as a savings account, as its market capitalization grows and its volatility decreases. Both the colossal amount of computing power that already powers Bitcoin, and the manner in which this computing power is distributed across several jurisdictions, ensure that Bitcoin’s network and therefore ledger is incorruptible.</li></ol><p>The contribution to civilization is expected to be so significant that gold and treasury bonds should gradually become obsolete, as bitcoin’s adoption rate increases. So bitcoin is indeed merely another financial product, or asset, at the moment, but assuming its adoption keeps growing, it will gradually replace older, less efficient, and ultimately more expensive financial products and assets. Bitcoin is real financial engineering that stores work-energy flows from energy production sites right into an incorruptible and irreproducible digital asset. As Michael Saylor elucidates, bitcoin is thermodynamically-sound monetary energy.</p><p>Let’s now dissect Munger’s arguments:</p><p>Munger: “Nor do I like just shoveling out a few extra billions and billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air.”</p><p>It is an interesting point, at least psychologically, but if we consider that every worthwhile invention started “out of thin air,” as an idea inside someone’s brain, we realize that it holds no ground. To give an example, the Wright brothers had first to imagine an airplane in their minds, “out of thin air,” as Munger says, before getting down to actually building it. Moreover, those billions and billions of dollars are not exactly going to the creator of bitcoin. Whoever buys bitcoin is in effect buying a piece of the Bitcoin network, i.e., a piece of finite blockchain property, and that piece will belong to the buyer and only the buyer as soon as he acquires it. The earlier adopters become wealthier as a side-effect of a growing adoption of the asset, but the positive civilizational event here is the radical optimization of wealth flows, as summarized above.</p><p>If Munger perhaps meant that one bitcoin can be easily created, or replicated, then that’s not true either. It costs, by design, a significant amount of energy to mine (i.e., to create) a single bitcoin. The side effect of this mining mechanic is that it incentivizes us to put to use lots of waste energy and also to repurpose power infrastructure. This is of course another excellent contribution to civilization.<br><br></p><p>Munger: “I hate the bitcoin success and I don’t welcome a currency that’s useful to kidnappers and extortionists.”</p><p>The thing with this line of reasoning is that it is equivalent to saying “I hate the success of knives and I don’t welcome a tool that’s useful to criminals.” But what if I told you that you can cut food, skin animals and help build an entire civilization with knives? Or like saying: “I hate fire because there are pyromaniacs.” But what if I told you that the “invention” of fire was practically the point at which human beings diverged from mere animals?</p><p>Not to mention that the moment regulation is tightened, criminals using bitcoin won’t be very bright: the ledger is public, and all transactions are tracked. As regulation and <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/2021/01/12/new-crypto-rules-in-the-eu-gateway-for-mass-adoption-or-excessive-regulation/">AML/KYC rules</a> start being enforced (on exchanges, and perhaps even on wallets), criminality driven by blockchain tech should gradually vanish. Good old plain cash, i.e. physical cash, is way more difficult to track. Why would a drug dealer, for example, accept bitcoin in his regulated, IRS-tracked wallet? Under such a regulatory scenario, in which the anonymity of bitcoin holders is non-existent to authorities, criminal activity driven by bitcoin transactions would hardly survive.</p><p>Sure, the criminals might create their own black-market of wallets and marketplaces, but as soon as a criminal wallet connected with a regulated, IRS-tracked wallet, it would sound an alarm. The “digital asset black-market” would consequently short-circuit itself from the economy–the criminal wouldn’t be able to use the wealth in his criminal wallet on anything other than untracked, criminal goods and services. Whereas now, the money, i.e. the physical cash, the criminal makes on the black-market can flow back into supermarkets, bars, restaurants, etc. and the criminal can effectively make a living out of crime.</p><p>In fact, the smartest anarchists are against bitcoin’s wide adoption, too, because they recognize it can lead to a society where your every move is tracked. So it follows that criminals, too, should be against it. If bitcoin works at the moment for them, this is because we are still early in its adoption and there is practically no regulation. After all, we are talking about replacing your physical, untracked wallet, with a digital, tracked wallet. How could crime prosper under these circumstances? Only through extremely organized crime and/or with government help.</p><p>When the first airplane the Wright brothers built crashed, there were guys laughing at the brothers.

    </figure><p>For most of us, walking the path of our individual Bitcoin journey has changed us in profound ways. We look more toward the future by improving our health, creating closer connections with those we care about (or reconnecting with them), and engaging in activities that represent our Bitcoin values. If you are looking for an activity that embodies these values in a single weird and wonderful place look no further than pickleball, the Bitcoin of sports.</p><p>If you just said, “What the heck is pickleball?” you are in the right place. Allow me to help you take your first steps down the pickleball rabbit hole and take you from no-pickler to new-pickler. If you already play, then this article might help you better understand why the sport feels like such a natural extension of who we are as Bitcoiners.</p><h2>Origin Story</h2><p>Like Bitcoin, pickleball combines existing equipment (technologies) from other sports and puts them together in a completely new way to create something entirely different. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickleball">Pickleball</a> was created in 1965 by Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell and Barney McCallum in Bainbridge Island, Washington. The three dads were trying to find something fun for their families to do during a summer vacation. They didn’t have a complete set of sports equipment available, so instead they took the best parts of what they had and collaborated with the kids to develop the rules for the game so that everyone would want to play (consensus mechanism).</p><p>Pickleball combines solid paddles like in paddle ball or ping pong, but in a size and shape more like racquetball racquets. It uses a net from badminton lowered to hip level like in tennis. The ball is plastic, much like the ones you might have used to play backyard baseball as a kid. The court is adapted from badminton, and the rules pull from multiple racquet sports and volleyball.</p><p>Even the name of the sport is shrouded in a bit of mystery, with Joan Pritchard saying they named it pickleball after the pickle boat in crew (the last boat to finish a race) because the oarsmen for the pickle boat are often chosen from the leftovers of other boats. Others believe the sport was named after the family dog, Pickles, who would dutifully retrieve the ball when it rolled off the court, although the Pritchards claim the dog came after and they named the dog after the sport (USA Pickleball).</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Low Time Preference</h2><p>One of the most valuable lessons Bitcoin teaches us is to prioritize the future over the present as we distance ourselves from the fiat world. Our time preference lowers, we stop seeking immediate gratification, and we learn the value of patience. Patience also happens to be the fundamental skill in pickleball. Success in pickleball is not about how many winners you can hit, but rather about how many points you don’t lose by making mistakes. Instead of constantly taking aggressive shots (trading), pickleball encourages patience (HODLing) and consistently executing basic shots (DCA) until the right moment arrives when the odds of winning the point are heavily in your favor. And when it does … Smash (BTFD)!</p><p>Even though the vernacular is different, you will find a lot of overlap in the languages of Bitcoin and pickleball. Below is a short sample of phrases that translate between the two. I welcome those of you who are Bitcoiners and picklers to add to the list!</p><div>  </div><h2>Hard To Grok</h2><p>Pickleball is easy to dismiss at first because, like Bitcoin, it is a little different. The rules are a little different, the equipment is a little different, and the people involved are a little different. But, like Bitcoin, once you experience the sport firsthand you realize it isn’t just different … it’s better. More importantly, it is better <em>because</em> it is different, and it is those differences that take new players on that familiar journey from confusion to curiosity to commitment. Players learn that playing good pickleball is counterintuitive to other sports, much like learning the fundamentals of Bitcoin is different from what we are taught about money and economics. At first, you think you should be aggressive, but then you learn to be patient. You think you should attack, but then you learn defending is more powerful. You think it will be easy, but then you learn that mastery can take a lifetime.</p><p>I was introduced to pickleball in late 2015 by Dave Leach (coincidentally, the same year I first heard about Bitcoin). Our sons were in the same Boy Scout troop and had become good friends. Dave tried explaining the game to me one night at a troop meeting. I didn’t really get it. To me, it just sounded like a weird form of mini-tennis. I listened politely and thought it was interesting, but never went out to play and forgot about it. Luckily, he kept encouraging me to give it a try and in early 2016 I went to the courts for the first time. I was instantly hooked. Like experiencing the rush of completing that first peer-to-peer transaction or holding your own keys for the first time, pickleball reels you in by perfectly balancing simplicity and challenge. This turned out to be about two months before I bought my first Bitcoin. Since then, I’ve been able to return Dave’s favor by introducing him to Bitcoin.</p><h2>Accessible And Challenging</h2><p>It doesn’t take much to get started in pickleball; all you need is a paddle, a ball, a court, and another player. With a couple of sessions of basic information and practice, you can go from “I’ve never played pickleball,” to enjoying fun games and holding your own on the court. However, taking the steps to learn the necessary skills to go from capable player to champion can take a lifetime. This is much like when you download a wallet and receive your first bitcoin while holding your own keys. From that moment you are a sovereign Bitcoiner, but taking the next steps to fully understand proper custody, privacy, and succession planning (not to mention economics, philosophy, etc.) can keep you engaged and intellectually challenged forever.</p><p>On your pickleball journey you will find that the biggest strides forward in your game often happen during the passive work you do off the court. After a game, you’ll have an a-ha moment like “I'm popping the ball up because I'm gripping the paddle too tightly near the net,” or, “With each step toward the kitchen, I should lessen my grip pressure by 10%.” The same thing happens to us as Bitcoiners. We make huge strides in our thinking when reading a non-Bitcoin article or having a non-Bitcoin conversation. We hear a news story about the Canadian truckers or about the failing Japanese yen and realize "This is the use case for Bitcoin."</p><h2>Proof-Of-Work</h2><p>Pickleball attracts players from other sports like tennis, ping pong and racquetball. They often arrive with an "I'm new to pickleball and I'm here to fix it," disposition. They assume their years of experience and skill building in other sports will immediately translate into dominance in this apparently easy pickleball thing. They quickly find out, usually by repeatedly losing games to more experienced players, that they must put in the necessary time and work to develop the specific skills and strategies that translate into success in pickleball. To paraphrase Max Keiser, "You don't change pickleball … pickleball changes you." Think it’s easy to be world class in pickleball? Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6MyDfJUTKg">this point</a> and think again.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Dare To Be Different</h2><p>Picklers are used to being snickered at by people that play more established racquet sports like tennis, racquetball, and squash (TradFi). They dismiss us and think “Aww, look at those pickleball players … aren’t they cute? It’s too bad they can’t play a real sport.” Then their courts get repurposed to become pickleball courts and they think “Maybe I should try it.” This is much like when normies think “Aww, look at those Bitcoiners … aren’t they cute? It’s too bad they don’t understand real money.” Then Bitcoin becomes the best performing asset in history, and they think “Maybe I should get some.”</p><p>Much like Bitcoiners proudly wear shirts that say “Rules not rulers'' and “∞/21M”, picklers proudly and unapologetically declare themselves as such by wearing merch with pickleball insider jargon like "Stay out of the kitchen!" and "I might have a dinking problem."</p><p>Pickleball players come from every type of political, religious, and cultural background. Like Bitcoiners, those differences sometimes come out in spirited discussions on and off the court. In the end, these differences are usually overshadowed by the common interest they share and their passion for the sport they love. What they share is more important than where they disagree, and it might even help them appreciate their differences a bit more.</p><section><figure>

    </figure><div><em>View the 2 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-pickleball-embodies-values-of-bitcoin">original article</a></em></div></section><h2>Inclusive</h2><p>Pickleball welcomes anyone and everyone to learn and enjoy the sport. Whether you are young or old, tall or short, rich or poor, walking on your feet or rolling on wheels, pickleball welcomes you and says “You can join this network. You can participate, benefit from, and contribute to this community.”</p><p>Pickleball not only accepts anyone and everyone, but it also encourages players of all types to play together. It is not uncommon to see high level players helping newbies, retirees playing against teenagers (and beating them), and children beating their parents.</p><p>Pickleball is also financially inclusive; it doesn’t take a lot of money to start playing. You can buy a pair of starter paddles for $20-$30. If you can’t afford that, just show up at a local court and I guarantee someone with an extra paddle will loan it to you, teach you the rules, play with you, and invite you back.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Passion</h2><p>There is no passion like that of a Bitcoiner who has fully gone down the rabbit hole, except possibly for someone that has been bitten by the pickleball bug. See if any of this sounds familiar:</p><ul><li>They watch videos, match replays, read articles and listen to anyone that can teach them about the game. </li><li>They constantly tell their friends how the game is fun, challenging and energizing.</li><li>They talk about how their physical, mental and social lives have been improved by the game.</li><li>They travel far and wide to find courts and instruction. Anything to be able to play more and improve.</li><li>They say pickleball is life.</li></ul><p>They play and play and they can’t get enough. You only need to hear the collective groans of 20+ people when the court lights shut off at 10 p.m. to know that pickleball is more than just another form of exercise.</p><h2>Gradually, Then Suddenly</h2><p>Parker Lewis’s perfectly named series has taught us that change happens gradually, then suddenly. Pickleball has grown from summer vacation family pastime to the fastest growing sport in the United States. Tennis courts, roller hockey rinks, and even basketball courts are being converted to pickleball courts everywhere, and demand is moving up and to the right. Multiple professional leagues have been started, with teams recently being formed by major celebrities like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/lebron-james-is-a-pickleball-fan-and-player-now-hes-buying-a-team.html">Lebron James</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-kim-clijsters-join-star-studded-list-of-major-league-pickleball-team-owners/">Tom Brady</a> (Golden). Major networks are starting to pick up coverage of pickleball events, like the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/cbs-celebrity-pickleball-tournament-players-180024484.html">Celebrity Pickleball Challenge</a> that recently aired on CBS (Webb). Venues for incorporating pickleball into other industries are springing up, like <a href="https://chickennpickle.com/">Chicken and Pickle</a> and <a href="https://www.thepicklebar.com/">The Pickle Bar</a>. Pickleball clubs and meetups are starting up everywhere and growing fast. Even Michael Saylor has a court at his house. The FOMO is real.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Community</h2><p>No matter where you are from or where you are, if you meet a fellow pickleball player you often become fast friends. There is simply an understanding among players that if you share a love for pickleball you will likely have enough in common to get along. I have met and played with people from all over the world. Even in situations where we didn’t speak the same language, we could still communicate on the court and have a great time. Like Bitcoiners, pickleball players are givers. They freely give their time, their knowledge, and their help to anyone who wants to learn the game or improve their play.</p><p>One of the things I love most about both the Bitcoin and pickleball communities is that its stars and celebrities are approachable (rules, not rulers). Max Keiser, Cory Klippsten, and Marty Bent will gladly have real conversations with plebs like me at a conference, meetup, or event. Likewise, world class players like Steve Kennedy, Kyle Yates, and Anna Leigh Waters will play pickup games with amateurs like me and shoot the breeze about the latest happenings in the pickleball world.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Luckily, unlike Neo, you don’t have to choose between the orange and the yellow pill. You can take both, and by doing so discover a new world that embraces the same values that make our Bitcoin community so special. You will also find a whole new group of precoiners to potentially orange-pill. So, pick up a paddle and head to a pickleball court near you and remember … stay humble, stack sats and respect the net!</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Pre-Conference Orange Pilling On The Beach</h2><p>For some time now, I’ve been an avid fan of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/alexgladstein">Alex Gladstein</a> and his perception of Bitcoin as a tool for empowering the unprivileged, the exploited and the suppressed. This spring, I gulped down his new book called “<a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/products/check-your-financial-privilege">Check Your Financial Privilege</a>,” and a few weeks later I had the good fortune to visit his organization’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-purpose-at-oslo-freedom-forum">Oslo Freedom Forum</a>. But even though I understood <em>rationally</em> that Bitcoin is a necessity for billions around the world, I never really <em>experienced</em> adoption from this perspective, and never met the very people for whom Bitcoin can be a life preserver. That changed for me a few weeks ago in Ghana.</p><p>Curiously, the most eye-opening thing for me in terms of local Bitcoin adoption wasn’t the conference as such, but rather, it was interactions with ordinary Ghanaians in the city of Accra, most of whom learned about Bitcoin for the first time from us, the conference goers. </p><p>Several other Bitcoiners and I, including Hermann Vivier (the organizer behind the south-African circular economy project Bitcoin Ekasi) visited the local beach a day before the conference began, and spent the whole afternoon discussing Bitcoin with locals. What we found out was that Bitcoin becomes a very real thing once the locals are shown that they can receive value instantly, without any registration, and immediately spend it on airtime via Bitrefill. Whoever we talked to — fishermen, souvenir merchants, taxi drivers, artists — we witnessed the same cognitive process: from disregard and suspicion to excitement, within minutes. All that was required was to showcase a real-life immediate use for Bitcoin, and it all clicked. </p><p>Now, this might sound trivial to some readers, but the fact is that in many places, there is no easy way to conduct digital payments. Western Bitcoiners are mostly used to viewing bitcoin as a long-term store of value — which is, of course, a valuable use case everywhere around the globe — but in many countries, bitcoin serves as an incredible medium of exchange as well. And often, the only thing that is missing is knowledge about the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi/status/1599482511251251200"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi/status/1599686846354554880"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><h2>Bitcoin: The Pan-African Hope</h2><p>One theme that resounded throughout the three-day conference was the notion that Bitcoin can serve as a tool of liberation from the post-colonial systems of control in the form of the IMF, World Bank, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-a-currency-of-decolonization">CFA franc system</a> and similar constraints.</p><p>Gladstein explained in his keynote the precise nature of the debt slavery that most of the African nations find themselves in, with the IMF and World Bank happily lending billions of dollars to dictators, while it’s the citizens who are later forced to repay these debts, even though the loans only served to fill up the personal coffers of the kleptocratic dictators. Gladstein’s talk was based on his <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/imf-world-bank-repress-poor-countries">latest essay for Bitcoin Magazine</a>, where he outlines the frustrating details of the IMF/WB exploitation scheme.</p><p>Africa may very well be the continent most damaged by fiat money. <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fabric/backgrnd.htm">Fourteen countries</a> still have their currency managed by the French government (the CFA franc regime), two countries are currently experiencing inflation near or over 100% (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1220801/inflation-rate-in-africa-by-country/#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%202021,African%20continent%2C%20averaging%2090%20percent.">Zimbabwe and Sudan</a>), <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/10/20/africas-inflation-among-regions-most-urgent-challenges">almost half of the African countries face inflation higher than 10%</a>, and cross-border payments are often expensive or impossible. Many speakers pointed out that Bitcoin is the only viable way out, and the only practical chance for uniting the continent.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The pan-African nature of Bitcoin was touched upon often: in the many talks, panel discussions and off-stage networking — it didn’t really seem to matter which country the particular speaker was from; Bitcoin was generally understood as a pan-African phenomenon. </p><p>On the other hand, the lessons learned from Bitcoin adoption on the African continent are invaluable to Bitcoin itself and its potential for hyperbitcoinization — in Africa, Bitcoin is tested to its very limits: many countries are openly hostile to Bitcoin, the infrastructure of all kinds is often unreliable, people are often lured into bitcoin affinity scams; yet the adoption is following an exponential curve. </p><p>Obi Nwosu of Fedi summed up the perspective of many attendees in his keynote, when he stated that “Africa wins with Bitcoin. And Bitcoin wins with Africa.”</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1600536579340222469"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>A strong theme throughout the conference was the necessity of African Bitcoiners being the ones to build tools for Africa, the reason being that developers from the Western world often have an understandable blind spot for the needs and circumstances of Africans. </p><p>A prime example is this year’s rollout of <a href="https://8333.mobi/">Machankura</a>, a service that makes Lightning Network payments accessible on feature phones. Machankura is being developed by Kgothatso Ngako, a programmer from South Africa, where feature phones are still widespread (as is the case in most other African countries). It’s hard to fathom Machankura being developed and adopted in Europe or the U.S., since people in these regions simply do not have the need to use Lightning on feature phones; but in Africa, it’s a game-changer for millions.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Obstacles On The Road To Africa’s Hyperbitcoinization</h2><p>The exploding Bitcoin adoption in Africa has had its fair share of problems as well. </p><p>First: the infrastructure. As one of the speakers aptly put it: “Every Ghanaian knows — when it rains, the internet goes down.” The good news is that Africans are actively working on alleviating these problems; one of the interesting projects featured at the conference was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-miner-gridless-raises-2-million">Gridless</a>, a bitcoin mining company that leverages stranded energy, such as local hydro power plants that are not connected to the national grid. During the course of the conference, a fresh $2 million investment into Gridless was announced, helping the project expand beyond Kenya, its home country.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1601126305683996673"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>A second obstacle is that scams and exploitative schemes are widespread. A prime example is Worldcoin. Some time ago, the global Bitcoin community was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/25/why-everyone-is-mad-at-sam-altmans-worldcoin/">outraged by this project</a>, which onboards new users via airdropping tokens in exchange for a retina scan. After the initial wave of disapproval, things went quiet and the general impression was that Worldcoin was abandoned. To my surprise, I found out that the project is very much alive and the eye-scanning orbs are being deployed across the African continent. Bitcoiners worldwide have a duty to shine light on such disgusting data-harvesting experiments, and ensure that Africans are well-informed about the difference between Bitcoin and everything else.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/statusquont/status/1604017162615934976"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Third: corporate conquest. It would do no good for the African continent to get rid of the neo-colonial monetary schemes such as the CFA system, only to be replaced with their corporate equivalents. From several discussions, I understand that Binance and other major exchanges are muddying the waters about what it means to actually hold bitcoin, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/binances-cz-does-about-turn-on-crypto-self-custody-99percent-of-peoplewill-end-up-losing-it/ar-AA15ix0Q?li=BBnb7Kz">discouraging newcomers from self custody</a>, and instead promoting exchange accounts as the only option. The other alarming area of a corporate conquest is the widespread reliance on WhatsApp; as one Twitter commenter <a href="https://twitter.com/benji_fernandes/status/1603379200320507912">recently stated</a>, WhatsApp is “Africa’s e-mail.” This should be a reminder that education efforts should focus not only on Vitcoin and self custody, but also on the likes of Signal, encrypted email, password managers, VPNs and other similar tools of digital empowerment.</p><h2>All Eyes On Africa</h2><p>The Africa Bitcoin Conference was hands down one of the most inspiring events I’ve been to. Everyone I met — the entrepreneurs, the human rights activists, the circular community builders, the developers — was full of energy to orange pill the African continent. But their excitement wasn’t naive and didn’t stem from any kind of ideology or heterodox economic school; on the contrary, theirs was a very practical approach. Africa has its fair share of problems, and Bitcoin can help fix them — if we do things correctly.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/femilonge/status/1602210457280024578"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Many speakers throughout the conference reminded us of the crucial ingredient of the Bitcoin revolution: the people. If ordinary people can’t understand and easily use the technology to alleviate their day-to-day problems, Bitcoin won’t get too far. Bitcoin doesn’t need to onboard politicians and central bankers, but rather taxi drivers and street food vendors. Thankfully, there are many grassroots communities emerging on the continent, spearheading the bottom-up adoption of the orange coin. To name just a few, there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi">Bitcoin Ekasi</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_BitcoinMt">Bitcoin Mountain</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CowriesKumi">Bitcoin Cowries</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/VillageBitcoin">Bitcoin Village</a>, <a href="https://exonumia.africa/">Exonumia</a> and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/digioats">DigiOats</a>. And many more are emerging.</p><p>Personally, I can’t wait for another chance to visit a Bitcoin conference on the African continent, the optimism for a better future is simply unmatched. The next upcoming conference seems to be the <a href="https://nigeriabitcoinconference.com/">Nigeria Bitcoin Conference</a>, happening in March. Since Nigeria has one of the most <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/nigeria-looking-to-legalize-bitcoin">orange-pilled populations worldwide</a>, I’m sure it will also be a wild, unforgettable experience.&nbsp;</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iGvYndip3H4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><em>Note: live streams from day two and three of the Africa Bitcoin Conference are available at the </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@africabitcoinconference7037/streams"><em>conference YouTube channel</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>This is a guest post by Josef Tětek.

The company has closed a seed round at launch, raising $3 million in funding.</p><p>Layer 2 Labs co-founder and CEO Paul Sztorc said in a statement sent to Bitcoin Magazine that the firm seeks to "make everyone in the world a Bitcoin user." Sztorc is the author of two Bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs),  BIP 300 and BIP 301, which detail the technical specifications of drivechains. Naturally, drivechains are at the forefront of Layer 2 Labs’ mission.</p><p>"Layer 2 Labs believes that drivechains have the potential to revolutionize the way we use Bitcoin by enabling greater scalability, extensibility, privacy, and flexibility on the network," the company said in a statement. "We believe that drivechains have the potential to kill altcoins, increase Bitcoin adoption, and provide the catalyst for hyperbitcoinization."</p><p>Drivechains define a specific way through which to create Bitcoin sidechains. Sidechains are parallel blockchains to Bitcoin that enable BTC to "flow" between the two networks in a two-way peg. Since bitcoin can’t actually leave the Bitcoin network, sidechains accomplish this task by locking up BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain and representing them in different ways in the sidechain. The goal is that the representation of BTC in the sidechain maintains a 1:1 peg to the actual BTC locked on the Bitcoin network.</p><p>Liquid is perhaps the most popular sidechain in the Bitcoin ecosystem today. Blockstream’s model leverages a federation to handle the on-chain lock-up and withdrawals, as well as sidechain block creations. Drivechains attempt to move away from the federated model in favor of something it deems more decentralized –– Bitcoin’s own miners. </p><p>Under the drivechain model, bitcoin miners also mine sidechain blocks, albeit blindly. That is, the miner doesn’t need to run software for that specific sidechain, while accruing from the value being transacted on that parallel chain. This is because most fees paid on the sidechain go to the bitcoin miners. Ultimately, this also contributes to greater fee revenue in Bitcoin.</p><p><a href="https://www.drivechain.info/">Drivechains</a> allow for nearly any kind of chain to be created and take advantage of the two-way peg. This characteristic could allow for functionality present on any altcoin network to be indirectly ported to Bitcoin. Hence, drivechains –– and sidechains at large –– in some way allow for bitcoin to be used on another chain, with different rules and properties. The benefit is the user would be able to do things with their bitcoin that isn’t possible on the Bitcoin network. The risk is the pegging mechanism.</p><p>Sztorc said the company has three overarching goals. The first, as mentioned, is the desire to further develop and scale drivechains.</p><p>"We have 6 sidechain-designs in development already, including two which are exact clones of Ethereum and zCash (but BTC-only)," he said in a statement. "These allow for immediate global scale, impenetrable easy-to-use privacy, and complete freedom (for users and developers)."</p><p>Second, <a href="http://layer2labs.com/">Layer 2 Labs</a> aims to improve the user experience in Bitcoin, especially around activities necessary for truly self-sovereign bitcoin ownership.</p><p>"We want REAL bitcoin users –– users who run nodes, and hold keys," he added. "This requires a revolution in UX and education... which we aim to bring about. Nodes should be easy to run and do useful things that any layperson can understand and appreciate."</p><p>Finally, Sztorc said the firm plans to work on what he calls "high-risk, high-reward problems."</p><p>"These include prediction markets and a resurrected Namecoin," Sztorc said. "These services will revolutionize media/telecommunications, just as Bitcoin will revolutionize Banking."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNzU0OTcxNDk3MTEzMjUx/20220819_best-sidechain-recap---shinobi.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[This Is The Best Time For Bitcoin Mining Opportunities]]></title><description><![CDATA[With the price of bitcoin being so down, opportunities abound for bitcoin mining operations with structured cash and efficient operations.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/best-time-for-bitcoin-mining-opportunities</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/best-time-for-bitcoin-mining-opportunities</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Miners]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ruda Pellini]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 02:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5MjkzNDU0MDY3NTA5MDkx/20220505_btcfinal_zack-voell---the-future-of-energy-markets-according-to-bitcoin-miners_.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">With the price of bitcoin being so down, opportunities abound for bitcoin mining operations with structured cash and efficient operations.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Ruda Pellini co-founder and president of Arthur Mining, an ESG-focused bitcoin mining company.</em></p><p>I recently saw an article that cited the level of leverage and debt of the world's <a href="https://capital.com/biggest-global-crypto-bitcoin-mining-companies-ranking-btc">leading Bitcoin mining companies</a>. Since they are listed companies, it is easy to find their financial statements and prove the obvious: this is a counter-cyclical business that requires a lot of efficiency and professional management. </p><p>For those who are still wondering what mining is, let me quickly explain: the term mining makes an analogy to the process of extracting gold and metals, since bitcoin miners are the "producers" of this digital commodity. In practice, mining consists of allocating computing power and electricity to ensure the bitcoin network functions, validating transactions and serving as the backbone of this decentralized system. </p><p>Investing in bitcoin mining is different from buying the asset directly. On the one hand, when investing in mining you have constant and predictable cash flow and physical assets that can be liquidated in the event of market stress, making the investment more attractive to more cautious investors accustomed to investing in cash flow generating businesses. On the other hand, besides the risk related to the asset, there are also risks of the operation itself. </p><p>Currently, bitcoin is down more than 65% from its November 2021 peak. Moments like this generate apprehension and make the investors ask themselves: is it an opportunity to increase my investments or a risk? </p><p>For bitcoin mining operations with structured cash, the moment represents a great opportunity! To <a href="https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/investing-strategy/warren-buffett-quotes/">quote</a> Warren Buffet: “It’s only when the tide goes out do you learn who was swimming naked.” <br><br></p><h2>The Impact Of Bitcoin Price On Mining </h2><p>In general, bitcoin miners have their cash flow reduced as the price of bitcoin falls, so at first glance it is counterintuitive that lower prices are beneficial to a mining company. </p><p>However, since we are talking about an industry, more important than the market price is the cost of production. <br><br></p><p>Within the production costs, the biggest cost is the cost of electricity, which is the main input for this data processing activity. Therefore, those who can get a good price for energy and efficiency can remain profitable even in unfavorable market conditions. </p><p>Since not all miners can achieve this same level of efficiency, in scenarios like this one many end up having their production cost very close to the market price of the asset, leading them to liquidate their assets and exit the market. <br></p><p>Because of this, as in most commodity markets, this market is also counter-cyclical, and these down times are the best times to expand operations. There is a positive correlation of the price of mining computers with the price of Bitcoin, where the price ends up being adjusted in a greater variation than the asset itself. <br></p><p>While the price of bitcoin fell about 47% from April to August of this year, <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/chart/asic-price-index">the price of computers used in mining</a> fell about 60% in the same period. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>The Bitcoin Mining Companies</p><p>Particularly, I understand the mining industry in much the same way as the network infrastructure (cable) industry of the 1990s, where there were basically three major cycles of expansion and consolidation. </p><p>The first cycle was marked by geeks and technology enthusiasts, who started internet businesses and literally cabled and set up the first network infrastructures. This has also happened with bitcoin miners since 2009. <br> </p><p>In the second cycle, we had the entry of players interested in maximizing capital quickly, ignoring the importance of efficiency by focusing only on the accelerated expansion of their structures and on short-term results. <br></p><p>In the third cycle, we had the consolidation of the industry, with the entry of players focused on efficiency and long-term vision, encouraging the entry of venture capital and the professionalization of the market. In the United States, the 50 largest cable companies of the late 1990s were consolidated into four by the end of 2010. <br> </p><p>Most of today's large mining companies entered the second cycle, with too much focus on the short term and not enough efficiency. This results in businesses that are not very robust and are very vulnerable to times of stress. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>During bitcoin's big up cycle between 2020 and 2021, many mining companies took advantage of rising margins to leverage themselves and expand their operations. This is very common in many industries, but in this case in addition to leveraging in dollars, a good portion of the listed miners ended up keeping their cash in bitcoin in an attempt to maximize their results.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/29/crypto-miners-face-margin-calls-defaults-as-debt-comes-due-in-bear-market/">estimates</a> from Luxor Technologies, estimates indicate that listed mining companies have between $3 and $4 billion in loan agreements used to finance infrastructure expansion and computer purchases. </p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Produce On The Uptrend, Sell On The Downtrend</h2><p>Mistakenly, these players did not consider that, as in any commodity producer, if you are able to increase your production capacity, it makes sense to sell the stock you produce and reinvest it, rather than keeping the asset you produce on your balance sheet.<br> </p><p>In order to be able to honor these commitments, mining companies began to liquidate their liquid assets first, in this case the bitcoins held on the balance sheet. This move further increased the selling pressure during June and July, pushing prices to new lows. <br></p><p>Basically, the result of the cash management strategy adopted by these mining companies was to mine high and sell low, resulting in further financial losses in addition to the operational losses caused by the bitcoin price declines. <br></p><p>After selling the bitcoin from the balance sheet, the less efficient mining companies will need to sell computers to honor payments and maintain the operation, opening up space for more efficient mining companies to incorporate these assets and operations. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Time To Expand</p><p>As with other commodities, bitcoin mining is an anti-cyclical business. As a result, the best time to grow is during periods of low prices, when inefficient miners face problems and exit the market. <br><br></p><p>At the current moment the equipment is at a great discount and the investments made now will bring returns faster. So, despite the negative news and the last few months of falling prices, this is a moment of great asymmetry, with reduced risk and high potential returns to make investments in bitcoin mining. <br><br></p><p>We are in a moment of great opportunities and those who invest now will be winners in the long run. In short, for businesses that are well structured and have strategic advantages that ensure efficiency, all the turbulence of this harsh winter points in the direction of a very favorable spring for growth.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ruda Pellini.

The premium or discount describes the difference in value between shares of the trust and the value of the underlying bitcoin held. When the value of the shares of the trust are higher than the underlying bitcoin, it is considered a premium. When the value of the shares drop below the underlying bitcoin, it is considered a discount. <br><br>Investors have recently had to consider their options as the trust faces a continued decline in value, widening the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/13/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-discount-reaches-record-50/">discount to 50%,</a> a record low, stoking fears of already jumpy investors.

In the lawsuit, Donald B. Verrilli Jr., Grayscale's senior legal strategist and former U.S. solicitor general, stated that “As Grayscale and the team at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell have outlined, the SEC is failing to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles, and is therefore acting arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and Securities Exchange Act of 1934.”<br><br>Despite the SEC’s repeated denial of a spot ETF, it has approved multiple futures ETFs, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/proshares-first-bitcoin-etf-starts-trading-in-the-us">starting with</a> the ProShares BITO ETF in October of 2021. The reasoning behind this, according to Chairman Gary Gensler, is that futures have "Bitcoin futures have been overseen by sibling agency CFTC for 4 years. That's wrapped inside the 1940 Act which brings it inside investor protection."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNzM0MTY1NDEzNTM3NDI2/technical-analysis-markets-bull-bear-trading-header-.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Binance.US To Acquire Bankrupt Voyager Digital’s Assets]]></title><description><![CDATA[The American Binance entity has submitted a winning bid for the bankrupt cryptocurrency firm’s assets.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/binance-to-acquire-voyagers-assets</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/binance-to-acquire-voyagers-assets</guid><category><![CDATA[Binance.us]]></category><category><![CDATA[Voyager Digital]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bankruptcy]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 14:57:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODU0MjU3NzAyNTk1/binance-to-expand-crypto-exchange-services-to-singapore.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The American Binance entity has submitted a winning bid for the bankrupt cryptocurrency firm’s assets.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/voyager-announces-agreement-for-binanceus-to-acquire-its-assets-301706065.html">press release</a>, Voyager Digital Ltd. announced that Binance.US, an American licensed entity independent of Binance international, will acquire the assets of the failed cryptocurrency firm.

It also ensures the price cannot be manipulated.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Are you keeping bitcoin on an exchange? </p><p>Let me tell you a story about what happens when you, and others, leave your bitcoin on exchanges. You might be surprised to hear what that means for your holdings. It might sound a lot like your own. </p><p>Let's call our character Bill. Bill has been cautiously watching bitcoin for years, hearing about it in passing and reading a few articles. After inadvertently saving a lot of cash due to lockdowns, he decided to dive into bitcoin at last. A friend told him to check out Coinbase, Binance or another popular and “trusted” exchange in order to buy his first chunk of bitcoin.</p><p>So, Bill created an account and uploaded his face, ID, social security number, address and every other relevant detail about his life until he finally reached the “Buy Bitcoin” screen. He picked up a fraction of a bitcoin, but after all that trouble, he thought to himself: </p><p>"I don't need to learn all these complicated technical details about <a href="https://whatismoney.info/resources/best-bitcoin-hardware-wallet/">hardware wallets</a> and <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/tips-to-trust-yourself-in-becoming-your-own-bank">self custody</a> — I just want my bitcoin safe." </p><p>Bill reviewed the exchange's website and decided that the security experts at the exchange, with their wiz-bang cold storage and state-of-the-art encryption, would be better at securing his bitcoin than he himself would be.</p><p>Bill was very pleased with himself after making that decision — not only did this exchange make investing in bitcoin simple, it gave him peace of mind knowing that someone else was responsible for keeping his assets safe from any kind of theft or malicious activity. After all, why should he have to worry about such things when there were professionals available who could handle them instead? </p><p>Bill has since become quite comfortable with the idea of trusting exchanges with his bitcoin — his coins are now safe from his own mistakes!</p><h2>When Trust Disappears: The Fall Of FTX</h2><p>When Bill turned on the news one morning and found out that the massive crypto exchange <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-fried-and-ftx-largest-crypto-fraud-history">FTX</a> had just paused withdrawals and seemed to “accidentally” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23451484/ftx-customer-funds-alameda-research-sam-bankman-fried">lose $10 billion</a>, roughly <a href="https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/ftx-the-spectacular-collapse-of-a-30-billion-crypto-exchange-should-come-as-no-surprise-11668230888318.html">a third of its market cap</a>, he was shocked.</p><p>How could a firm with its logo on the side of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/12/miami-heat-arena-ftx-bankruptcy">major sports stadium</a> and a CEO who appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGZrZq6z-Ig">CNBC</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbF_OjP7QQg">Bloomberg</a> and in front of the U.S. Congress(!) to talk about digital assets and regulation have lost — or likely stolen — so much from right under everyone's nose?</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Now Bill was stuck between a rock and a hard place. He was suspicious of his own exchange, but setting up his own hardware wallet seemed so difficult and scary. It would require him to invest in a physical device, acquire the necessary knowledge to secure it properly and keep track of his seed phrase backup. Even if he figured out the basics, there was still the risk of misplacing his device or improperly storing his backup and losing access to his bitcoin.</p><p>FTX was shocking, but surely Bill's exchange would never conduct itself the same way. People would see it before it was coming, and he'd have time to get out, right?</p><h2>Reasons To Take Your Bitcoin Off Exchanges</h2><p>It's clear that trusting your bitcoin to an exchange brings with it the risk that you'll log in one morning to find that your bitcoin just isn't there. If you hold your bitcoin yourself using a hardware wallet, this can't happen.</p><p>However, there's another big reason it's important to take your bitcoin off exchanges: the bitcoin price.</p><p>How could self custody affect bitcoin's price? Everything in economics says that buying and selling affect the market price for a good, not who holds it. However, self custody is very important to price — and it has to do with something I'll call “paper BTC.”</p><h2>Introducing The Next Big Thing: Paper BTC</h2><p>Let's look at how an exchange works by considering a hypothetical exchange called ExchangeCorp, owned and operated by a jolly entrepreneur named Bernie. ExchangeCorp built an uncomplicated way to buy bitcoin, and hired a team of security experts to make sure hackers are kept at bay. Over time and through great marketing campaigns, ExchangeCorp built trust with traders and investors, drawing many in to store their bitcoin on the exchange.</p><p>When users keep their bitcoin with ExchangeCorp, the CEO Bernie and his team maintain control over those coins. Customers simply have a claim on their coins: they can log in and see their balance as well as request to withdraw their coins. However, if Bernie wants to transfer those coins owed to his customers to other Bitcoin addresses, he's technically able to do so without any customer's permission.</p><p>When Bernie kicks up his feet and looks at the balances in ExchangeCorp's vault, he's pleased to see tens of thousands of bitcoin that his customers have deposited sitting pretty. Since ExchangeCorp is doing well, more bitcoin are always coming in than going out.</p><p>So Bernie gets a wise idea. He could lend out some of those customer coins, earn some interest, and get the coins back without anyone noticing. He would get richer, and the risk of enough ExchangeCorp customers asking for withdrawals at one time to draw its vault's massive balance down to zero is miniscule. So Bernie loans out thousands of coins here and there to hedge funds and businesses.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NTM2NzAzNDM0NzYxNjAz/fractional-reserve_banking.png" height="351" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><a href="https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/fractional-reserve-banking/"><em>Source</em></a>. <em>Traditional banks are even worse than ExchangeCorp. And from March 2020, they can now </em><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm"><em>lend out 100% of your money</em></a><em>!</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Now there's another set of claims to consider. Customers have a claim on their bitcoin at ExchangeCorp, but ExchangeCorp no longer has the actual bitcoin — they only have a claim on the coin they lent out. What customers now have is a claim on Paper BTC held by ExchangeCorp, with the real bitcoin in the hands of borrowers.</p><p>This is where things get weird. All of ExchangeCorp's customers still think they have a direct claim on real bitcoin held safely by ExchangeCorp. However, that real bitcoin is in fact in the hands of those who borrowed from ExchangeCorp, and those entities are selling it out in the market.</p><p>What happens when ExchangeCorp lends out a large quantity of the bitcoin its customers deposited? A lot of extra bitcoin starts to float around in the market, because investors who think they're holding actual bitcoin are only holding paper BTC. All of that extra supply of bitcoin in the market absorbs buy pressure, which suppresses the price of bitcoin.</p><p>Let's look at simple supply and demand here:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NTM2NzE1NzgyNzI3Mjc4/btc-price-suppression-thru-paper-btc.jpg" height="334" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>When paper BTC comes into the market, because market participants are unaware that this new supply is not real bitcoin, it has the same effect as increasing the supply of real bitcoin — until the fraud is uncovered.&nbsp;</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Does this hypothetical story sound anything like the recent news around FTX?</p><h2>The Paper BTC At The Center Of The FTX Fraud</h2><p>The story of ExchangeCorp and Bernie is exactly the story of FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, with some save-the-world complexes, study drugs and polyamorous orgies redacted.</p><p>By lending out customer funds, FTX essentially inflated the supply of bitcoin by taking advantage of the trust users placed in FTX to safeguard their funds. FTX created tons of paper BTC.</p><p>Just how much paper BTC might FTX have created? We cannot be sure of the exact amounts given its <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/new-ftx-ceo-john-ray-iii-says-crypto-firms-failure-worse/439445">absolutely horrid bookkeeping</a>, but the estimate below suggests FTX had 80,000 paper BTC on its books — bitcoin owed to customers that is not backed by real bitcoin.</p><p>That would represent a staggering 24% of the roughly 330,000 new bitcoin that were created over the past year through the <a href="https://bitcoinbriefly.com/21-million-bitcoin/">predictable mining issuance process</a>. That is a ton of extra bitcoin entering the market that nobody — aside from a small group of insiders at FTX — knew about!</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/Croesus_BTC/status/1593274010434871297"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>It's impossible to tell where the price would have gone without that extra bitcoin supply entering the market, but we can be almost certain that the price would have climbed higher than it did in 2021.</p><p>While the FTX collapse is recent and still unfolding, history has a few cautionary tales to tell about the dangers of paper assets and price manipulation. The story of gold's failure to resist centralized capture, for instance, can tell us where Bitcoin is headed if we continue to trust exchanges and third parties to hold our bitcoin for us.</p><h2>The Fall Of Gold</h2><p>Gold was once used in daily transactions — it takes no more than a visit to a museum of ancient history to see the collections of old gold coins once circulating in local markets. The traditional view of the demise of gold as a transactional currency was that it became too cumbersome or too valuable to continue to function well as a means to buy groceries and beer.</p><p>However, this story omits a few key components that only reveal themselves when we trace the evolution that societies took from gold coins to paper bills and digital bank accounts.</p><p>Centuries ago, banks started taking customer’s gold in exchange for bank notes — giving customers a measure of security for their gold and a more convenient means of transacting. However, entrusting a bank with your precious metal meant the bank was able to lend it out or make bad investments without the depositor’s consent. When a bank was caught between bad loans and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run">high rate of depositor withdrawals</a>, they had to declare bankruptcy and shut down — leaving many depositors penniless, holding paper claims on gold now worth nothing at all. </p><p>Then central banks came along to “fix” the problem of bankrupt banks leaving depositors penniless. Central banks held gold for people and commercial banks, giving them banknotes from the central bank as receipts for their gold. By 1960, central bank official holdings accounted for <a href="https://www.omfif.org/2016/09/the-seven-ages-of-gold/">about 50% of all aboveground gold stocks</a>, with their banknotes circulating freely. Commercial banks and individuals didn’t mind, since each note was convertible to a set weight of gold by the central bank that issued it.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>This would have worked well, except that central banks — especially the Federal Reserve in the U.S. — started <a href="https://whatismoney.info/what-is-money/#bretton-woods-collapse">creating more bills than they had gold to back</a>. Creating more bills than the Fed had gold to back was essentially creating paper gold, since each bill was a claim on gold. Doing this in secret meant the Fed was manipulating the price of gold, given the extra circulating supply which the market was not aware of. When many depositors of gold at the Federal Reserve — like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58gikUjyIo">French government</a> — started questioning the Fed’s gold holdings and creating the <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/gold-convertibility-ends">threat of a run on gold</a> in the U.S., the U.S. government had to intervene. </p><p>In 1971, this came to a head with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock">Nixon shock</a>. One night, President Nixon announced the U.S. would temporarily stop allowing depositors to trade in their Federal Reserve notes for the gold they promised. </p><p>This temporary halt in withdrawals was never lifted. Since all currencies were connected to gold through the U.S. dollar under the <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/bretton-woods-created">Bretton Woods agreement</a>, the Nixon Shock meant that the entire world went off the gold standard at once. All currencies were now just pieces of paper, instead of notes giving the holder a claim on a quantity of gold.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>This was only achievable because gold, over time, was deposited into commercial banks and then to central banks. Once central banks held most of the gold, they could manipulate the price of gold and remove it entirely from daily commerce. Everyday people chose the convenience of paper notes over the security of holding gold, and paid the price. </p><p>Instead of a neutral money backed by a precious metal that is difficult to dig up and impossible to synthesize, currencies became easy to print and thus highly politicized. Keeping the dollar at the top of the food chain no longer required restraint and good stewardship to ensure its backing in gold. Instead, it required military expeditions and strong policing to ensure global governments and citizens continued to use the dollar to transact. </p><p>A return to gold at this point would be impractical — the world’s commercial networks span too great a distance with transactions happening at too high a speed. With paper currency and eventually digital banking systems, what we gained in speed and convenience we lost in soundness and neutrality. We lost our savings, our social cohesion and our political institutions as a result. </p><h2>Preventing Bitcoin's Fall</h2><p>Taking your bitcoin off of your exchange is not just good practice for your own security, it's protecting the price of your bitcoin as well. Our freedoms depend on individuals having control over their own wealth. When we entrust our wealth to companies or states, we go down the path we witnessed with gold. </p><p>Thanks to bitcoin’s divisibility and digital nature, it overcomes the hurdles that held gold back from supporting our modern, interconnected economy. Bitcoin can support a global marketplace, but it will only get there if we each hold our own bitcoin. </p><p>Don’t let the banksters and bureaucrats manipulate the price of your bitcoin: take it off the exchange and get it on your own <a href="https://whatismoney.info/resources/best-bitcoin-hardware-wallet/">hardware wallet</a>. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Captain Sidd.

The bill would amend the 2007 Investments and Securities Act and would recognize bitcoin as legal capital for investment.</p><p>Back in February of 2021, Nigeria effectively <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2021/CCD/Letter%20on%20Crypto.pdf">banned</a> the usage of bitcoin with a letter prohibiting regulated financial businesses from “dealing” with cryptocurrencies. In the same year, Bitcoin Magazine reported Nigeria soaring to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-largest-volume-peer-to-peer-africa">largest volume</a> of bitcoin peer-to-peer trading in the world, and Chainanalysis reports <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/chainalysis-global-crypto-adoption-index">showed</a> that Nigeria had greatly accelerated bitcoin adoption. <br> </p><p>The newspaper report described how Ibrahim pointed to Nigeria being behind in regards to regulation of the industry, saying “Like I said earlier during the second reading, we need an efficient and vibrant capital market in Nigeria.

You’re at a social event and a friend, acquaintance or relative comes up to you and says “you were into Bitcoin, right?” You know you only have a brief period of their attention to give them an overview and pique their interest. So how can you give them an intelligible take on such a complex, multifaceted subject? </p><p>Here are a few ideas for you to pick and choose from for the next time you find yourself in that situation! </p><h2>Centralisation Is The Enemy Of Property </h2><p>Any currency which is centralized can be taken away from you in two ways. It can be done directly, by simply skimming it off your bank account as happened in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis">Greece</a> when people lost 20% of whatever was on their account to a government haircut in 2015 and 16, or by cutting your access to your own assets, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/29/doj-says-allies-have-frozen-30-billion-of-russian-oligarch-assets.html">as has just been shown</a> by America and the U.K. doing this to Russian corporations or individuals during the current crisis in relations around the Ukraine. Secondly, because all our fiat currencies are centralized, this can be done through inflation — the government simply prints more money which means that whatever you have in your bank account will lose its value — also effectively robbing you of your purchasing power. </p><p>Bitcoin is a new kind of digital money that will never be issued or controlled by a corporation or government. It is a new form of money, unlike anything we’ve ever seen before and is a 21st century hedge against inflation and central bank money printing. Unlike the US dollar, it is a provably scarce digital asset that is backed by a wall of encrypted real world energy. These coins reached parity with the U.S. dollar ten years ago and are now worth 20,000 times <em>more</em> than the dollar. </p><p>Because it is both scarce and totally decentralized, it is deflationary, and no one can take it away from you as long as you keep it in a storage which is not connected to the internet.</p><h2>What Is Bitcoin?</h2><p>The term bitcoin can really mean two things: <em>bitcoin the asset</em> (currently worth 20,000 times more than the USD) and <em>Bitcoin the network</em> which is growing faster than the internet or Facebook or Amazon. Bitcoin the asset travels along digital rails (a shared distributed ledger where a record of all the Bitcoin transactions is kept) that are decentralized onto tens of thousands of devices and computers. This digital asset is a 21st century savings technology which uses military grade encryption and permits you to store value and wealth on a smartphone or hardware device called a wallet. </p><p>It allows those who buy it to store the fruit of their labor (or life force) and wealth using software, math and energy that is almost impossible to steal directly or indirectly (through inflation) Once you learn the language of bitcoin, you realize that anyone holding government issued currency (which is all of us) is watching their wealth melt like an ice cube in the sun as the fiat value inflates, and hyperinflated when measured against bitcoin. Anyone who cares about keeping their wealth in the future ( and that should be all of us, especially those of us who have children and intend to leave them an inheritance) needs to wake up and smell the coffee. Fiat currencies are losing their value fast, and although Bitcoin is still volatile, everything points towards it holding its value long term. </p><h2>The Bitcoin Network Has Never Been Hacked</h2><p>In 13 years. The Bitcoin network is rock solid. </p><h2>How Bitcoin Works In A Nutshell</h2><p>Bitcoin runs on a blockchain. As its name suggests, a blockchain is made up of blocks. Each time a new block is confirmed it gets added to the blockchain. Bitcoin blocks are confirmed by computers known as miners and each time a miner solves the math problem which confirms a block, it gets a reward in new Bitcoin, a process written into the original Bitcoin code. This takes a lot of energy and is the system which keeps the Bitcoin blockchain safe. </p><p>Bitcoin mining is the energy intensive process which both creates new coins and maintains a log of all transactions performed on the bitcoin network since its inception. Bitcoin miners take real world energy (stranded and renewable) and convert it into monetary energy that will outlive your grandchildren. The more energy used by bitcoin miners, the more secure and unhackable the network becomes. </p><p>The protocol has a fixed supply schedule that issues 6.25 coins into the network about every 10 minutes. In 2024 the supply issuance will be cut in half to 3.125 coins every 10 minutes. </p><p>Each time a Bitcoin transaction is made, it’s recorded into the next block. Once that block is confirmed and added to the blockchain it can never be deleted.</p><h2>Who Uses Bitcoin?</h2><p>More and more individuals are using Bitcoin. It’s been estimated that in the first half of 2021, the number of people using Bitcoin grew by just under 165 per minute (“<a href="https://medium.com/original-crypto-guy/how-fast-is-bitcoin-growing-1b8f9fac97b7">How Fast Is Bitcoin Growing?</a>”). That’s a lot of people and a lot of growth.</p><p>Bitcoin is the first and only digital asset to be named as legal tender by a nation state. Bitcoin is the first and only asset in history to be named a primary treasury reserve asset by a Fortune 500 company, Microstrategy, an intelligence software company. </p><p>Here’s what their CEO, Michael Saylor, had to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-interview-the-predator-prey-dynamics-of-bitcoin">say about</a> it:</p><blockquote><p>“We converted our balance sheet from a depreciating asset to an appreciating asset. So we have two businesses. One is enterprise software business and the other is digital property business. So why did we do it? Defensively, I don’t want to lose money or destroy the value of the company. Wealth is destroyed. Stage two is opportunistic, we could buy high quality property. Digital property is better than analog property. Stage three is strategic. It’s a good idea to buy up cyber Manhattan before everyone else moves here. If bitcoin is appreciating at 100% per year and I can borrow fiat at 5% then my arbitrage is 95%. Why would I NOT do it?” </p></blockquote><h2>There’s A Lot Of Negativity About Bitcoin In The Press</h2><p>If we look back at history, it's been pretty rare for a king to be deposed from his throne by a newcomer without putting up a bit of a fight. The fiat banking system has been king almost since its invention by the Medici. It's not going to go quietly. The fiat system has been able to dictate the terms and its employees profit massively from doing so. Until, that is, Bitcoin came along, the upstart King Arthur who, against all odds, has pulled the sword from the stone. And do the central banks and the governments like that? They do not. </p><p>It’s a key reason why central bankers attack and spread untruths about bitcoin. </p><p> What are those lies? It’s not backed by anything. It wastes energy. It’s volatile. It is controlled by billionaires. It has no practical uses. It’s primarily used by criminals and terrorists. It’s a Ponzi scheme. </p><p>Rubbish. Bitcoin has the potential to upset the current status quo — hence why it’s so maligned by those currently holding the microphone. </p><h2>You Can Buy A Fraction Of A Bitcoin</h2><p>Sure, most of us don’t have 20,000 odd dollars just lying around which we could spare to buy a whole Bitcoin with. One Bitcoin divides into one hundred million Satoshis – which means that you can invest 10 dollars in Bitcoin as a start investment, should you so desire. </p><blockquote><p>“Bitcoin is our peaceful weapon of choice against central bank driven time theft.” — Ross Stevens</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Bitcoin is a currency for the people backed by the people.” — Sylvain Laurel</p></blockquote><p><em>This is a guest post by Mark Maraia and Holly Young.

This comes with an endorsement from the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee, which is the “<a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p221216.htm">primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks.</a>”</p><p>Investopedia <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier1capital.asp">defines Tier 1 capital</a> as “the core capital held in a bank's reserves [that] is used to fund business activities for the bank's clients. It includes common stock, as well as disclosed reserves and certain other assets.” <br><br>The policy includes bitcoin in its definition of Group 2 crypto assets, saying that “In addition to any tokenised traditional assets and stablecoins that fail the classification conditions, Group 2 includes all unbacked cryptoassets.” It later describes that “a bank’s total exposure to Group 2 cryptoassets should not generally be higher than 1% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital and must not exceed 2% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital.”<br></p><p>The BIS had previously considered a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/basel-banks-crypto-currency-idCNL5N2NR51V">policy of 1%</a> for global banks. In turn, the banks <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/jpmorgan-deutsche-bank-oppose-strict-basel-rules-for-banks-holding-bitcoin">requested a 5% reserve limit</a>. This 2% appears to be a compromise between the two. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/421215/banks-assets-globally/">data from 2020</a>, if applied to all banks in the world, who collectively custody approximately $180 trillion, this would amount to a limit of $3.6 trillion in bitcoin held by such entities. <br><br>Tiff Macklem, Chair of the GHOS, <a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p221216.htm">stated that</a> “Today's endorsement by the GHOS marks an important milestone in developing a global regulatory baseline for mitigating risks to banks from cryptoassets. It is important to continue to monitor bank-related developments in cryptoasset markets. We remain ready to act further if necessary.”<br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTA5MzYx/bitcoin-code.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin And The Cardinal Virtues: How The Rabbit Hole Instills Virtuous Behavior]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s mission and incentives point its community toward classically virtuous behavior.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-instills-cardinal-virtues</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-instills-cardinal-virtues</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[philosophy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[religion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mitchell Askew]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNTQxOTQxNDY3Nzg0MzE2/silver-or-orange-lining-in-the-clouds-hope-freedom-storm.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Bitcoin’s mission and incentives point its community toward classically virtuous behavior.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Mitchell Askew, a Christian, conservative Bitcoiner who produces Bitcoin-related research and social media content for Blockware Solutions.</em></p><p>“You don’t change Bitcoin, Bitcoin changes you.”</p><p>This is one of many mantras circulating around the Bitcoin community. I am two years removed from the start of my Bitcoin journey and can personally attest to the legitimacy of this statement. While my experience in Bitcoin is relatively short-lived, people can grow a great deal in two years, especially those in their early 20s. Bitcoin is a never-ending quest for knowledge and anyone who joins the expedition will in due time find themselves embracing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues">cardinal virtues</a>.</p><p>The cardinal virtues, deeply rooted in Christianity and among philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, represent a universal foundation of moral guidance. The virtues are prudence, temperance, justice and fortitude. They were dubbed “cardinal” from the Latin root “cardo,” which means “hinge,” as in: all other virtues hinge (rely) upon the four cardinal virtues.</p><p>I have outlined how anyone in honest pursuit of the Bitcoin mission to separate money and state is strongly incentivized to behave according to the cardinal virtues.</p><h2>Bitcoin Instills Prudence</h2><p><em>Acting with or showing care and thought for the future.</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>You will not understand what Bitcoin is the first time you hear about it. Nor will you have a firm grasp the second, third or fourth time. In today’s fast-paced world, few have put in the hours necessary to have a solid understanding of how Bitcoin functions, technically. Of those that have, even fewer have taken the time to study all of the encompassing domains of Bitcoin, including but not limited to economics, personal finance, computer science, energy markets, the history of money and geopolitical game theory.</p><p>To say that Bitcoin will have a profound impact on the world is an understatement. To begin having the slightest understanding of what the impact will be requires prudence. In the words of Michael Saylor “<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-interview-the-predator-prey-dynamics-of-bitcoin">there are no informed critiques</a>.” Those who immediately dismiss Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme no different than those of Bernie Madoff or Sam Bankman-Fried, are simply exposing their intellectual sloth.</p><p>A common theme among Bitcoiners, popularized by Austrian economists such as Saifedean Ammous, is the concept of time preference. To have a low time preference means that you are willing to place more emphasis on your future wellbeing relative to your present wellbeing; this quite literally is the definition of prudence. Those who engage in the speculative markets of altcoins, or attempt to trade bitcoin’s unpredictable short-term volatility, rather than HODL the least uncertain asset of all time, are inherently imprudent.</p><p>By putting in the hours necessary to have a basic understanding of Bitcoin’s technical fundamentals and its broad implications on society, you have exhibited prudence.</p><h2>Bitcoin Instills Temperance</h2><p><em>Habitual moderation in the indulgence of the appetites or passions.</em></p><p>Similar to prudence, Bitcoiners achieve temperance through low time preference behavior.</p><p>Contrary to common FUD propagated among no-coiners, Bitcoin is not full of whales seeking to dump their positions in pursuit of fiat-denominated profit. Moreover, the exponentially-increasing adoption of Bitcoin coupled with its immutably scarce supply means that each wave of newcomers are met with the realization that it is wise to acquire as much bitcoin as possible before the rest of the world catches on.</p><p>When bitcoin becomes your individual unit of account, you begin weighing every potential purchase or experience against the opportunity cost of acquiring more bitcoin. This has led to many Bitcoiners, including myself, embracing minimalist lifestyles. The key point here is that this declination of materialistic goods in pursuit of more bitcoin, though perhaps initially sparked by a desire to satisfy future greed, brings forth the realization that an abundance of materialistic goods is unnecessary.</p><p>By eliminating many of the “wants” from your personal budget, i.e., moderating the indulgence of appetites or passions, and limiting yourself to “needs” in order to save wealth in bitcoin, you are embracing the cardinal virtue of temperance.</p><h2>Bitcoin Instills Justice</h2><p><em>Just dealing or right action; giving each person his or her due.</em></p><p>The biggest financial fraud of all time is the fiat monetary system. For far too long, the existence of central banks has provided governments with the ability to fund the ideals of the ruling class at the expense of cash savings and future economic productivity. Prior to the rapid acceleration of inflation during the past couple of years, most Westerners were completely unaware of the backdoor thievery that occurs with the expansion of the money supply.</p><p>Bitcoin grants inalienable property rights to all of its users. No government agency or corporation has the power to dilute the value of each unit in the network and, when stored properly, BTC is virtually impossible to confiscate. Bitcoin is an open, neutral network that does not discriminate based on religion, ethnicity, sex, race or vaccination status. Nobody is restricted from running a node to audit the authenticity of each transaction on the ledger.</p><p>By guaranteeing irrefutable access to an unconfiscatable and undilutable form of property, Bitcoin represents the most just asset and monetary network in the history of mankind.</p><h2>Bitcoin Instills Fortitude</h2><p><em>Courage in pain or adversity.</em></p><p>Bitcoiners develop fortitude in two ways.</p><p>The first way is by encouraging HODLing through volatility. At the time of this writing, bitcoin is <a href="https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price/">down by over 70% from its all-time high</a>. This is the fourth time in Bitcoin’s thirteen-year history that we have experienced a drawdown of this magnitude. Bitcoiners are clearly exhibiting courage in the face of this adversity as evidenced by on-chain data. An all-time high of over <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/over-66-of-the-total-bitcoin-supply-hasnt-moved-in-the-last-one-year-setting-a-record/#:~:text=66%25%20of%20Bitcoin's%20circulating%20supply,illiquid%20bitcoin%20supply%20ever%20recorded.">66% of Bitcoin’s supply has not moved in one year or longer</a>. This fortitude is not unprecedented either, as this metric has hit all-time highs during previous bear markets as well.</p><p>I sense that a positive feedback loop is occurring here. When you can see for yourself that other bitcoin holders are undisturbed by the extreme drawdowns in price, it enables one to become more confident in the future of the network, and thus continue HODLing themselves.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The second way in which Bitcoiners develop fortitude is by encouraging Bitcoiners to take an action akin to the founding fathers signing of the Declaration Of Independence. While holding bitcoin is not outright illegal in most countries, it certainly does not put you in a favorable standing with the most powerful entities in the world.</p><p>History has shown that regimes in control of the global reserve currency do not take kindly to that position being usurped. As such, there is a non-zero chance that Bitcoiners could be declared treasonous in a dramatic, last-chance attempt by the United States government to maintain control over the monetary system. </p><p>However, this extremity can be avoided by winning the race of adoption as Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/the-race-to-avoid-the-war/">eloquently describes in this article</a>.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mitchell Askew.

After only having 7.82% market share of the bitcoin supply on exchanges in 2018, their share is now 27.50% despite a much broader trend of bitcoin supply leaving exchanges. The bitcoin balance on Binance now totals 595,864 BTC, which is 3.1% of outstanding supply, worth $10.58 billion. This bitcoin belongs to their customers and reflects a growing trend in market share over the last few years that has made Binance the largest bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange in the world. </p><p>Binance now controls approximately <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/the-exchange-war-binance-smells-blood">60% of the spot and derivatives volume</a> in the entire market. It’s hard to see how any exchange in the space can be a “winner” in the current market conditions, but one could make the case for Binance, with the exchange’s growing strength in a decimated industry. On top of that, Binance’s BNB token, the native currency of Binance’s own Ethereum-competing Layer 1 blockchain, is still one of the better performing tokens when valued in bitcoin terms this year. </p><p>Yet, is this recent “strength” everything that it seems or is it a facade? We’ve learned over the last month that no company is safe in this industry right now (especially exchanges) and questions are growing around Binance’s practices, solvency, BNB token value and the overall state of their business over the last few weeks. Is it FUD or legit? Let’s try to break some of it down, addressing the concerns through an objective and skeptical lens. </p><h3>Binance Flows</h3><p>We’ve seen significant outflows from Binance across different various tokens and bitcoin when looking at both <a href="https://twitter.com/themlpx/status/1602567600483205125?s=20&amp;t=O5hgOya8eEjD2QUHMv6Mcg">Nansen</a> and Glassnode tracking. Across ETH and ERC20 tokens, Binance saw <a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1602673823651864577?s=20&amp;t=O5hgOya8eEjD2QUHMv6Mcg">$3 billion</a> leaving the exchange in its largest single-day outflow since June. Across Nansen total wallet tracking, all Binance balances are estimated at $62.5 billion with around 50% of those balances in stablecoins across BUSD and USDT.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>According to Glassnode, the total bitcoin exchange balance on Binance is down around 6-7% over the last day, after reaching a peak on December 1. Although balances remain above 500,000 bitcoin and Binance has shown a rising trend of bitcoin balances on the platform this year, this is a significant move for outflows in just 24 hours. As a general comparison, the trend of bitcoin exchange balances was a much different story for FTX, whose balance had been falling heavily since June. Binance outflows over the last couple days are a bit alarming and raise questions: Is this a one-off event and just business as usual or is this the start of something more?&nbsp;</p><figure>

We can transparently see that the firm controls tens of billions worth of crypto assets. What isn’t exactly clear, similar to FTX, is whether the firm has commingled users funds or whether the firm has any outstanding liabilities against user assets.</p><p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has said that the firm has no liabilities with any other firms, but as recent months have shown, words don’t mean all that much. While we are not claiming that CZ is lying to the public about the state of Binance finances, we have no way to prove otherwise.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1600575731540574228"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1600596763404079124"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>CZ’s response as to whether the company was going to audit liabilities against user assets was, “Yes, but liabilities are harder. We don't owe any loans to anyone. You can ask around.” </p><p>Unfortunately, “ask around” isn’t a satisfactory enough answer for an ecosystem supposedly built around the ethos of “don’t trust, verify.”</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1601785215646461952"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>While there is no doubt that Binance is an industry giant in the crypto derivatives industry, how do we know the firm isn’t doing similar things as past actors in regards to trading against clients using user funds and/or proprietary data. Things like the former Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/binance-us-ceo-brian-brooks-resigns-2021-08-06/">departing Binance U.S. last summer after just three months</a> as the CEO leaves one with many questions. </p><p>To add to our skepticism, the price of the Binance exchange token BNB is near all-time highs in bitcoin terms, appreciating an astounding 828% against bitcoin in the last 785 calendar days.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Is BNB really worth approximately 14% of all bitcoin that will ever exist?</figcaption>
    </figure><p>The coming weeks will be full of headlines around the state of global crypto regulation in a post-FTX world. In a 48-hour period, Reuters published news stating that the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-justice-dept-is-split-over-charging-binance-crypto-world-falters-sources-2022-12-12/">U.S. Justice Dept is split over charging Binance</a>, Binance withdrawals for bitcoin and aggregate stablecoin pairs have hit all-time highs and the BNB exchange token has fallen 10% relative to bitcoin.</p><p>Out of an abundance of caution, we will continue to urge readers operating on any centralized exchange — of which Binance is most definitely included — to look into self custody solutions. There have been far too many instances of incompetence and/or misconduct from exchanges.</p><p>It’s not that we don’t trust CZ or Binance, it's the fact that <em>we don’t trust anyone.</em> </p><p>The whole point of bitcoin is we now have an asset that is truly the liability of no one. Verify the ownership of an open distributed network with cryptography; don’t trust permissioned IOUs. With the mix of regulatory concerns about the global crypto derivatives industry, a questionable exchange token with unbelievable relative performance over the last two years and a shaky proof-of-reserves attestation — that was incorrectly claimed to be an audit and had industry CEOs raising eyebrows — we find the need to urge our readers to evaluate their counterparty risk.&nbsp;</p><figure>

Nick Szabo wrote an interesting anecdote about how in his essay “<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">Shelling Out: The Origins of Money</a>.” When homosapiens displaced <a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis">homo neanderthalensis</a> in Europe circa 40,000 to 35,000 B.C., population explosions followed. It's difficult to explain why, because the newcomers, homosapiens, had the same size brain, weaker bones and smaller muscles than the neanderthals. The biggest difference may have been wealth transfers made more effective or even possible by collectibles. Evidence shows homosapiens sapiens took pleasure in collecting shells, making jewelry out of them, showing them off and trading them. <br></p><p>It follows that the capability to preserve wealth is one of the foundations of human civilization. Historically, there have been a variety of wealth preservation technologies that have constantly changed and adapted to the technological possibilities of the time. All wealth preservation technologies serve a specific function: storing value. Chief among the early forms is handmade jewelry. Below I will compare the four most commonly used wealth preservation technologies today (gold, bonds, real estate and equities) to bitcoin to show why they underperform and how efficiently bitcoin can help us save and plan for our future. For equities, I focus specifically on ETFs as equity instruments used as a means of long-term savings.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>What Makes A Good Store Of Value?</p><p>As explained by <a href="https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1">Vijay Bojapati</a>, when stores of value compete against each other, it is the unique attributes that make a good store of value that allows one to out-compete another. The characteristics of a good store of value are considered to be durability, portability, fungibility, divisibility and especially scarcity. These properties determine what is used as a store of value. Jewelry, for example, may be scarce, but it's easily destroyed, not divisible, and certainly not fungible. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/fintech-startup-rupeek-gives-out-1-billion-in-gold-backed-loans-122011101614_1.html">Gold fulfills these properties much better</a>. Gold has over time replaced jewelry as humankind's preferred technology for wealth preservation, serving as the most effective store of value for 5,000 years. However, since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, gold has faced digital disruption. Digitization optimizes almost all value-storing functions. Bitcoin serves not only as a store of value, but also as an inherently digital money, ultimately defeating gold in the digital age. </p><h2>Bitcoin Versus Gold </h2><p><strong>Durability:</strong> <a href="https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1">Gold is the undisputed king of durability</a>. Most of the gold that has been mined remains extant today. Bitcoin are digital records. Thus it is not their physical manifestation whose durability should be considered, but the durability of the institution that issues them. Bitcoin, having no issuing authority, may be considered durable so long as the network that secures them remains intact. It is too early to draw conclusions about its durability. However, there are signs that, despite instances of nation-states attempting to regulate Bitcoin and years of attacks, the network has continued to function, displaying a remarkable degree of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility">anti-fragility</a>”. In fact, it is one of the most reliable computer networks ever, with nearly <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-downtime/#:~:text=Conclusion,has%20maintained%20very%20stable%20uptime.">99.99% uptime</a>. </p><p><strong>Portability:</strong> Bitcoin's portability is far superior to that of gold, as information can move at the speed of light (thanks to telecommunication). Gold has lost its appeal in the digital age. You can't send gold over the internet. Online gold portability simply doesn't exist. For decades, the inability to digitise gold created problems in our monetary system, historically based on gold. With the digitization of money, over time it was no longer comprehensible whether national currencies were actually backed by gold or not. Also, it is difficult to transport gold across borders because of its weight, which has created problems for globalised trade. Due to gold's weakness in terms of portability, our current fiat-based monetary system exists. Bitcoin is a solution to this problem as it is a native digital scarce commodity that is easily transportable.</p><h2>Storing Gold Versus Storing Bitcoin</h2><figure>

    </figure><p><strong>Divisibility: </strong><a href="https://breedlove22.medium.com/money-bitcoin-and-time-part-1-of-3-b4f6bb036c04">Bitcoin is purely digital, so its divisibility is much better compared to gold. Information can be subdivided and recombined almost infinitely at almost zero cost (like numbers).</a> A bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 units called satoshi. Gold on the other hand is difficult to divide. It requires special tools and carries the risk of losing gold in the process, even if it's just dust.</p><p><strong>Fungibility:</strong> Gold can be distinguished for example by an engraved logo, but can be melted down and is then fully fungible. With bitcoin, fungibility is “tricky”. Bitcoin is digital information, which <a href="https://breedlove22.medium.com/money-bitcoin-and-time-part-1-of-3-b4f6bb036c04">is the most objectively discernible substance in the universe (like the written word</a>). However, since all bitcoin transactions are transparent, governments could ban the use of bitcoin that has been used for activities deemed illegal. Which would negatively impact bitcoin's fungibility and its use as a medium of exchange, because when money is not fungible, each unit of the money has a different value and the money has lost its medium of exchange property. This does not affect bitcoin's store-of-value function, but rather its acceptance as money, which can negatively impact its price. Gold's fungibility is superior to bitcoins, but gold's portability disadvantages make it useless as a medium of exchange or a digital store of value.</p><p><strong>Scarcity:</strong> Gold is relatively scarce, with an annual inflation rate of <a href="https://www.seabridgegold.com/the-case-for-gold/basic-facts-about-gold-prices-elasticity-and-uses">1.5%</a>. However, the supply is not capped. There are always new discoveries of gold and <a href="https://www.mining.com/web/the-golden-asteroid-that-could-make-everyone-on-earth-a-billionaire/">there is a possibility that we will come across large deposits in space</a>. Gold's price is not perfectly inelastic. When gold prices rise, there is an incentive to mine gold more intensively, which can increase supply. In addition, ​​physical gold can be diluted with less precious metals, which is difficult to check. Furthermore, gold held in online accounts via ETCs or other products often has multiple uses, which is also difficult to control and negatively impacts the price by artificially increasing supply. The supply of bitcoin, on the other hand, is hard-capped, there will never be more than 21,000,000. It is designed to be disinflationary, meaning there will be less of it over time. </p><p>Bitcoin's annual inflation rate is currently <a href="https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-inflation/">1.75%</a> and will continue to decrease. Bitcoin mining rewards are halved roughly every 4 years, according to the protocol’s code. In 10 years, its inflation rate will be negligible. The last bitcoin will be mined in 2140. After that, the annual inflation rate of bitcoin will be zero. <br><br><strong>Auditability:</strong> This is not a unique selling proposition for a store of value, but it is still important because it provides information about whether a store of value is suitable for a fair and transparent financial system.<br><br>Bitcoin is perfectly audible to the smallest unit. No one knows how much gold exists in the world and no one knows how much US dollars exist in the world. As pointed out to me by <a href="https://twitter.com/samabbassi">Sam Abbassi</a>, bitcoin is the first perfectly, publicly, globally, auditable asset. This prevents rehypothecation risk, a practice whereby banks and brokers use assets posted as collateral by their clients for their own purposes. This takes an enormous amount of risk out of the financial system. It allows for proof of reserves, where a financial institution must provide their bitcoin address or transaction history in order to show their reserves. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin Versus Bonds</p><p>In 1949 Benjamin Graham, a British-born American economist, professor and investor, published „The Intelligent Investor“, which is considered one of the founding books of value investing and a classic of financial literature. One of his tenets is that a "balanced portfolio" should consist of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, as he believed bonds protect investors from significant risk in the stock markets. <br><br></p><p>While much of what Graham described then still makes sense today, I argue that bonds, particularly government bonds, have lost their place as a hedge in a portfolio. Bond yields cannot keep up with monetary inflation and our monetary system, of which bonds are a part, is systematically at risk. </p><p>This is because the financial health of many of the governments that form the heart of our monetary and financial system is at risk. When government balance sheets were in decent shape, the implied risk of default by a government was almost zero. That is for two reasons. Firstly, their ability to tax. Secondly, and more importantly, their ability to print money to pay down its borrowings. In the past that argument made sense, but eventually printing money has become a “credit boogie man”, as explained by <a href="https://rockstarinnercircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Why-Every-Fixed-Income-Investor-Needs-To-Consider-Bitcoin-As-Portfolio-Insurance.pdf">Greg Foss</a>, </p><p>Governments are circulating more money than ever before. Data from the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the US, shows that a broad measure of the stock of dollars, known as M2, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Onyz">rose from $15.4 trillion</a> at the start of 2020 to $21.18 trillion by the end of December 2021. The increase of $5.78 trillion equates to 37.53% of the total supply of dollars. This means that the dollar's monetary inflation rate has averaged well over 10% per year over the last 3 years. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us">U.S. Treasury Bonds are yielding less.</a> </p><figure>

In addition, there is the risk of a systematic failure. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/read-516-conclusion-of-the-long-term-debt-cycle/id1359544516?i=%201000517163396">The global financial system is irreversibly broken</a> and bonds as a foundation of it, are at high risk.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjGd9jHDy3a/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D">There is an irresponsible amount of credit in the market</a>. In recent decades, central banks have had very loose debt policies and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjGd9jHDy3a/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D">nation states have incurred large amounts of debt</a>. Argentina and Venezuela have already defaulted. There is a possibility that more countries will default on their debt.

This dynamic built the foundation of the infamous 60/40 portfolio — <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/united-states-will-back-dollar-with-bitcoin">until that reality </a>finally collapsed in March 2020 when central banks decided to flood the market with money. The attempt to stabilize bonds will only lead to an increased demand for bitcoin over time. </p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/grahamprinciples.asp">Graham's philosophy was first and foremost, </a>to preserve capital, and then to try to make it grow. With bitcoin it is possible to store wealth in a self sovereign way with absolutely zero counterparty or credit risk. </p><h2>Bitcoin Versus Real Estate </h2><p>Given the high levels of monetary inflation in recent decades, keeping money in a savings account is not enough to preserve the value of money. As a result, <a href="https://businessday.ng/business-economy/article/two-reasons-real-estate-is-worlds-most-preferred-store-of-wealth/#:~:text=Over%2067%20percent%20of%20the,to%20a%20consulting%20firm%2C%20McKinsey.">many hold a significant portion of their wealth in real estate</a>, which has become one of the preferred stores of value. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/why-bitcoin-is-digital-real-estate#:~:text=As%20digital%20property%2C%20bitcoin%20has,can%20buy%20and%20hold%20bitcoin.">In this capacity, bitcoin competes with real estate</a>, the properties associated with bitcoin make it an ideal store of value. The supply is finite, it is easily portable, divisible, durable, fungible, censorship-resistant and noncustodial. Real estate cannot compete with bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin is rarer, more liquid, easier to move and harder to confiscate. It can be sent anywhere in the world at almost no cost at the speed of light. Real estate, on the other hand, is easy to confiscate and very difficult to liquidate in times of crisis, as recently illustrated in Ukraine, where <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html">many turned to bitcoin to protect their wealth, accept transfers and donations, and meet daily needs</a>. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=mP0f2s39GDs">In a recent interview with Nik Bhatia, Michael Saylor</a> detailed the downsides of real estate as a store of value asset. As explained by Saylor, real estate in general needs a lot of attention when it comes to maintenance. Rent, repairs, property management, high costs arise with real estate. Commercial real estate for example, is very capital intensive and therefore uninteresting for most people. Furthermore, attempts to make the asset more accessible have also failed, with second tier real estate investments such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) falling short of actually holding the asset.</p><p>As Bitcoin (digital property) continues its adoption cycle, it may replace real estate (physical property) as the preferred store of value. As a result, the value of physical property may collapse to utility value and no longer carry the monetary premium of being used as a store of value. Going forward, bitcoin's return will be many times greater than real estate, as bitcoin is just at the <a href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/bitcoin-adoption-curve-w-croesus/">beginning of its adoption cycle</a>. In addition, we will most likely not see the same type of returns on real estate investments as we have in the past. Since 1971, house prices have already <a href="https://frisby.substack.com/p/what-really-causes-inflation-heres?r=1o6vt&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">increased nearly 70 times</a>. Beyond that, as Dylan LeClair points out in his article-turned podcast, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/read-516-conclusion-of-the-long-term-debt-cycle/id1359544516?i=1000517163396">“Conclusion Of The Long-Term Debt Cycle”</a>, governments tend to tax citizens at times like this. Real estate is easily taxed and difficult to move outside of one jurisdiction. Bitcoin cannot be arbitrarily taxed. It is seizure and censorship resistant outside of the domain of any one jurisdiction. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin Versus ETFs<br></p><p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) emerged out of index investing, which utilizes a passive investment strategy that requires a manager to only ensure that the fund's holdings match those of a benchmark index. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_bogle.asp">In 1976, Jack Bogle,</a> founder of the Vanguard Group, launched the first index fund, the Vanguard 500, which tracks the returns of the S&amp;P 500. Today, ETFs manage well over $10 trillion<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_bogle.asp">.</a> Bogle had a tenet: active stock picking is a pointless exercise. I recall him stating multiple times in his interviews that over a lifespan, there is only a 3% chance that a fund manager can consistently outperform the market. He concluded that average investors would find it difficult or impossible to beat the market, which led him to prioritize ways to reduce expenses associated with investing and to offer effective products that enable investors to participate in economic growth and save. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_bogle.asp">Index funds require fewer trades to maintain their portfolios than funds with more active management</a> schemes and therefore tend to produce more tax-efficient returns<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_bogle.asp">.</a><em> The concept of an ETF is good, but bitcoin is better. </em>You can cover a lot of ground through an ETF, but you still have to limit yourself to one index, industry, or region. However, when you buy bitcoin, you buy a human productivity index. Bitcoin is like an “ETF on steroids”. Let me explain : <br><br>The promise of Bitcoin should at least be on everyone's lips by now. A decentralized computer network (Bitcoin) with its own cryptocurrency (bitcoin), which, as a peer-to-peer network, enables the exchange and, above all, the storage of value. It is the best money we have and the base protocol for the most efficient transaction network there is (Lightning Network). It is very likely that Bitcoin will become the dominant network for transactions and store of value in the not too distant future. At that point, it will act as an index of global productivity. The more productive we are, the more value we create, the more transactions are executed, the more value needs to be stored, the higher the demand for bitcoin, the higher the bitcoin price. I've come to the conclusion that instead of using an ETF to track specific indices, I can use bitcoin to participate in the productivity of all of humanity. As you might expect, bitcoin's returns have outperformed all ETFs since its inception.<br><br></p><h2>Bitcoin Returns Versus ETFs Returns</h2><p>The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust is the largest and oldest ETF in the world. It is designed to track the S&amp;P 500 stock market index. The performance over the last decade (October 26, 2012 to October 25, 2022) was 168.0%, which translates to an average annual return of 16.68%. Not bad, especially given that all an investor had to do was hold.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>However, over the same period, bitcoin‘s performance was: 158,382.362%. More than 200% per annum. We've all heard the phrase that past performance is no indicator of future performance, that may be true. But that is not the case with bitcoin. The higher a stock goes the riskier it becomes, because of the P/E ratio. Not bitcoin. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/read-516-conclusion-of-the-long-term-debt-cycle/id1359544516?i=1000517163396">When bitcoin increases in price,</a> it becomes less risky to allocate to, because of liquidity, size and global dominance. The Bitcoin Network has now reached a size where it WILL last (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect#:~:text=The%20Lindy%20effect%20(also%20known,proportional%20to%20their%20current%20age.">Lindy Effect</a>).</p><p>We can therefore conclude that bitcoin is likely to continue to outperform ETFs going forward. </p><p>Bitcoin has other advantages over an ETF. First, it has a lower cost structure. Second, the latter is a basket of securities held by a third party. You are not free to dispose of your ETFs. If your bank, for whatever reason, decides to close your account, your ETFs are gone too. Bitcoin, on the other hand, cannot be taken away from you or denied access so easily. Additionally, bitcoin can be moved across the internet at will at the speed of light, making confiscation nearly impossible.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Bitcoin is the best wealth preservation technology for the digital age. An absolutely scarce digital native bearer asset with no counterparty risk that cannot be inflated and is easily transportable. A digital store of value, transferable on the world’s most powerful computer network. Considering that the Bitcoin network could theoretically store all of the world’s wealth (Global wealth reached a record high of $530 trillion in 2021, <a href="https://www.bcg.com/press/9june2022-global-wealth-grew-double-digits-to-530-trillion">according to the Boston Consulting Group</a>), it may well be the most efficient way we humans have found to store value ever. By holding bitcoin your wealth is going to be protected, likely increasing it by 10x,100x, maybe 500x, during this early monetization process.<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/read-516-conclusion-of-the-long-term-debt-cycle/id1359544516?i=1000517163396"> If you hold out for the next few decades</a>. </p><p>In closing, I'd like to revisit Jack Bogle, who was a huge influence on me. As described by <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/the-express-podcast-episode-87-5322901">Eric Balchunas</a>, Bogle‘s life work is addition by subtraction. Getting rid of the management fees, getting rid of the turnover, getting rid of the brokers, getting rid of the human emotion and the bias. His entire life's work had been in a similar direction, and as such, I think bitcoin fits well with his investment ethos. Bogle’s primary philosophy was “common sense” investing. He told Reuters in 2012. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/jack-bogle-founder-of-vanguard-group-and-creator-of-the-index-fund-dies-at-age-89.html">“Most of all, you have to be disciplined</a> and you have to save, even if you hate our current financial system. Because if you don’t save, then you’re guaranteed to end up with nothing.<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/jack-bogle-founder-of-vanguard-group-and-creator-of-the-index-fund-dies-at-age-89.html">”</a> Bitcoin is very similar to what Bogle envisioned with passive mutual funds. A long term savings vehicle for investors to place their disposable income with low cost and little risk. Don't be distracted by bitcoin's volatility or negative press, to quote Jack Bogle: <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/John-C-Bogle/dp/1119404304">stay in the course</a>. We're just getting started, stay humble and stack sats.

This was only two years after delegates at the Constitutional Convention explicitly fought to include the “<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-10/#:~:text=No%20State%20shall%20enter%20into,Contracts%2C%20or%20grant%20any%20Title">gold and silver clause</a>” in the U.S. Constitution. This clause made its way into Article One of the founding document, where it lives on as stating that individual states were not allowed to “make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.” In other words, the political apparatus of the time, though far more monetarily constrained than our present-day Leviathan State, was still able to exert its will over the energy sector.</p><p>To be fair, tariffs are easier for a government to enact than subsidies, since only the latter requires the government to have money to spare. But history shows subsidies, too, have existed before the fiat standard went into full effect in 1971. For example, the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10821#:~:text=Congress%20responded%20in%201957%20by,readily%20available%20within%20those%20limits.">Price-Anderson Act of 1957</a> forced the federal government to subsidize nuclear energy by paying for the damages incurred by a nuclear disaster. </p><p>Hydropower, too, has been federally subsidized since at least the 1890s, though quantifying the size of these subsidies is challenging. Earth Track, a think tank that works to standardize energy subsidy data, estimates that the <a href="https://www.dbl.vc/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/What-Would-Jefferson-Do-2.4.pdf">U.S. federal government has provided about $2.7 billion (in 2010 dollars)</a> to hydropower from the nation’s inception until 2010. Naturally, this timespan covers a range of different monetary regimes.</p><h2>Government Meddling In Money</h2><p>As much certainty as many in the Bitcoin community have about bitcoin becoming the next global reserve asset, governments are unique institutions and can damage our relationship with money, <em>even after bitcoin becomes the new gold</em>.</p><p>Governments also wield the threat of violence and incarceration via the military-industrial complex to retain economic power.</p><p>For example, imagine that the U.S. government/central bank accepts the new bitcoin monetary regime and even holds it on its balance sheet. Surely by this time, the global economic order will have vastly changed for the better — however, if governments are still around, they are likely still using the threat of violence and/or incarceration to collect taxes. To keep some <em>Layer 2</em> fiat currency alive, all they have to do is mandate that taxes be paid in said fiat currency. People will then have no choice but to obtain this currency in order to hand it over to the tax man. </p><p>To be sure, there are several reasons that such a scheme may not work. For one, “competition” between governments might pressure them to ease up on forcing fiat currencies on citizens who are using Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based Layer 2 technologies in their daily lives. Secondly, ideological pressure from citizens might pressure politicians to give up on creating their own fiat currencies for fear of career suicide. And finally, governments themselves may view such a scheme as being more trouble than it is worth, since a Bitcoin-based economy has the potential to grow at a much greater rate than a Bitcoin-fiat hybrid economy would.</p><h2>We Must Remain Vigilant</h2><p>With respect to both energy and money, the government may still intervene after bitcoin has become the next global reserve asset and after Bitcoin mining has forever improved our relationship with money. In this sense, Bitcoin’s inevitable victory is only the beginning — we may still have to fend off meddling bureaucrats. To be sure, freedom-loving Bitcoiners will be in a much better position to do so then than we are now. Nevertheless, we must not rest on our laurels.</p><p>What can we do to truly exorcize the State from money and energy? The same thing that we do now: <em>explain </em>our ideas. </p><p>We want a free market in energy so that the most cost-effective forms of energy are discovered and made profitable over inefficient alternatives. Furthermore, subsidies, tariffs and regulations in the energy sector hamper innovation. For all we know, absent so much intervention throughout the centuries, our world would be powered by cold fusion, oceans and nuclear energy by now. </p><p>And government-imposed money, even if somehow backed by bitcoin, would throw sand in the gears of capital accumulation and economic calculation. The cost of accumulating capital would rise, since we’d need to keep some garbage money in our back pocket for tax season. In other words, the production of all sorts of goods and services would never come to pass, since they’d no longer be affordable. And entrepreneurs' ability to calculate profits or losses becomes more difficult, since there is no longer a single immutable measuring stick (bitcoin), but also an unpredictable fiat currency still trading alongside Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation.</p><p>Our job will not be finished, even after Bitcoin wins the money game and Bitcoin mining wins the energy game, as <em>governments</em> won’t quit. But our ideas will be so much easier to sell by that point, that I, for one, am looking forward to the battles ahead.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Will Szamosszegi.

    </figure><p>After many years of development and the successful routing of socialists, evil CIA proponents of “Democracy”, cowards and soft-skinned, fat, virtue-signaling infiltrators, Bitcoin is stronger than ever, growing in many surprising and encouraging ways and confounding people who can’t think.</p><p>The stage is now set for Bitcoin to totally replace fiat online and offline as the main way people spend. The infallible Bitcoin network and consumer-grade Bitcoin tools are spreading like wildfire in every direction as people wake up to what this new network can do for them and how fiat is inflating under their feet, just as people woke up to what the web could do, and that they didn’t need the post office any more.</p><p>The greatest explosion of Bitcoin users will be on mobile phone platforms where Wallet of Satoshi, Samourai Wallet, Breez, Muun, Phoenix, Pine, and BlueWallet are the vanguard of a new class of applications in the emerging <em>“Consumer Bitcoin”</em> sector.</p><p>Very few people understand the enormous impact <em>Consumer Bitcoin</em> is going to have on the way things are ordered in the world, and certainly, the list of selfish and ignorant bad actors listed above are either incapable of imagining it, and if not, are actively against it under orders to prop up the unethical, unsustainable, and evil fiat status quo.</p><p>Thankfully not all people are driven by fear of the new, or take their marching orders from violent psychopaths. This is manifestly clear in the case of El Salvador, the surprise market leader that is forging ahead fastest and most effectively to switch from the money of mass murder to the money of peace, “Bitcoin”. Not only are they embedding Bitcoin deeply into the economy there, they are actively educating other countries to help them remove the yoke of fiat and the murderous democracy boosters.</p><p>One of the countries attending the historic summit in San Salvador was the mighty Nigeria, which, should it heed the advice and learning accumulated there, could take its rightful place as the economic center of the continent of Africa. Rather than settling on the racist-inspired “Afro” currency, it could settle on bitcoin as the unifying, provably fair, and economically sound “lingua franca of money” for all citizens in African nations — bringing extraordinary economic benefits to all the people who live on that continent, as well as the long-overdue permanent removal of toxic Western influences.</p><p>Democracy created fiat. It is that fiat philosophy (created by <a href="https://www.conservapedia.com/John_Maynard_Keynes_and_pederasty">a pedophile, John Maynard Keynes</a>) that was a key factor in the ruin of the economies of the African continent. By adopting bitcoin, fiat will cease to have power over 1,404,827,471 people, setting them on a path to prosperity and proper order. Bitcoin has the power to defang the unnatural blood-sucking viper that injects poison into the economies of Africa and drains blood from the people.</p><p>Voting doesn’t make fiat ethical. Voting doesn’t trump math. Anyone who is for voting as the way to select how a monetary system should work is anti-Bitcoin, and certainly, no Nigerian should listen to a Washington wonk who desires all nations to be Cargo Cult copies of the West and its unethical, evil, unbalanced, and unworkable systems of control.</p><p>“Democratic” doesn’t equal fair, proper, or right. It doesn’t ensure just outcomes, or restrain the State from committing mass murder. Democratically overproduced fiat is the fuel that powered the mass murder “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y&amp;ab_channel=USNationalArchives">Military Industrial Complex</a>” that ravaged the 20th century. Now, with bitcoin in place as the world’s money, outrages like this cannot happen again because there simply and literally is no money for it.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Everyone who understands Bitcoin and what it was designed to do does not argue about this. There is no argument to be made against it. The time of arguing is over. The lying, mass-murdering, racist democracy boosters (some of whom pretend to be “for Bitcoin”) will not be able to change the inevitable outcome. The producer of the form and arbiter of the function of money has been the root problem for generations. There will be no more debate. The die is already cast. Anyone arguing about Keynesianism vs Bitcoin, democracy vs free markets or any other distraction is delusional; reality is going to be asserted and imposed on the market and there is nothing you can do about it.</p><p>How and why is this so, and what is it about Bitcoin in particular that makes any of this predictable? Doesn’t the price of bitcoin and how it fluctuates refute these extravagant claims? <em><strong>Are they</strong></em><em> extravagant claims?</em></p><p>Bitcoin is a very new technology, even though the software and math concepts that it brings to life are decades old. The double-spending problem has been solved; this means that it is possible to use a digital “certificate” to stand in the place of money and be sure that as long as you hold it no one else can spend that “certificate” other than you. This is an unprecedented paradigm shift, the implications of which are not yet fully understood, and for which the tools do not yet exist to fully take advantage of this new idea.</p><p>This new technology requires some new thinking when it comes to developing businesses that are built upon it. In the same way that the pioneer providers of email did not correctly understand the service they were selling for many years, new and correct thinking about Bitcoin is needed, and will emerge, so that it reaches its full potential and becomes ubiquitous.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The original Hotmail Interface.<br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Hotmail used familiar technologies (the web browser and email) to create a better way of accessing and delivering email; the idea of using an email client like Outlook Express has been completely superseded by web interfaces and email “in the cloud” that provides many advantages over a dedicated client with your mail in your own local storage.</p><p>Bitcoin, which will transform the way you transfer money, needs to be understood on its own terms, and not just as an online form of money. Thinking about bitcoin as money is as absurd as thinking about email as another form of sending letters by post; one not only replaces the other but it profoundly changes the way people send and consume messages. It is not a simple substitution or one-dimensional improvement of an existing idea or service.</p><p>As I have explained previously, <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=3135"><strong>Bitcoin is not money</strong></a>. Bitcoin is <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=3166"><strong>a protocol</strong></a>. If you treat it in this way, with the correct assumptions, you can start the process of putting Bitcoin in a proper context, allowing you to make rational suggestions about the sort of services that might be profitable based on it.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYzMDEwOTIyNzAyNTEz/image16.png" height="521" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Every part of Bitcoin is text. It is always text, and never at any point ceases to be text. This is a fact, and as text, it is protected under the free speech provisions of the constitutions of civilized nations with guaranteed, irrevocable rights.<br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>If Bitcoin is a protocol and not money (it is), then setting up currency exchanges that mimic real-world money, stock and commodity exchanges to trade in it is not the sole means of discovering its price. You would not set up an email exchange to discover the value of email services, and the same thing applies to Bitcoin.</p><p>Staying with this train of thought, when you type in an email on your Gmail account, you are inputting your “letter”. You press send, it goes through your ISP, over the internet, into the ISP of your recipient and then it is outputted on your recipient’s machine. The same is true of Bitcoin; you input money on one end through a service and then send the bitcoin to your recipient, without an intermediary to handle the transfer. Once Bitcoin does its job of moving your <a href="http://www.weusecoins.com/globe-Bitcoin/">value across the globe</a> to its recipient it needs to be “read out”, i.e., turned <em>back into money</em>, in the same way that your letter is displayed to its recipient in an email.</p><p>In the email scenario, once the transfer happens and the email you have received conveys its information to you, it has no use other than to be a record of the information that was sent (accounting), and you archive that information. Bitcoin does this accounting on the blockchain for you, and a good service built on it will store extended transaction details for you locally, but what you need to have as the recipient of bitcoin is <em>services </em>or <em>goods </em>not bitcoin itself.</p><p>Bitcoin’s true nature is as an instant way to pay (despite not being money) anywhere in the world. It is not an investment, and holding on to it in the hopes that it will become valuable is like holding on to an email or a PDF in the hopes it will become valuable in the future without simultaneously investing in the companies that provide access to it for consumers doesn’t make any sense. Of course, you <em>can</em> hold on to bitcoin and watch its value go up, and its value <em>will </em>go up, but you need to have guts to weather the violent waves of selling and buying as the transition to an all-bitcoin economy gets under way.</p><p>Despite the fact that you can’t double spend them and each one is unique, bitcoin have no inherent value, unlike a book or any physical object. They cannot appreciate in value. Mistaken thinking about Bitcoin has spread because <em>it behaves like money</em>, due to the fact it cannot be double spent. Misrepresentation of Bitcoin’s true nature has masked its dual nature of being digital and not double-spendable.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYzMDEwNjU0NTk0NTY1/image8.jpg" height="465" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Razzles. They start as a candy, and then end as a gum. Before you chew them, which are they? A candy, or a gum?<br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Bitcoin is digital, with all the qualities of information that make information non-scarce. It sits in a new place that oscillates between the goods of the physical world and the infinitely abundant digital world of information, belonging exclusively to the digital world but having the characteristics of both. This is why it has been widely misunderstood and why a new approach is needed to design businesses around it.</p><p>All of this goes some way to explain why the price of buying bitcoin at the exchanges <strong>doesn’t matter for the consumer</strong>. If the cost of buying bitcoin goes to 1¢, this doesn’t change the amount of money that comes out at the other end of a transfer. As long as you redeem your bitcoin immediately after the transfer into either goods or currency, the same value comes out at the other end no matter what you paid for the bitcoin when you started the process.</p><p>Think about it this way. Let us suppose that you want to send a long text file to another person. You can either send it as it is, or you can compress it with zip. The size of a document file when it is zipped can be <a href="http://file-compression-software-review.toptenreviews.com/file-compression-software-compression-test.html">up to 87% smaller</a> than the original. When we transpose this idea to Bitcoin, the compression ratio is the price of bitcoin at an exchange. If bitcoin trades for $100, and you want to buy something from someone in India for $100 you need to buy 1 bitcoin to get that $100 to India. If the price of bitcoin is 1¢ then you need 10,000 bitcoin to send $100 dollars to India. These would be expressed as compression ratios of 1:1 and 10,000:1 respectively.</p><p>The same $100 value is sent to India, whether you use 10,000 or 1 bitcoin. The price of bitcoin <em>is irrelevant to the value that is being transmitted</em>, in the same way that zip files do not “care” what is inside them; Bitcoin and zip are dumb protocols that do a job. As long as the value of bitcoin does not go to zero, it will have the same utility as if the value were very “high”.</p><p>Bearing all of this in mind, it’s clear that <a href="https://medium.com/@beautyon_/azteco-bitcoin-for-the-masses-fc17f8ca1df0">new services to facilitate the rapid, frictionless conversion into</a> and out of bitcoin are needed to allow it to function in a manner that is true to its nature.</p><p>The current business models of exchanges are not addressing Bitcoin’s nature correctly. They are using a twentieth-century model of stock, commodity, and currency exchanges and superimposing this onto Bitcoin. Interfacing with these exchanges is non-trivial, and for the ordinary user a daunting prospect. In some cases, you have to wait up to seven days to receive a transfer of your fiat currency after it has been cashed out of your account from bitcoin. While this is not a fault of the exchanges, it represents a very real impediment to Bitcoin acting in its nature and providing its complete value.</p><p>Imagine this; you receive an email from across the world, and you are notified of the fact by being displayed the subject line in your browser. You then <em>apply </em>to your ISP to have this email delivered to you and you have to wait seven days for it to arrive in your physical mailbox.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYzMDEwNjU0NTI5MjAx/image11.jpg" height="278" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The very idea is completely absurd, and yet, this is exactly what is happening with bitcoin, for no technical reason whatsoever.</p><p>It is clear that there needs to be a rethink of the services that are growing around Bitcoin, along with a rethink of what the true nature of Bitcoin is. Rethinking services is a normal part of entrepreneurship and we should expect business models to fail and early entrants to fall by the wayside as the ceaseless iterations and pivoting progress, just as it was in the early days of the web.</p><p>Bearing all of this in mind, focusing on the price of bitcoin at exchanges using a business model that is inappropriate for this new software simply is not rational; it’s like putting a methane-breathing canary as a detector in a mine full of oxygen-breathing humans. The bird dies even though nothing is wrong with the air; the miners rush to evacuate, leaving the exposed gold seams behind, thinking that they are all about to be wiped out when all is actually fine.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Day traders speculating on bitcoin from home cause the price to oscillate. It’s an artificial signal that has nothing to do with demand for bitcoin and its circulation as an economic tool to facilitate commerce.<br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Bitcoin, and the ideas behind it are here to stay. As the number of people downloading the client and using it increases, like Hotmail, it will eventually reach critical mass and then spread exponentially through the internet. When that happens, the correct business models will spontaneously emerge, as they will become obvious — in the same way that Hotmail, Gmail, Facebook, cellular phones, and instant messaging seem like second nature.</p><p>In the future. I imagine that very few people will speculate on the value of bitcoin, because even though that might be possible, and even profitable, there will be more money to be made in providing easy-to-use Bitcoin services that take full advantage of what Bitcoin is.</p><p>One thing is for sure; speed will be of the essence in any future Bitcoin business model. The start-ups that provide instant satisfaction on both ends of the transaction are the ones that are going to succeed. Even though the volatility of the price of bitcoin is bound to stabilize, since it has no use in and of itself, getting back to money or goods instantly will be a sought-after characteristic of any business built on Bitcoin.</p><p>The needs of Bitcoin businesses provide many challenges in terms of performance, security, and new thinking. Out of these challenges will come new practices and software that we can only just imagine as they come over the horizon.</p><p>Finally, when there is no more fiat, and <a href="https://medium.com/@beautyon_/bitcoin-adoption-and-conway-s-game-of-life-54ca71db7b88">the chaotic transition zone between fiat and Bitcoin</a> has been abolished, then everything will be priced in bitcoin, and there will be no volatility, because no one uses anything other than bitcoin to buy or sell. If you know any chemistry, this will be like a reaction’s reagents reaching equilibrium; you can shake it and stir it all you like; the reaction is over and you’re left with the inert product.</p><p>Right now, compared to the amount of fiat in the world, bitcoin can expand and contract very rapidly over a large range, because it is small in volume. It can expand to what for many is an unimaginably high price, and then shrink down again. As it gets bigger and accumulates more mass (its price expressed in fiat), these fluctuations will become smaller and smaller. Through all of this, bitcoin remains exactly the same; it is its users that are publishing numbers as a signal to react upon that are changing.</p><p>In its essence, this is a struggle between Bitcoiners and liars. The liars who promote democracy and who believe that morality and even rights can come out of a vote.</p><p>The ideas of socialism and democracy are diametrically opposed to the core philosophy of a voluntary peer-to-peer system like Bitcoin. Peer-to-peer systems disintermediate the transfer of information and eliminate the need for an arbitrary governing authority or service provider. Bitcoin, like math, has no philosophy and is neutral.</p><p>Socialism’s basic premise is that “property is theft”, and that all property, goods, and services should be collectively owned for the benefit of all people in a coercive State with no opt-out. Under a socialist system of forced organization, individuals do not have free use of their inherent rights, which are violently suppressed.</p><p>This is an inherently immoral proposition, where one group of people inevitably coalesce into an illegitimate ruling class to control and administer other people “for their own good” — the good of the collective. Even if this aggregation of power were not the case, no man or group of men has the right to force another man to relinquish his property.</p><p>Libertarians understand that there is no such thing as “the rights of the collective” and that only a living individual human has rights. Chief among these rights, the “root right”, is the right of <strong>property</strong>. Anyone who contends that Bitcoin is a socialist idea is fundamentally mistaken about how Bitcoin works and its true nature, or is trying to redefine socialism so that it can fit in with and be the standard-bearer of the inevitable rise of Bitcoin. You can detect this when you read the phrase, “my idea of socialism is”, which means that the speaker wants to abandon the bad smell of socialism and rebrand the word to mean something that it is not, so that he can remain “a committed socialist” and be a part the real world at the same time.</p><p>Bitcoin is the antithesis of socialism. Bitcoin transfers, and the ownership of bitcoin and the rules governing exchanges are not administered by a central State authority — unlike a system designed by a socialist, where who can own what, how much of it, and what can be done with it is absolutely regulated by a group of violent bureaucrats.</p><p>Bitcoin is a strict peer-to-peer protocol, and not a centralized system under the control of arbitrary rules or fallacious economic ideas like Keynesianism. In its essence, Bitcoin acts like a law of nature (powered by cryptography) and it does not and cannot care about your philosophy or ideology. By dint of this alone, Bitcoin cannot be called socialist or have a political philosophy attributed to it any more than an inanimate object or a fundamental force of nature can. It is designed to do one thing, it does that one thing, and that one thing is not inherently political; only Bitcoin’s users have political ideas that they try, and fail, to superimpose upon it. Bitcoin is neutral, like a hammer or a neutron or a handgun.</p><p>Bitcoin is a stateless tool that is purely voluntary. You may or may not use bitcoin at your own discretion. No one forces you to be a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem or to abide by its rules. How much bitcoin you accumulate in exchange for goods and services is entirely up to you and your trading partners, and what you spend your bitcoin on is entirely up to you.</p><p>The users of Bitcoin do not “have a say” in what you can or cannot do with them. There is no State, statist, or socialist that can tell you that you may not collect as many bitcoin as you can, or that your bitcoin belong to the collective, or that you must hand over a percentage of them to the State “for the good of the people”.</p><p>Users of Bitcoin, by default, are freely associating people, choosing freely to accept the rules of the Bitcoin system. This is the complete opposite of socialism, which is the negation of individual liberty, the abolition of free choice, and the elimination of property rights.</p><p>Anyone who claims to be a socialist while advocating for the widespread adoption of bitcoin is de facto acting against their socialist principles and desire to create a world where collective property ownership and centralized direction of capital is enforced by violence.</p><p>In a world where money transfers are made entirely through bitcoin, a socialist state will at the very least have a huge amount of trouble compelling people to hand over their money to the State by force. As usual, the socialist collectivists will resort to threats, violence, imprisonment, confiscation of real property, and any other immoral and disgusting means they can come up with to steal money from people. This prompts the question, “how can an avowed socialist advocate the adoption of bitcoin when it has the potential to destroy his violent Statist utopia from the inside out?”<em>.</em></p><p>It’s an interesting question. I suspect that many socialists who advocate the adoption of bitcoin are having a profound internal struggle with the emergence of not only Bitcoin but of the internet itself and its astonishing, undeniable example of stateless cooperation between men that has changed the world and had the effect of benefiting everyone.</p><p>The internet has brought the entire body of human knowledge to everyone who uses it, at a cost that is near zero. It has also rendered practically redundant the state monopoly over telephone systems and postal systems. Anyone who still believes that “we” need the State in the face of these revelations is completely insane, or is on the road to abandoning socialism, or is sticking his fingers in his ears, unable to face the facts of this matter.</p><p>Mankind is better off in every way without the State. The paradigm shifts brought about by the internet in publishing, music distribution, postal mail, telephony, and the new, unprecedented services created by the connectivity of the internet are proof of this. Each of these industries has been regulated by the State in the offline world, and now that they are running in the online world without State regulation they are more efficient and beneficial by orders of magnitude. The only people who are against this are the vested interests, the buggy whip makers and the socialists, and every time they try and exert their influence they inconvenience and damage people and cause them to expend time and money where they would otherwise not have to.</p><p>The next great shift on the internet is going to be the complete disruption of the sclerotic bank-mediated money transfer systems in favor of internet-facilitated money transfers that remove banks entirely from the process flow. This event will cause a great acceleration in the transaction rate of commerce worldwide, will defund the socialist states and be of great benefit to everyone, everywhere.</p><p>All the attempts the banks are making now to embrace the internet and peer-to-peer payments systems will eventually fail, as long as people are free to develop software, release it, and freely interface with money at will. This is why PayPal had banned transfers that touch bitcoin in any way; they knew that Bitcoin is completely superior to PayPal, and that it constituted an existential threat to their business. PayPal allowing its system to be used to make payments in exchange for bitcoin is allowing blood vessels to feed a cancerous tumor. Bitcoin is cancer to PayPal and they must kill it at any cost.</p><p>The PayPal response to the inevitable peer-to-peer payment ecosystem in the form of their “Blue Dorito” suffers from the fatal elixir of powdered friction, arbitrary rules, suppression, and regulation by the State, all made soluble with a profound lack of imagination — none of which Bitcoin suffers from… but that is beyond the scope of this post. PayPal (and Coinbase) will eventually become the MySpace of moving money because they’re both wedded to a pre-internet mode of thinking when it comes to payments, and they are in an abusive shotgun wedding with the State.</p><p>Bitcoin is going to be the vehicle for services that make this disruption come to pass. Once critical mass is reached, Bitcoin will be completely unstoppable. We need only look at the French restrictions on 128bit SSL and the way they dropped them when it became the standard protection for e-commerce transactions. The first sign of this shift will be the adoption of Bitcoin as an accessory service on one of the major money transfer service providers, offering bitcoin transfers to the computer illiterate.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin, <em>by design</em>, is not democratic. No matter how many times you try and assert that it is, it is not, <em>and it never will be</em>. And it is also not socialist, as I just clearly explained.</p><p>Removing all of the fascinating, revolutionary technical details, the core of Bitcoin is that it is <em><strong>voluntary</strong></em> and the transactions and ledger entries made with it are mediated by a computer program. <em><strong>You choose</strong></em>, as a free human being, to download the required software, use Bitcoin and be bound by the network’s fixed rules.</p><p>There is <strong>no voting</strong> involved, <strong>no coercion</strong>, <strong>no obligation</strong>, social or otherwise to use it. You are not even required to donate your CPU and bandwidth to the Bitcoin network in exchange for using it. When you use Bitcoin, you <em>volunteer</em> to use it on its terms. It is as simple as that.</p><p>Lest you have any un-clarity about this, making a choice in and of itself <strong>is not “democratic”</strong>. More on that below, but to understand why Bitcoin is not democratic, we need to understand what democracy is.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYzMDEwNjU0Mzk3OTU3/image4.jpg" height="426" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p><strong>What is “democracy”? </strong>Democracy is a coercive political system where people in a geographic area are “enfranchised”. This means that they all have a “vote”, allocated one vote per man, that they can cast in “elections”, where the accumulator of the most votes wins, and then that person takes “office”. No matter what the winner thinks or his plans are, he gets extraordinary, unconstrained, extra-judicial, extra-ethical powers over the “electorate” and near total immunity from the law.</p><p>That is <strong>all</strong> that democracy is.</p><p>I shall leave out that once in power, these people steal, murder, lie, corrupt, and poison to their black heart’s content, with almost absolute certainty that they will get away with whatever evil they do, no matter what the scale. In fact, the bigger the scale of their crimes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_expenses_claims_in_the_United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal">the less likely they are</a> to face any justice of any kind, and the more likely they are to be rewarded. And of course, the sole monopoly on the dispensing of justice belongs to the same “democracy” which in effect, polices itself. In civil litigation the guiding principle is that no one may be a judge in his own cause, but in democracy, this is the default. It is an open scandal.</p><p>Now back to Bitcoin. At no point in the Bitcoin process do you have a vote over any aspect of how Bitcoin works, who owns what bitcoin, how they are distributed, transferred, their value, or anything whatsoever to do with its operation. If you don’t like it, you’re free to decline to use it.</p><p>The fact that you can choose one good over another does not mean you are participating in democracy or acting “democratic”. You cannot say that, “Ice cream is democratic”, because you can choose whatever flavor you like in Baskin Robbins or Carvel. Or choose Baskin Robbins over Carvel. You cannot say that choosing a Volkswagen over a Ford Fiesta is, “a democratic choice”. Democracy means only the hermetically sealed one-man-one-vote inherently corrupt and unethical political system. That is it. <em>That is all.</em></p><p>Because millions of people have been brainwashed in government schools to believe that the system of government that educated them is the best, they have been encouraged to misuse the word “democracy” as a synonym for everything good or anything that is beneficial. I have even heard people saying, <em>“that’s very democratic of you”</em> when someone does another person a good turn. This is how distorted the meaning of the word “democracy” has become.</p><p>Bitcoin is a beneficial technology, so quite naturally, these uneducated and dangerous people will use the word “democracy” in association with it, despite it having no relation of any kind, way, shape, or form to democracy. Thinking about it, it is <em>rather good</em> that these people think Bitcoin is democratic. If they understood its <em>true</em> nature, they would hysterically rail against its mass adoption, as they have been trained like dogs to do against any threat to the violent system that has them in a hypnotic spell.</p><p>And these people are <em>very</em> well trained. And totally hypnotized. It should come as no surprise then, that Bitcoin, the software that is going to be of benefit to billions of people on Earth, is being called “democratic”. Sorry to shatter your mesmeric delusions, democracy lovers; Bitcoin <strong>is not democratic,</strong> and using it has <strong>nothing to do with majority rule, force, voting</strong>, or <em>anything</em> that touches democracy in any way. Bitcoin is without your greasy taint or fetid stink.</p><p>The nonsense that a choice in the market is “democratic” stems from the fallacious idea that consumers spending money is somehow a “vote”. It is not. It is an <em>economic choice</em>, <strong>that does not impose any rule over others</strong>, has nothing to do with achieving a majority, etc. Note also how some deranged thinkers misuse the word “voice”. This is the only way that the delusional democracy booster can make an argument — by distorting English until words lose all their meaning. People spending money do not “have a voice” (or as they say in the U.K., <em>“have their say”</em>); they have a <em>choice</em>. Even if they are using fraudulent central-bank-printed paper money, their voice, opinion, or sentiment is <em>irrelevant</em> at the moment of choice and exchange.</p><p>Even if you were to repurpose “the Blockchain” to act as a voter registration and voting system (ironically, it would then <em>truly</em> become a <em>chain</em>; a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGAiW5dOnKo">Chain of Fools</a> that holds people as slaves to morally repugnant, violent, and unethical mob rule). This would not make Bitcoin <em>the money-transport system</em> democratic, it would simply be another “creative” use of the blockchain software — this time for an antisocial and completely evil purpose: enforcing the hold, coercion, and violence of democracy.</p><p>In this nightmare scenario, the miners would become de facto gaolers. Stealing bitcoin would mean that the political system could be bought — literally — for bitcoin. The idea is as nauseating as it is wrong.</p><p>All of this absurd posturing and conflating of Bitcoin with democracy (or socialism), however, is now nothing more than faintly amusing noise. The people who are doing it are as irrelevant as dead men.</p><p>The people who love democracy are going to find out <strong>first-hand</strong> what democracy really means and what it did to them, by virtue of its abrupt absence and the contrast of life before and after democracy. Bitcoin is going to defund the State by absorbing and extinguishing all the fiat currency in the world, so that eventually the the deluded slaves of democracy can vote all day and all night without the votes cast having any effect whatsoever. <a href="https://medium.com/bitcoin-think/the-bitcoin-future-super-cell-london-4505eea1129f">The libertarian society, protected and powered by Bitcoin</a>, will not allow the violent, deluded, and sick devotees of democracy to wage war, steal money, or interfere with voluntary contracts and exchange.</p><p>Bitcoin is not democratic; it is <strong>voluntarist</strong>. No matter what you say or believe, the nature of Bitcoin does not change. You can call it a fruit cake, a leprechaun, cotton candy, a joke, <a href="http://dexterslab.wikia.com/wiki/Koosalagoopagoop">Koosalagoopagoop</a>, or anything else that you fancy. As it is with the ocean, if you dive into it, you <strong>will get wet</strong>. What you <em>want</em> does not come into it. If it is your desire to stay dry, don’t jump in, but you cannot expect to stay dry and go swimming <em>at the same time</em>. Calling Bitcoin democratic when it is not is utterly absurd, and insulting. The world has had quite enough of it and its virus-like variants.</p><p>Finally, Bitcoin doesn’t care what you think. It can’t care about anything. What you think doesn’t matter; that is the ultimate power of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is like a force of nature. You must conform to ethical standards of behavior in the Bitcoin-mediated world, or starve, since the option of violence is taken off of the table. The implications of all of this will only become clear once it is too late for the democracy lovers to stop it, who will be left scratching their heads wondering what happened, why democracy died, and crucially, why everything has not fallen apart…</p><p>…but is now<strong> </strong><em><strong>infinitely better</strong>.</em></p><p>No government on Earth can change Bitcoin. They can either fail or adapt to Bitcoin. By allowing themselves to be transformed by Bitcoin, in a counter-intuitive and astonishing result, they will become more powerful than they ever have been. The benefits Bitcoin will bring to every economy will give unprecedented new tools to governments, not to oppress and destroy, but to do right by the explicit permission of the populace.</p><p>As people adopt Bitcoin, they will be “voting with their money” and moving to a space where the thin-skinned, lying boosters of democracy have no power over anything.</p><p>Bitcoin will eventually absorb all fiat currency in the world as consumer Bitcoin clients like <a href="https://pine.pm/">Pine</a> are installed globally. The jurisdictions that allow companies that facilitate this transformation to work unencumbered are going to be the new financial centers of the 21st century. And if they don’t, the absorption is going to happen in any case.</p><p>Whether or not your aim is to dominate in Bitcoin services as a nation, there is no other rational way to approach this other than abandoning KYC/AML, and Conway’s “Game of Life” provides a neat illustration of why this is so.</p><p>The <strong>Game of Life</strong>, also known simply as <strong>Life</strong>, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automaton </a>devised by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">British</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician">mathematician</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Horton Conway</a> in 1970.</p><p>The world in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> is a two-dimensional grid of square <em>cells</em>, each of which is in one of two possible states, <em>alive</em> or <em>dead</em>. Every cell interacts with its eight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood"><em>neighbors</em></a>, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:</p><ol><li><em>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</em></li><li><em>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</em></li><li><em>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</em></li><li><em>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</em></li></ol><p>Let us now superimpose this simple idea on Bitcoin adoption. Imagine a world where there is total KYC/AML, and it has been running for years, with steady growth in Bitcoin adoption. The illustration below is a picture of this world; it is a grid with one billion cells in it. Each cell is a human being who uses money or bitcoin. If the cell is black, they use bitcoin as money. If the cell is white, they use fiat currency as money.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYzMDEwNjU0MjY2ODg1/kyc-absorption-zone.png" height="526" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>For a cell to turn from white to black (a person starting to use bitcoin), fiat must be converted into bitcoin at a KYC/AML entry point. This happens in a thin line at the <strong>edge</strong> of the fuzzy gray mass, via compliant companies that provide this conversion service.</p><p>Everyone <strong>outside</strong> in the white zone is either unbanked or using only fiat currency and banks. Everyone <strong>inside</strong> the mass in the black zone uses bitcoin. Those in the black zone do not ever engage with KYC/AML, because they <em>already have bitcoin</em>, and regularly send it anywhere, to any person, globally <em>without further permission of any kind.</em></p><p>The central mass increases in size as it absorbs fiat currency. It will keep growing until either it absorbs all fiat currency, or a lower-than-total absorption equilibrium point is reached. A lower-than-total absorption equilibrium could be caused by the Bitcoin network reaching a technical upper limit (like the transaction rate limit, which is now impossible on a practical level thanks to Elizabeth Stark’s Lightning Labs “Layer-2” network) or a psychological or political distortion (banning, taxation, FUD, usability, or some other artificial pressure).</p><p>We can see from this illustration and thought experiment that eventually, there will be a huge number of users who will <strong>never again</strong> need to be KYC-/AML-verified, <em>because their money exists and circulates freely only as bitcoin</em>. This means that inside the Bitcoin ecosystem, KYC/AML is <strong>worthless</strong> after the first conversion. It also becomes immediately clear that any bitcoin <em>leaving</em> the mass <strong>on a peer-to-peer basis</strong> when new bitcoin users are brought in, creates more mass without KYC/AML, and this amount will be very large once the central mass is large.</p><p>This simple illustration shows what will happen as bitcoin absorbs fiat currency. KYC/AML will have a short life, after which it will be worthless as a tool to track people, since a large number of users are in bitcoin and never touch fiat.</p><p>Rather than go through this completely pointless stage of KYC/AML, <a href="https://medium.com/bitcoin-think/our-submission-to-the-british-governments-digital-currencies-call-for-information-160fbf103bbc#.82d3qyz40">a nation with competent leaders will understand the inevitable, and race to attract companies into their jurisdictions by eschewing the regulation of Bitcoin services.</a></p><p>The benefits of the virtuous circle of Bitcoin firms all incorporating and working in the same small area of the same city cannot be overstated. As a long-term strategy, abandoning KYC/AML is the only logical path.</p><p>Inside the absorption zone is where all the businesses touching Bitcoin will operate. That is where Bitcoin “pure play” businesses will flourish, and that means software companies, providing the very important wallet and merchant services, new classes of services built on multisig and the other tools in Bitcoin; powered escrow services, time-triggered conditional payments, and many other things.</p><p>All people, institutions, and governments in the future will be equal peers on the Bitcoin network where no person or entity has any more control over Bitcoin than any other, and everyone has access on the same, provably fair, equal basis.</p><p>Bitcoin is the pure, level playing field where no one can cheat and everyone is guaranteeing the network for the benefit of everyone else. This is not “democratic” as some very stupid people might want to convince you; this is <em>voluntarism in motion.</em></p><p>All corruption comes from the law produced by crony capitalism and democracy and unethical companies using it to distort economics. Under a Bitcoin regime, it will not be possible to print money for any reason whatsoever. That former privilege of the State is permanently revoked in Bitcoin. Now money is allocated by merit alone; you cannot accumulate money if you don’t serve other people. That is true on an individual level, the business level, and the governmental level also. Everyone will have the absolute power to refuse to pay for anything they would rather not pay for. This will become a universal law under Bitcoin.</p><p>In Bitcoin, everyone will have a free choice to be a slave or not, but not with other people’s money. You can <em>voluntarily choose</em> to subordinate yourself to liars, democracy boosters, and warmongers, but y<em>ou can’t forcibly enlist other people and their money</em>. Since most people are not interested in “Spreading Democracy”, demonizing and murdering brown-skinned strangers and other vile, disgusting things, you can be sure that the ills of the 20th century spread by democracy and its evil boosters will come to a sharp, abrupt, permanent, and most welcome end.</p><p>Naturally the question that follows is, “Which of the current nation-states has the best chance of dominating in this Bitcoin-mediated world?”. Oddly enough, the country whose government behaved the worst in the 20th century has the best chance of turning itself around and becoming a beacon of light again. <strong>The United States of America</strong>.</p><p>The Founding Fathers of the greatest country in the history of the world, the United States of America, gifted that nation a system borne of genius, ethics, and subtlety. That astonishing system, when combined with and constrained by Bitcoin, will create a nation that will last longer than the Roman Empire and be more prosperous. All that is required is that it follows the law as laid down by the Founders.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CCqCsmCDdw">Hearings on Bitcoin</a> and its derivatives are being held in the USA on a regular basis, and invariably the expert witnesses fail to properly describe the actual processes going on. If they used the correct language and excluded all analogies, the only possible conclusion would be that <strong>America cannot regulate Bitcoin under its current legal system</strong>. The Constitution guarantees the inalienable rights of American citizens, and therefore Bitcoin is a protected act or practice by virtue of it being a form of published text. The only way Bitcoin can be made regulable is if the Constitution is changed; and that does not mean adding a new Amendment — it means <strong>removing the First Amendment entirely</strong>.</p><p>Inevitably the anti-Bitcoin “protagonists” will face a robust and ultimately successful legal challenge that will remove the possibility of any sort of “BitLicense” or interference from the CTFC, FinCEN, or any other agency. It will also remove any possibility of interference at the State level. The consequence of adhering to the basic law of the United States will cause America to become the center of all Bitcoin business for the entire world, and will cause trillions of dollars worth of e-commerce to flow through the USA.</p><p>Let me explain why this is the case.</p><p>Some say that Bitcoin is money. Others say that it is not money. It doesn’t matter. What does matter are three things: that Bitcoin is, that the Bitcoin network does what it is meant to do completely reliably, and what the true nature of the Bitcoin network and the messages in it are.</p><p>Bitcoin is a database, maintained by a network of peers that monitors and regulates which entries are allocated to what Bitcoin addresses. This is done entirely by transmitting messages that are <em>text</em>, between the computers in the network (known as “nodes”), where cryptographic procedures are executed on these <em>messages in text </em>to verify their authenticity and the identity of the sender and recipient of the message and their position in the public ledger. The messages sent between nodes in the Bitcoin network are human readable, and printable. There is no point in any Bitcoin transaction at which Bitcoin ceases to be <em>text. </em>It is <em>all</em> <em>text</em>, all the time.</p><p>Bitcoin can be printed out onto sheets of paper. This output can take different forms, like machine-readable QR codes, or it can be printed out in the letters A to Z, a to z, and 0 to 9. This means they can be read by a human being, just like “Huckleberry Finn”.</p><p>At the time of the creation of the United States of America, the Founding Fathers of that new country in their deep wisdom and distaste for tyranny, haunted by the memory of the absence of a free press in the countries from which they escaped, wrote into the basic law of that then-young federation of free states, an explicit and unambiguous freedom, the “Freedom of the Press”. This amendment was first because of its central importance to a free society. The First Amendment guarantees that all Americans have the power to exercise their right to publish and distribute anything they like, without restriction or prior restraint.</p><blockquote><p><em>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</em></p></blockquote><p>This single line, forever precludes any law that restricts Bitcoin <strong>in any way</strong>.</p><p>In 1995, the U.S. Government had on the statute books laws that restricted the export of encryption software products from America without a license. These goods are classified as “munitions”. The first versions of the breakthrough Public Key Encryption software <em>“Pretty Good Privacy”, </em>or “PGP”, written by Philip Zimmerman had already escaped the USA via bulletin board systems from the moment it was first distributed, but all copies of PGP outside of the United States were “illegal”. In order to fix the problem of all copies of PGP outside of America being encumbered by this perception, an ingenious plan was put into motion, using the First Amendment as the means of legally making it happen.</p><p>The source code for PGP was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Criminal_investigation">printed out</a>.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYzMDEwNjU0MzMyNTkz/image5.jpg" height="465" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>The original print-out of the PGP source code.</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>It’s as simple as that. Once the source code for PGP was printed in book form, it instantly and more importantly, <em>unambiguously</em>, fell under the protection of the First Amendment. As a binary, the U.S. government ridiculously tried to assert that immaterial software is <em>a device</em>, and not <em>text (software or “binaries” is text that can be run </em><em>on</em><em> devices). </em>Clearly the idea that software is a device is patently absurd, but rather than waste money arguing this point in court, printing out PGP removed all doubt that a First Amendment act was taking place.</p><p>The printed source code was shipped to another country, perfectly legally and beyond challenge, and then transferred to a machine by OCR (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"><em>Optical Character Recognition</em></a><em>, a software tool that can turn a printed page into a text file, removing the need for a person to manually type out a printed page</em>), resulting in a PGP executable that was legally exported from the United States.</p><p>The direct analogy to Bitcoin should be vividly clear to you now. PGP and Bitcoin are both:</p><ol><li>Pieces of software that can be rendered as printed text on paper.</li><li>Software that generates unique blocks of human readable text.</li><li>Designed to generate text that is 100% covered by the First Amendment.</li></ol><p>The purpose of PGP is to absolutely verify the identity of the sender of a message and ensure that the message was not read or changed in transit. The purpose of Bitcoin is to absolutely verify the ability of the owner of a cryptographic key (which is a block of text) that can unlock a ledger entry in the global Bitcoin network. Both of these pieces of software are <em>messaging systems and services </em>that absolutely fall under the First Amendment in every aspect, from the source code used to generate the software clients that do the message signing to the text the compiled clients generate, send, receive, and process.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYyOTA2NTAxMzc1NjY1/bitcoin-is-text.png" height="465" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Bitcoin is <strong>text</strong>. Bitcoin is <strong>speech</strong>. It cannot be regulated in a free country like the USA with guaranteed inalienable rights and a First Amendment that explicitly excludes the act of publishing from government oversight.</p><p>Bitcoin and PGP generate messages that are initiated by their users. Each of the messages that are generated by these two pieces of software are unique. The only bodies of law that could possibly be invoked regarding their output and source code are copyright and patent law respectively. The Bitcoin source is not copyrighted and the core idea of it is not patented, and in any case, none of this has anything to do with the nature of Bitcoin messages, or your right to publish. Typewriters can include patented methods in their construction, and those patents have no bearing on your First Amendment right to publish what you create with a patented tool.</p><p>Copyright gives the generator of these texts privileges under the law imposing fines on someone copying your message without your permission, but copyright law has nothing to do with exporting, regulating, or imposing a tax <em>on the messages themselves</em>, and of course, forbidding the copying of your Bitcoin payment message rather negates the purpose of using Bitcoin.</p><p>Taking all of this into account, if any legislator, regulator, three- or six-letter U.S. agency or other bureaucrat dares to try and regulate Bitcoin, they will be on a hiding to nothing. A legal challenge <a href="https://t.co/HfGxuOmyt6">will be mounted</a>, and will have to be mounted, because if the State can legislate against a single piece of software that generates messages, a legal precedent will be created allowing the U.S. government to regulate <em>all software no matter what it does</em><em>.</em></p><p>Bitcoin’s operation is fundamentally no different to what all email, text messaging, and internet-connected software do: relay messages. The only difference is in the software that tracks how the messages of the sender and recipient relate to each other. Email is no different to Bitcoin, save for the fact that a record of the sender and recipient and content of your email is not stored in a public ledger one against the other. We know it’s stored in a <em>private </em>database, but that’s another story. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=edward+snnowdn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"><em>Wink wink</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Here is <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/bernstein-v-us-dept-justice">another example</a> of case law proving that this reasoning is correct.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In Bernstein v. U.S. Department of Justice, it was established that code is speech and is protected by the First Amendment. This absolutely and unambiguously applies to Bitcoin, with eerie parallels to KYC/AML in Bitcoin. The unconstitutional ITAR requirements are exactly the same as asking Bitcoin traders to register as “Money Transmitters” and seek licenses before they can be paid to transmit text to the Bitcoin network for publication on the public ledger. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found in Bernstein’s favor, and ruled that software <em>was speech</em> protected by the First Amendment and that the government’s regulations preventing its publication were unconstitutional. It is clear to see that Bitcoin falls squarely into the category of protected speech, there is no way around any of this, and the U.S. courts must come to the same conclusion for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is protected speech, and the case law says so explicitly.</p><p>The position that Bitcoin is money is fundamentally wrong, and systems like it have existed for many years without gaining the attention of any three-letter agencies. Take for example <em>FarmVille,</em> the massively popular farm simulation game on Facebook.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>From Wikipedia’s entry on FarmVille.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>This hugely popular game is no different to Bitcoin in nature. <em>FarmBucks</em> exist in a closed system, just as bitcoin does. The only difference is the size of the space where the messages are being sent, and in the case of <em>FarmBucks</em>, the number of users and transactions (messages sent) was large. FarmVille had 83,760,000 monthly active users and <strong>not a single one</strong> was subjected to KYC/AML to exchange fiat for FarmBucks or FarmCash. Why not? What happened to that money? Why weren’t FinCEN or SEC all over that game as they are on ICOs? No one can explain this adequately. This example is very useful as a tool to pull back the curtain on the people who assert that bitcoin is a money and is <strong>fundamentally</strong> different to a money kept in a game. All the rationales they use (mostly in the form of run-on sentences) to explain that the differences are inaccurate, and never address the fundamental processes; if they did, they would have no choice but to conclude that Bitcoin is no more subject to regulation than FarmBucks or PGP are.</p><p>Clearly, allowing legislation to touch Bitcoin means that any software <em>of any kind </em>will suddenly be liable to arbitrary and unconstitutional restriction. It will set a precedent that will be devastating to all software development in the USA, and software is the means by which everything is run, communicated, exchanged, and ordered in modern society. In fact, it is impossible to run a modern society without software.</p><p>Twitter for example, could find itself being regulated; it transmits messages that are no different in nature to the messages that Bitcoin transmits; the only difference being the publicly maintained ledger and application of the messages. In fact, Twitter could turn itself into a Bitcoin company quite easily by adding a few fields to its message <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Example">JSON schema</a> to include a Bitcoin address for each of its users, adding a page to its client, and running its own Bitcoin server pool. Would that extra text suddenly transform Twitter into a bank? Would that suddenly change the nature of each Tweet that is sent on their network, and cause them to be “Money Transmitters”? How is having a Bitcoin address integrated into your Twitter account different to making a promise by hand on Twitter to your followers or in a direct message?</p><p>Essentially, Bitcoin allows you to make written contracts with people without knowing them or signing paper; the network and software takes care of identifying and fulfilling the promise, all with cryptographically signed pieces of text. What the people calling for “BitLicenses” and the absurd, insulting, and totally anti-American “Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act”, are asserting is that because Bitcoin right now has a particular use, it should be exempted from the basic law of the United States of America. That is <strong>completely insane</strong>, and will have unintended consequences that would be <strong>absolutely disastrous</strong> for the American economy since almost everything today is mediated by or touches software.</p><p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin is left to flourish and the market allowed to define its services, means of setting the value and resolving disputes, Bitcoin as an ecosystem will be extremely robust and widespread, just like the internet is today, after having grown for decades without any regulation or oversight from the State.</p><p>Furthermore, as I have said previously, the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/our-submission-to-the-british-governments-digital-currencies-call-for-information-160fbf103bbc">country that does not enact Bitcoin legislation will become the starting point and end points of all Bitcoin transactions</a> globally by first-mover advantage. All other jurisdictions will see Bitcoin passing through them untaxed, and there will be nothing they can do about it, as Bitcoin is an unassailable peer-to-peer network.</p><p>We have seen a similar phenomenon with the legal position of encryption in France. SSL was regulated in France until <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/01/15/france_to_end_severe_encryption/">Dominique Strauss-Khan, former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, removed the restrictions</a>. They knew that “French e-commerce” would take place inside <em>“le pays Roosbeef” </em>if it were not possible to secure French websites with SSL on demand without friction. American Bitcoin businesses (since the end points will be in their jurisdiction) will be taxed on their profits, and this will be a percentage of the trillions of global transactions made on the network for every conceivable and inconceivable purpose.</p><p>The same is true for any other country. The United States looks set to cripple itself by enacting “BitLicenses” and declaring by fiat that bitcoin is a currency, or a commodity, or legal tender. As I describe above, Bitcoin is none of those things by nature, and the myriad number of applications it can be put to is only just being discovered. Our project <a href="https://azte.co/">Azteco</a> is but one of them, with the potential to reach the billions of unbanked people in the world, and provide them with an easy way to access internet e-commerce, worldwide, with a system that makes payment fraud impossible. The potential benefit to the unbanked and the websites that sell goods online and the jurisdictions where those websites operate is without precedent. Only a <em>fool </em>would do something that could harm the advent of this transformation, or shun this new technology and the business building on it.</p><p>No legislature will be able to keep up with the advances in software that are taking place; there are too many developers and efficient tools in the wild all over the world, all with equal access to the market. The best the State can possibly hope for is to tax new businesses that use the new tools as they emerge, and encourage entrepreneurs to incorporate in their jurisdictions. If America wants to drive away Bitcoin developers, exchanges, and new businesses, by all means, do so and take the consequences. There are many other places in the world where fast internet pipes have been laid and where the government is not so backward. Skype was founded in Estonia, not Silicon Valley, and this is for a reason. All the big bitcoin exchanges are outside the USA. There is a reason for that. No one wanting to start a Bitcoin business is planning to move to New York from anywhere, because they know that their business models will immediately come under attack.</p><p>For those of you who are frightened of a free market in Bitcoin, rest assured, all the laws that currently exist to do with fraud, theft, misrepresentation, and everything else, continue to apply to all people and corporations who use bitcoin. Bitcoin does not make laws or your personal or corporate obligations moot. When you deal with a company, you retain access to the law and recourse to it. When someone makes a promise to sell you goods with bitcoin, that promise is not nullified because you are paying with bitcoin. Good Bitcoin businesses will build dispute resolution systems the way that eBay and Amazon have, so that you never have to go to court to obtain justice if there is a problem. Online, reputation is everything, and bad reputations can destroy your credibility and customer base overnight. This is a far more powerful incentive to behave correctly and fulfill promises, which most people do by default in any case, rather than some arbitrary and absurd “BitLicense”.</p><p>All the “BitLicenses” and “Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Acts” in the world could not stop Mt. Gox from having a software problem, and no law can bring back the money lost either directly or through the disruption caused by the software error. Once again, it is entrepreneurs powered by the internet that make life easier and better, not laws and regulations. Regulation does not make software correct; developers do.</p><p>I have one recommendation for anyone advocating that there should be a “BitLicense” or that the reprehensible “Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act” should become law. Don’t waste everyone’s time, money, and resources proposing this anti-American idea. The EFF has better things to do with their time than teach the PGP “Munitions Case” lesson all over again. If it goes to court, your side will lose, and as a consequence, America will lose its head start as all Bitcoin entrepreneurs flee the USA for environments that will allow them to innovate, grow, and prosper.</p><p>And what can the business people who want a “BitLicense” forced on the software industry say? <em>That they don’t trust themselves</em>? That’s patently absurd. That they do not trust their competitors? If it’s the case that their competitors are not good actors, then the good actors have a market advantage. Remember, a license cannot protect the public from fraud or provide any guarantee of any kind; it can only distort the market.</p><p>What these “BitLicense” and Lummis-Gillibrand advocates actually want is <em>a guaranteed market advantage</em>. They are anti-American crony capitalists. They want to prevent the emergence of a “Golden BB” entrepreneur that might destroy their business, they want to slow down and stifle innovation, so that they can become the entrenched and unassailable gatekeepers. They want to bar new entrants to the market. It simply will not work. <strong>And it’s un-American</strong>.</p><p>The American legislature must let the American dream flourish and extend its power to Bitcoin, or it will be compelled to obey the law, and this has started to happen. Two judges in the USA have now found that bitcoin is not money, and have thrown out “Money Laundering” charges against two men:</p><blockquote><p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott ruled in a money laundering case in Buffalo, N.Y., that bitcoin is more like a commodity and is not a form of currency, according to a local news report.</p><p>He recommended the money laundering charge be dropped against the defendant since bitcoin isn’t money.</p><p>In another money laundering case last year, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler stated it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, that bitcoin has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money.</p><p>–Archive: <a href="https://archive.is/pKQJ2">https://archive.is/pKQJ2</a></p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin is not money. KYC/AML should not apply to it at all. The Hugh B. Scott ruling is highly significant, because it directly contradicts the idea of BitLicence and Lummis-Gillibrand. And lest there be any doubt, all of this, including legal remedies for breach of promise, applies to “ICOs” and “NFT”s (so called, “Digital Collectibles”), which are also nothing more than <strong>text</strong> stored in a database. The fact that they are called, “Initial Coin Offerings” or “Digital Collectibles”<strong> is irrelevant</strong> to the underlying processes, and it is not illegal to parrot the language and terms of finance, which are not trademarked or copyrighted. The Hollywood Stock Exchange wasn’t deceptive because it called itself a “Stock Exchange”. Opponents of Bitcoin and ICOs have no good arguments, and the threadbare pretexts for regulation they’re able to synthesize are as flimsy as fiat.</p><p>The longer-term effects of bitcoin becoming the only money will be a total collapse in the public’s belief in the Political Class, who, having had the power to steal and redistribute money revoked from them, will have literally nothing to offer anyone anymore. If a ceremonial class of apratchicks (entirely at their own personal cost of course) should remain, it will attract only the most hard-core and mentally ill participants and spectators.</p><p>And these evil people will not have stormtroopers on tap to raid citizen’s houses and steal from them with “Civil Asset Forfeiture” and other measures. All security will be provided by the free market, where the only rule enforced is Natural Law.</p><p>This is, of course, anathema to democracy addicts, who will be forced to go cold turkey.</p><p>Incompetence will also be permanently deprecated and suppressed by the market, because all money is accounted for in a fine-grained way, and people will only pay for services and goods that actually serve them correctly.</p><p>All of this may sound like the most “out there” fantasy, but so did Bitcoin before Bitcoin. And now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXebE1eEMGOTe6ipH9n2AmUE3uLaKEfXE">Bitcoin is</a>, and the effects it will have are what we, the people who predicted it will be, not what some idiotic democracy booster believes or wants it to be. The evil people never saw the need for Bitcoin in the first place; why should anyone believe that they have the crystal ball? We do, they don’t.</p><p>And as for the imbeciles that believe that only the State can keep people safe, the facts are against this also. The story of the incandescent light bulb is a perfect example of a scenario that will be absolutely forbidden in the Bitcoin-mediated world.</p><figure>

type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act Of 2022 from Elizabeth Warren proposes unconstitutional privacy restrictions for bitcoin users.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by L0la L33tz, a privacy and security researcher and hacking advocate.</em></p><p>Yesterday, the U.S. Senate proposed the <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/DAAML%20Act%20of%202022.pdf">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act Of 2022</a> — a bill that is not only deeply concerning to international human rights, but unconstitutional and in direct opposition to current U.S. consumer privacy regulations. </p><h2>What’s In The Bill?</h2><p>The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act Of 2022, proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, proposes the following regulations, among others:</p><ul><li>Section three, part a: The classification of custodial wallets and “unhosted wallet providers,” likely meaning developers of non-custodial wallets, as well as cryptocurrency miners, validators or other nodes that may act to validate or secure third-party transactions, independent network participants and other validators with control over network protocols as money service businesses.</li><li>Section three, part d: Promulgation of a rule that prohibits financial institutions from handling, using or transacting with digital asset mixers, privacy coins and other anonymity-enhancing technologies, as specified by the secretary of the U.S. Treasury; and handling, using or transacting business with digital assets that have been anonymized.</li></ul><p>Section three, part a of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act Of 2022 would deem anyone developing non-custodial wallets as money transmitters, requiring them to obtain a license. The problem: “unhosted wallet providers” do not exist. “Unhosted wallets,” or non-custodial wallets, are simply software. </p><h2>Infringing On The First Amendment</h2><p>The enactment of section three, part a would hence require anyone writing software which enabled the sending, receiving and signing of bitcoin transactions to obtain a money transmitter license. This attempt at restricting the writing of code is nothing new and a directly unconstitutional approach, as the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt1-7-1/ALDE_00013537/#:~:text=First%20Amendment%3A,for%20a%20redress%20of%20grievances.">U.S. constitution clearly states</a> that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” </p><p>Under these circumstances, attempts at regulating the writing of software have been struck down by U.S. courts <a href="https://brownpoliticalreview.org/2022/03/decoding-speech/#:~:text=City%20Studios%2C%20Inc.-,v.,is%20unrelated%20to%20constitutional%20inquiry.">numerous times</a>. </p><p>In Universal City Studios vs. Corley, 2001, for instance, the second circuit <a href="http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise50.html">addressed</a> the attempted restriction on computer code with the following arguments:</p><ul><li>Communication does not lose constitutional protection as “speech” simply because it is expressed in the language of computer code. If someone chose to write a novel entirely in computer object code by using strings of ones and zeroes for each letter of each word, the resulting work would be no different for constitutional purposes than if it had been written in English.</li><li>Computer programs are not exempted from the category of First Amendment speech simply because their instructions require use of a computer. A recipe is no less “speech” because it calls for the use of an oven, and a musical score is no less “speech” because it specifies performance on an electric guitar. The fact that a program has the capacity to direct the functioning of a computer does not mean that it lacks the additional capacity to convey information, and it is the conveying of information that renders instructions as “speech” for purposes of the First Amendment.</li><li>Limiting the First Amendment protections of programmers to descriptions of computer code (but not the code itself) would impede discourse among computer scholars, just as limiting protection for musicians to descriptions of musical scores (but not sequences of notes) would impede their exchange of ideas and expression. Instructions that communicate information comprehensible to a human qualify as speech whether the instructions are designed for execution by a computer or a human (or both).</li></ul><p>The court further cited that the limiting of free speech under the U.S. constitution is permitted if, and only if, it serves a substantial governmental interest, the interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and the regulation is narrowly tailored, which, in this context, requires that the means chosen do not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government’s legitimate interests.</p><h2>The Key Moving The House Around</h2><p>That section three of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act serves any other purpose but the direct restriction of free expression is yet to be proven by Senator Warren. And even so, the section appears much too broad in scope to be legally applied without directly violating constitutional rights, particularly as developers of non-custodial wallets serve no purpose in the transmission of money. </p><p>Non-custodial wallets transmit bitcoin the currency as much as the key to one’s door moves the house around. Non-custodial wallets function as signing devices, which transfer the <em>access rights</em> to bitcoin — while the asset itself never moves. The attempt at restricting the development of non-custodial wallets would therefore constitute a regulation of public-private key cryptography, which, too, <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1212&amp;context=uclf">has been attempted before and struck down</a> due to violation of the first amendment of the U.S. constitution. </p><p>Similarly nonsensical as framing developers of non-custodial wallets as money transmitters is the idea that “nodes who may act to validate or secure third-party transactions” and “independent network participants” must be defined as money service businesses, consequently constituting that anyone who runs a Bitcoin node must obtain a license to do so.</p><p>By definition, Bitcoin nodes do not secure third-party transactions. Rather, Bitcoin nodes validate one’s own version of the blockchain against copies obtained through other nodes in the network. Nodes neither secure nor transmit third-party transactions. No other user’s funds are affected if a Bitcoin node goes down. </p><p>The attempt of ruling Bitcoin node operators as money transmitters can therefore be seen as the attempt at regulating which individuals are allowed to compare information. Again, the proposed bill is unable to sufficiently prove that section three is narrow enough in scope to sufficiently warrant the approval of such a bill without infringing on further aspects of free speech and the freedom of information. </p><p>Section three further attempts to regulate bitcoin miners as money service businesses. Here, too, the bill exhibits an embarrassing level of misunderstanding of the inherent technology it attempts to restrict. </p><p>A bitcoin miner is nothing more than a computer, meaning a machine which processes code as speech. In no scenario does a bitcoin miner transmit bitcoin from A to B. Rather, a bitcoin miner propagates blocks of information to the network. A regulation of bitcoin miners does not hold up from a technological point of view. In addition section three again fails to prove that the permissioned use of bitcoin miners would not constitute further violations on anyone using a computer, particularly to access and broadcasting speech as protected under the U.S. constitution. </p><h2>Violating Well-Established Human Rights</h2><p>By attempting to restrict the handling, using or transacting of business with digital assets that have been anonymized as declared under section three, part d, the Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act further infringes on aspects of the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> (FCRA), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_privacy_laws_in_the_United_States#California_Privacy_Act">California Privacy Act</a>, the U.S. constitution’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privileges_and_Immunities_Clause">Privileges and Immunities Clause</a>, as well as Article 12 and Article 13 parts a and b of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. </p><p>The FCRA of 1970 is a U.S. federal legislation which regulates the accuracy, fairness and privacy of consumer information as handled by credit reporting agencies in the scope of the collection, dissemination and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. Under the act, credit reporting agencies are required to remove negative information seven years after the date of first delinquency, except for bankruptcies (10 years) and tax liens (seven years from the time they are paid). </p><p>Bitcoin transactions provide an immutable history of themselves. The restriction of privacy services and tools as defined under the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act as services “designed to conceal or obfuscate the origin, destination, and counterparties of digital asset transactions” directly violate FCRA regulations, as credit reporting agencies would be enabled to maintain indefinite records of any user’s financial information and transactions without the possibility of deletion. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a> is a U.S. constitutional act guiding the regulation of banking companies, insurance companies and securities companies. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, companies are required to provide consumers with privacy notices at the time of the establishment of consumer relationships, documenting the scope of use of financial information. In accordance with the FCRA, users must be given the right to opt out of the sharing of information.</p><p>Because the blockchain is a public ledger, with the restriction of privacy protecting tools and services, users would be unable to opt out of the sharing of information, as financial information regarding bitcoin transactions is shared with everyone and anyone able to view the Bitcoin blockchain by default. The restriction of privacy tools and services therefore constitutes a direct violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. </p><p>The California Privacy Act is a state-level privacy act which governs the handling of consumer information, including financial information. It is often seen as <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/Gramm-Leach-Bliley-Act">a more strict implementation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a>. The act herein constitutes that financial information must be maintained within one financial entity, restricting access to other financial entities based on affiliation. </p><p>In the case of bitcoin transactions, any financial business conducting transactions on the blockchain on behalf of customers unavoidably shares customer’s financial information with other financial entities — namely anyone able to view a block explorer — as, again, the blockchain is a public ledger. Restricting the use of privacy technologies such as blinded e-cash or CoinJoin for businesses herein directly violates the relevant sections of the California Privacy Act. </p><p>The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act further violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Privacy_Rights_Act">California Privacy Rights Act of 2020</a> which constitutes that businesses must obtain permission through a parent or guardian to collect data on individuals below the age of 16; a regulation unenforceable with the restriction of privacy tools as the age of Bitcoin users cannot clearly be distinguished in the bulk collection of chain analysis data. </p><p>The Privileges and Immunity Clause is part of the U.S. constitution, governing the freedom of movement. In 1869’s Paul v. Virginia, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law#:~:text=In%20Paul%20v.,to%20protect%20freedom%20of%20movement.">court ruled that</a> U.S. persons must retain the “right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them,” leading to the creation of this clause. With the restriction of the obfuscation of the origin of funds, as well as restrictions regarding the obfuscation of senders and receivers, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act directly opens individuals up to arbitrary restrictions on their freedom of movement, as no individual is able to cross state lines without purchasing the necessary means, such as gas or train tickets. </p><p>The ramifications of fully surveillable means of payment on individuals’ freedom of movement have been clear most recently through <a href="https://qz.com/1642441/extradition-law-why-hong-kong-protesters-didnt-use-own-metro-cards">protests in Hong Kong</a>, during which protestors were identified by the times and places where their train tickets were purchased with digital means of payment. </p><p>For these reasons, it can further be argued that the Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act infringes on articles 18, 19 and 22 of the 1966<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights"> International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, which govern individual’s right to protest and freely assemble, as well as Article 11, which governs the right to free association, and Article 9, which governs the freedom of religion, as neither of these rights are effectively enactable by the individual’s side without a private form of payment.</p><p>In addition, for the reasons above, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act violates Article 13 of the Universal Declaration Of Human Rights, which constitutes the right to freedom of movement, stating that any human must retain the right to leave any country and return to their own countries, as well as Article 12, which states that no one should be made subject to arbitrary interference with their privacy. </p><p>Section three, part d of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act proposes the enabling of total surveillance of anyone using bitcoin as a currency under the pretense of anti-money laundering regulations. Yet, the <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">Chainalysis crypto crime report of 2021</a> found that illicit activity in cryptocurrency use had reached an all-time low as volumes reach all-time highs, clearly rendering the proposed prohibitions of privacy technologies in cryptocurrency as arbitrary, therefore constituting a clear violation of Article 12. </p><p>It additionally violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Financial_Privacy_Act">Right to Financial Privacy Act</a> (RFPA), a federal law under which governments must obtain consent of the customer to access financial information, another regulation which would become virtually non-enforceable with the restriction of privacy tools and services and the enabling of bulk surveillance of Bitcoin users. While the RFPA was amended by the Patriot Act in 2001 to include the compelling of disclosures of requested information to intelligence and counterintelligence agencies for any investigation related to terrorism, the bulk surveillance of all cryptocurrency users can hardly be argued under the Patriot Act, in light of a $15.8 trillion market cap at a rate of an associated <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">illicit transaction volume of 0.15%. </a></p><p>As pointed out by the non-profit research and advocacy center Coincenter, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act may additionally be in violation of the fourth amendment of the US constitution, as it orders the warrantless surveillance of cryptocurency users through developers and miners while serving no purpose towards their operations.</p><p>It can be suggested that Sen. Warren spends less time attempting to regulate technology that she clearly does not understand and more time learning about existing financial regulations. She would further be well advised in refraining from attempting to violate her constituents’ constitutional rights and instead put her effort toward protecting them. After all, that’s what we pay her for.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by L0la L33tz.

Core Scientific currently has an existing loan with B Riley totaling $42 million. The new $72 million loan would be “on favorable terms,” and aim to provide two years of runway before anticipating profitability from the company.<br><br>In the lender’s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/b-riley-financial-issues-open-letter-to-core-scientific-investors-301703337.html">released statement</a> it described how, “We believe that there is a path forward and have been proactive in working through a solution, specifically by providing debt on a number of unencumbered assets.” </p><p>The mining firm has faced various headwinds in recent months. Bitcoin Magazine PRO <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/public-miner-capitulation-takes-and-core-scientific">detailed these back</a> in late October of this year, describing how “Core Scientific is halting all debt service payments; Bitcoin holdings are now 24 — they sold 1,027 over the last month; Cash resources will be depleted by the end of the year or sooner; and Core Scientific claims Celsius owes them $5.4 million.” <br><br>In addition to these, last week a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221208006081/en/Kirby-McInerney-LLP-Announces-the-Filing-of-a-Securities-Class-Action-on-Behalf-of-Core-Scientific-Inc.-CORZ-Investors">lawsuit was filed</a> by Kirby McInerne LLP on behalf of Core Scientific investors. </p><p><br>Despite this and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosemariemiller/2022/10/27/core-scientific-unable-to-pay-bills-warns-of-bankruptcy/?sh=b2565565c4b6">statements</a> by the mining firm that bankruptcy was not off the table, B Riley states that they believe “bankruptcy is not necessary at all.” <br><br>The lender explains that the miner’s previous loans “were made when the price of Bitcoin was significantly higher than it is today and the theoretical payoff on miners was significantly faster. These debts were incurred as part of an aggressive, ill-conceived strategy by the Company to continue to build out power facilities and expand miners while never selling Bitcoin on hand and never hedging prices … This decision combined with the fast maturity associated with mining has led the Company to its current position.”<br><br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5NzMwNDMwMjE0MjE5NDUy/immersion-cooling-bitcoin-miner.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Visiting El Salvador’s Slums, It’s Clear Bitcoin Country Must Go Further]]></title><description><![CDATA[A visit to Soyapango, one of El Salvador’s most impoverished slums, shows that the Bitcoin experiment isn’t reaching those who need it most.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-slums-need-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-slums-need-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Violence]]></category><category><![CDATA[el salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Poverty]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nayib Bukele]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rikki]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 18:11:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwOTE3NzExNjQ2MTcyNzU3/aa-btc-4.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">A visit to Soyapango, one of El Salvador’s most impoverished slums, shows that the Bitcoin experiment isn’t reaching those who need it most.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Rikki, author and co-host of the “Bitcoin Italia,” and “Stupefatti” podcasts. He is one half of the Bitcoin Explorers, along with </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Lorinaura"><em>Laura</em></a><em>, who chronicle Bitcoin adoption around the world, one country at a time.</em></p><p>A few days before this writing, El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele announced an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-deploys-10000-troops-gang-run-capital-suburb-2022-12-03/">immense police operation</a>. San Salvador's satellite city of Soyapango was surrounded by 8,500 military and 1,500 police officers, who went searching from house to house for gang members still hiding in the area. <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/true-cost-el-salvador-war-on-gangs/">More than 150 arrests were counted</a>.</p><p>Soyapango represents one of the most difficult realities for the country. With <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/12/05/watch-el-salvador-troops-surround-entire-city-part-war-gangs/">300,000 inhabitants</a>, it is home to several "comunidades," the name used locally to define slums or “favelas,” if you prefer.</p><p>The news of the police operation hit me hard because, only two days before, I had visited two different neighborhoods in that very city: the extremely poor Ciudad de Dios, which stands on an old garbage dump, and the violent Santa Lucia, one of the historical lairs for criminal gangs.</p><p>My visit was carefully planned well in advance and the only reason it was possible for me to even enter these places was that the "pandilleros," the gangsters, have been hit hard by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Salvadoran_gang_crackdown">government crackdown in recent months</a>, a direct result of the upsurge in clashes between rival gangs that had bloodied the country again earlier this year. </p><p>Had I tried to enter a year ago, my own life would have likely been in danger. Nevertheless, as a precaution, I had a local driver, only rarely was I allowed out of the car, and we were escorted by a person known in the neighborhood who rode ahead of us on a motorcycle. Our guide was from those streets, had lived for five years under a bridge and had a history of drug addiction, from which he recovered with the help of the community.</p><p>It was an enlightening day for me and a necessary one.</p><h2>Solving Extreme Poverty</h2><p>My reason for visiting these places to report on them comes from a conversation I had recently with a rather famous Bitcoiner: a developer who is well educated and highly intelligent and has been in the industry for many, many years. Well, his thesis is that El Salvador is not really as poor as people would have you believe, but rather an economically-backward country where the incidence of extreme poverty is not unlike that of far more developed nations.</p><p>This viewpoint, frankly, left me in shock.</p><p>According to official data in El Salvador, <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/SLV/el-salvador/poverty-rate">26% of the population</a> lives below the poverty line. That is <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/el-salvador-population/">1.7 million people</a>. </p><p>Yet it is true that many of the Bitcoiner tourists who come here believe it is the lady selling pupusas on the street corner who is poor. She is not. That lady is an entrepreneur. She has a store, a business. The lady, despite the plain clothes creased by hard work, is lower-middle class in El Salvador. Poverty, the real kind, is hidden in huge neighborhoods made of tin houses, without running water, sewage or electricity. Invisible cities, where no one goes and that no one talks about.</p><p>This is a serious mistake.</p><p>If we want Bitcoin to succeed here, we must also improve the living conditions of these people. Because they are the ones who need it the most and because it is their poverty, as the police operation of the last few days showed us, that directly fuels crime.</p><p>The Bitcoiners who come to El Salvador dreaming of a freer nation than the one from which they escape, the entrepreneurs who want to invest here, must understand that among their priorities must be the inclusion of those living in the slums of Soyapango, otherwise it is their very future here, it is their very investments, that are in danger. Indeed, the military solution to the gang problem can only be a temporary palliative. Crime feeds on the slums. This is where bosses recruit new thugs, this is where they sell drugs and profit, this is where they live, rule and hide. If we don't solve the problem of extreme poverty in El Salvador, the gangs will keep coming back, more dangerous and better organized than before, and El Salvador will never be a truly safe country.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmBLOOJAvxs">footage I shot in the slums of Soyapango</a> is a blow to the stomach. But I think it was also necessary to show our community this side of El Salvador, which is too often forgotten.</p><p>I would like to thank Luis David Esparragoza for organizing the day in the slums of Soyapango. Without him none of what you have just read would have been possible.</p><section><figure>

It is time, therefore, to take some stock.</p><p>As I have <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/rikki">extensively documented</a>, Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador is slowing down. There are many merchants who have stopped accepting BTC as a form of payment. The reasons they always give have been twofold: Bitcoin is too complicated and there is a lack of volume. Very few want to pay this way.</p><p>While we have already shown how too much complexity is to blame for the shortcomings of the Chivo wallet, the second problem is far more serious and delicate. On the one hand, there are the citizens of El Salvador who earn and spend dollars — a strong currency, not a victim of serious inflation — and they view digital payments with suspicion. On the other, however, there are the encouraging data that tell of a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/el-salvador-weekly-tourism-minister-says-bitcoins-led-to-spike-in-visitors/">strong increase in tourism in this country</a>, also related to the many Bitcoiners who come here to visit the country of BTC legal tender.</p><p>But if there are thousands of Bitcoiners coming to visit, how is it possible that the volume of BTC transactions in the streets is not increasing? Maybe we are not numerically sufficient?</p><p>Maybe. But I think the problem is also another one.</p><p>Let me give you an example: A few weeks ago, outside the Mi Primer Bitcoin graduation ceremony in the small town of Ataco, I met a Spanish gentleman who had come to the country specifically for Bitcoin. Tall and grizzled, in his 40s, he was helping this association that educates very young people in El Salvador about Bitcoin. He was an examiner, one of the "experts" called upon to assess the children's preparation. Wearing a Bitcoin Beach cap and Bitcoin t-shirt, with a lean and tanned physique, he appeared to be a typical fanboy, in appearance.</p><p>We lingered talking outside of the school and I happened, almost by accident, to mention how I was a bit disappointed with the worsening adoption of Bitcoin among people there.</p><p>It was at this point that he started telling me how he himself, strong, in perfect Spanish, always asks whenever he buys something if he can pay in bitcoin. But when he gets an affirmative answer, he starts investigating with the merchant to figure out exactly what they are going to do with the satoshis he would be sending him. Basically, it’s an interrogation. If the poor merchant responded that they wanted to keep the sats for the future, then they will receive some from the experienced Western Bitcoiner via a Lightning transaction. But if they instead admits that they want to exchange or receive the bitcoin directly in dollars, then this Westerner gives up using bitcoin and pays directly in fiat.</p><p>Can you see how idiotic that is? It makes no sense at all.</p><p>I thought that our mission in El Salvador was to incentivize adoption as much as possible, to help these people through a new and alternative economic system. But no! Now we even demand that they be HODLers. Otherwise they are not worthy of our bitcoin. This is a creepy mindset and pure selfishness.</p><p>When I pointed out to him that the future of these people also depends on the success of bitcoin in the country and that perhaps his attitude is a bit selfish — because after all, we can sacrifice a few thousand satoshi to incentivize adoption, even if they are converted to dollars — he went on a rampage and started screeching that he lives in El Zonte and that all of his friends are the poor in the village and that he cares about the fate of them all.</p><p>Evidently, however, not enough to sacrifice a few dollars in sats. </p><p>And, mind you, there are many other people who think like this. I have seen plenty of Bitcoiners here paying in cash or with their flaming credit cards. We are all familiar with the narrative behind this gesture: "Bitcoin are not to be spent. HODL to the death. Bitcoin will be worth billions, it's not like they're being spent today. We wouldn't want to end up like that fool <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-man-behind-bitcoin-pizza-day-is-more-than-a-meme-hes-a-mining-pioneer">Laszlo</a>!"</p><p>Too bad that Bitcoin's success in El Salvador is also linked to transaction volume and that if we win our battle in this country, the value in bitcoin's markets will be positively affected, to the benefit of our entire community. So evidently, we all want bitcoin to gain in value, but only a few are willing to sacrifice a handful of satoshis to really contribute to the ultimate victory. How boorish and selfish.</p><p>I mean this in no uncertain terms: At the risk of angering someone, if you come to visit this country for Bitcoin and you are not willing to pay in bitcoin, do El Salvador a favor, stay home.</p><p>PS</p><p>I saw the guy again a few weeks later in El Zonte, comfortably seated, eating a shrimp cocktail, peering out to sea at Palo Verde, one of the most exclusive resorts in the village. It is one of those places that his "so many poor friends" cannot even afford to look at from a distance.</p><p>PPS </p><p>Laszlo Hanyencz is a hero and has gone down in the history books, unlike all of those who consider him a fool.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rikki.

It would also prohibit financial institutions from interacting with privacy tools such as CoinJoin in an effort to limit the ability of users to maintain their privacy. While the bill focuses on such measures in order to curb money laundering, tools such as CoinJoin simply restore the users’ ability to use bitcoin in a way that more closely resembles physical cash. That is, the bank knows when a client withdraws cash at an ATM, but has limited knowledge of what any user does with it afterwards. This cash-like attribute is only realized in cryptocurrencies through tools such as CoinJoins. In addition to this, regulating bodies would be allowed to file reports and surveil users without need for a warrant or government request. <br></p><p>According to the bill, it also calls for a “rule classifying custodial and unhosted wallet providers, cryptocurrency miners, validators, or other nodes who may act to validate or secure third-party transactions, independent network participants, including MEV searchers, and other validators with control over network protocols as money service businesses,” which would imply that Bitcoin nodes would be classified as such as well.<br><br>The bill seeks for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to implement the guidance which, according to <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-digital-asset-anti-money-laundering-act-is-an-opportunistic-unconstitutional-assault-on-cryptocurrency-self-custody-developers-and-node-operators/">blockchain advocacy group CoinCenter</a>, “is the most direct attack on the personal freedom and privacy of cryptocurrency users and developers we’ve yet seen.”<br><br>Senator Elizabeth Warren has previously expressed her desire to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-warren-in-wall-street-journal-op-ed-ftxs-implosion-should-be-a-wake-up-call">most recently</a> after the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">collapse of FTX</a>. The bill would likely face extensive scrutiny as, amongst many other issues, it would force unhosted wallets providers to register before publishing their products, effectively placing limits on free speech, as code has been <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/remembering-case-established-code-speech">proven to be free speech</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTQ3/bitcoin-code.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Japan’s Largest Power Company, TEPCO, To Mine Bitcoin With Excess Energy]]></title><description><![CDATA[TEPCO Power Grid is deploying bitcoin mining operations across Japan in a partnership with a local semiconductor company to capitalize on excess power.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tepco-to-mine-bitcoin-with-excess-power</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tepco-to-mine-bitcoin-with-excess-power</guid><category><![CDATA[Power grid]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Japan]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Namcios]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 12:43:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3Nzc1NDUz/green-sustainable-bitcoin-mining.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">TEPCO Power Grid is deploying bitcoin mining operations across Japan in a partnership with a local semiconductor company to capitalize on excess power.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Japan’s largest electric power company is about to start mining bitcoin.</p><p>Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) Power Grid is partnering with TRIPLE-1, a local semiconductor designer and developer, to mine bitcoin with excess energy across the country, CoinDesk first reported. TEPCO is the country’s largest electric power company in total assets, per <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/868685/leading-companies-electricity-industry-by-total-assets-japan/">Statista</a> data.</p><p>TEPCO is the utility behind the Fukushima nuclear reactor, which in 2011 was struck by an earthquake and huge tsunami that knocked out some of its cooling systems, allowing three reactors to melt down. The power company later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/world/asia/tepco-admits-failure-in-acknowledging-risks-at-nuclear-plant.html">admitted</a> that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent such disasters. TEPCO is still suffering from the accident, as compensation for victims is <a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14610645">taking a toll on its profitability</a> to this day. Now, its power transmission and distribution company, TEPCO Power Grid, is seeking ways to monetize surplus power with bitcoin mining through its wholly-owned subsidiary Agile Energy X.</p><p>TEPCO is joining major global energy companies in jumping on the bitcoin mining bandwagon. And a common denominator for most of them is a need to monetize excess power, something BTC mining does very well. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/conocophillips-is-selling-extra-gas-to-bitcoin-miners">ConocoPhillips is selling stranded gas to bitcoin miners</a> in the Bakken, an oil-abundant region in the U.S. –– a similar strategy to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/exxon-is-mining-bitcoin-with-excess-gas-report">what Exxon is doing</a>. The oil giant reportedly has an agreement with Crusoe Energy Systems to redirect gas that would otherwise be wasted from an oil well pad to mobile bitcoin mines. TEPCO's setup also goes along those lines.</p><p>According to a translated version of a Wednesday <a href="https://www.tepco.co.jp/pg/company/press-information/information/2022/pdf/221214a.pdf">statement</a> by the Japanese energy giant, Agile Energy X signed a memorandum of understanding with TRIPLE-1 on November 11 to build a constructive strategic partnership. Through the collaboration, Agile aims to deploy distributed data centers throughout Japan that repurposes surplus electricity from renewable energy with semiconductors from TRIPLE-1.</p><p>A pilot project has already been set up on the premises of TEPCO Power Grid’s office in the Tokyo metropolitan area, per the statement. “We have started experiments to confirm the system behavior and the impact on the power grid when equipment is operated with a large amount of power on the scale of 1,500 kW, and have confirmed that the equipment can operate normally.”</p><figure>

I also offer some cost mitigating suggestions to hopefully encourage more participation on the bitcoin network.</p><p>Before exploring the costs involved: <strong><em>What is a bitcoin node</em>?</strong></p><p>A<a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-node/"> bitcoin node</a> is software that connects to the Bitcoin peer-peer network. A node receives, validates and broadcasts transactions/blocks to other nodes on the network, according to the network rules.<a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-node/"> Ted Stevenot</a> concisely described nodes as <em>the messengers and rule keepers of Bitcoin.</em></p><p>The broadcast blocks are part of a distributed ledger which contains records of each transaction, keeps track of bitcoin ownership and the corresponding amount owned. This publicly shared ledger is generally known as the Bitcoin <em>blockchain</em>.</p><p>A Bitcoin node is usually run on portable single-board computers (SBCs) like the<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/"> Raspberry Pi</a>, or on a <a href="https://umbrel.com/">personal computer</a>. However, a node can also be run in a virtual machine or on a smartphone. Bitcoin Core is the most widely used bitcoin node software and can be downloaded<a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/"> here</a>.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDI3NjY0Njg0Mjk1Njg1/image6.jpg" height="427" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Nodes can either be full or light:</p><ul><li>A full node stores a full copy of the blockchain and verifies every transaction and block, from the first block — the genesis block — against the consensus rules.<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Consensus"> Consensus rules</a> are specific rulesets enforced by full nodes to determine the validity of a block and its transactions.</li></ul><p>There are two types of full nodes: <em>archival nodes</em> and <em>pruned nodes</em>. Archival nodes store the entire blockchain locally and relay it to other nodes, this also helps to bootstrap new ones. Meanwhile, a pruned node only saves a specified minimum number of blocks as it verifies transactions and blocks. Therefore, more computer disk is saved by pruned nodes compared to archival nodes. However, pruned nodes are unable to serve the entire blockchain to other nodes.</p><ul><li>A light node does not enforce the consensus rules and relies on third party run full nodes to receive block data, which involves a privacy trade-off.</li></ul><p>Full nodes will be the main focus of this article — any mention of <em>“node”</em> hereafter implies a full node unless explicitly stated.</p><h2>Why Run A Node?</h2><p>There are personal and network benefits to running a node. Some of these include:</p><ul><li>Privacy when broadcasting transactions, verifying bitcoin received in your wallet, and exploring blockchain data, without third parties logging your personal information.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/">Enforcing the consensus rules</a> which helps uphold bitcoin’s integrity and your investment in it. Furthermore, running a node enables you to either reject or support any proposed changes — <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/may-the-forks-be-with-you-e02d00366ae3">soft or hard forks</a> — to the consensus rules. Reciting Raspiblitz’s slogan:<a href="https://shop.fulmo.org/"> <em>Not your node, not your rules</em></a> .</li></ul><ul><li>Strengthening the Bitcoin network. The more nodes on the network, the more decentralized and resilient Bitcoin is against malicious parties, jurisdictional restrictions or black swan events.</li></ul><ul><li>Increasing your understanding of how the bitcoin network operates and sharing this acquired knowledge with others. </li></ul><p>With some of the benefits outlined, let’s analyze the costs of running a node from a Nigerian perspective.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>The common hardware, that meet the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node">minimum requirements</a>, used to run a bitcoin node on are either:</p><ul><li>Plug and Play nodes or</li><li>Do-It-Yourself (DIY) nodes.</li></ul><h3>Plug And Play Node</h3><p>Some bitcoin companies offer plug and play full node products that run on SBCs like the Raspberry Pi, <a href="https://www.pine64.org/rockpro64/">RockPro64</a> and <a href="https://rockpi.org/rockpi4">Rock Pi4</a>, and mini PCs like the<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc.html"> Intel NUC</a> and<a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-mini/"> Librem Mini</a>. Some of these node providers are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://mynodebtc.com/">MyNode</a></li><li><a href="https://shop.fulmo.org/raspiblitz/">Raspiblitz</a></li><li><a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/ronin">RoninDojo</a> and</li><li><a href="https://start9.com/">Start9</a></li></ul><p>Node prices range from $300 to $700 — excluding shipping ($100 minimum to Nigeria) and customs duty — dependent on hardware and storage size. Currently, international purchases made on most Nigerian Naira debit cards are limited to $20 per month, a reduction from a previous $100 limit. Your node purchase options are to use a dollar debit card — tied to a domiciliary account — with deposited dollars obtained from the black market (currently 70% above the official rate), use a virtual dollar card which offers convenience but at a higher rate than the black market, and bitcoin.</p><p>There are other obstacles you might encounter in purchasing a node. Firstly, not all node providers ship to Nigeria. Additionally, due to chip shortages, some of these products are out of stock. One way of surmounting some of these hurdles is employing the alternative availed by node providers of sourcing node components yourself, and installing their respective bitcoin core embedded software on your assembled node.</p><h3>DIY Node</h3><p>In sourcing hardware components, we’ll only consider SBCs as they are cheaper than mini-PCs. The hardware components required to run an SBC node are:</p><ul><li>SBC + power supply</li><li>SD card + reader</li><li>SSD + enclosure</li><li>Heatsink case/fan</li></ul><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDI3NjY0Njg0MDMzNTQx/image2.jpg" height="215" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The current chip shortages and high demand for single board computers have led to a massive increase in prices and supply deficits, Raspberry Pis in particular both locally (used and new) and <a href="https://rpilocator.com/">internationally</a>. However, some Raspberry Pis and RockPro64s are available on <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/">Aliexpress</a>. Regardless, there are some fake sellers on the platform, you need to be especially wary of newly created stores, read negative reviews and request a refund if an item does not arrive within the estimated period. </p><p>Considering the international purchase limit on Naira debit cards, these SBCs will need to be purchased using a dollar card — there is no bitcoin purchase option. The table below summarizes average hardware component costs from Aliexpress, for building new Raspberry Pi or RockPro64 nodes.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Data</h2><p>Before a node is able to perform its role as a messenger and rule keeper on the bitcoin network, it needs to be synchronized with other nodes on the network. This is done by downloading and verifying all the blocks from the genesis block in a process known as the Initial block download (IBD). Currently, the bitcoin blockchain is approximately <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_blockchain_size">440 GB</a> in size.</p><p>The following table summarizes the average data costs, from network providers, for the IBD and roughly <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_blockchain_size">5.3 GB</a> required monthly to sync your node with the blockchain. An assumption is made that you reside in an area with somewhat reliable 4G network coverage.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDI3NjY0Njg0MjMwMTQ5/image3.png" height="305" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h2>Power</h2><p>To simplify the power cost analysis, the assumption is made that you live in a region with no electricity (at least 80% of the time in my location) and will need a solar generator to power the node and router, which isn’t ideal as it’s weather dependent. Replicating something similar to Chimezie Chuta’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/16/one-mans-mission-to-deploy-solar-powered-bitcoin-nodes-across-africa/">Spacebox</a> incurs the subsequent mean costs.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Finally, the estimated full node setup costs is tabulated below.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDI3NjY0Njg0MTY0NjEz/image4.png" height="211" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h2>In Conclusion</h2><p>Running your own Bitcoin node has a lot of benefits, some of which were listed earlier on. However, with ongoing chip shortages, inflation and node setup costs (despite the assumptions and cost-cutting recommendations made herein), running a node might not be feasible for everyone. One practical solution would be to implement Arman The Parman’s <a href="https://armantheparman.com/why-should-you-run-your-own-bitcoin-node/">circle of trust</a> idea or Obi Nwosu’s <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/whats-fueling-bitcoin-adoption-in-nigeria-390dd37fde2f">guardians and users</a> model of having a technical individual run a node for a trusted group of people like close friends, a family or community. This approach does involve a trade off, but is much better than connecting to third party nodes and helps in easing bitcoin’s custody challenge.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><em>Chinedu</em><em>.

On the other hand, if we look at their underlying open-source software, we see radical differences: </p><ul><li>Bitcoin’s protocol is specifically configured for minimizing uncertainty with conservative parameters and a constrained feature set, and its simple ledger architecture results in <a href="https://www.pierrerochard.com/auditing-bitcoin-supply/">supply auditability of BTC</a>. </li><li>Ethereum is optimized for cutting-edge experimentation and a wide range of programmable features, but its complex ledger architecture results in an <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinIsSaving/status/1505356218759528452">unauditable supply of ETH</a>.</li><li>Luna was <a href="https://mishtalk.com/economics/congratulations-to-luna-the-first-crypto-to-hyperinflate-now-worth-zero">programmed to automatically hyperinflate</a> to try to prop up the value of a stablecoin, Terra, and that’s exactly what it did. </li></ul><p>Putting all three of these assets into a single “crypto” bucket is reductive — they are different technologies optimizing for different outcomes. Bitcoin has accomplished long-term network stability — you could have run the same node software continuously for the past decade without any problems. The same cannot be said for Ethereum node software, which <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">completely changed its consensus mechanism in September 2022</a>. This change was only able to occur because the Ethereum Foundation has a unique <em>centralized</em> role in designating the official staking contract. Ethereum has to be more centralized than Bitcoin to push through aggressive “upgrades” to its protocol. Bitcoin has no such centralized operator or authority, and its consensus rules are unofficial: a <a href="https://pierre-rochard.medium.com/bitcoin-governance-37e86299470f">spontaneous, inter-subjective, network-wide agreement</a> among the users. </p><p>To address the second element in Sixsmith’s line of reasoning: the intrinsic value of holding any form of money is that you are <a href="https://mises.org/library/yield-money-held-reconsidered">minimizing uncertainty by hedging</a> against unpredictable future cash flows. In the fiat system, the least-uncertain assets are physical cash and government-insured bank accounts; however, even those are subject to the fiat power of the governments issuing such currencies and insuring those bank accounts — that is, your money is only as good as the applicable government’s promises.</p><p>Setting aside Bitcoin’s exchange rate, on a fundamental engineering level, holding BTC with your own private keys and verifying the ledger with your own node results in less uncertainty than holding even physical cash or an insured bank account. <em>That is bitcoin’s intrinsic value</em>. While the spot price/purchasing power of BTC can be subject to the whims of market forces, the uncertainty-minimizing principles of how to receive, hold and send BTC have not changed since its inception. Thus, you can be <em>certain</em> that the smart contracts locking your BTC will execute as written, so that only a signature from your private keys can move your money.</p><p>The third element addressed in Sixsmith’s piece relates to the speculative trading of cryptocurrencies on exchanges. Exchanges operating in the United States are legal entities subject to U.S. laws governing exchanges and are subject to compliance with both state and federal money transmitter, custodian and investor protection regulations. They are regulated federally by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and/or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and they have clear terms of service and user agreements. Even an “offshore” exchange in the Bahamas is accountable to the <a href="https://guides.law.fsu.edu/caribbean/bahamas#:~:text=The%20Bahamas&amp;text=It%20gained%20independence%20from%20the,Law%20as%20its%20legal%20system.">English Common Law</a>. To label these entities as “crypto” exchanges obfuscates their centralized fiat nature. </p><p>Sixsmith states, “...we knew that crypto-currencies were not a surefire route to freedom and independence when their value hinged on the good sense and morals of a bunch of weird nerds online.” </p><p>While humorous, this statement conflates Bitcoin’s value with the (mis-)management of fiat/crypto exchanges; akin to questioning the value of tomatoes because a supermarket went bankrupt. Furthermore, there’s nothing inherent about BTC that would necessitate leaving it at a fiat exchange, vulnerable to theft. It is harder and riskier to properly secure and use an exchange account’s password than it is to do so with BTC private keys. Furthermore, there are bitcoin-only brokerages that encourage or require the delivery of BTC directly to the client’s keys. Countless individuals and businesses receive BTC not as a trade for fiat, but as revenue for goods and services. The continued development of a circular economy will lessen the need to ever exchange for fiat.</p><p>In conclusion, despite adjacent cryptocurrencies and fiat exchanges that are centralized and unreliable, Bitcoin is a decentralized and reliable alternative monetary system. Bitcoin’s vision for the future is not utopian or idealistic, rather it is simply looking at the past decade of successful adoption, noting that Bitcoin’s fundamental properties have only improved, and projecting out continued growth. Perhaps the bottleneck in Bitcoin’s adoption is peoples’ understanding of what differentiates Bitcoin from fiat and crypto.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Pierre Rochard.

After two years of sustained inflation as a result of the Federal Reserve’s COVID-19 stimulus, the Fed was forced to aggressively hike rates in order to prevent runaway inflation.

Check this: Money has no inherent value. And, besides being a special kind of money that allows for disintermediated transfers, the same applies to bitcoin. </p><p>As banal as it may sound, money <em>is </em>just a means to an end. As a matter of fact, it’s a means to any number of ends. And those ends are what matter. Money — whether dollars, satoshis or the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180502-the-tiny-island-with-human-sized-money">rai stones of Yap</a> — is not valuable for what it is, but for what it lets us do. We transform money into experiences, and experiences are what make a life, not ledger entries. Everything else is <a href="https://youtu.be/fjg5TuXV09U">bank propaganda devised to generate interest</a>.</p><p>As long as it’s “just” a store of value, bitcoin is even further removed from the ends that matter (unless watching charts is your thing). At least by turning bitcoin into a medium of exchange that can be traded for those valuable experiences, the Lightning Network moves bitcoin closer to what matters.</p><p>In fact, here’s a general postulate: bitcoin’s value is inversely proportional to the friction between the blockchain and the experiences it enables. Lightning was one big step in reducing that friction, and Lightning itself has taken several steps in the last four or so years to diminish it further, including:</p><ul><li>Mobile Lightning nodes</li><li>On-the-fly channel creation</li><li>Zero-confirmation channels</li><li>LSPs to manage users’ connectivity and liquidity</li></ul><p>Still, though it’s painful to admit, there remains more friction in non-custodial Lightning than in the best custodial and fiat solutions, and users will choose whatever gets them to those experiences faster and easier. </p><p>Less friction means moving bitcoin closer to creating experiences, which means more value in bitcoin and <em>in life</em>.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The First Key To Reducing Friction: P2P Interaction </h2><p>The peer-to-peer (P2P) economy refers to disintermediated exchange, like creative people trading the fruits of their creativity — podcasts, videos, fanfic novels, 3D-printed cosplay accessories — with users for cash, without the intervention of banks, payment processors or aggregators. </p><p>Each intermediary in an interaction induces friction and increases the distance from the desired experience, and they can’t help it. Banks have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Aggregation platforms have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Payment processors have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. </p><p>Notice the pattern? While each intermediary claims to be giving people what they want, they’re actually serving different groups who want different things at the same time. That intermediaries always take a cut, induce friction and increase the distance between people and experiences isn’t the result of bad management or evil intentions, it’s just the nature of the beast.</p><p>So, why not create something far better for users? Let people interact directly, pay each other directly, exchange goods and services directly. There are even services out there — social networks, messaging services, content aggregators, gaming platforms — that would like to facilitate transactions among their users, but they can’t because legacy intermediaries induce too much (financial, regulatory, UX) friction. Worse still, the centralization induced by these large data networks increases their power over each user and, therefore, increases the risk of abuse to all users.</p><p>The P2P economy isn’t some billionaire’s pipe dream; it describes a world where we’re closer to the experiences we value and to each other. That’s what Lightning was made for. We just need to make it happen.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjU0NzA3NDI0ODk2Njg5/p2p.jpg" height="413" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>Web 2.0 interaction is you paying a conglomerate with money controlled by someone else; the P2P economy is just two people trading ideas, goods or a laugh for some P2P cash.

    </figure><h2>The Second Key To Reducing Friction: Fitting The Right Application To The Experience</h2><p>A lesson we’ve drawn from developing Breez is that different kinds of experiences (ends) need different payment interfaces (means). For example, the point-of-sale (PoS) terminal and podcast player that are included in our app are meant to feel like their own little self-contained interfaces, tailor-made for their respective purposes (or as close as we could get with the technological limitations of running a node on a phone).</p><p>But you can only cram so many activities and experiences into a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/no-such-thing-as-lightning-wallet">non-custodial Lightning payment app</a>. And, however clever, charming and good looking a team behind the payment app may be, they’re not necessarily best placed to devise new ways of applying P2P payments to new types of experience. We know how to make Lightning mobile and how to improve its UX, but when it comes to commerce, music, video streaming or any other vertical solution, experts in those fields know better how to craft the best experience.</p><p>Indeed, the PoS mode and the podcast player are just scratching the surface of what’s possible. We implemented them according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">the KISS principle</a>. Though they have scaled and attracted new users, they’re basically demo versions implemented to showcase how people interface with the P2P economy.</p><p>Could others with fine-grained expertise of those and other kinds of experience come up with better ways to apply P2P money to P2P interaction? <em>Of course they could</em>. And would those better applications achieve scale that our neophyte, outsider attempts never could? <em>Absolutely</em>.</p><p>And that’s the point. The better we apply the tech, the closer people get to the experiences they want, the more they will use the tech, the faster Lightning will scale. The scale we’re aiming for is not X orders of magnitude; we’re shooting for a world where kids roll their eyes whenever an adult says “Back in the fiat days…”</p><p>Achieving scale is a matter of reducing friction, and multiple, tailor-made apps that apply Lightning technology optimally to life’s many worthwhile pursuits is the best way of minimizing friction and expanding the P2P economy. It’s not about making the best wallet that can do everything; it’s about adapting Lightning — the means — to whatever end users want and whatever kinds of experience they want in exchange.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>LaaS Liberates Lightning </h2><p>Those who understand the technical requirements of running a non-custodial Lightning app will have realized already that adapting Lightning payments to any number of existing and yet-unimagined applications is incompatible with running a node in a single app. Lightning is far too technically demanding to scale the P2P economy as we have described it. Running the kind of always-on node required is an experience that few users, developers, creators or vendors out there will relish. </p><p>We’re envisioning <strong>Lightning as a Service (LaaS)</strong>. LaaS is about using Lightning to remove friction from life, from the experiences we crave. The point isn’t to improve the user experience <em>in the app</em>, but to improve the users’ experience <em>of Lightning as a whole</em> that gives them more value in their lives.</p><p>And LaaS is doable. Our vision for LaaS has three major components:</p><h3>1. A Lightning Software Development Kit (SDK)</h3><p>As it stands, anyone seeking to integrate Lightning payments to their existing business faces a steep learning curve. Accepting payments over Lightning requires them to run a node, secure liquidity with a Lightning service provider (LSP), manage fiat exchanges, perform swaps on and off the Bitcoin blockchain, manage a wallet, and so on. A non-custodial SDK would give P2P entrepreneurs and existing web utilities access to those functions without having to start from scratch. </p><p>With a well-designed SDK, developers could select the Lightning functions they need from a menu and integrate them quickly and easily into their own applications. Instead of having to learn the Lightning tech stack, a Lightning SDK will let developers simply plug it into their own tech stacks.</p><h3>2. Hybrid Architecture</h3><p>Lightning needs to be immediately available wherever and whenever people want to make payments. Locking a user’s functionality into a single app or on a single device would require the user to adapt to the technology, which is backwards. That’s friction.</p><p>At the same time, though, KYC friction and global, cross-market expansion requires a P2P, non-custodial solution. As soon as LSPs start acting like banks, regulators will start treating them like banks. That’s friction too.</p><p>The solution is a hybrid architecture based on <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/get-ready-for-a-fresh-breez-multiple-apps-one-node-optimal-ux-519c4daf2536">sovereign remote nodes</a>, but that locates those nodes in the cloud rather than on users’ local devices. Any service could access these nodes from any device, but as long as the users’ keys are locally stored, users would maintain custody of their own funds, minimizing the operators’ regulatory profile. </p><p>P2P plus minimal friction equals scale.</p><h3>3. Decentralizing Liquidity</h3><p>There is no credit on Lightning. The liquidity to settle any transaction needs to be preloaded onto the network. While this imposes a significant liquidity burden on those seeking to process users’ payments, it also presents the rich opportunity of a snowball effect: the more liquidity the network contains, the more transactions it can process, the more transaction fees the operators can collect, the more liquidity they have to invest in the network, and so on.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/lightning-network/">Lyn Alden</a> recently put it:</p><p>“Once there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of participants, and with larger average channel balances, then routing a payment from any arbitrary point to any other arbitrary point on the network becomes exponentially easier and more reliable.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In order to get the snowball rolling, we must distribute the burden of preloading the network with liquidity by onboarding new LSPs. By attracting LSP collaborators, we will raise the liquidity level of the network overall, turning the snowball into an unstoppable avalanche of liquidity.</p><h2>A Postscript On Shortcuts And Friction </h2><p>A dear, old teacher of mine always used to say, “Doing it the right way <em>is</em> the shortcut.” Like so much wisdom gained from experience, this was infuriating to hear as a young person, which makes it no less wise.</p><p>The thoughts above about how to scale Lightning and catalyze the exponential growth of the P2P economy never even flirt with the idea of third-party custodians. And yet I would be the first to admit that connecting users via third-party custodians would make everything <em>so much easier</em>. Throw together a jazzy interface for an app in a few weeks or so, have your developers implement a database in the backend to manage users’ transactions, cut everything down to a single node and a handful of big payment channels, and you’re off. Less hassle for Lightning operators, a tighter network and a shallower learning curve for Lightning users.</p><p>We could push this even further. For all its revolutionary potential, bitcoin can be a pain in the neck. Private keys can get irretrievably lost or stolen. The network needs a certain amount of energy to run. A satoshi can only be in one place at any given time, limiting financial innovation. Why not just tell everyone that we’re moving their bitcoin around, when in fact they have no bitcoin … and neither do we? Same database, same interface, infinitesimal hassle, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/z82ktt/lambo_math_a_story_in_4_parts/">free Lambos for everybody</a>.</p><p>I'm joking, of course. It’s been tried. Repeatedly. FTX. BlockFi. Genesis. Solana. It’s already a cliché that “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-24/the-vaccine-is-not-a-competition">the story of cryptocurrency is in large part a story about rediscovering traditional finance.</a>” And not only will operators lose users’ money (or magic beans, as the case may be) sooner or later, but the network would consist of <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/why-bitcoin-needs-to-become-a-medium-of-exchange-80d5c9e1de65?source=collection_home---4------9-----------------------">a limited number of choke points</a>, begging to be regulated, throttled and censored.</p><p>At which point we’d have to learn from our mistakes, start over from scratch, and do it again the right way. Fortunately, it’s still early days, and we can still <em>do it right the first time</em>. An omniscient being able to view all possible timelines would assure us that the sometimes tedious path of sovereignty and self-custody is, in fact, the shortest route to our P2P future. Though LaaS envisions a slightly different network than we have now to realize the future of Lightning, the principles and technological integrity that make Bitcoin worthwhile must remain inviolate.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Is bitcoin volatile? How does one determine volatility? How can those with diamond hands so decisively say “no,” while those stuck in the fiat mindset so emphatically say “yes”? Which one is correct? Is it just that both sides have to agree to disagree, or can both of these seeming contradictions simultaneously be true? </p><p>To truly answer these questions, we should first analyze Albert Einstein’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity">special theory of relativity</a>…</p><h2>The Special Theory Of Relativity</h2><p>In Einstein’s attempt to better understand how the elapsed time of two clocks moved differently, we need to look at one of his thought experiments: Imagine two individual observers, one sitting as a passenger on a train and the other onlooking from a nearby platform. The train passenger sees two bolts of lightning strike each end of the train, the first bolt from the front of the train, and the second bolt from the rear. Meanwhile, the onlooker on the nearby platform sees the two bolts strike both the front and the rear of the train at the same time. The train passenger claims that the front strike happened before the rear strike, while the onlooker claims that the strikes happened simultaneously.</p><p>Whose perception is accurate? Can both of them be? Einstein believed that both interpretations are valid because they each have their own frame of reference. </p><p>This phenomenon led to Einstein’s theory of special relativity: different reference frames necessitate different perceptions on the simultaneity of events. Said more simply, having a different reference point changes one’s perception. Granted, this is a gross oversimplification and a narrow view of a much broader concept, but this limited scope will suffice for how it relates to the disparity in perceptions regarding bitcoin’s volatility.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Not Volatile</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>In this analogy, let’s consider Bitcoiners as the passengers on the train. Due to the nature of the technology, we’re traveling at a consistent speed set by math and code. Inside this protocol, we see that one bitcoin equals one bitcoin. We can verify its scarcity with a supply hard cap of 21 million. We understand how the lack of need for trusted third parties or central authorities ensures a trustless and permissionless peer-to-peer system. We realize that a whale has no more clout over the control of the ledger than a shrimp. We know that every two weeks, the difficulty adjustment will continue to produce blocks at an estimated once every ten minutes; we grok the term “tick tock, next block.” </p><p>None of this speaks to volatility; just the opposite, in fact. All of this speaks to consistency; the consistency of the network. It speaks to our grounded perception from within a stable and secure system of value transfer over space and time. We passengers inside the train that is Bitcoin are better able to make economic decisions based on sound systemic fundamentals. This is one of the main reasons that Bitcoiners are able to have and maintain a low time preference; we’re not as susceptible to the distortions created by less-volatile systems, which leads to erratic economic behavior. Said differently, the predictability of the protocol perpetuates low time preference.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Volatile</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>From an outside onlooker’s perspective, it’s clear that bitcoin is volatile. Their main frame of reference is not the network, but simply the asset (specifically, the BTC/USD exchange rate). When the supply of the dollar fluctuates wildly, when the cost of capital is consistently manipulated — not to mention with the competing, equally-flawed currencies attempting to claw their way out of hyperinflation — the onlooker’s perception is distorted. </p><p>This is a real-world application of <a href="https://coffeeandjunk.com/wittgensteins-ruler/">Wittgenstein’s Ruler</a>, a concept which states that, “Unless you have confidence in the ruler’s reliability, if you use a ruler to measure a table you may also be using the table to measure the ruler.” </p><p>Fiat onlookers’ view of bitcoin the asset are obfuscated by their frame of reference, which is to say, an unnecessarily convoluted one.</p><p>What’s worse is that, because of this perceived volatility, onlookers are disincentivized to take a deeper look into Bitcoin the network. They find comfort in the known. They’re unwilling to do the work to understand why their arbitrarily-chosen system is flawed. As <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBooth/status/1592796329687715841">Jeff Booth</a> points out, “Perhaps the biggest impediment for people understanding Bitcoin is bringing their baggage from how the monetary system works today and in the past, versus how it will work in the future.” </p><p>All of the misinformation inside the fiat system pushes its constituents away from connecting the dots… while they are simultaneously seated on a sporadic and spastic merry-go-round. They’ve either consciously or otherwise accepted that the fate of their money (in its forms as a store of value, medium of exchange and a unit of account) will potentially change roughly every four years with election cycles. They’ve been conditioned to believe there must be a small group of elites who “know best” how to manipulate the growth of an economy (while also ignoring the elites’ inherent incentives). They overlook the fact that the currency they’re compelled to use has lost 99% of its value over its lifetime. </p><p>This last point nudges those inside the fiat system to adopt a high time preference, knowing the value of their time and efforts will be devalued over time. This further distorts their frame of reference, thus their ability to make sound, economic decisions; choosing between a volatile, alternative asset which requires a low time preference and a lot of effort to understand versus a new, gizmo gadget providing endless dopamine dumps… well, I can see how it’s an easy choice for them.</p><h2>The Theory Of Monetary Relativity</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>All of this can simply be stated as: Bitcoiners determine volatility based from the reference of its network and protocol while fiateers derive its volatility from the reference of bitcoin the asset. </p><p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/dergigi/status/1594297942974038016">Gigi says</a>, “Bitcoin isn't volatile. Humans are.” Therefore, we must continue to reframe the conversation from the asset to the network and protocol. The asset will continue to show volatility (to the upside over the long term), which is not due to Bitcoin the network or protocol, but due to the volatility of human nature.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Tim Niemeyer.
