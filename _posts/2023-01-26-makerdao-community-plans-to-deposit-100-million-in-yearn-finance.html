<p>The MakerDAO community has approved a proposal to deploy around $100 million worth of USDC into Yearn Finance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decision to deposit the funds on Yearn Finance will allow MakerDAO to earn an annual yield of around 2% on the stablecoin deposits.&nbsp;</p>
MakerDAO To Deposit $100 Million On Yearn&nbsp;
<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol MakerDAO&rsquo;s community has approved a proposal to deploy $100 million in USD Coin (USDC) on the DeFi protocol Yearn Finance. The funds will be deposited in a special investment account called a &ldquo;vault,&rdquo; which is managed by Yearn Finance. The vault&rsquo;s ceiling will be set at $100 million and will allow MakerDAO to earn a yield of around 2% per year, totaling around $2 million on an annual basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maker Governance voted to deploy 100 million USDC from the PSM into a bespoke @iearnfinance on-chain vault.&rdquo;</p>

Strong Support For Proposal&nbsp;
<p>The proposal to deposit the funds on Yearn was submitted in November 2022 and has found strong support within the Maker community. Around 72% of members voted in favor of the plan. The final implementation and the transfer of funds will require a further &ldquo;executive vote,&rdquo; according to the information shared by MakerDAO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talk of a partnership between MakerDAO and Yearn Finance was first suggested by Yearn Finance in November 2022. However, the partnership still requires a final approval through an executive vote. The executive vote is the final step in the MakerDAO governance process and is primarily used when implementing a technical change to the Maker Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
In Line With Long Term Vision&nbsp;
<p>MakerDAO&rsquo;s move to deposit funds on Yearn Finance is in line with the protocol&rsquo;s vision of earning a steady revenue stream by the allocation of a part of its reserve assets to several yield-generating strategies such as investing in US government bonds and partnering with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Under the partnership with Coinbase, Coinbase proposed that MakerDAO deposit around $1.6 billion worth of USD Coin (USDC) on the platform, allowing the latter to earn an annual yield of 1.5% per year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MakerDAO has also allocated USDC on a number of other decentralized finance platforms, including Idle Finance, Aave, and Compound. Additionally, DAI stablecoin holders have also received an annual reward of 1% since last month. MakerDAO is a platform managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), with holders of the MKR token being able to vote on governance proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move to deposit USDC on Yearn could also improve the protocol&rsquo;s dwindling user activity. Yearn Finance&rsquo;s total value locked (TVL) is currently at around $442 million. This is a small fraction compared to the protocol&rsquo;s all-time high TVL of $6.9 billion, which was reached in December 2021, according to data sourced from DeFiLlama. The total value locked is an indicator of the worth of the assets deployed on a protocol.&nbsp;</p>
An Active Community&nbsp;
<p>The MakerDAO community has been quite active when it comes to governance proposals and recently voted on two important proposals related to Alameda Research and Gemini&rsquo;s GUSD stablecoin. In November 2022, the protocol announced that the community had voted on and passed a governance vote to remove the Alameda Research-linked RenBTC from its collateral vaults. The move was made to reduce the exposure to what the DAO deemed a risky asset following the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MakerDAO community is also debating about keeping Gemini&rsquo;s GUSD stablecoin as part of the reserves. The vote comes amidst growing concerns about a liquidity crisis that has impacted Gemini&rsquo;s Earn program. Maker and Gemini had announced a partnership in September 2022, which allows Maker to earn 1.5% whenever the GUSD in Makers Peg Stability Module (PSM) goes above $100 million.&nbsp;</p>
