Terra Classic has made a significant move in the world of cryptocurrency with the passing of the LUNC Proposal 11487, and it&#8217;s leaving many wondering: what does this mean for the future of LUNC prices?  The proposal&#8217;s successful passage signifies a positive step towards achieving Terra Classic&#8217;s vision of a more decentralized and sustainable blockchain network. It also highlights the importance of community participation in shaping the future of the cryptocurrency.  With almost half of the voters showing their support, it&#8217;s clear that this decision has the potential to make a lasting impact on the Terra ecosystem.

According to the proposal, the fee will vary from 0% when the peg is reached to 100% at a 50% deviation from the peg. Now that the proposal has been approved, the L1 team will establish an actual timetable and implement the mechanism in four stages.

The Terra ecosystem is currently struggling to maintain its positive momentum, and the decline in LUNC&#8217;s price is indicative of this struggle.
