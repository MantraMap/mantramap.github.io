<ul><li>Do Kwon’s lawyers have questioned the U.S. SEC’s jurisdiction over crypto assets.&nbsp;</li><li>The lawyers have requested the court to dismiss the securities fraud allegations made by the regulator.&nbsp;</li><li>U.S. law enforcement has sought Kwon’s extradition from Montenegro.&nbsp;</li><li>The Terraform Labs co-founder was recently indicted for the forgery of legal documents.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Do Kwon is taking on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by bringing the agency’s jurisdiction over crypto assets into question. Lawyers representing the disgraced Terraform Labs executive have claimed that the lawsuit filed by the securities regulator in the United States is unfounded due to the nature of the crypto assets in question.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Do Kwon’s Lawyers Request Judge To Dismiss SEC’s Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-22/do-kwon-says-sec-is-out-of-bounds-in-pursuing-crypto-fraud-suit#xj4y7vzkg?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Do Kwon’s defense team has argued that the crypto asset at the center of the SEC’s lawsuit, the TerraUSD stablecoin, is a currency and not a security. The lawyers cited U.S. law while pointing out that regulators are prohibited from “using federal securities law to assert jurisdiction over the digital assets in this case.”. To that end, the lawyers have requested a Manhattan judge to dismiss the lawsuit filed against the Terraform Labs co-founder by the securities regulator. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The SEC’s improper assertion of power here by trying to shoehorn all cryptocurrencies into its definition of a security fails.” </p><cite>Court filing by Do Kwon’s lawyers.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The filing by Do Kwon’s lawyers highlighted the fact that the U.S. Congress, the executive branch, and the SEC have not been able to clarify as to what constitutes “security”. They argued that the securities fraud lawsuit filed by the securities regulator fails to take into account that TerraUSD’s status as a security hasn’t been proven yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>U.S. law enforcement agencies have sought the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro, where he was arrested last month for trying to board an international flight using fake documents. Earlier this week Kwon was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-indicted-montenegro-for-forgery/">indicted</a> by local prosecutors in the State of Podgorica for forging legal documents, including his passport. The Terra co-founder may be handed a sentence of up to five years. </p>

<ul><li>Gemini has announced its plans to open a crypto derivatives platform outside the United States.&nbsp;</li><li>Gemini Foundation’s first offering will be a BTC perpetual contract denominated in GUSD.&nbsp;</li><li>The new platform will be available to clients in dozens of non-U.S. countries including Singapore, Brazil, and India.&nbsp;</li><li>News of the new platform comes amid rumors of Coinbase setting up an offshore derivatives platform.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-files-pre-registration-osc-canada/">Gemini</a> is following in the footsteps of rival crypto exchange Coinbase and setting up an offshore crypto platform. The American exchange announced earlier today that it plans to launch Gemini Foundation, a crypto derivatives platform based outside the United States. The move comes after rumors about Coinbase setting up a similar platform in Bermuda amid intensifying regulatory crackdown by regulators in the United States. </p>



<h2><strong>Gemini Steps Up Global Expansion Efforts</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-foundation-a-non-us-crypto-derivatives-platform" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> from the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange, the first offering of the Gemini Foundation will be a BTC perpetual contract denominated in the GUSD stablecoin. The crypto derivatives platform will subsequently launch an ETH/GUSD perpetual contract. The derivatives offerings will reportedly expand in the coming months. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Gemini Foundation will allow eligible customers to leverage their crypto assets to achieve long or short crypto exposure in order to manage risk, generate returns, and gain directional exposure.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The platform’s offerings will not be limited to derivatives. Customers from over thirty countries will be able to trade spot products as well. These countries include Singapore, Hong Kong, India, El Salvador, Thailand, Bermuda, Brazil, and South Korea, among several others. The platform will not be available to customers in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funding the account will require customers to convert their USD and USD Coin to GUSD on a 1:1 basis. Perpetual funding payments will have to be made exclusively in GUSD. Traders on the platform will be allowed to trade using a maximum leverage of 100x, with 20x being the default. News of the new platform comes just hours after Gemini <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-expand-global-engineering-and-operations-teams-with-new-india-office" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> that it would be opening its second-largest engineering hub in India as part of its global expansion. The exchange also appointed its Chief Technology Officer, Pravjit Tiwana, as the Chief Executive Officer of the Asia Pacific Region (APAC). </p>

<ul><li>Open Exchange recently published a list of investors that supposedly participated in their funding round.&nbsp;</li><li>Most of the listed investors have stated that they did not participate in OPNX’s funding round.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto platform has criticized the concerned investors and accused them of misrepresenting their involvement.</li><li>The exchange’s primary token $FLEX has lost more than 23% of its value following the controversy.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Open Exchange (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-crypto-exchange-3ac-coinflex-live/">OPNX</a>), founded by infamous crypto personalities Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, has run into trouble with a group of investors that the crypto platform claims were a part of its funding round. The investors have denied funding the exchange, leading to a controversial exchange of statements between the parties involved. Open Exchange was launched in February this year by Zhu and Davies, the men behind the defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). </p>



<h2><strong>OPNX Criticizes Investors For Denying Association, Calls It An Ugly Move</strong></h2>



<p>OPNX took to <a href="https://twitter.com/OPNX_Official/status/1649426185015685126" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to reveal the investors who had backed the crypto exchange. The list of supposed investors included AppWorks, Susquehanna (SIG), DRW, MIAX Group, Merchant Bank International, Token Bay Capital, Nascent, and Tuwaiq Limited. Open Exchange’s CEO Leslie Lamb could be seen thanking the investors for backing the exchange. According to the Twitter thread, the investors not only contributed capital but also provided feedback on product offerings, tokenomics, legal framework, etc. </p>



<p>Of the investors that OPNX claimed participated in its funding round, almost half have denied giving any funds to the crypto exchange. Venture Capital firm Nascent responded to Open Exchange’s tweet and clarified that it did not participate in the platform’s fundraising round. A spokesperson for DRW told <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/21/drw-says-its-not-an-opnx-investor-denying-opnxs-tweet-implying-otherwise/" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinDesk </a>in a statement, “DRW is not an investor in OPNX nor are any of its affiliates investors in OPNX.” This was followed by a similar statement from Susquehanna (SIG) which read, “We have not provided any funding to OPNX and have no intentions to do so.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just to clarify, Nascent did not participate in an OPNX fundraising round, we invested in FLEX tokens in early 2021.</p>&mdash; Nascent (@nascentxyz) <a href="https://twitter.com/nascentxyz/status/1649464652102004737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">April 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>OPNX responded to the denials from its supposed investors by accusing them of seeking profits while simultaneously denying association with the exchange due to fear of backlash on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We believe in full disclosure of our institutional backers and key strategic partners. Should any party waver in their dedication to transparency and industry advancement, we express our disappointment at their misrepresentation and prefer not to have them as investors in future.&#8221;</p><cite>Open Exchange&#8217;s response to investors</cite></blockquote>



<p>The controversy surrounding Open Exchange and its investors has led to a significant decline in the price of $FLEX, the native token of CoinFlex that will also serve as the primary token of Su Zhu’s crypto venture. FLEX’s price sank more than 23% shortly after the investors denied affiliation with OPNX. The token is currently trading at $1.06.</p>

<p>Coinbase’s Layer 2 network Base is planning to launch its mainnet before the end of this year. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-exchange-soon/">Coinbase</a> launched the Ethereum-focused blockchain’s testnet in February this year, marketing it as a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly network for the crypto community to build decentralized applications. </p>



<h2><strong>Base Wants To Decentralize From Coinbase Soon</strong></h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/21/coinbases-layer-2-blockchain-base-plans-for-2023-mainnet-launch/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF_UUQ8GWq6CyAnnFbvOk5rmyaHZ6dVOmk7-BDo8NbX6yc7ETqQi_Mry_q5sSSayPbfwGIc3LfNkb7hKirM1wrs4s5wFvmWpNUhs2wa2-1au0-DNSdNercJjnm5mPsoe9vv_4bFcu4RZYLqFS4z87v2q9kHEXlBVnUWX9LLmeKO7" rel="nofollow noopener">TechCrunch</a>, Base’s lead Jesse Pollak revealed that the Layer 2 blockchain is aiming for its mainnet launch in 2023. Pollak, who also serves as the Head of Protocols for Coinbase, added that the short-term vision for Base is to debut it on the mainnet and decentralize it. The long-term vision is to attract a million builders to the network to build easy-to-use products that will then attract a billion users. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“It’s coming soon, we’re working hard on it. It’s our number one priority alongside decentralization goals and the rest of the year is really about making sure we get there as quickly as possible.” </p><cite>Jesse Pollak, Base Lead &amp; Coinbase Head of Protocols</cite></blockquote>



<p>Jesse Pollak also disclosed that Base is planning to become decentralized from Coinbase within “months or years” and not a decade. Coinbase Chief Brian Armstrong reportedly said to Pollak, “We can’t not decentralize this. We have to live up to that value and to that ethos.”</p>



<p>Since going live in testnet earlier this year, Base has attracted several builders and crypto projects. Uniswap and Aave are reportedly among the protocols that are being recruited to the Layer 2 network. DeFi crypto exchange <a href="https://gov.gmx.io/t/deploy-gmx-on-coinbase-s-level-2-base/1862" rel="nofollow noopener">GMX</a> is also considering deploying on Base. Other crypto entities that have committed to building on Base include Chainlink, Etherscan, Magic Eden, Nansen, Wormhole, Dune, and Animoca Brands</p>

<ul><li>Binance is reportedly under investigation by federal prosecutors and police in Brazil.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange allegedly helped its clients evade a stop order on crypto futures trading.&nbsp;</li><li>Futures are deemed securities in Brazil irrespective of the nature of the underlying assets.&nbsp;</li><li>The investigation was initiated after Brazil&#8217;s top financial regulator reported suspicious activities at Binance.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange has once again run into trouble with the law, this time in the South American nation of Brazil. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-refused-justin-suns-huobi-stake/">Binance</a> is reportedly being investigated in Brazil by the Federal Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the Federal Police of Brazil for allegedly offering securities to its clients by helping them evade a stop order on crypto futures. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance Allegedly Offered Derivatives Despite A Stop Order</strong></h2>



<p>According to a recent report by Brazil’s <a href="https://valor.globo.com/financas/criptomoedas/noticia/2023/04/18/ministrio-pblico-e-polcia-federal-investigam-suposto-crime-financeiro-da-binance.ghtml" rel="nofollow noopener">Valor Econômico</a>, the public prosecutor’s office and the federal police are investigating Binance for alleged financial crimes related to the products being offered. The investigation was initiated after Brazil’s Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (Securities and Exchange Commission) informed the Attorney General of the State of São Paulo that the crypto exchange may have continued to offer crypto derivatives to Brazilian clients despite a stop order that was issued in 2020. </p>



<p>The Brazilian regulator reportedly provided screenshots to the federal police which showed Binance’s support personnel guiding its customers to change the website’s language in order to be able to access the futures trading platform. Futures are deemed securities in Brazil irrespective of the nature of the underlying assets.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>(Binance) reiterates that it does not offer derivatives in Brazil, that it operates in compliance with the local regulatory scenario and maintains a permanent dialogue with the authorities for the development of the crypto and blockchain segment in Brazil and in the world.” </p><cite>Binance’s statement to Valor Econômico</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 2020, the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission initiated administrative proceedings against Binance over the crypto derivatives offered on its trading platform. According to the regulator, the crypto exchange’s website had extensive content in Portuguese, which marketed crypto futures that could be traded with up to 125 times leverage after opening an account “in less than 30 seconds”. The website reportedly had no mention of the restrictions on such offerings for clients resigning in Brazil.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>On Thursday, the European Commission’s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation or MiCA received overwhelming among EU lawmakers.</li><li>517 legislators voted in favor of the new broad crypto licensing regime that will allow crypto service providers to operate regulated digital asset businesses across the EU.</li><li>38 lawmakers opposed the bill while 18 legislators abstained from declaring support as Europe becomes the first “major” jurisdiction to publish crypto regulations.</li></ul>



<p>On Thursday, Legislators from the European Union <a href="https://twitter.com/McGuinnessEU/status/1648999671644188674" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/McGuinnessEU/status/1648999671644188674" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">voted</a> in support of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation or MiCA , a crypto licensing policy first introduced in 2020 by the European Commission.</p>



<p>517 EU lawmakers threw their voting power behind the MiCA bill, pushing the bill into law. The bill will be actively implemented 12-18 months after lawmakers publish the regulations in the EU&#8217;s Official Journal. This is only possible after the EU&#8217;s council and the parliament both approve MiCA. </p>



<p>Thursday&#8217;s vote followed a Wednesday parliamentary debate where several legislators <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-backed-by-senior-eu-lawmakers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-backed-by-senior-eu-lawmakers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">voiced support for the bill</a> ahead of the vote on Thursday. Rhetoric from lawmakers like EPP’s Lídia Pereira, MEP Ernest Urtasun, and lawmaker Stefan Berger stressed the benefits of allowing crypto exchanges and wallet providers to operate under a regulated licensing framework. </p>



<p>Lawmakers also backed requiring stablecoin issuers to maintain sufficient reserves for their tokens. </p>



<p>MiCA faced opposition from 38 lawmakers during today&#8217;s vote. 18 legislators abstained from declaring support as Europe becomes the first “major” jurisdiction to publish crypto regulations.</p>



<p>&#8220;We’re protecting consumers and safeguarding financial stability and market integrity,&#8221; the European Commission&#8217;s Mairead McGuinness said, saluting the decision as a &#8220;world first&#8221;. </p>

<h2>AML Regulation Shadows MiCA Vote</h2>



<p>Lawmakers in the European Parliament voted for a separate law aimed at beefing up anti-money laundering systems. Under the Transfer of Funds regulation, crypto businesses must implement thorough know-your-customer checks. 529 lawmakers voted for the bill while 29 voted against the policy. 14 legislators abstained. </p>

<ul><li>Do Kwon has reportedly been indicted in Montenegro for forging his legal documents.&nbsp;</li><li>Prosecutors in the country’s capital have also indicted the Terraform Labs co-founder’s associate Han Chang-jun.</li><li>The prosecutors are seeking an extension on the detention of Kwon and his associate.&nbsp;</li><li>The indictment comes almost one month after the Terraform Labs co-founder was arrested.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Do Kwon, the Terraform Labs co-founder who was on the run from law enforcement agencies till last month, has reportedly been indicted in Montenegro for forging his travel documents. The indictment comes more than three weeks after Kwon was arrested in Podgorica airport while attempting to flee the country.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Prosecutors Ask Court To Extend Do Kwon’s Detention</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by South Korea’s <a href="https://www.blockmedia.co.kr/archives/312089" rel="nofollow noopener">Block Media</a>, local prosecutors in the State of Podgorica have issued indictments to Do Kwon and Han Chang-jun, the former Chief Financial Officer of Terraform Labs. As per the documents submitted in the Montenegrin Basic Court, the prosecutor&#8217;s Office of the State of Podgorica intends to prosecute the Terraform Labs co-founder and his associate for making and using a false passport and other identification documents.</p>



<p>The court filing further revealed that prosecutors were seeking an extension on the detention of Kwon and his associate. The decision on the extension is expected before April 23, which is when the initial 30-day detention of the Terraform Labs executives will end. If convicted, the duo may get a prison sentence of up to five years. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities have attempted to arrest Shin Hyun-Seong aka Daniel Shin, another co-founder of Terraform Labs. However, Seoul Southern District Court has refused to issue an arrest warrant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do Kwon was arrested on March 23 at Podgorica airport after he attempted to board a private plane to Dubai using a fake Costa Rican passport. His arrest put an end to the months-long manhunt that involved several law enforcement agencies, including Interpol. The United States and South Korea have sought Kwon’s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-south-korea-seek-do-kwons-extradition/">extradition</a> to prosecute him for his role in the collapse of Terra last year. However, Montenegro&#8217;s Justice Minister has clarified that Do Kwon will have to face prosecution in Montenegro before he can be extradited.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Tornado Cash developer will be released next Wednesday after authorities install surveillance devices in Alexey Pertsev&#8217;s home.</li><li>Pertsev was arrested by Dutch police in August 2022 after a directive from the country’s financial crime authority FIOD.</li><li>Authorities allege that Pertsev laundered more than 500,000 ETH in supposed illicit wealth shortly after U.S. authorities sanctioned the crypto mixer that Alexey wrote code for.</li></ul>



<p>Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev will be moved from prison to home arrest ahead of his trial for allegedly laundering millions in digital assets through sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash, a Dutch court ruled. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/20/tornado-cash-developer-pertsev-can-be-freed-pending-trial-dutch-court-rules/?utm_content=editorial&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=coindesk_main&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_term=organic" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/20/tornado-cash-developer-pertsev-can-be-freed-pending-trial-dutch-court-rules/?utm_content=editorial&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=coindesk_main&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_term=organic" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Coin Desk</a>, Alexey&#8217;s attorney Keith Cheng voiced excitement about his client&#8217;s freedom. Cheng said the case raises critical concerns about privacy on the Ethereum blockchain and promised to intensify defense efforts now that &#8220;he can be set free&#8221;. </p>



<p>The Tornado Cash developer will be released next Wednesday after authorities install surveillance devices in Alexey Pertsev&#8217;s home Pertsev will also wear an ankle bracelet to monitor his movements. A Dutch court will hold an investigative hearing on May 24 where a judge will assess Pertsev&#8217;s residency status. </p>



<h2>Tornado Cash&#8217; Alexey Pertsev Arrested For Money Laundering</h2>



<p>Dutch police detained Pertsev back in August 2022 after the country&#8217;s financial crime authority FIOD issued arrest orders. Authorities claimed that the Tornado Cash code writer laundered over 500,000 ETH worth over $984 million at current prices. They also claimed that Pertsev should have known the funds were generated from criminal operations. </p>



<p>Government prosecutors claimed that Pertsev was a flight risk following his arrested and should remain in prison awaiting trial. Also, investigators said the Tornado Cash developer could hide or destroy evidence if released. </p>



<h2>North Korean Links Attract U.S. Sanctions</h2>



<p>The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/us-treasury-tornado-cash-ofac-license/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/us-treasury-tornado-cash-ofac-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sanctioned</a> Tornado Cash shortly before Pertsev&#8217;s arrest. Federal prosecutors said the North Korean hacker group Lazarus leveraged the crypto mixer to launder stolen funds and finance crime. </p>

<p>Coinbase is reportedly planning to launch an offshore derivatives trading platform after receiving a license to operate in the island nation of Bermuda. The American exchange previously hinted at setting up an exchange overseas and focusing on global expansion in light of the hostile treatment of crypto firms at the hand of regulators in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>U.S. Regulators Force Coinbase To Look At Offshore Options</strong></h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/an-update-to-coinbases-global-scale-to-go-broad-and-deep" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>, Coinbase revealed that it had obtained a Class F license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BME) under the Digital Asset Business Act. The American crypto exchange added that it had chosen Bermuda as one of its international hubs given the high level of experience that its financial regulator carried. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Bermuda was one of the first financial centers to pass comprehensive digital assets regulation in 2018, and its regulatory environment is long known for a high level of rigor, transparency, compliance, and cooperation.”</p></blockquote>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/04/19/coinbase-gets-bermuda-license-plans-to-launch-offshore-exchange-in-coming-weeks/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fortune</a>, Coinbase is planning to launch an offshore derivatives exchange in Bermuda as soon as next week. The plans were revealed by a person close to the exchange. CEO <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-preparing-legal-battle-u-s-sec/">Brian Armstrong</a> has been vocal about his company’s efforts toward global expansion. News of the offshore exchange in Bermuda comes just a day after the CEO hinted at relocating the firm abroad. At a fintech conference in London, Armstrong stated, “Anything is on the table. Including, you know, relocating or whatever is necessary.” Coinbase had previously contacted its institutional investors about plans to potentially set up a new crypto-trading platform overseas. </p>



<p>Brian Armstrong and other industry leaders have repeatedly warned about the consequences of the crackdown on the U.S crypto industry by the country’s regulator. The anti-crypto campaign is led by the Securities and Exchange Commission with Gary Gensler at its helm. Since the beginning of 2023, the securities regulator has initiated enforcement actions against several crypto firms and issued Wells notices to multiple crypto entities including Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Maple Finance has launched a cash management pool for U.S. Treasury Bills.</li><li>The DeFi crypto lender’s new on-chain cash management pool will simplify access to U.S. Treasury yields.&nbsp;</li><li>Maple’s new product will only be available to entities and individuals based outside the United States.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Maple Finance has launched a new cash management pool for U.S. Treasury Bill yields. The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-sec-proposal-targeting-defi-crypto/">DeFi</a> crypto lender’s new product will allow accredited web3 investors to access the pool that invests in one-month Treasury Bills, with no minimum lock-up period.  </p>



<h2><strong>Maple Finance’s New T-Bill Pool Is Not Available For U.S. Customers</strong></h2>



<p>According to a<a href="https://www.maple.finance/news/maple-cash-management-pool/" rel="nofollow noopener"> blog post</a> by Maple, the new product will enable decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), offshore firms, Web3 treasures, and high net-worth individuals to park their idle funds in its pool for direct access to Treasury bill yields, whilst meeting their liquidity, risk and accounting requirements. However, the cash management pool will not be available to clients based in the United States.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This pool lets stablecoin holders focus on their core business activities whilst we take care of the technicalities. The access to banking and deposit services for startups has narrowed so the importance of having this service on-chain cannot be overstated.” </p><cite>Sid Powell, CEO and Co-Founder, Maple Finance.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Maple’s T-Bill pool will offer investors the one-month Treasury bill yield. A 0.5% management fee will be applicable on stablecoin deposits. As per the current T-Bill rate, investors will get a 3.2% yield annually. All deposited funds will be directed to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) which lends it to Room40 Capital, an institutional crypto hedge fund that will act as the sole borrower from the pool to invest in the U.S. Treasury Bills. The DeFi crypto lender has simplified the onboarding process such that clients will be able to complete applications within 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking on the new T-Bill pool, Maple developers stated that most on-chain risk-free offerings do not seem safe enough to attract investment from treasury funds. “Counterparty risk is either too high, assets too illiquid, too complicated with ETFs, or rates between 1-2% too low for the level of smart contract risk,” the developers added.</p>
