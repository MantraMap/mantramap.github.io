<ul><li>Revolut will stop offering ADA, MATIC, and SOL for users in the United States starting September 18, 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>The British neobank’s announcement came after its service provider Bakkt delisted the tokens.</li><li>The neobank clarified that there were no plans to delist the tokens in other markets.&nbsp;</li><li>ADA, MATIC, and SOL were listed as unregistered securities in the SEC’s recent lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.</li></ul>



<p>London-based Revolut has announced that it will delist three mainstream crypto tokens from the American version of its platform. The British neobank will stop offering Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) to customers based in the United States starting September 18, 2023. The crypto tokens boast a combined market capitalization of more than $24 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Delisting Will Be Limited To Revolut’s American Users</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/revolut-to-delist-solana-cardano-polygon-tokens-for-us-users" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Revolut’s customers will be able to sell off ADA, SOL, and MATIC from their accounts till September 18, 2023, following which the cryptocurrencies will automatically be converted to USD deposits. The British neobank’s latest move came after its service provider Bakkt Holdings’ delisted the crypto tokens last month due to increasing regulatory uncertainty in the United States.  The firm told its customers that the delisting of SOL, ADA, and MATIC would be limited to the United States with other markets remaining unaffected. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our US crypto services provider has decided to delist these tokens due to the changing laws and regulations around cryptocurrency in the US. Because of this, we’ll no longer be able to process your buy and sell orders for these tokens.”</p><cite>Revolut</cite></blockquote>



<p>Interestingly, MATIC and ADA surged following the news of their imminent delisting from Revolut. Meanwhile, SOL saw a slight decrease in its price. The three cryptocurrencies were previously delisted by the social trading platform eToro and California-based brokerage <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/">Robinhood</a> as well. The tokens were also listed as unregistered securities in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase. </p>

<ul><li>Nasdaq has refiled BlackRock’s application for a Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).&nbsp;</li><li>The ETF application was previously rejected by the SEC for not providing sufficient details about the crypto product.&nbsp;</li><li>The Chicago Board Options Exchange also refiled Fidelity’s rejected Bitcoin ETF application earlier today.&nbsp;</li><li>BlackRock’s latest application stated that Coinbase would provide market surveillance as well as BTC custody services.</li></ul>



<p>Nasdaq has refiled Wall Street giant BlackRock Inc.’s application for offering a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The second largest stock market by market capitalization submitted BlackRock’s BTC ETF application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Nasdaq’s refiling was accompanied by that of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), which refiled applications for multiple operators, including Fidelity and ARK Invest.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Shares Surge After Refiling of Multiple Bitcoin ETF Applications</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-03/blackrock-s-bitcoin-etf-application-is-refiled-by-nasdaq-to-sec" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the latest filing by Nasdaq included details that were sought by the SEC when it rejected the initial applications last week. The revised <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/rulebook/NASDAQ/filings/SR-NASDAQ-2023-016_Resubmission.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> named Coinbase as the crypto exchange that would work with BlackRock on market surveillance. Bloomberg reported that a surveillance agreement with an exchange could play a significant role in convincing the securities regulator, given that such an agreement would reduce fraud and market manipulation. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-brian-armstrong-sold-29000-share/">Coinbase</a> has also been named as the custodian for the BTC holdings associated with BlackRock’s ETF. </p>



<p>The latest developments sent Coinbase’s share price soaring. The stock has gained more than 11% since market open and is currently trading at $79.9. The refiling of multiple BTC ETF applications led to optimistic sentiments among crypto investors, which prompted the flagship cryptocurrency to add as much as 2.4% to its price. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $31,112.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other companies which revised their applications and refiled with the United States SEC included Invesco, VanEck, 21Shares, and WisdomTree. The revised spot BTC ETF applications filed by the Chicago Board Options Exchange on behalf of Fidelity, WisdomTree, and ARK Invest also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/coinbase-surges-after-cboe-names-crypto-exchange-bitcoin-etf-application-2023-07-03/" rel="nofollow noopener">named </a>Coinbase as the crypto exchange partner for market surveillance. All of the prior applications were rejected by the SEC for failing to name the partner in the surveillance-sharing agreements,</p>

<ul><li>A newly formed DAO in the Azuki community voted to hire a lawyer after last week’s Elementals launch.</li><li>The DAO comprised of 74 members wants to recover 20,000 ETH from pseudonymous founder Zagabond and the blue-chip NFT project.</li><li>Azuki’s community voiced heavy backlash against the Elementals NFTs with members saying they look strikingly similar to the original collection.</li></ul>



<p>A newly formed DAO in the Azuki community &#8211; a popular Japanese manga-themed project &#8211;<a href="https://snapshot.org/#/azuki-dao.eth/proposal/0x065ffcc4878fc66b574e8ad23d2c2033d7896c7683457a3f6e3f5e449e637298" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://snapshot.org/#/azuki-dao.eth/proposal/0x065ffcc4878fc66b574e8ad23d2c2033d7896c7683457a3f6e3f5e449e637298" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">voted</a> to hire a lawyer for the recovery of 20,000 ETH raised last week during the Elementals mint, a new NFT collection from Chiru Labs that holders say is similar to the original collection. </p>



<p>The snapshot proposal floated over the weekend by Azuki DAO was titled &#8220;Hire a Lawyer and Help the community reclaim the 20000ETH from Zagabond&#8221; and saw 37 votes out of 74 members that comprise the newly formed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). </p>



<p>88.35% of voters backed recovering nearly $40 million in ETH raised by the Elementals and reallocating the proceeds to community incentives meant to support artists, creators, and builders. </p>



<h2>Azuki Elementals Just Like Original Collections, Community Cries Out</h2>



<p>Sunday&#8217;s vote follows intense community scrutiny surrounding the Elementals launch and claims that pieces from the new collection look almost exactly the same as NFTs from the original 10,000 profile picture (PFP) project that debuted in February 2022.</p>



<p>Elementals was released last week by Chiru Labs &#8211; the startup behind the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/azuki-reveals-physical-backed-tokens-for-on-chain-ownership-of-physical-items/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/azuki-reveals-physical-backed-tokens-for-on-chain-ownership-of-physical-items/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azuki</a> project &#8211; and raised  20,000 ETH in 15 minutes. Each NFT from the new collection cost 2 ETH to mint worth roughly $3,900 at current market prices. </p>



<p>The hype was shortlived as community members raised concerns over similarities between the two collections, leading to sell-offs across NFT marketplaces. Azuki&#8217;s floor price &#8211; the cheapest available NFT on open markets &#8211; fell over 50% and now sits around 6 ETH. </p>



<p>Azuki DAO which says it is made of OG holders of the original project argued that the pseudonymous founder Zagabond let down the community and tried to pacify community members with &#8220;empathy checks and promises&#8221;.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We have max-minted the 2e elemental beanz and are anticipating the release of a new product, as suggested by the Asian ambassador. Despite our efforts, we have only been given a similar profile picture to that of the original Azuki holders, and nothing more. The Team is blatantly scamming us&#8230;</p></blockquote>



<p>In other related news, the DAO governance token contract for BEANZ was exploited for around 35 ETH due to a signature vulnerability. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Germany’s top watchdog BaFin turned down an application for a custody license from Binance, FinanceFWD reported.</li><li>Paysafe also announced its decision to end support for Euro transactions by September this year.</li><li>This comes as the exchange suffers blow after blow in European markets including being de-banked in Australia and pulling its registration application in the UK. </li><li>The company is also facing stiff regulatory action in the U.S. following lawsuits from the SEC alleging securities violations. </li></ul>



<p>Binance continues to face hurdles in European markets following a decision from its banking partner to end support for Euro transactions and BaFin&#8217;s rejection of the company&#8217;s custody license. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/binance-says-paysafe-to-cease-being-its-euro-payments-provider?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/binance-says-paysafe-to-cease-being-its-euro-payments-provider?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, banking partner Paysafe will no longer facilitate Euro deposits and withdrawals to and from the crypto exchange from September 2023. The decision will take effect from September 25 and will see Binance cut off from Paysafe&#8217;s Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) network, a spokesperson for the trading venue said. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In the meantime, all methods of depositing and withdrawing other fiat currencies as well as buying and selling crypto on Binance.com remain unaffected, including bank transfer using one of the other fiat currencies supported by Binance, and buying and selling crypto directly via credit or debit card</p></blockquote>



<p>Binance&#8217;s license to offer custody services in Germany was rejected by the country&#8217;s top financial regulator BaFin, FinanceFWD <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-lizenz-deutschland/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-lizenz-deutschland/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a>. The report cited people familiar with the saying, saying that it&#8217;s yet unclear if BaFin&#8217;s move constitutes an official decision or an intention to turn down the application for a custody license.</p>



<h2>Binance In The Midst Of European Hurricane</h2>



<p>The two latest setbacks for Binance come amid a string of blows for the world&#8217;s largest centralized crypto exchange across European jurisdictions and trouble in the U.S. </p>



<p>Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s company withdrew its license applications in Cyprus and the UK ahead of MiCA&#8217;s implementation by 2024. The company also requested to terminate its derivatives license in Australia amid a de-banking crisis with local banking partners. </p>



<p>Belgium&#8217;s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA)<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/belgium-binance-cease-all-crypto-services/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/belgium-binance-cease-all-crypto-services/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> issued a cease and desist orde</a>r for all crypto services offered to Belgian clients. </p>



<p>In the U.S. the company is accused of violating securities laws alongside exchange rival Coinbase. However, both entities have denied the allegations and attempted to throw out their respective lawsuits. </p>

<h2>MicroStrategy Ups Bitcoin Holds As Spot ETF Applications Surge </h2>



<p>Although MicroStrategy has been buying Bitcoin since 2020, the company&#8217;s latest acquisition comes at a time when institutions are racing to provide U.S. investors with America&#8217;s first Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund. </p>



<p>Indeed, wall street titans like BlackRock have filed for a Bitcoin Spot ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other players like WisdomTree and Invesco followed suit with respective applications. Fidelity, another giant asset manager with trillions in AUM is expected to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fidelity-bitcoin-spot-etf-blackrock/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fidelity-bitcoin-spot-etf-blackrock/" rel="noreferrer noopener">file its application by Tuesday. </a></p>

<h2>Bitcoin Spot ETF Race Heats Up</h2>



<p>Fidelity enters a pool of institutions and companies in the open race to offer America&#8217;s first Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund, a product that the SEC and Chair Gary Gensler have notoriously rejected on several occasions. </p>



<p>BlackRock <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/us-banks-bitcoins-largest-holder-mstr/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/us-banks-bitcoins-largest-holder-mstr/" rel="noreferrer noopener">submitted</a> its filing for a Bitcoin Spot ETF on June 15, ushering a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-rallies-29000-blackrock-etf-plays/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-rallies-29000-blackrock-etf-plays/" rel="noreferrer noopener">wave of applications</a> from other institutions like WisdomTree, Invesco, and now Fidelity. Crypto proponents speculate that the trillion-dollar asset manager stands a chance at success after successfully filing over 500 applications with the SEC.</p>



<p>Grayscale, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, has filed a number of unsuccessful applications with the securities watchdog. The company has repeatedly tried to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product to a Bitcoin Spot ETF with no luck. Grayscale is currently locked in a legal tussle with the SEC over the regulator&#8217;s decision to deny its application despite approving Bitcoin Futures ETFs. </p>



<p>Bloomberg analysts believe that Grayscale has a <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1673685658538323968?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1673685658538323968?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">70% chance</a> of winning in court after three judges heard arguments from both sides. This has also seemingly upped the chances of BlackRock&#8217;s application going through as the SEC could look to soften the impact of coming up short in court, per comments from Bloomberg&#8217;s Eric Balchunas and Elliott Z. Stein.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Chibi Finance team disappeared overnight in what seems like a rug pull, PeckShield noted.</li><li>555 Ether (ETH) worth around $1 million was drained from the project’s liquidity pools and deposited into the crypto mixer Tornado Cash.</li><li>The team&#8217;s social media accounts and websites also mysteriously vanished, leaving users with no access to the people behind the project.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto project Chibi Finance which runs atop the Ethereum Layer 2 scaling protocol Arbitrum allegedly rugged its users and disappeared with around $1 million in Ether (ETH).</p>



<p>The project styled itself as a yield-optimizing protocol that allowed users to automatically rack up rewards after depositing their crypto tokens on the platform. The platform&#8217;s native token CHIBI tanked 98% in value following the incident.</p>



<h2>Chibi Finance Team Goes AWOL</h2>



<p>On-chain security firm PeckShield reported that the Chibi Finance team drained 555 ETH worth $1 million from the project&#8217;s liquidity pools. </p>

<p>According to another security startup <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1673639936631734272?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1673639936631734272?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CertiK</a>, the developers were able to do this as they added malicious code in Chibi&#8217;s smart contract. This allowed the team to steal user funds after the contract was deployed and crypto investment poured in. The CertiK team noted that this is the 12th exit scam tracked so far in 2023.</p>



<p>After stealing the assets, the team moved funds from Arbitrum to Ethereum&#8217;s ecosystem. PeckShield said the 555 ETH was then deposited in the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based platform used to obscure transactions. </p>



<p>The protocol is often used by crypto criminals to launder stolen wealth and was sanctioned by U.S. authorities last year due to suspicions that the North Korean hacker group Lazarus uses the service.</p>



<p>Community concerns over a rug pull increased after the Chibi Finance team scrubbed its digital presence following the asset drain. The project&#8217;s Twitter profile was deactivated and its website is unavailable. Crypto influencers like <a href="https://twitter.com/defi_mochi/status/1671159738233651200?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/defi_mochi/status/1671159738233651200?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@defi_mochi</a> also deleted their posts on the project. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Bybit will offer crypto exchange and digital asset custody services to users in Cyprus after bagging a license in the country.</li><li>The trading venue sets up shop in Cyprus ahead of the implementation of MiCA, the first crypto regulatory regime in a major jurisdiction.</li><li>Bybit enters Cyprus as Binance exits the country amid global regulatory woes and uncertainty in the U.S. following successive crackdowns by the SEC.</li></ul>



<p>Bybit, one of the world&#8217;s largest centralized exchanges, has obtained a crypto license to offer its services in Cyprus. The move comes ahead of the EU&#8217;s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) which comes into effect by mid-2024. </p>



<p>Regulators in the country have approved Bybit to “offer a full suite of services&#8221;, per a statement from the trading venue. Bybit CEO and co-founder Ben Zhou remarked that the license signals a mix of global expansion and compliance with &#8220;robust regulatory frameworks. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We wholeheartedly support the regulatory objective of building a cryptocurrency industry that is both compliant, secure, and transparent, ultimately benefiting all those seeking financial freedom,”</p></blockquote>



<p>Bybit exited the Canadian market in May due to a regulatory shift in the country. Canadian users will lose access to Bybit&#8217;s trading platform by July/August this year.</p>



<h2>Binane Bows Out Of Cyprus, Bybit Rolls In</h2>



<p>Bybit&#8217;s entrance into the country follows the exit of crypto&#8217;s largest centralized exchange &#8211; Binance. Binance <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-under-investigation-in-france/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-under-investigation-in-france/" rel="noreferrer noopener">deregistered</a> its local arm ahead of <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">MiCA&#8217;s implementation</a> expected next year. The leading crypto exchange also withdrew its crypto license application in Austria per <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-oesterreich/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-oesterreich/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a> today. </p>



<p>The island nation, like a handful of jurisdictions around the world, has noted plans to develop its local crypto industry into a global hub for digital asset innovation. In June 2022, the policymakers in the country tried to pass a bill on digital assets meant to clarify standards for the industry. Ultimately, the bill lost steam and was binned in 2023.</p>

<p>HSBC became the first bank in the special administrative region in China to allow easy access to Bitcoin and Ether ETF trading. According to Wu, users will be able to trade three ETFs currently listed including CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF.</p>



<p>The giant bank also launched a Virtual Asset Investor Education Centre to sensitize investors on risk and disclosure related to crypto asset investment. </p>

<ul><li>FTX has sued K5 Global to recover the $700 million invested in it by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</li><li>Bankman-Fried transferred vast sums of money from his trading firm to K5 and other related ventures in 2022.&nbsp;</li><li>The investment reportedly allowed the disgraced FTX founder to gain access to politicians and celebrities in the United States.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt crypto exchange has accused Bankman-Fried of investing billions without proper due diligence.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Bahamas-based bankrupt crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-judge-says-hide-customers-identities/">FTX</a> has sued California-based investment firm K5 Global, founded by a former advisor to top U.S. politician Hillary Clinton. The crypto exchange is looking to claw back a whopping $700 million from K5. The amount was transferred to the investment firm by the crypto exchange’s disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried last year. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX’s Bankman-Fried Invested In K5 To Gain Access To Politicians and Celebrities</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-sues-ex-clinton-aides-investment-firm-700-million-2023-06-22/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, FTX sued K5 Global and its co-founder Michael Kives who previously worked for former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The bankrupt crypto exchange’s latest move was part of an effort to recover the $700 million that was transferred by Bankman-Fried to K5 Global and its associates in 2022 as part of an investment. The funds for this investment were reportedly misappropriated from the crypto exchange. </p>



<p>As per the lawsuit filed in Delaware Bankruptcy Court, internal notes from Bankman-Fried revealed that he was captivated by what Kives and his investment firm had to offer. The disgraced founder described it as “something of a one-stop shop for relationships” that he felt should be utilized by his crypto firm. The weeks following these internal notes reportedly saw the former crypto billionaire sign a term to invest billions of dollars in K5.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>K5 was under the impression – like many others – that SBF was completely legitimate and they were entering into a fair, long-term, and mutually beneficial business relationship. Our belief is that the lawsuit is without merit.” </p><cite>K5 Global spokeswoman </cite></blockquote>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s term sheet also included a $125 million payment for Michael Kives and K5 co-founder Bryan Baum. The latest lawsuit also accused Bankman-Fried of failing to conduct sufficient due diligence before extending vast sums of money to K5 and associated ventures. He reportedly made the investments in order to secure access to high profile personalities, including politicians and celebrities. </p>
