The billionaire wants the price of the cryptocurrency to fall further so he can buy some more. Meanwhile, he insulted gold investors, calling them &#8220;dumb as f***.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Mark Cuban Prefers Bitcoin Over Gold</h2>
<p>Shark Tank star and the billionaire owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, shared his thoughts about bitcoin and gold in an episode of the &#8220;Club Random&#8221; podcast, hosted by comedian Bill Maher and scheduled to be aired Monday.</p>
<p>Maher said he is &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bill-maher-mocks-bitcoin-warren-buffett-bill-gates-nassim-taleb/">very anti-bitcoin</a>&#8221; and believes in the value of gold. Commenting on gold investing, the Dallas Mavericks owner <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/12/24/mark-cuban-defends-bitcoin-crypto-slams-gold-investing/">opined</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you have gold, you&#8217;re dumb as f***.</p></blockquote>
<p>The podcast host proceeded to argue that gold &#8220;never goes away&#8221; and is &#8220;like a hedge against everything else.&#8221; Cuban replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>No, but it&#8217;s not a hedge against anything, right? What it is is the stored value and you don&#8217;t own the physical gold, do you? … Gold is a stored value and so is bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;When you own gold, all you own is a digital transaction. You don&#8217;t own the gold bar,&#8221; Cuban detailed, emphasizing that investors do not actually possess the actual gold. &#8220;If everything went to hell in a handbasket and you had a gold bar, you know what would happen? Someone would beat the f*** out of you or kill you and take your gold bar,&#8221; the Shark Tank star warned.</p>
<p>Acknowledging Cuban&#8217;s criticism of gold, Maher clarified, &#8220;We&#8217;re not mostly in gold.&#8221; Cuban responded: &#8220;And that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m not mostly in bitcoin, right? It&#8217;s just something I own.&#8221; The Dallas Mavericks owner stressed: &#8220;But it&#8217;s a digital transaction and it&#8217;s a store of value … So, people perceive that there is a value associated with gold, and there&#8217;s value associated with bitcoin.&#8221;</p>

<p>While stating that bitcoin &#8220;is a good investment,&#8221; Cuban noted that he is &#8220;not telling people to buy&#8221; the cryptocurrency. The Shark Tank star added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cuban believes in cryptocurrency&#8217;s potential despite the crypto winter and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. He previously explained that the FTX fallout <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mark-cuban-says-ftx-implosion-isnt-crypto-blowup-explains-why-he-invests-in-crypto/">is not a failure in crypto</a>. While admitting that he does not know all the details, he said former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) should be worried about <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mark-cuban-if-i-were-sam-bankman-fried-id-be-afraid-of-going-to-jail-for-a-long-time/">going to jail</a> for a very long time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cuban&#8217;s Shark Tank co-star, Kevin O&#8217;Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, has insisted that SBF is one of the best traders in the crypto space and he will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-slammed-for-saying-hed-back-former-ftx-ceo-again-insists-sbf-is-a-brilliant-crypto-trader/">back him again</a> if he has another venture. O&#8217;Leary was a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-reveals-ftx-paid-him-15-million-to-become-a-spokesperson-for-the-exchange/">spokesperson</a> for FTX when the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy.</p>

<h2>Twitter Won&#8217;t Go Bankrupt Anytime Soon, Says Elon Musk</h2>
<p>Tesla CEO and Twitter chief Elon Musk revealed over the weekend that Twitter will not be filing for bankruptcy anytime soon. He said on the All-In podcast Saturday:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve got the expenses reasonably under control, so the company&#8217;s not in the fast lane to bankruptcy anymore.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It has been quite a roller coaster,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It has its highs and lows, to say the least, but overall it seems to be going in a good direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the podcast, Musk tweeted clarifying that Twitter is not secure yet and there is still &#8220;much work to do.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/musks-tweet-about-twitter-bankruptcy.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20221225%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20221225T144546Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Signature=728ee3323cde624eff13971591a95978e58ce63b8bbbafece075365f48fd4741"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-565812 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/musks-tweet-about-twitter-bankruptcy.jpg" alt="" width="919" height="302" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/musks-tweet-about-twitter-bankruptcy-300x99.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/musks-tweet-about-twitter-bankruptcy-768x252.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/musks-tweet-about-twitter-bankruptcy.jpg 919w" sizes="(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px" /></a></p>
<p>The Twitter boss further shared on the podcast: &#8220;My error rate and sort of being the chief twit will be less over time but, in the beginning, we&#8217;ll make a lot more mistakes because I&#8217;m new … Hey, I just got here, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued: &#8220;If you look at the actual amount of improvement that has happened at Twitter in terms of having costs that aren&#8217;t insane and shipping product that, on balance, is good, I think that&#8217;s great — We&#8217;re executing well, and getting things done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The billionaire first warned about the prospect of bankruptcy for Twitter just a few weeks after he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-takes-control-of-twitter-fires-ceo-and-cfo-says-he-buys-twitter-to-help-humanity/">took over</a> the social media platform. Sharing Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-tells-twitter-staff-economic-picture-ahead-is-dire-bankruptcy-isnt-out-of-the-question/">financial troubles</a> in his first email to Twitter employees in November, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The economic picture ahead is dire … Bankruptcy isn’t out of the question.</p></blockquote>
<p>After purchasing Twitter for about $44 billion at the end of October, Musk immediately made some <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-takes-control-of-twitter-fires-ceo-and-cfo-says-he-buys-twitter-to-help-humanity/">drastic changes</a> to the platform as he focused on free speech. Soon the company lost half of its top 100 advertisers which made up a large chunk of Twitter&#8217;s revenue. Musk has been trying to generate income for the social media company ever since, including charging $8 a month for the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-says-twitter-to-charge-8-per-month-for-blue-checkmark-verification-plans-to-reward-content-creators/">Twitter blue checkmark</a> ($11 for iPhone users).</p>
<p>Musk recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-promises-to-step-down-as-head-of-twitter-edward-snowden-throws-his-name-in-the-hat-for-ceo/">promised</a> to step down as head of Twitter. &#8220;I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams,&#8221; he tweeted last week.</p>

<h2>Texas Bitcoin Miners Curtail Computational Power</h2>
<p>After reaching 272 exahash per second (EH/s) on Dec. 24, 2022, the network’s hashrate plunged during the early hours the very next day as it dropped to 170 EH/s. A <a href="https://twitter.com/Dennis_Porter_/status/1606441437603987461?s=20&amp;t=I2kub4QK2tTspSEn2uVNGw">myriad</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1606614927950729217?s=20&amp;t=I2kub4QK2tTspSEn2uVNGw">reports</a> detail that because of the cold weather in Texas, bitcoin miners located in the area have voluntarily shut down operations. Bitcoin supporter Dennis Porter shared a screenshot of a message from the bitcoin mining operation Lancium as the business shut down its Ft. Stockton facility to give more power to the grid.</p>

<p>“Bitcoin miners have once again voluntarily shut off power during an extreme weather event in Texas,” Porter <a href="https://twitter.com/Dennis_Porter_/status/1606441437603987461?s=20&amp;t=I2kub4QK2tTspSEn2uVNGw">tweeted</a>. “Bitcoin miners are good for the grid.” The bitcoin mining operation Core Scientific explained that it too was participating in operational curtailments. “Due to extreme cold weather sweeping across the eastern and southern half of the U.S., we will be participating in multiple power curtailments to help stabilize the electrical grid,” the mining operation <a href="https://twitter.com/Core_Scientific/status/1606325456688422918?s=20&amp;t=50Gea-fDDTsUpvi_Dh150Q">detailed</a>.</p>

<p>Statistics from coinwarz.com indicates that while close to a 100 exahash went offline, the hashrate came back roughly around noon (ET) to around 240 EH/s. In fact, for the first time in a long period of time, Antpool has surpassed Foundry USA’s hashrate. Antpool commands 29.92 % of the global network at press time, as it has roughly 69 EH/s of computational power. Foundry USA has 19.68% of the global hashrate with 45.51 EH/s. Just <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-miners-discovered-53240-blocks-this-year-foundry-led-the-pack-hashrate-tapped-an-all-time-high/">two days ago</a>, Foundry USA had around 70 EH/s and roughly 31% of the global hashrate on Dec. 23.</p>
<p>Reports show that Texas is dealing with <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/winter-weather/texas-avoiding-a-major-power-crisis-as-frigid-conditions-take-hold/1429145">a major cold freeze</a> and Texans do not want to experience icy blackouts like they did in 2021. The entire state will be dealing with subzero realfeel during the course of the holiday weekend. Reports on Friday <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/12/23/ercot-power-winter-weather/">noted</a> that the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid in the state was holding its own but more cold winter tests are on the horizon.</p>

<p>“Please be prepared for some ups and downs this weekend as we deal with the winter storm,” Compass Mining’s director of mining operations Neil Galloway <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinNeil/status/1606318230787657728?s=20&amp;t=CkllmWQHR11yzs2wC3WoAA">tweeted</a>. “Our hosting partners and technicians are working in rough conditions that may slow down progress but we are monitoring things throughout the weekend. This is what bitcoin mining does.” Galloway <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinNeil/status/1606318432298770433?s=20&amp;t=CkllmWQHR11yzs2wC3WoAA">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because your miner is offline, people can heat their homes and cook, hospitals can continue to take care of patients, military bases can continue to monitor our borders and you can be proud to have been a integral part of balancing your grid.</p></blockquote>

Since the Fed started, more than 96% of the greenback&#x2019;s purchasing power has been erased via inflation.</strong></p>
<h2>The Purchasing Power of the U.S. Dollar After the Creation of the Federal Reserve on Dec. 24, 1913 Dwindles Lower</h2>
<p>During the last hundred years, economists have blamed the U.S. Federal Reserve for a great deal of America&#x2019;s rising inflation. American economist and social theorist Thomas Sowell referred to the Fed as a &#x201C;cancer,&#x201D; and former politcians like Ron Paul have called on the masses to abolish the Fed. Prior to the creation of the Fed on Dec. 23, 1913, America had two central banks the preceded the current U.S. central bank.</p>
<p>The first U.S. central bank started in 1791 which was the First Bank of the United States, a financial institution charted by Congress at the time. The second attempt to create a central bank in America was in 1816 with the formation of the Second Bank of the United States. The third central bank is the current financial institution we know of today called the Federal Reserve and it was officially created 109 years ago just before Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>Because of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/money-and-democracy-why-you-never-get-to-vote-on-the-most-important-part-of-society/">the Panic of 1907</a>, Americans at the time were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/american-panic-led-to-the-creation-and-expansion-of-the-corrupt-federal-reserve-system/">convinced</a> that a central bank was needed. A secret set of meetings on Jekyll Island that included America&#x2019;s top financial elites and the so-called &#x2018;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-gold-to-greenbacks-a-look-at-the-us-dollars-devaluation-manipulation-and-militant-backing/">Money Trust</a>&#x2019; crafted the foundations of the Federal Reserve system. The American people were kept in the dark about the meetings between senator Nelson Aldrich and the &#x2018;<a href="https://youtu.be/Te_LmrVys_E">House of Morgan</a>.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-565758 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wilson.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="600" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wilson-300x141.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wilson-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wilson-768x360.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wilson.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The secret Jekyll Island meetings took place on Nov. 20, 1910 and Nov. 30, 1910. The House of Representatives voted on the Federal Reserve Act on December 22, 1913, the U.S. Senate voted on the act the next day, and President Woodrow Wilson <a href="https://youtu.be/RfFcNGikROk">signed</a> the act into law on Christmas Eve. Ever since this point, the greenbacks Americans use that claim to be a &#x2018;promissory note&#x2019; backed by the U.S. Federal Reserve, have lost considerable value.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://mises.org/wire/defining-inflation-correctly">some would say</a> that &#x201C;only if the pace of money expansion surpasses the pace of increase in the production of goods will we have a general increase in prices.&#x201D; However, some individuals would also insist that other types of government interference like irrational spending, sanctions, and regulations can make the price of goods and services rise unnaturally.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/aei/photos/the-value-of-the-us-dollar-has-lost-more-than-96-of-its-purchasing-power-since-t/10156116509838958/">Statistics</a> show that between 1913 to 2017, the U.S. dollar has lost more than 96% of its purchasing power, according to the American Enterprise Institute. 2022 metrics show that $1 in 1913 equates to roughly <a href="https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1913?amount=1">$30.07 in purchasing power</a> today. One report says: &#x201C;The dollar had an average inflation rate of 3.17% per year between 1913 and today, producing a cumulative price increase of 2,907.18%.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/purchasing-power-of-the-u-s-dollar-over-time/">report</a> published by visualcapitalist.com last year explains how you could purchase ten bottles of beer back in 1933 with a single greenback and today, you&#x2019;d be lucky to get a small coffee for that $1. Since 2020, inflation has soared as the U.S. Federal Reserve increased the monetary supply by a considerable amount during the last three years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-565754 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/peeps.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="300" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/peeps-300x70.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/peeps-1024x240.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/peeps-768x180.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/peeps.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Visualcapitalist.com&#x2019;s author Govind Bhutada explained the &#x201C;money supply (M2) in the U.S. has skyrocketed over the last two decades, up from $4.6 trillion in 2000 to $19.5 trillion in 2021.&#x201D; He <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/purchasing-power-of-the-u-s-dollar-over-time/">added</a> that the &#x201C;effects of the rise in money supply were amplified by the financial crisis of 2008 and more recently by the COVID-19 pandemic &#x2014; In fact, around 20% of all U.S. dollars in the money supply, $3.4 trillion, were created in 2020 alone.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Ukraine-Russia war has caused energy prices to jump a lot higher as a great number of Western countries like the United States have imposed sanctions on Russia. The sanctions, in turn, made oil and natural gas prices rise a great deal, because Russia is one of the largest suppliers of fossil fuels in the world. Additionally, U.S. government officials have imposed a great deal of red tape on firms that don&#x2019;t follow along with the so-called climate change reform.</p>
<p>Between the U.S. government&#x2019;s military spending, the Fed&#x2019;s massive monetary M2 increase since 2020, and the sweeping climate change regulations have all contributed to the rising prices across the country. This is the reason why free market advocates like alternatives like precious metals and cryptocurrencies. Precious metals, for instance, are scarce and they cannot be printed on a whim like fiat currencies.</p>

<p>Metals like gold and silver have intrinsic value as well, as they are used widely for things like jewelry, computer parts, and coins. Although, both precious metals and fiat currencies can be cumbersome in physical form, as holding a great deal of gold or stacks of U.S. dollars requires security and secrecy of some sort. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) are also scarce and cannot be printed on a whim like promissory notes either.</p>
<p>Crypto assets like bitcoin are more portable and while they need security and secrecy, the cost to do so is negligible. Both of these types of alternative monies have not eroded in value like fiat currencies all across the world have during the past 100 years. Data clearly shows the U.S. dollar <a href="https://youtu.be/9dldPMOJVEo">cannot be</a> a <a href="https://youtu.be/XNu5ppFZbHo">store of value</a> for a long period of time. Like the economist Friedrich A. Hayek once said, good money cannot exist until it is removed from the state.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can&#x2019;t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can&#x2019;t stop,&#x201D; Hayek said.</p>

<h2>13 Years of Bitcoin Prices in December</h2>
<p>2022 wasn&#x2019;t the greatest year for <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> in terms of market value measured in fiat. At the start of the year, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was trading for roughly $46K per unit and since then, the price has tumbled 63% since the first of Jan. 2022. According to <a href="https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/ronan-manly/dawn-of-bitcoin-price-discovery-2009-2011-the-very-early-bitcoin-exchanges/">records</a>, the first recorded nominal value of bitcoin in U.S. dollars was on Oct. 5, 2009 and it was selling for $0.00764 per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on New Liberty Standard (NLS). At that rate, whoever was buying bitcoins at that time via NLS could get around 1,309.03 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for $1.</p>

<p>We cant really count 2009, as seeing gains during the last month of the year, as recorded prices are sporadic. However, records show on Dec. 17, 2009, one could get around 1,630.33 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for for a single greenback. On Dec. 28, 2009, NLS quotes are around 1,578.76 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for $1. In Dec. 2010, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price was much higher and on the first day of the month, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> exchanged hands for $0.21 per coin. By Dec. 31, 2010, a single bitcoin was 42.85% higher at $0.30 per unit. Bitcoin would also see gains during the last month in 2011, and 2012.</p>

<p>In 2011, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> traded for $2.97 per unit on Dec. 1, and thirty days later <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> exchanged hands for $4.25 or 43.09% higher. On Dec. 1, 2012, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> changed hands for $12.57 per coin and by the end of the year, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was up 7% at $13.45 per unit. During the next two years, despite the bull run in 2013, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> did not see Santa rallies. For instance, on Dec. 1, 2013, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was trading for $955.85 per coin and by Dec 31, it was 21.11% lower at $754.01 per unit.</p>
<p>2014 saw a 15.57% loss as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> traded for $379.25 on Dec. 1, and found itself changing hands for $320.19 by the year&#x2019;s end. The last month of 2015, 2016, and 2017 all saw Santa rallies. In 2015 on Dec. 1, bitcoin was trading for $362.49, but by the year&#x2019;s end it jumped 18.78% higher as it exchanged hands for $430.57 per unit. Similarly, on Dec. 1, 2016, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was trading for $756.77 and by Dec. 31, it was up 27.34% and was swapping for $963.74 per coin.</p>

<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> also saw gains in 2017 when it traded for $10,975.60 per coin on Dec. 1 and then ended the year 28.98% higher at $14,156.40 per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. History shows that three out of the four next Decembers saw negative returns. In 2018, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> swapped for $4,194.39 on Dec. 1, and on Dec. 31, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was trading for $3,740.23 losing 10.82% in USD value. The next year on Dec. 1, 2019, bitcoin was trading for $7,449.52 and by the end of the year, it was down 3.13% and traded for $7,216.10 per unit.</p>
<p>2020 was the best bitcoin Santa rally ever recorded as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> jumped 53% higher during the last month of the year. On Dec. 1, 2020, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> swapped hands for $18,876.77 per coin and by the year&#x2019;s end it was up to $28,994.35. At the end of 2021, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices dropped during the last month, sliding 18.92% in USD value during the course of 30 days.</p>

<p>On Dec. 1, 2021, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was trading for $57,217.66 per unit and by the month&#x2019;s end, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was down to $46,387.98 per coin. Last month, wasn&#x2019;t the greatest for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> as it was up above $20K per unit before FTX collapsed. That specific event sent shockwaves through not only the industry, but it caused crypto markets to drop considerably in fiat value as well.</p>
<p>As of right now on Dec. 25, 2022, it does not seem like a Santa rally is in the cards for bitcoiners but you never know how the year could end. Over the next week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> could jump 10% or more higher and end 2022&#x2019;s dismal bear market with a bang. Or we just might see what we&#x2019;ve seen during the past few weeks, which is a whole lot of lackluster movements, low volumes since the FTX aftermath subsided, and a great deal of consolidation.</p>

<p>Hedge fund manager Michael Burry, famed for forecasting the 2008 financial crisis, says the problem with auditing cryptocurrency exchanges, like Binance and FTX, is the same as when he started using a new kind of credit default swap. “Our auditors were learning on the job,” he described, adding that it’s “not a good thing.”</p>

The new tax rules, incorporated into the $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed by the U.S. Congress in 2021, were to be imposed in 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Brokers Told to Comply With Existing Laws Until Final Regulations Are Issued</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are delaying an obligation for digital asset brokers to start tracking and reporting proceeds from customer transactions. The respective provision was introduced with the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/congress-passes-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-crypto-advocates-criticize-amended-broker-definition-tax-code-6050i/">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a>, which was signed into law in late 2021, and was scheduled to enter into force on Jan. 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the requirement, imposing on the crypto sector the regulations that currently apply to securities brokers, was to increase tax revenues from coin trading by revealing gains from such operations in a 1099 form.</p>

<p>However, additional rules are needed to enforce the legislation, including defining the scope of the term “broker” — <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-infrastructure-bills-attack-on-crypto-industry/">critics</a> have pointed out that it’s currently too wide and covers entities such as miners that may not be able to comply with the regulations.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Treasury and the IRS provided transitional guidance on the matter. The announcement stated that crypto brokers will not be expected to report additional information with respect to dispositions of digital assets until final regulations are adopted and noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brokers are still required to comply with existing laws and regulations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The authorities also emphasized that the guidance applies only to returns filed by brokers while taxpayers still need to report any income received from transactions involving cryptocurrencies. “They are also required to answer the digital asset question on page 1 of either Form 1040PDF or Form 1040-SRPDF,” the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-irs-provide-transitional-guidance-for-broker-reporting-on-digital-assets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notice</a> detailed.</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-delay-for-implementation-of-600-reporting-threshold-for-third-party-payment-platforms-forms-1099-k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> released on Dec. 23, the IRS also said it’s delaying new rules requiring third-party settlement organizations, such as Paypal, Venmo, Cash App, and other digital wallets, to report transactions exceeding $600 until next tax year.</p>
<p>The new minimum threshold, lowered from the previous one of more than 200 transactions per year, was enacted with the American Rescue Plan of 2021. It was initially supposed to apply to transactions that occurred in the calendar year 2022, which is now considered a “transition period.”</p>

A new law passed by the State Duma also prohibits banks from using chats to send personal data and payment documents.</strong></p>
<h2>Bill Restricts Russian Banks and Brokers From Sending Sensitive Information Through Foreign Messengers</h2>
<p>Banks in the Russian Federation will not be allowed to contact their customers on a number of popular messengers, according to new legislation approved by the lower house of parliament. The ban applies to foreign-based platforms.</p>
<p>A list of the affected apps is yet to be published by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/roskomnadzor-media-watchdog-unblocks-leading-russian-crypto-news-outlet/">Roskomnadzor</a>, the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media, but <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/telegram-introduces-no-sim-sign-ups-with-blockchain-powered-numbers/">Telegram</a>, Whatsapp, Viber, and the like fit the description, the business daily Kommersant reported.</p>
<p>The draft law, passed by the State Duma in the third reading, also restricts the use of this type of messaging service for correspondence containing sensitive information like personal data or documents related to payments and money transfers.</p>
<p>The restrictions concern not only banks but all other financial organizations as well, including brokers, companies operating in the securities market, management firms, investment funds, and private pension funds and depositories, the article details.</p>

<h2>Digital Development Ministry to Oversee the Implementation of the New Restrictions</h2>
<p>According to Anatoly Aksakov, head of the parliamentary Financial Market Committee, the Russian Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media will be tasked to oversee the ban, not the Central Bank of Russia in this case. Commenting for Kommersant, he also stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Credit organizations, of course, are very careful about the implementation of the law, and are unlikely to violate it. Therefore, obviously, they will take steps to avoid falling under sanctions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking to the newspaper, members of the industry noted that instant messengers are rarely used to communicate with clients, especially by large players who have developed their own applications featuring built-in support chats.</p>
<p>Others employ third-party solutions, most often secure platforms for communicating with clients, exchanging documents, concluding agreements, uploading data, and reporting to the central bank, explained Tatyana Evdokimova, an investment advisor. “We know what personal data protection is, and we have been complying with certain requirements for a long time,” she emphasized.</p>

<h2>JPMorgan on Institutional Crypto Investing</h2>
<p>JPMorgan Asset Management&#8217;s head of institutional portfolio strategy, Jared Gross, discussed crypto and institutional investors&#8217; interest in the asset class on Bloomberg Friday. The senior investment strategist described:</p>
<blockquote><p>As an asset class, crypto is effectively nonexistent for most large institutional investors … The volatility is too high, the lack of an intrinsic return that you can point to makes it very challenging.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gross added that it is &#8220;self-evident&#8221; that bitcoin has not proven itself to be a form of digital gold or haven asset like some have hoped. He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most institutional investors probably are breathing a sigh of relief that they didn&#8217;t jump into that market and are probably not going to be doing so anytime soon.</p></blockquote>
<p>The crypto market has declined significantly this year as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks around the world raised interest rates to fight inflation. There have also been collapses and bankruptcies within the sector, including the most recent fallout of crypto exchange FTX.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a growing number of banks and financial institutions are offering crypto products and services to their institutional clients. Investment giant <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/financial-giant-state-street-sees-unwaning-crypto-demand-from-institutional-investors/">State Street</a>, for example, said in September that it sees unwaning demand for crypto assets from institutional investors. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nasdaq-establishes-crypto-unit-sees-increased-demand-for-digital-assets-among-institutional-investors/">Nasdaq</a> recently established a crypto unit called &#8220;Nasdaq Digital Assets,&#8221; citing increased demand among institutional investors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a survey released in November by crypto exchange Coinbase showed that institutional investors <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-institutional-investors-increased-allocations-during-crypto-winter-long-term-price-outlook-positive/">increased their allocations</a> during the crypto winter. The firm emphasized that there is &#8220;a strong signal of the acceptance of crypto as an asset class.&#8221; A study published by financial giant Fidelity in October showed that 74% of institutional investors surveyed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-74-of-institutional-investors-surveyed-plan-to-invest-in-digital-assets/">plan to invest in digital assets</a>.</p>

He called investors who own various altcoins idiots and urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to do &#8220;a big sweep&#8221; on the crypto industry.</strong></p>
<h2>Jim Cramer&#8217;s Crypto Warnings</h2>
<p>The host of CNBC&#8217;s Mad Money show, Jim Cramer, has issued more warnings about cryptocurrency. Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who co-founded Thestreet.com, a financial news and literacy website. He said on CNBC Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would not touch crypto in a million years because I wouldn&#8217;t trust the deposit bank.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was then asked whether he is making a distinction between centralized and decentralized platforms. &#8220;They fought regulation. They didn&#8217;t want regulation and you don&#8217;t have regulation,” Cramer replied, indicating that he does not trust any platforms that do not want regulation.</p>
<p>The Mad Money host continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m just saying you are using a lot of blind faith, and I like to have my money at JPMorgan, and I check on Monday to see whether my balance is there. It feels good.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Try getting your money out,” he advised crypto investors, adding that when he had money at a crypto firm: &#8220;It was a fight to get the money out — a fight!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cramer opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that everybody who owns these various coins — you know, solana, litecoin — I do think you are an idiot, okay. I did not go to college to get stupid. These people who own these things should not own them. They shouldn&#8217;t own them.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Jim Cramer Calls on SEC to Do a Big Crypto Sweep</h2>
<p>Cramer also commented on the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, stating that existing securities laws are adequate for the regulation of the crypto industry. He wants the SEC to &#8220;come on and enforce&#8221; crypto firms.</p>
<p>The Mad Money host added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think they need to do a big sweep. They have to stop people creating money.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the creation of money by cretins. I don&#8217;t think cretins should create money and then suck people in. These are worse than even the worst Nasdaq stocks,&#8221; Cramer concluded.</p>
<p>The Mad Money host <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-money-jim-cramer-buys-bitcoin-strategy-to-increase-holdings/" target="_self" rel="noopener">used to invest</a> in bitcoin, ether, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jim-cramer-dumps-bitcoin-china-mining-crackdown-ransomware/" target="_self" rel="noopener">sold</a> all his crypto holdings last year. Cramer has been advising investors to avoid <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-moneys-jim-cramer-recommends-avoiding-crypto-other-speculative-investments/" target="_self" rel="noopener">investing in speculative assets</a>, including crypto, while the Federal Reserve continues to tighten the economy. Earlier this month, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-moneys-jim-cramer-advises-investors-to-get-out-of-crypto-says-its-never-too-late-to-sell/">advised</a> investors to get out of crypto, emphasizing that it is never too late to exit &#8220;an awful position.&#8221;</p>
