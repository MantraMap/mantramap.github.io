<p>Zug, Switzerland, August 4th, 2023, Chainwire</p>D8X's pre-seed round features Polygon Ventures, Axelar Network, Swissborg Ventures and others&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;D8X, an institutional-grade decentralized exchange (DEX) for derivatives on Polygon zkEVM, announced a $1.5 million pre-seed round with support from Polygon Ventures and other notable investors. The capital will help D8X launch a decentralized derivatives trading platform in the second half of 2023 that provides a white-labeling solution to trading partners seeking access to powerful derivatives products.&nbsp;</p><p>The pre-seed round for D8X includes additional participation from Axelar Network, Swissborg Ventures, Cogitent Ventures, Veris Ventures, G1 Ventures, Pragma Ventures, CryptoDiscover and others.</p>&ldquo;DeFi is reshaping the future of finance. Projects like D8X are building the infrastructure that will help legacy finance to leap into web3,&rdquo; said Polygon Co-Founder Sandeep Nailwal.<p>Bridging CeFi to DeFi</p><p>D8X's founders bet on centralized players wanting to offer decentralized crypto derivatives to their clients without having to hire experts to develop in-house market-making and trading engines. D8X provides a white-label solution to partners who act as brokers and earn fees by running their own front ends powered by the D8X trade engine and shared liquidity.</p><p>Financial Engineering On Chain</p><p>D8X&rsquo;s sophisticated on-chain solutions curb costs and offer products that are competitive with centralized exchanges, such as cost-efficient hedging, a prerequisite for building a highly functional derivative trading space. Contract trading allows other DeFi protocols to efficiently hedge on-chain. Their perpetuals can be calibrated for a wide range of assets and support&mdash;as a first in DeFi&mdash;linear, inverse and quanto perpetuals. At launch, a liquidity pool in Lido's staked ETH (stETH) will enable liquidity providers to earn the Lido yield while simultaneously participating in the DEX&rsquo;s earnings.&nbsp;</p><p>D8X is the first business-to-business (B2B) DEX built on Polygon&rsquo;s zkEVM, harnessing the power of zero-knowledge proofs to cut transaction fees, increase security and scale operations across the Polygon and Ethereum networks.&nbsp;</p>&ldquo;D8X is part of a driving force of innovation and community in Polygon&rsquo;s 2.0 zero-knowledge space,&rdquo; said Polygon Director of Growth Hamzah Khan.<p>D8X is a fully decentralized DEX following regulatory guidance from Switzerland&rsquo;s financial market regulator FINMA.&nbsp;</p>&ldquo;We thank all our investors for believing in D8X's vision to bring truly decentralized derivatives as white-labeling solutions to institutions. With best-in-class financial engineering and risk management, D8X is changing the way decentralized derivatives are traded,&rdquo; said D8X co-founder Caspar Sauter.<p>The production codebase of D8X was audited by PeckShield and an earlier version was audited by Hacken.&nbsp;</p><p>About D8X</p><p>D8X is a Polygon Ventures-supported institutional-grade perpetual futures DEX with a financial engineering approach that elevates the way perpetual futures can be traded on-chain. Think of a powerful and decentralized trading platform on Polygon zkEVM that offers white-labeling to institutions. D8X&rsquo;s pricing mechanism adapts to changing market conditions protecting liquidity providers and profitable traders in volatile periods, resulting in superior DeFi trading conditions.</p><p>D8X | Twitter | GitHub | Docs</p>ContactPR DirectorPatrick BrendelScrib3patrick@scrib3.co
