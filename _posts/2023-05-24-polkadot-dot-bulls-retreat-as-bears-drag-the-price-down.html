Polkadot (DOT) is in the red today as the bears seek to regain control over its price. DOT traded at $4.37 on January 1, 2023, and increased to $5.13 on January 11.   It remained within this range before moving to $6.23 on January 20. Also, DOT increased to the $7 price level on February 17 as the bulls seized control of its price. However, a gradual bearish turn between March and April forced it back to $5, where it currently trades today.  Polkadot Price Prediction Today Are The Bears In Control? DOT is trading in a sideways trend forming a red candle on the daily chart. It is below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), with bearish sentiment in the short and long term.

If the bears persist, DOT&#8217;s 50-day SMA, which is about to drop below its 200-day SMA, will form a death cross. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 40.73 and in the neutral zone. The RSI is a trend-based indicator. DOT&#8217;s RSI is moving downwards, hinting at further price decline to the oversold region before a trend reversal.  The cryptocurrency&#8217;s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is slightly above its signal line and shows convergence.  Also, the MACD &#8211; a trend momentum indicator that displays the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) and an asset&#8217;s price, displays a negative value conforming to the bearish trend today. The green histogram bars are fading, indicating a changing trend direction.  DOT&#8217;s technical indicators all hint at the possibility of further price decline for the asset. It is close to the $5.29 support level as the bears at the $5.42 resistance continue to act on its price, forcing a decline. DOT has remained in a sideways trend for the last few days and further price decline remains a possibility. However, if the bulls rally again, the $5.42 resistance level will be a realistic target before the $6 psychological resistance level.   The altcoin will likely enter a downtrend if the bears maintain the pressure today. But one thing that offers the possibility of a bullish reversal is the upcoming &#8216;Polkadot Decoded 2023&#8217; event in June.  Polkadot Decoded 2023 Might Boost DOT’s Performance Polkadot is hosting a community event, &#8216;Polkadot Decoded 2023&#8217;, between June 28-29 in Copenhagen, Denmark. This event will assemble the Polkadot community in progressive talks anchored by over 100 quality speakers in the crypto community.
