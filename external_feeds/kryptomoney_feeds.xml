<ul>
<li>Ethereum (ETH) surged on Saturday, climbing to its highest mark in last four months</li>
<li>At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,627</li>
<li>A total of 2.8 million ETH, or around $4.6 billion at the current exchange rate, have been taken out of circulation since the implementation of EIP-1559</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-sees-another-bull-favoring-element-as-on-chain-analytics-indicate-increased-blockchain-activity/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> surged on Saturday, climbing to its highest mark in the last four months. ETH/USD hit a high of $1,680 earlier before a slight retreat. At the time of writing, ETH was up 0.20% at $1,627. The EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) 1559 protocol has been actively burning ETH at a tremendous rate since it was first introduced in August 2021. According to EIP-1559, a percentage of every NFT deal, yield scheme, and even straightforward token transfer is destroyed. All of it is being burned. A total of 2.8 million ETH, or around $4.6 billion at the current exchange rate, have been taken out of circulation since the implementation of EIP-1559. According to Ultrasound Money, the Ethereum protocol has destroyed more than 16,364 ETH in the past seven days at an estimated pace of 1.62 ETH per minute. Due to the burn mechanism, more ETH is being burned than is being issued to miners. Since EIP 1559, supply growth has now decreased to -1.06% annually. As a result, Ethereum becomes more deflationary than Bitcoin.<br /><br /><strong>Key levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $2,300, $2,000, $1,700<br />Support Levels: $1,500, $1,300, $1,000</p>
<h4>ETH/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>

Ethereum (ETH) price action closed slightly flat after mild drops over the end of the prior week, which might culminate in a Doji close on Sunday. Despite showing hesitation, the Doji pattern may portend a positive reversal in the coming sessions. <br /><br />However, for the time being, trader sentiment is divided. With a solid bullish close over $1,650, ETH might rise above $1,700 to the resistance level of $2,000. This may pave the way for ETH/USD to return to the $3,000 region. Alternatively, if the ETH price falls from current levels, it is expected to revert toward moving averages (MA 50 and MA 200) around $1,450 and $1,350.</p>
<h4>ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bullish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-64079 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-22.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-22-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-22-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-22-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-22-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-22-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>ETH/USD has been consolidating in recent days, with the drop to $1,603 creating a base for the lows. Ethereum price rose over the $1,600 support level. The bullish picture remains intact, as evidenced by the RSI and the SMAs&#8217; upside turn. Their upward inclination may also imply that the current course will last a little longer. If buyers can break over the $1,700 resistance level, the $2,000 level could be the next objective.<br /><br />A decrease, on the other hand, might be halted merely by the moving averages of 50 and 200, which are around $1,580 and $1,350, respectively. To summarize, ETH&#8217;s newfound bullish surge may continue if the price closes above the $1,700 level. However, short-term profit-taking may occur to calm the RSI, making corrective drops more likely.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-btc-quells-downside-move-indicators-and-market-participants-have-this-to-say/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> is leading the weekly gains among the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market cap as its price soared 11.2%. Bitcoin rose as high as $23,375 on Saturday, per Trading View data, and at a current price of $22,983, it has increased nearly 5% over the past 24 hours. The last time that Bitcoin rose near current levels was in August 2022, well before November’s implosion of crypto exchange FTX sent the price of the biggest cryptocurrency in market valuation down below the $16,000 mark. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has risen as the large &#8220;whale tier&#8221; group of addresses holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC has accumulated 64,638 BTC worth $1.46 billion in the last 15 days, according to Onchain analytics firm Santiment. In a related development, crypto exchange Binance saw the biggest amount of hourly inflows since the FTX collapse on January 20. About 6800 BTC entered the exchange yesterday, followed by withdrawals of approximately 5000 BTC.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $30,000, $27,000, $25,000<br />Support Levels: $21,500, $18,500, $16,500</p>

<p>BTC gained ground after an early rebound from its January 18 low of $20,370. Although bullish continuation requires confirmation and a downside correction cannot be ruled out, the RSI is fixed northwards over 80 may indicate that buying forces continue to dominate in the near term. However, traders are expecting sideways action in the coming trading sessions as they wait for a full breakout.<br /><br />A continuation of the price rise for Bitcoin (BTC) could finally reach and test the resistance of $25,000 ahead of the $27,000 level. The psychological zone of $30,000 may be another hurdle for the bulls. Alternatively, a price decrease would test the daily moving average (MA 200) near $20,000 before returning to the current range&#8217;s floor of $22,000.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-btc-usd-trying-to-extend-consolidation-after-weeks-recovery-attempt/">BTC/USD</a> is consolidating just near the $23,000 mark, establishing a base for next move higher. Bulls had provided the impetus in prior sessions, rising far above the 4-hour MA 50 ($21,500) and on to the $23,000 mark. The MA 50 and 200 have turned upside and show positive momentum, while the RSI, which is now in the bullish zone, is in overbought territory.<br /><br />The BTC/USD pair may find immediate resistance near the $25,000 horizontal barrier. The pairs&#8217; climb higher may cause the price to retest the $30,000 level in the near term, and if that level is breached, traders may see a run-up into known bullish territory, with $40,000 as a potential goal. Alternatively, a push below the moving averages could cause the BTC price to fall.</p>

At the time of writing, THETA was up 12% in the last 24 hours and up 11.72% since the past week as optimism rises for the bulls&#8217; comeback in 2023. Theta Labs has announced the alpha release of Theta EdgeStore, a crucial part of its 2023 roadmap, building on the release of the EdgeStore demo and Theta Video API Edge Ingestors. Theta EdgeStore, a new component of the Theta Edge Node software, is run by tens of thousands of users around the globe and acts as an append-only, content-addressing, decentralized key/value storage network for the permanent web. While Theta Edge Nodes already support decentralized streaming and encoding or transcoding, with the addition of decentralized storage, the Edge Node hopes to offer a complete end-to-end decentralized service for video streaming, as well as any other type of file transfer or streaming.

<p>Following the crypto market rebound, THETA has made a robust comeback, with price action at the end of the week extending the strong rebound. The gains lifted the THETA/USD above the psychological level of $1.0. The current rebound is supported by near-term oscillators, with the RSI moving into overbought territory. If the rally continues, today&#8217;s high of $1.1031 around the MA 200 could serve as immediate resistance.<br /><br />Only a significant breakout above this resistance could rekindle the bullish bias beyond the $1.50 zone. The closing gap between the MAs will be closely monitored in the following sessions. Support levels are at the daily moving average (MA 50) at $0.85, which remains vulnerable to bearish pressure. If these levels are closely violated, there is a chance that the slide will be more severe and reach as low as $0.50.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/theta-price-analysis-consolidation-targets-breakout-on-theta-usd-ahead-of-june-30-mainnet-3-0-launch/">THETA price</a> surged at the close of the week on Saturday, January 21, towards the $1.1031 area, after briefly consolidating below $1.000 to find support close to the $0.9800 low, from which it later recovered. Since then, THETA has bounced back to trade above the $1.0 level.<br /><br />A breakout to the upside above the $1.1500 high would pave the way for the round figures of $2.0 achieved in May. On the other hand, a new wave of losses could stall close to the $1.00 psychological level before the MA 50. After the latest low at $0.9826, a bearish break may seek scope for a test of the MA 50.</p>

<p>This weekend&#8217;s crypto market rebound got another jolt on Saturday as Bitcoin (BTC) blasted off to highs last seen in August 2022, with altcoins such as Aptos, Optimism, and Decentraland’s MANA also posting sizable gains.<br /><br />Bitcoin rose as high as $23,375 on Saturday, per Trading View data, and at a current price of $22,948, it has increased nearly 9% over the past 24 hours. The last time that Bitcoin rose near current levels was in August 2022, well before November’s implosion of crypto exchange FTX sent the price of the biggest cryptocurrency in market valuation down below the $16,000 mark.<br /><br />Saturday’s continued rally pushes Bitcoin’s seven-day gains to 20%, with a 34% jump recorded over the last 30 days. Bitcoin is nearly 68% below its all-time high price of over $69,000 reached in November 2021, but the recent gains show a recovery in the crypto market after a bearish 2022.<br /><br />Overall, the cryptocurrency market valuation has seen a 6.76% growth over the past 24 hours, with cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL, 18.40%), Tezos (XTZ, 13.04%), Ravencoin (RVN, 10.01%), and a handful of other altcoins posting significant gains.<br /><br />Aptos (APT) however, is skyrocketing compared to most of the rest of the crypto market on Saturday as it is up a whopping 60% to trade at $12.52 at press time.</p>
<h2>JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon Calls Bitcoin “A Hyped-Up Fraud</h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon calls bitcoin “a hyped-up fraud.” The executive queried the cryptocurrency’s fixed supply cap, saying that he was expecting an image of bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto to pop up and laugh when bitcoin’s supply hits 21 million coins.<br /><br />The CEO of global investment bank JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, who has always been vocal in his criticism of bitcoin cryptocurrency and not the blockchain reiterated his skepticism about bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Thursday by saying ‘’Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud. It’s a pet rock’’.<br /><br />While he is positive about blockchain technology, the JPMorgan boss casts a negative light on cryptocurrencies: “Crypto itself doesn’t do anything. It’s a pet rock.” He then told the news outlet: “I don’t care about bitcoin so we should drop this subject.” He said.</p>

<p>According to reports, the S<a href="https://stellar.org/blog/representing-blockchain-on-the-commodity-futures-trading-commissions-global-market-advisory-committee">tellar Development Foundation</a> will join a new advisory council for the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In the new entity, the SDF will be in charge of blockchain and digital assets, advising the CFTC on these concerns.<br /><br />Along with Stellar representatives, officials from the Chamber of Digital Commerce, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/us-sec-opens-investigation-into-decentralized-crypto-exchange-developer-uniswap-labs/">Uniswap Labs,</a> and CoinFund will be on the side of the new digital economy. However, Stellar will be solely responsible for the blockchain&#8217;s direction.<br /><br />J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock have also joined the Global Market Advisory Committee, indicating Stellar&#8217;s optimism for beneficial collaboration with traditional financial market representatives. Stellar (XLM), as a decentralized cross-border money transfer provider in particular, wishes to give special attention to the issue of remittances and stablecoins. <br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ripple-rival-stellar-releases-impressive-annual-results/">SDF</a> intends to bring up the topic of stablecoins on the digital asset market and their uses in real life, including humanitarian relief, as part of their Stellar Aid Assist initiative on this occasion.<br /><br />Ironically, the event seems almost the exact opposite of what is going on in the other corner between Ripple and the SEC. It turns out that while Stellar, together with the traditional finance giants, oversees crypto policy under the wing of the CFTC, Ripple continues to fight the SEC in court. We have two competing companies, two competing regulators, and two opposing situations.</p>

<p>The SEC charged <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/nexo-crypto-lending-platform-adds-bitcoin-cash-support/">Nexo</a> on Thursday with failing to register its Earn Interest Product retail crypto asset lending product. Nexo agreed to pay a $45 million penalty to satisfy the charges brought against the company. Nexo has agreed to pay the SEC $22.5 million in fines, as well as state authorities $22.5 million in fines. <br /><br />Nexo faced regulatory scrutiny for its EIP in September 2022 from eight states in the United States, including California, Kentucky, New York, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Washington, and Vermont. State officials said that Nexo sold its products without registering them as securities and without properly disclosing them to customers.<br /><br />According to the SEC, Nexo began providing its EIP in June 2020, allowing US investors to surrender their crypto holdings in exchange for a promise of interest. After the SEC filed similar accusations against another company in February 2022, Nexo discontinued marketing its product to new investors. According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-11">press release</a> issued by the SEC:<br /><br />According to the SEC’s order, in or around June 2020, Nexo began to offer and sell the EIP in the United States. The EIP allowed U.S. investors to tender their crypto assets to Nexo in exchange for Nexo’s promise to pay interest.<br /><br />The order states that Nexo marketed the EIP as a means for investors to earn interest on their crypto assets, and Nexo exercised its discretion to use investors’ crypto assets in various ways to generate income for its own business and to fund interest payments to EIP investors. The order finds that the EIP is a security and that the offer and sale of the EIP did not qualify for an exemption from SEC registration. Therefore, Nexo was required to register its offer and sale of the EIP, which it failed to do.<br /><br />Despite the SEC and state regulators&#8217; claims, Nexo is also the focus of a large-scale investigation in Bulgaria for suspicions of money laundering, computer fraud, tax evasion, and other offenses. Over 300 police officers searched the company&#8217;s offices in Bulgaria.<br /><br />Nexo also sued the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) for denying its application to become a virtual asset service provider (VASP) in the jurisdiction. Nexo&#8217;s plan to sue CIMA comes after the regulator denied the lender&#8217;s registration as a VASP due to regulatory and enforcement concerns. <br /><br />According to CIMA, <em>&#8220;Nexo posed a risk to market confidence, consumer protection and the reputation of the Islands as a financial centre.&#8221;</em> Nexo is requesting that CIMA&#8217;s judgment be reversed and that the lender be granted VASP registration.</p>

<p>After falling the previous day, Bitcoin rose once more to a comfortable level substantially above $21,000. The action caused bitcoin to rise to intraday highs of $22,456, which was last reached in September 2022.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-soars-to-new-heights-with-10-increase-as-miners-return/">lead cryptocurrency</a> was recently trading at over $22,276, up 5.76% over the previous 24 hours, as investors ignored the most recent consequences of the disgraced crypto exchange FTX and conflicting economic statistics. BTC kept following the more optimistic course throughout 2023.<br /><br />The Crypto market is showing a decoupling from equities. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1% this week, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) also fell by more than a percentage point. Equities markets also continued to lose ground this week.<br /><br />Investors struggled to square declines in housing starts and building permits with the publication of jobs data showing that the strong job market had not cooled, which showed a 15,000 weekly fall in Americans applying for unemployment. <br /><br />The former suggested that the economy is not cooling sufficiently to appease central bankers, which is bad news for cryptocurrency, while the latter implied the opposite.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/hbar-price-analysis-what-to-watch-in-hbar-as-it-ticks-higher-hedera-set-to-launch-its-first-defi-project/">Hedera (HBAR)</a> is up 33% in the last 24 hours at $0.076 and up 51% in the last seven days. Hedera has been named the winner of The Innovation Awards in the category “Innovation in DLT, Blockchain, and Crypto” per a Dmagazine report. <br /><br />Avery Dennison, one of the most important material sciences companies in the world, confirmed Hedera’s attendance at the World Economic Forum this year. The same company is currently one of Hedera’s partners, which means the network is already attracting partners that are aligned with the WEF’s efficiency and sustainability plans.<br /><br />Over the past seven days, the Hedera network has set new milestones, processing more than 323 million transactions, averaging 535 TPS. It also reached a new throughput ATH of 8,061 TPS while Achieving transaction finality in 3.56 seconds (avg).</p>
<h2>Here Is What Analysts Say About the Bullish Scenario</h2>
<p>The resilience of bitcoin in the wake of the Genesis bankruptcy news didn&#8217;t come as a surprise to traders. The GBTC discount immediately widened again as the market seems to have been anticipating the Genesis bankruptcy filing for the previous 48 hours. <br /><br /><em>&#8221;Genesis declaring bankruptcy removes a cloud of doom from the market, allowing cryptocurrency investors to concentrate on the fundamentals,&#8221;</em> Markus Thielen, head of strategy and research at cryptocurrency services provider Matrixport stated.<br /><br /><em>&#8220;In 2023, there is a good chance for a breakthrough that might start a new bull market. The development of layer 2 solutions, ZK-rollups, privacy solutions, and many other emerging cryptographic capabilities excite us,&#8221;</em> Bitwise&#8217;s analysts under the direction of Chief Investment Officer Matthew Hougan noted.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/verasitys-vra-token-increases-300-because-of-its-product-and-sales-strategy/">Verasity (VRA)</a> has rallied over 65% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, VRA was trading at $0.0071 at press time and is up 150% since the past week. <br /><br />Founded on May 18, 2018, Verasity (VRA) is the next generation of video-sharing aimed at creating a fair system for creators to earn from their work and for advertisers to gain value for their ad spend.<br /><br />Since the start of 2023, Verasity has steadily climbed higher. The rally picked up the pace on January 10 when a base was formed at $0.002. Since then, VRA has marked 10 days out of 11 in green. Specifically, it has marked five consecutive days in green since January 16.<br /><br />Today’s rise to intraday highs of $0.0077 was the biggest daily gain since then. Verasity’s rally seemed to be buoyed by technical factors as it saw a breakout above key barriers. The rally might have also been buoyed by the fact that Verasity as a project built on its successes in the previous year. <br /><br />Verasity announced it has an exciting and jam-packed roadmap for 2023 that it will soon release. In 2022, Verasity inked a partnership with Nasdaq-listed marketplace Brightcove; a major video technology provider to some 3,000 publishers and over 30,000 web publishers worldwide.</p>
<p>Verasity’s Proof of View patent also passed the examination by the Chinese Patent Office, securing PoV’s intellectual property rights in the world’s second-largest—and fastest-growing—advertising market.<br /><br />The VRA staking program was also extended through 2023, locking in VRA staking at 18.25% through to April 2023, when the next phase of staking would be announced.<br /><br />In October 2022 VeraViews became an Amazon Ads Partner, officially joining the Amazon Ads Partner Program.<br /><br />Having passed Amazon verification, VeraViews is listed as a tool provider in the Amazon Ads Partner Directory, offering video measurement, brand safety, advertising effectiveness, and reporting and analytics tools. Amazon Ads Partner status is based on merit and independent review following application, and cannot be paid for. Commercial success for VeraViews is now the key focus for 2023.</p>
<h2>Five On-Chain Indicators Signal Early Bull Market Cycle Might Be Near</h2>
<p>On-chain analytics provider, Cryptoquant has provided an analysis of five on-chain indicators that signal an early bull market.</p>
<p>First are the flows between spot and derivative exchanges. Bitcoin movements from spot to derivative exchanges exhibit that investors have entered &#8220;risk-on&#8221; mode, signaling the beginning of a new bull cycle.</p>
<p>Second, the MVRV ratio is above 1 (1.07), close to its 365-day moving average (orange line), showing that bitcoin is about to start a new uptrend.<br /><br />Third, is the NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) metric, which is the average profit margin of bitcoin holders. Like the MVRV ratio, the NUPL is close to its 365-day moving average (orange line), which could mean that bitcoin is about to start a new uptrend.<br /><br />Fourth, Puell Multiple is showing a shift to a positive trend because bitcoin&#8217;s price has passed its 365-day moving average to the upside for the first time in a significant way since November 2020. CryptoQuant&#8217;s P&amp;L Index combines the MVRV ratio, NUPL, and LTH/STH SOPR into a single <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/something-is-brewing-on-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth-this-is-what-key-and-on-chain-indicators-are-insinuating/">bitcoin</a> value indicator.<br /><br />The PnL Index is close to giving a buying signal for BTC, which happens when the index (dark purple line) crosses its 365-day moving average (light purple line).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What altcoins to buy in a new year? We are ready to present you a small guide to the altcoin world and a brief overview of the best altcoins to invest in.</p>
<h2>What Is Altcoin?</h2>
<p>Before you buy altcoins, let’s find out what the word itself means.</p>
<p>&#8220;Altcoin&#8221; is a combination of the two words &#8220;alternative&#8221; and &#8220;coin.&#8221; Altcoins are all the cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Some investors even point out that altcoins may be those coins that are not Ethereum as well because most cryptocurrencies are usually forked from either Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>
<p>Usually altcoins try to distinguish themselves from these two by using other consensus mechanisms and opening new blocks. Developers do it as they have different visions on crypto and its utility. Many altcoins are developed to compete with Bitcoin as means of payment.</p>
<p>By the way, get an <a href="https://cryptomus.com/blog/post/cryptocurrency-merchant-account-solutions-international-business-merchant-account">international merchant service</a> to accept payments in altcoins.</p>
<h2>Types Of Altcoins</h2>
<p>Here is a brief description of every altcoin type:</p>
<h3>Payment Token</h3>
<p>These altcoins are designed to be used as currency. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/whats-happening-with-bitcoin-ethereum-classic-shiba-inu-and-bitcoin-cash/">Bitcoin Cash</a> is an example of such coins.</p>
<h3>Stablecoins</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are volatile and the only way to use crypto without the fear of price change is to use stablecoins. The volatility is reduced by pegging the price of the crypto to other assets, such as physical currencies and values, such as fiat, precious metals, or even other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Tether&#8217;s <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tether-usdt-to-be-offered-in-24000-brazilian-atms/">USDT</a> is the most notable stablecoin out there. It is pegged to the USD and is widely used to save crypto assets from volatility.</p>
<h3>Security Tokens</h3>
<p>These assets are tokenized stock market securities. The process of tokenization is a transfer of value from an asset to a token. Anything can be tokenized – from stocks to real estate. Although, the asset tokenized must be secured and held, as it adds value to the token.</p>
<h3>Utility Tokens</h3>
<p>Utility tokens are used to provide services within a network. Use them to pay network fees, purchase services, or redeem rewards. The tokens can be purchased on exchanges and held, but they are meant to be used in the blockchain network to keep it functioning.</p>
<h3>Meme Coins</h3>
<p>Meme coins are inspired by jokes or a silly take on other cryptocurrencies. They usually get hyped on the internet and gain a short period of popularity. This allows the investors to obtain short-term gains.</p>
<h3>Governance Tokens</h3>
<p>The rights for voting for changing a protocol or having a say in decisions are what is allowed for the holders of governance tokens. They are not the same as utility tokens as they are native to a private blockchain and are used for blockchain purposes.</p>
<h2>What New Altcoins to Buy in 2023?</h2>
<p>Which new altcoins are worth buying this year? Here is a list of new good altcoins with potential for growth:</p>
<p>Tamadoge (TAMA): It is a memecoin that has its own purpose. Tamadoge is a part of a Play-to-Earn crypto NFT platform that allows users to mint, train and take care of their virtual puppies.</p>
<p>Battle Infinity (IBAT): Another P2E gaming ecosystem that exists in NFT, DeFi, and Metaverse forms. The IBAT is a native altcoin that covers all needs of users.</p>
<p>Lucky Block (LBLOCK): The biggest altcoin to reach $1 billion market cap value.</p>
<p>Enecuum (ENQ): It works on a unique protocol that unites all mobile devices in a single network offering vast reserves of computing power to its users.</p>
<h2>The Best Altcoins To Invest In</h2>
<p>We compiled a list of the best altcoins for you:</p>
<h3>Ether (ETH)</h3>
<p>Ethereum is the second largest coin after Bitcoin and the biggest altcoin. The digital asset has all the potential to become even bigger.</p>
<p>It is an open-sourced and distributed computing network. Being a favorite of program developers because of its potential applications: non-fungible tokens (NFTs), smart contracts hosting and dApps creation.</p>
<h3>Litecoin (LTC)</h3>
<p>One of the oldest altcoins. It’s just a peer-to-peer digital asset. The uniqueness of it is in Litecoin’s fully decentralized nature. The coin aims to overcome Bitcoin by its fast confirmation speed.</p>
<h3>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h3>
<p>Dogecoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies to buy this year. The open-sourced digital currency works on a Proof-of-work consensus. It is an original meme coin that started as a joke in 2013. The token became popular because of the social media backing led by Elon Musk. Gaining a huge amount of attention, Doge soon became a prominent cryptocurrency.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</h3>
<p>Bitcoin Cash is a faster and cheaper fork of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is regarded as a store of value like gold, Bitcoin Cash is treated as a payment provider.</p>
<h3>Tether (USDT)</h3>
<p>Tether is not like the other cryptocurrencies in the list. It is a stablecoin, which means that the asset is backed up by fiat currencies and keeps a value equal to the currency it is pegged to. Tether value is supposed to be more stable than the value of other currencies. Investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins prefer it to other coins.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hedera is up 5.07% in the last 24 hours at $0.059</li>
<li>Hedera has been named winner of The Innovation Awards, in the category <em>&#8220;Innovation in DLT, Blockchain, and Crypto&#8221;</em></li>
<li>The hedera community is rocking so hard at World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos 2023</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-influencer-reveals-why-he-moved-from-solana-to-hedera-hbar-internet-computericp-and-algorand/">Hedera (HBAR)</a> is up 5.07% in the last 24 hours at $0.059 and up 21.11% in the last seven days. Hedera has been named the winner of The Innovation Awards in the categor<em>y &#8220;Innovation in DLT, Blockchain, and Crypto&#8221;</em> per a Dmagazine report. Avery Dennison, one of the most important material sciences companies in the world, confirmed Hedera’s attendance at the World Economic Forum this year. The same company is currently one of Hedera’s partners, which means the network is already attracting partners that are aligned with the WEF’s efficiency and sustainability plans. The Hedera community is rocking so hard at World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos 2023. Hedera says it ranks the 12th highest by influence on Twitter. As stated in a blog post, smart contracts will pay rent on Hedera starting in February 2023. As defined, <em>&#8220;rent&#8221;</em> is the recurring payment required for contracts to remain active on the network and is comprised of auto-renewal and storage fees. Smart contracts on Hedera can pay for rent in two ways: with external funds or contract funds.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.0850, $0.0750, $0.0600<br />Support Levels: $0.0550, $0.0450, $0.0350</p>
<h4>HBAR/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-64034 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-19.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-19.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-19-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-19-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-19-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-19-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-Daily-Jan-19-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">HBAR/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>A price break of the moving average (MA 200) on the daily chart indicates a mild price breakout region. Near-term range trading is likely to continue as the 36th-largest cryptocurrency battles to stay above the $0.0500 region, which serves as a critical zone. Because of a surge in positive bias, positive momentum is increasing while negative momentum is declining.<br /><br />Hedera has regained some of its losses after plunging to the $0.0355 level. Buyers may come through around the $0.0600 handle in an attempt to strengthen the positive bounce after recovering from the loss. The Relative Strength Index, which indicates a surge in upward momentum, contributes to the bullish traction from the yearly low of $0.0355.</p>
<h4>HBAR/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bullish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-64035 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-19.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-19.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-19-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-19-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-19-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-19-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Jan-19-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">HBAR/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p><br />According to the short-term oscillators, bulls are currently backing additional gains in the pair toward the $0.0600 level. Bears, on the other hand, may sell on rallies that fall below the 4-hour moving average (MA 50) at $0.0522. If investors keep the surge going above this mark, the $0.0700 barrier could represent the first point of resistance on the upside.<br /><br />If favorable forces start to weaken, preliminary support might be at $0.0550. If the bearish trend persists, the price may target the short-term MA 200 at about $0.0440. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/hbar-price-analysis-hedera-crosses-the-2-5-billion-transaction-mark-in-a-major-milestone-what-happens-to-price/">HBAR/USD</a> is showing an upward tendency, and bulls must push the price above the $0.0600 level to oppose bears.</p>
