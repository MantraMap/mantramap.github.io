<p>The charity event is seeking to collect funds to benefit victims of the nervous system disease ALS, which the late Hal Finney himself was afflicted by.&nbsp;</p>
Charity Event Invites BTC Donations
<p>Hal Finney was one of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, in 2009. He succumbed to the ravages of the disease and passed away from complications in 2014. On Tuesday, his widow Fran Finney took to her late husband&rsquo;s Twitter handle to announce the charity event, &ldquo;Running Bitcoin,&rdquo; a half marathon for Bitcoin holders to raise funds that would be contributed towards finding a cure for ALS. Those willing to participate would be covering a half-marathon distance between January 1st through 10th to raise funds through BTC donations for ALS research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are determined to find a cure for this devastating condition and any support you can provide will make a big difference&hellip;If you'd like to participate in the 'Running Bitcoin' event and make a donation, you can do so by visiting our website http://runningbitcoin.us and following the instructions there.&rdquo;</p>

More On &ldquo;Running Bitcoin&rdquo;
<p>It is interesting to note that the marathon name, &ldquo;Running Bitcoin,&rdquo; was informed by the first-ever tweet about the crypto made by Hal Finney himself, indicating how much of an early adopter he was. In fact, he was the second person to run a Bitcoin node after Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Finney tweeted those two words just a few days after Bitcoin went live in 2009. Prior to his diagnosis, Finney had frequently run distances. The Running Bitcoin website has also revealed that he especially favored the half marathon distance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The notice on the website reads,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Join Honorary Chair Fran Finney and the Running Bitcoin Challenge Committee as we honor legendary cypher punk, Hal Finney. This is THE EVENT that combines Hal Finney's love of running and Bitcoin and is raising funds and awareness to help defeat ALS, which claimed his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other information on the event reveals that participants can complete the half marathon in one day or throughout the campaign duration. The website also collects donations in Bitcoin and fiat currency, where certain donators will receive certain benefits. A minimum $100 donation will earn a special event t-shirt, while the top 25 contributors will receive a Hal Finney collectible autographed by Fran Finney. The campaign has already raised $10,000 of its $50,000 goal.&nbsp;</p>
