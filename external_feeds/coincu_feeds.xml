<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitdeer&#8217;s Bhutan mining facility is operational, and testing is in progress.</em></li>

<li><em>Gedu Datacenter thrives with 11,000 stable miners, and growth continues.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitdeer Technologies, a Singapore-based Bitcoin mining company founded by Jihan Wu, has <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/07/2720183/0/en/Bitdeer-Announces-July-2023-Operations-Updates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved</a> a significant milestone by completing the construction of its mining facility in Bhutan.

<p>Linghui Kong, the CEO of Bitdeer, shared that around 15,000 new mining machines were delivered to their Gedu data center in Bhutan in July.</p>



<p>In their latest update for July, <a href="https://coincu.com/203859-bitdeer-dominates-vaneck-crypto-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitdeer</a> reported advancements in both operational and infrastructure aspects. The company demonstrated steady growth in its total hash rate, which expanded year-over-year and monthly. This growth encompassed self-owned and hosted mining machines, showcasing the company&#8217;s commitment to scaling operations. Notably, Bitdeer mined 220 Bitcoins through its self-mining business in July, representing a remarkable 41% increase compared to the previous year.</p>



<p>Kong highlighted the company&#8217;s proactive approach to power usage in its Texas data center. By curbing power consumption during the intense local heat, Bitdeer contributed to stabilizing Texas&#8217; electric power grid.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s proprietary hash rate surged to 7.9 EH/s by the end of July, propelled by the arrival of new mining machines in Bhutan. Approximately 23,000 newly-purchased mining machines were delivered to the <a href="https://coincu.com/195155-bitdeer-100mw-gedu-datacenter-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gedu Datacenter</a> as of the end of July, with an additional 7,000 machines en route. The construction of the Gedu Datacenter has been successfully concluded, with power-on testing underway.</p>



<p>As of August 7, a substantial 11,000 mining machines were operational and stable. This progress not only signifies Bitdeer&#8217;s commitment to growth but also positions them as a prominent player in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining.</p>

<p>The transaction occurred a mere 45 minutes ago and has stirred intrigue due to its magnitude and the entities involved.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Justin just yoinked $200M USDT out of JustLend (the USDT he has taken from Huobi) back to his personal wallet, and then transferred to a new address…<br><br>Feeling some heat your excellency? <a href="https://t.co/khywV9Qxn7" target="_blank">https://t.co/khywV9Qxn7</a></p>&mdash; Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1688733773938995201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Adam Cochran, a respected partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, has cast a spotlight on the situation by identifying the enigmatic recipient of the transfer. Cochran stated that the recipient address was allegedly linked to none other than Sun Yuchen, a prominent figure in the blockchain space and the founder of TRON.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="982" height="632" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413.png" alt="JustLendDAO&#039;s 200M Transfer Raises Justin Sun Connection" class="wp-image-208943" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413.png 982w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413-300x193.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413-768x494.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413-750x483.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" title="JustLendDAO&#039;s 200M Transfer Raises Justin Sun Connection 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What adds to the intrigue is that after the initial transfer to Sun Yuchen&#8217;s purported personal wallet, another transfer of 200 million USDT swiftly followed, this time to an entirely new address. This sequence of transactions has fueled conjecture about the motives behind such a substantial and swift movement of funds.</p>



<p>Analysts and industry insiders are buzzing with theories about the significance of this transfer and its potential implications for JustLendDAO, TRON, and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. The identity of the new address remains shrouded in mystery, prompting heightened curiosity among enthusiasts and investors alike.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>PayPal&#8217;s PYUSD employs advanced security, allowing Paxos to halt functions during threats and legally freeze criminal assets.</em></li>



<li><em>With 26.9 million coins issued, it integrates with Venmo and third-party wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>PayPal&#8217;s PYUSD launch leads fintech in embracing digital currencies for payments, reshaping financial norms.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Recent information available on GitHub <a href="https://t.co/zKc5NoYwXr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sheds</a> light on PayPal&#8217;s stablecoin, PYUSD, revealing robust security protocols. In the event of a significant security threat, Paxos, the underlying technology, has the capability to suspend both the authorization and transfer functions of PYUSD.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-1024x631.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="631" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-1024x631.png" alt="PayPal Stablecoin PYUSD May Be Freeze by Paxos If It Has A Serious Security Threat" class="wp-image-208933" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-1024x631.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-300x185.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-768x473.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-750x462.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410-1140x702.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-410.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="PayPal Stablecoin PYUSD May Be Freeze by Paxos If It Has A Serious Security Threat 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>Additionally, Paxos can lawfully freeze or seize assets linked to criminal activities. AssetProtectionRole permissions enable designated addresses to initiate freezing, unfreezing, or even clearing the balances of specific accounts, as indicated in a report by <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1688748340979306498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wu Blockchain</a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Paxos clarified its stance, stating that it would not execute freeze operations directly, and such instances are expected to be exceedingly rare. Similar to PYUSD, stablecoins USDT and USDC incorporate a comparable blacklist-freezing mechanism.</p>



<p>Paxos officially disclosed the contract address of PYUSD, PayPal&#8217;s US dollar stablecoin, as 0x6c3ea9036406852006290770BEdFcAbA0e23A0e8.</p>



<p>On-chain data <a href="https://coincu.com/208906-pyusd-by-paypal-issued-26-9m-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highlights</a> the issuance of 26.9 million coins held by 8 owners, with 175 transactions recorded since its launch.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, PayPal <a href="https://coincu.com/208826-paypal-pyusd-new-stablecoin-u-s-dollar-deposits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> headlines by unveiling its U.S. dollar stablecoin, marking a pioneering step among major financial technology firms in adopting digital currencies for payments and transfers.</p>



<p>Despite stablecoins&#8217; existence for years as crypto tokens tethered to stable assets to mitigate volatility, their integration into mainstream consumer payment ecosystems has remained limited.</p>



<p>Access to <a href="https://coincu.com/208865-paypals-pyusd-connected-to-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PYUSD</a> will gradually become available to U.S.-based PayPal customers, with users of the Venmo payment app also gaining access. Future plans include enabling individuals to hold PYUSD in third-party digital wallets like MetaMask, enhancing the coin&#8217;s accessibility and usability.</p>



<p>This strategic move by PayPal underscores the company&#8217;s commitment to exploring the potential of stablecoins and expanding their adoption in the digital financial landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cathie Wood predicts a delay for ARK Invest&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF approval and cites potential SEC simultaneous approvals.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC&#8217;s possible move to approve multiple Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously could balance the demand by $50 billion.</em></li>



<li><em>Market leaders like BlackRock, Fidelity explore Bitcoin ETFs; Grayscale advocates fairness in the approval process.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ARK Invest&#8217;s CEO and CIO, <a href="https://coincu.com/201934-cathie-woods-ark-invest-cuts-coinbase-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cathie Wood</a>, anticipates the likelihood of a delay in the approval of ARK Invest&#8217;s proposed spot Bitcoin ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="929" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408.png" alt="SEC May Approve Multiple Bitcoin ETFs Worth $50B At The Same Time: ARK Invest CEO" class="wp-image-208922" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-408-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="SEC May Approve Multiple Bitcoin ETFs Worth $50B At The Same Time: ARK Invest CEO 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>Wood&#8217;s statement highlighted her expectation that the SEC would not meet the upcoming review deadline for the fund. According to Wood, the SEC might approve multiple Bitcoin spot ETFs concurrently, departing from its past reluctance.</p>



<p>In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/cathie-wood-says-sec-will-approve-multiple-bitcoin-etfs-at-once" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, she suggested that if the SEC decides to move forward with any pending applications, it could approve more than one ETF. ARK Investment Management, known for its active participation in cryptocurrency, submitted a Bitcoin ETF application in June, and Wood noted the possibility of several approvals simultaneously.</p>



<p>Initially asserting a leading position for potential approval due to the timing of their application, ARK now aligns with the idea of a level playing field for ETFs. Wood&#8217;s revised stance could foster demand for upwards of $50 billion across various ETFs.</p>



<p>Market giants such as <a href="https://coincu.com/206478-blackrocks-bold-move-partners-with-jio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/202622-fidelity-fires-up-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/196656-wisdomtree-enters-spot-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WisdomTree</a>, VanEck, and Invesco have all submitted applications for similar products to ARK&#8217;s proposed Bitcoin ETF. Differentiating these similar offerings will hinge on the issuers&#8217; marketing strategies, according to Wood.</p>



<p>The push for spot Bitcoin ETFs gains momentum as prominent asset management companies, including BlackRock and Fidelity, pursue BTC ETFs. Additionally, <a href="https://coincu.com/206678-grayscale-sec-concurrent-approval-bitcoin-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grayscale</a>, a significant cryptocurrency investor, urges the commission to consider approving all proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously.</p>



<p>Wood&#8217;s perspective resonates with Grayscale&#8217;s proposal to avoid granting an advantage to any particular ETF. Grayscale, in legal conflict with the SEC regarding its Bitcoin Trust application, recommends concurrent approvals to ensure fairness among ETF applicants.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said 70% of USDC is applied outside of the US, particularly in Asia, Latin America, and Africa.</em></li>



<li><em>To expand the USDC market, the company is partnering with banks of superior quality in key global regions.</em></li>



<li><em>Jeremy Allaire also said the launch of PYUSD by payment giant Paypal is a good sign for stablecoin regulations in the US.</em></li>

<p>According to Jeremy Allaire, co-founder, and CEO of Circle, said on Twitter that despite the hype that the company&#8217;s target is the US, it is estimated that 70% of USDC adoption takes place outside of the US.</p>

<p>USDC is well received by the fastest-growing countries and regions, especially Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The demand for a secure, transparent digital dollar is enormous here.</p>



<p>Circle is partnering with premium quality banks in key global regions to expand the market to bring local payment methods and globally distributed mint/burning to USDC.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Allaire also said he predicts that stablecoins will make significant strides in 2024 and 2025 as the Stablecoin Law is coming to Japan, the United Kingdom, the EU, Hong Kong, the UAE, Singapore, and the United States. Customers will know with whom they are dealing, and companies that can survive the scrutiny of central banks and prudent regulators will thrive.</p>

<p>As mentioned, Paypal (PYPL.O) has announced the <a href="https://coincu.com/208865-paypals-pyusd-connected-to-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch</a> of USD stable coin for transfers and payments. PayPal USD (PYUSD) by Paxos Trust Co. is issued and backed entirely by deposits in US dollars, short-term Treasury bills, and similar cash equivalents.</p>



<p>It is pegged to the US dollar and will gradually be available to PayPal customers in the United States. As an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, the token can also be transferred to a compatible third-party wallet outside the PayPal network.</p>



<p>PayPal says Paxos will publish monthly reports detailing the PYUSD-backed asset starting next month. Paxos will also disseminate third-party, public endorsements of the value of its new stablecoin reserve asset.</p>



<p>Given that the US is strengthening its controls on the crypto industry, this could be a bold move for Paxos, especially since the company just filed an SEC lawsuit in mid-February. This year involves Binance&#8217;s stablecoin (BUSD).</p>



<p>However, at least one US lawmaker quickly voiced <a href="https://coincu.com/208844-us-representative-mchenry-praises-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support </a>for PayPal&#8217;s new initiative. Patrick McHenry, the Chairman of the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, supports PayPal&#8217;s stablecoin launch and its correlation with bipartisan stablecoin regulation. McHenry recently protested after the American Bankers Association criticized the stablecoin law the congressman helped draft.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Steadefi strategic leverage project was attacked with an estimated $1.1 million in damage.</em></li>



<li><em>Currently, all funds are at risk as an attacker has taken possession of a wallet that implements the protocol.</em></li>



<li><em>The project calls for the hacker to return the money to receive the 10% bonus, otherwise, that part will go to the tracker, and the hacker will face a lawsuit.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Steadefi, an automated earnings leverage strategy platform, said on Twitter that the protocol was hacked, and all funds are now at risk. According to security company CertiK Alert&#8217;s monitoring, Steadefi <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1688668943622230016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has lost</a> about $1.1 million in this incident.</strong></h5>

<p>Steadefi briefly updated the specific situation regarding the hack in another tweet. It said that the wallet that implements the protocol (also the owner of all the vaults in the protocol) had been compromised.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A brief overview of the exploit:<br><br>The attack vector is that our protocol deployer wallet &#8212; which is also the owner of all vaults in the protocol &#8212; has been compromised.  <br><br>The exploiter had transferred ownership of all the vaults (lending and strategy) to a wallet they control,…</p>&mdash; Steadefi <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f53a.png" alt="🔺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f499.png" alt="💙" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f536.png" alt="🔶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@steadefi) <a href="https://twitter.com/steadefi/status/1688638572608552960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 7, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>All funds are in jeopardy because the attacker has taken ownership of all the vaults (loans and policies) transferred to a wallet they control and proceeds to perform many actions only for holders, such as allowing any wallet that can borrow any available funds from the loan vault to be swapped for ETH and bridged to Ethereum.</p>



<p>The depositor&#8217;s vault has not been exhausted (as of now) because the attacker has no sole owner function to withdraw the deposit from the vault. If a user deposits funds into the strategic vault, withdrawals are still made of the available assets (assuming the attacker does not pause the vault). The attacker also paused the liquidity mining contract, which means that if you (and most people) deposit svtoken or ibtoken into the farm, you won&#8217;t be able to withdraw them either, even though the attacker public can&#8217;t extract them either.</p>



<p>Although the protocol did not reveal the exact damage, they did send a message to the attacker&#8217;s wallet address to negotiate. Steadefi hopes to cooperate with the participation. The parties involved in the exploit will discuss the bounty issue and offer a 10% reward for the stolen funds.</p>



<p>Steadefi threatens that if the attacker returns 90% of the funds by August 10 at 08:00 UTC, the protocol will extend the bounty to the public, and offer the complete 10% to the identifiable person your character in a way that leads to your conviction in court.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The cryptocurrency exchange is in talks to raise more capital to open the market.</em></li>



<li><em>The company plans to expand into Europe, Asia, and the UK early next year.</em></li>



<li><em>The company&#8217;s current and only priority is to raise money through strategic investors.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/crypto-exchange-bitstamp-in-fundraising-talks-seeks-expansion?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg News</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/194829-bitstamp-join-uk-crypto-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitstamp </a>Global CEO Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux said they are currently in talks to raise new capital to expand the market and increase operations.</strong></h5>

<p>A Bitstamp spokesperson said the exchange kicked off the fundraising process at the end of June, with Galaxy Digital Holdings as an advisor. The company plans to use the money for operations, including launching derivatives trading in Europe next year and expanding operations in Asian and UK markets.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our current and exclusive priority is to raise money through strategic investors to accelerate Bitstamp&#8217;s growth by providing new products and services to retail and institutional crypto customers,&#8221; Graftieaux said in a statement.</p>



<p>The U.S. regulatory crackdown and banking crisis have also made it a lot more difficult to trade crypto in USD. This seems to have prompted crypto companies to move to more breathable markets.</p>



<p>Founded in 2011, Bitstamp, based in Luxembourg, is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, having been the main venue for Bitcoin trading, acting as an alternative to Bitcoin exchanges. The dominant at that time was Mt.Gox.</p>



<p>Recently, Binance.US is bleeding. A week after the SEC lawsuit, market makers and traders left the exchange in droves. As measured by aggregate market depth for the 17 tokens on the exchange, liquidity has dropped by almost 80%. The market share of Binance.US, the US version of Binance, plummeted from 27% in April to just over 1% at the end of June.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of the Binance slump, three smaller exchanges, Kraken, LMAX, and Bitstamp, jumped up by 25.5%, 9%, and 6%, respectively, according to Kaiko. Currently, Bitstamp USA, the US unit, has a coveted license called BitLicense, which allows it to serve customers in the state of New York.</p>
