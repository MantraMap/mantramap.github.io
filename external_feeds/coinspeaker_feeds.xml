<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/uk-amazon-1-7b-irobot/">UK Regulator Approves Amazon&#8217;s $1.7B Acquisition of Roomba-maker iRobot</a></p>
<p>Earlier today on Friday, June 16, Britain&#8217;s competition regulator gave a go-ahead to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> for its planned acquisition of the Roomba vacuum cleaner maker &#8211; iRobot Corporation.</p>
<p>UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that they have cleared the deal which would not lead to any competition concerns in the country. Earlier in April 2023, the CMA started investigating the deal that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) made in August of the previous year. Amazon wanted to add more smart-home devices to its collection, like the Alexa voice assistant, smart thermostats, security devices, smart displays for walls, and a robot named Astro that looks like a dog. The CMA had considered three potential areas of concern.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is whether Amazon might start selling robot vacuum cleaners if the merger doesn&#8217;t happen, and if this would significantly reduce competition.</li>
<li>The second is whether Amazon could use its online store to give iRobot&#8217;s competitors a disadvantage if the merger goes through.</li>
<li>The third is whether iRobot vacuum cleaners are important for &#8220;smart home&#8221; platforms, and if Amazon could give its smart home competitors a disadvantage if the merger happens.</li>
</ol>
<p>Speaking on the development, a spokesperson for Amazon <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/uk-regulator-clears-amazons-planned-purchase-irobot-2023-06-16/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased with the UK Competition and Markets Authority&#8217;s decision and are committed to supporting regulatory bodies in their work. We look forward to similar decisions from other regulators soon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>CMA-Amazon Deal Has No Competition Concerns</h2>
<p>After doing the due diligence, CMA concluded that Amazon&#8217;s deal of acquiring iRobot won&#8217;t violate any competition concerns that the regulator had. The CMA found that iRobot doesn&#8217;t have a big market share in the UK for robot vacuum cleaners and already faces significant competition. Therefore, Amazon&#8217;s entry wouldn&#8217;t greatly affect the market.</p>
<p>Even though Amazon is a major retailer, it wouldn&#8217;t have a strong incentive to disadvantage other robot vacuum cleaner manufacturers. The UK market for these cleaners is small and not expected to grow much, so the benefits would be limited. Additionally, pursuing such a strategy would be costly for Amazon.</p>
<p>The acquisition of iRobot wouldn&#8217;t harm Amazon&#8217;s competitors in the &#8220;smart home&#8221; market. Robot vacuum cleaners and the data they collect are not considered crucial for the UK smart home market. There are also other vacuum cleaners with similar capabilities that can be part of rival &#8220;smart home&#8221; offerings.</p>
<p>Colin Raftery, Senior Director of Mergers at the CMA, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It marks a significant milestone, and both companies are continuing to work cooperatively with other relevant regulators in their review of the merger.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-exit-netherlands-vasp/">Binance Announces Exit from Netherlands after Failing to Secure VASP License</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> has announced its exit from the Netherlands. According to an <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/notice-on-changes-of-services-in-the-netherlands-b5a647be31cf469b87fc3337fd461ced" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official publication</a>, the world’s largest crypto is leaving the Dutch market as it has been unable to secure a license as a virtual asset service provider (VASP).</p>
<p>In the exit announcement, Binance notes it will no longer accept new users in the Netherlands with immediate effect. Also, apart from withdrawals, all services will be suspended for existing users resident in the Netherlands from 00:00 on Saturday.</p>
<p>Binance said it has been trying to secure official registration as a VASP with Dutch authorities but without luck. The announcement states:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Although we explored many alternative avenues to service Dutch residents in compliance with Dutch regulations, unfortunately this has not resulted in a VASP registration in the Netherlands at this time.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The exchange added that it complies with money laundering and terrorism financing standards in several EU countries, including Sweden, Poland, Lithuania, Spain, Italy, and France. Binance continued by stating its commitment to working with regulators and promised to leave conversations with Dutch authorities open.</p>
<p>As Binance prepares for its exit, existing users in the Netherlands will receive emails with details about their accounts and assets. The email will also include the steps required of each user. Binance ended by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“While Binance is disappointed that this has become necessary, it will continue to engage productively and transparently with Dutch regulators.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Binance Fined in the Netherlands</h2>
<p>In July last year, the central bank of the Netherlands (DNB) fined Binance 3.3 million euros &#8211; about $3.35 million &#8211; for operating in the country without registration. In an <a href="https://www.dnb.nl/nieuws-voor-de-sector/handhavingsmaatregel-2022/boete-voor-binance-holdings-ltd-vanwege-het-zonder-de-wettelijk-vereiste-registratie-aanbieden-van-cryptodiensten/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a> at the time, the Dutch regulator noted that it had issued Binance a public warning nearly a year before. The apex bank also clarified that it arrived at the fine based on Binance’s large trading volume, number of customers in the country, and the fact that Binance is the world’s largest crypto firm. The violation was a “third category fine” with a minimum amount of 2 million euros and a maximum of 4 million euros.</p>
<h2>Exit from Other Countries</h2>
<p>Binance recently <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1657099651210969088?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> its exit from the Canadian market. According to the exchange, Canada is no longer an attractive market for a few reasons, including rules surrounding stablecoins and investor limits. Binance mentioned that it postponed the decision to exit the market for a long time as it tried to explore other options but to no avail. Like the notice announcing its exit from the Netherlands, Binance also said it would continue engaging with Canadian regulators and hopes to “someday return to the market”.</p>
<p>Binance also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/asic-binance-crypto-license/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">no longer holds</a> a derivatives license in Australia. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) published a <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-091mr-binance-australia-derivatives-afs-licence-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> saying it revoked the license held by Oztures Trading Pty Ltd, a local Binance subsidiary. According to the release, Binance requested the revocation. In February, the ASIC opened an investigation into Binance, probing the alleged unlawful closure of some derivatives accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blockfi-legal-action-commission-license/">BlockFi Initiates Legal Action against State Commission for Not Accepting Its Surrendered License</a></p>
<p>BlockFi’s attempts to return its Connecticut money transmitter license have been futile, as the state regulator has repeatedly refused to respond. Instead of accepting or acknowledging the license return, the commission insists that BlockFi undergo administrative processes that would require the bankrupt crypto exchange to go through some court proceedings or pay a fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blockfi-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlockFi filed for bankruptcy</a> last year following the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> crash, claiming debts owed to over 100,000 creditors, with its 50 largest creditors accounting for a total of $1.3 billion. Filing for bankruptcy also means that the defunct crypto company would need to surrender its Connecticut money transmitter license, which allowed it to facilitate the transfer of funds within the state. The license was no longer needed since the company had already stopped its operations.</p>
<h2>The State Commission&#8217;s Lack of Response to BlockFi&#8217;s Request for License Return</h2>
<p>In December 2022, BlockFi attempted to submit the license but received no response from the commission. However, BlockFi was sent a notice from the state revoking the license and ordering it to stop doing business within the state in February. This came as a surprise to the company, considering the steps it had taken to return the license and because it had halted all its activities when it filed for bankruptcy last year.</p>
<p>BlockFi made a subsequent attempt to submit the license but received no response. Instead, the commission informed the company that it would need to pay a $1 million fine to avoid court proceedings.</p>
<p>Concerned about the situation, BlockFi was left with no choice but to sue the Connecticut banking commissioner. Despite receiving approval to sell its assets earlier this year, the company is burdened by significant debt. It aims to settle with its clients rather than engage in a protracted court case or pay what it considers unwarranted fees.</p>
<p>In its statement, BlockFi <a href="https://decrypt.co/144879/blockfi-sues-connecticut-banking-commission" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">emphasized</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Department’s self-help actions to revoke the license and assess monetary penalties are in pursuit of its pecuniary interest and do not seek to protect public health, safety, or welfare.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>BlockFi is attempting to halt the court proceedings and make it clear that the state is wrong and violating the law by revoking its license and seeking civil penalties.</p>
<p>A court proceeding is scheduled for July 6, during which BlockFi can present arguments in support of its position and potentially avoid the administrative hearing scheduled for July 20. The outcome of the July 6 court process may determine whether the July 20 court meeting proceeds or not.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bank-of-england-boe-cbdc-test/">Bank of England (BoE) Concludes CBDC Test Project towards Potential Official Launch</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Bank of England (BoE) is moving closer to launching its Central Bank Digital Currency (</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDC</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">) after its long test project on the potential benefits of the technology. The BoE launched Project Rosalind last year to help decide whether to float a CBDC.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The BoE undertook the CBDC project in collaboration with the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) to practicalize CBDC usage. According to a report the BIS published on Friday, the BoE’s CBDC could improve the payments landscape. The report notes that the CBDC could help people make payments faster and much easier. For organizations, the asset would help launch financial products and detect duplicity or fraud.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One way the BoE’s CBDC could help reduce fraud is to program settlement at a specific time or after a set event. For instance, an online vendor’s payment may only settle after a customer confirms that products received are satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the BIS’ report: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“A well designed API layer could work with different private sector applications and central bank ledger designs and that a set of simple and standardized API functionalities could support a diverse range of use cases.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The results from the first phase are positive. According to the BoE, the development and launch of a CBDC is “likely” and could happen sometime later. However, the Bank has not decided on a specific date or whether or not it would go ahead. It said a series of consultations are necessary in addition to support from the UK Treasury.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">London-based blockchain technology company Quant worked on the CBDC project between the BoE and the BIS. Quant founder and CEO Gilbert Verdian applauds the initiative because he believes the UK’s existing financial system is not well-suited for a digital society.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Testing the BoE’s CBDC</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The first phase of the CBDC started last year and featured eight organizations from finance and tech. Using Quant’s framework, Mastercard created a CBDC debit card, while the Bank of Canada created an account for children that paid a certain amount when the child completes a chore.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other participants include Barclays Plc, BNY Mellon, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/revolut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revolut</a>. Barclays used the CBDC to test cash payments released to vendors only after the buyers receive their items in good condition.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Verdian said this “conditional logic” feature is great for preventing fraud instead of working hard at fraud protection. Verdian also said these features could make the digital pound one of the world’s most preferred currencies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Officials at the BoE and the UK Treasury </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bank-of-england-digital-pound-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">believe</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a CBDC would have numerous benefits. The BoE’s deputy governor for monetary policy Ben Broadbent said the digital pound would be cheaper for businesses due to low settlement costs and faster for online payments.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Many expect the digital pound, fondly called the “Britcoin,” to launch sometime at the end of 2023.</span></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/stellantis-first-european-ev/">Stellantis to Unveil First European-made EV in Mid-October</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automobile manufacturer Stellantis NV (BIT: STLAM) is set to </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/16/stellantis-to-reveal-its-first-europe-made-affordable-electric-vehicle-reuters-reports.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unveil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its first European-made affordable electric vehicle, the new </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citroën e-C3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by mid-October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Brand Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Citroën and Stellantis Chief Sales &amp; Marketing Officer Thierry Koskas, the Electric Vehicle (EV) will sell for less than 25,000 euros which is approximately $27,400. With this price, Stellantis is geared towards countering lower-cost Chinese brands arriving in the European market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese carmakers are usually focused on larger electric vehicles but recently they have started introducing smaller and cheaper models to Europe to gain traction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s French market, the most affordable EVs are the Chinese-made Renault Dacia Spring and the electric Renault Twingo, priced at 21,000 euros ($22,806) and 25,000 euros respectively. Meanwhile, Twingo will stop production by mid-2024. Compared to these two models, the Citroën e-C3 is a larger city car selling for less or around the same price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stellantis has made efforts towards tapping into the EV business which is largely dominated by Chinese manufacturers. So far, it has </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/stellantis-record-full-year-2022-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recorded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outstanding results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the carmaker announced the addition of nine new battery EVs to its range for 2023. By the end of 2024, Stellantis plans to have a total of 47 battery EVs while Citroën plans to have electrified its total range by the same time. In 2022, Stellantis </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/stellantis-uber-electric-vehicles-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collaborated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with car-hailing service provider </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/uber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber Technologies Inc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NYSE: UBER) to take on the electric vehicle market in France.</span></p>
<h2><b>Stellantis and the EV Subsidy Uncertainty</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ordinarily, EVs are way more expensive than their fossil-fuel counterparts. European car manufacturers always try to come up with cheaper models which are encouraged by government subsidies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clear example is France which plans a subsidy for EVs produced in Europe seeing that they have a lower carbon footprint than imported models. There is also an upcoming social leasing program that would offer these EVs to poorer households for about $100.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information from some sources has hinted at a possible release of this subsidy by October for cars that would be delivered by next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Citroën e-C3 model will have a 320-kilometer range and a 57-minute “fast charge” capability. It is built on Stellantis &#8220;smart car&#8221; architecture that was launched in India and Latin America. The EVs will be assembled in Slovakia as they get ready for the official launch in the second quarter of next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The e-C3 battery will likely be produced in China and this raises the question of whether the Citroën vehicle can be covered by the subsidies, seeing that one of its vital parts is from China. Consistently, China has successfully led the EV market but Volvo Cars CEO Jim Rowan believes that an end has come to that narrative.</span></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitkey-coinbase-cash-app/">Bitkey Forms Alliance with First Global Partners: Coinbase and Cash App</a></p>
<p>Bitkey, a self-custody <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> wallet app by Jack Dorsey’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/square/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block</a>, is partnering with Cash App and crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> (NASDAQ: COIN). The Bitcoin wallet application <a href="https://bitkey.build/coinbase-and-cash-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its first two global partners on June 15, noting that it aims to make self-custody more accessible. In addition to enabling customers to purchase, the alliance assures control over private keys.</p>
<p>Previously, former Twitter CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jack-dorsey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Dorsey</a> conducted an in-house beta of the Bitcoin self-custody wallet, which was available to Block employees only. Now, Block is opening up access to the general public, commencing in the coming weeks. Block plans to roll out the full Bitkey product suite in the UK, US, Australia, Canada, etc, following the global public launch later this year, customers will have access to more functionalities. Examples include buying BTC and initiating transfers from Coinbase to Bitkey across six continents.</p>
<h2>Bitkey Integrates with Coinbase and Cash App</h2>
<p>Bitkey was strategic in choosing its global partners &#8211; Coinbase and Cash App. While the crypto exchange is the largest in the US by trading volume, Cash App is owned by Block and provides mobile payment services, as well as stocks and Bitcoin in a single application. The relationship among the three parties will allow Bitkey users to buy and sell BTC through Coinbase and Cash App directly from within the wallet app. The main criteria in choosing Coinbase and Cash App are security standards, price transparency, availability of fiat payments, and global reach.</p>
<p>Bitkey business lead Lindsay Grossman at the self-custody BTC wallet app said it was important to partner with global forces to reach more audiences worldwide. The executive added that liaising with Coinbase is an assurance that the self-custody service remains secure.</p>
<p>While announcing Coinbase and Cash App as the new partners, Bitkey referred to some information it passed in March. The Jack Dorsey-backed Bitcoin wallet talked about how strategic alliance can help in its mission to empower the new 100 million people on BTC self-custody.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Partners play a key role in this journey and will help us widen the pie of self-custody adoption by making it easier and safer to move bitcoin from exchanges to Bitkey’s self-custody wallet where we can empower customers to truly own and manage their money on their own terms.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Henceforth, Bitkey users will begin to see either or both Cash App and Coinbase in their app. They can also transfer their existing BTC with any of the partners on the same app. According to the press release, the feature enabling the transfer of existing Bitcoin and purchase with global fiat currencies will be available shortly.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-report-bitcoin-halving/">Coinbase Report Casts Doubt on Bitcoin Halving Effects on Market Performance</a></p>
<p>With the next <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) halving anticipated in the second quarter of 2024, there is considerable speculation about its potential impact on the performance of the leading crypto asset and the market in general. However, according to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-halving-market-effects-overblown/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, a new  Coinbase publication suggests that while halving is often seen as a positive event due to its effect on Bitcoin scarcity and supply-demand dynamics, the true outcome of the next halving episode is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>According to the report&#8217;s analyst, David Duong, understanding the market reaction to previous halving events requires careful analysis of various factors, including liquidity, interest rates, and movements of the US dollar.</p>
<p>Although Bitcoin <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-search-query-bitcoin-halving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halving</a> is generally regarded as favorable, there is limited evidence from the three recorded events as they were influenced by factors such as global liquidity measures. The crypto exchange believes past historical events are insufficient to adequately predict the outcome of the upcoming halving in April 2024.</p>
<p>The Coinbase report highlights the challenge of establishing a clear pattern of market behavior during halving events. The complexity arises from the multitude of factors that contribute to price movements, making it challenging to isolate the precise impact of the halving.</p>
<p>Consequently, it remains uncertain how the upcoming halving will affect Bitcoin&#8217;s price behavior, especially with global liquidity appearing to have peaked in the near term.</p>
<h2>Retail Demand for Bitcoin Set to Soar Ahead of April 2024 Halving</h2>
<p>Despite the uncertainty surrounding the market reaction, JPMorgan Chase, a prominent player in the financial industry, predicts that retail demand for BTC will continue to be strong, leading up to the halving.</p>
<p>This stance underscores the high anticipation and significant interest surrounding the event within the crypto community.</p>
<p>The JPMorgan <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-bitcoin-retail-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> in May attributed the surge in retail demand for BTC to the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. The report emphasized that as the halving draws nearer, demand from retail investors for the crypto asset is expected to strengthen significantly.</p>
<p>The company is one of many financial services firm that joined the crypto bandwagon. The bank launched its in-house Bitcoin fund for institutional clients in 2021.</p>
<p>Like JPMorgan, other fintech firms like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock</a> and Grayscale Investments actively participate in crypto. According to a recent <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec/">report</a> by Coinspeaker, BlackRock has applied to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/">SEC</a>) to offer customers a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<h2>A Look At the Previous Halving Events</h2>
<p>The first Bitcoin halving occurred in 2012 after its official launch in 2009. The miner&#8217;s block reward was reduced from 50 to 25 BTC at the time. This significant milestone triggered a substantial increase in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, propelling the crypto asset into a remarkable bull run. The market witnessed a surge in investor interest, driving BTC&#8217;s value to new heights and solidifying its position as a king coin.</p>
<p>he second event took place in 2016, reducing the block reward from 25 to 12.5 BTC. Similarly, this halving had a profound impact on the Bitcoin price trajectory. The crypto asset experienced an impressive surge following the event, surpassing previous all-time highs. Market sentiment was overwhelmingly positive, fostering a period of significant growth for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Most recently, in May 2020, the crypto community witnessed its third Bitcoin halving, which further reduced the block reward to 6.25 BTC.</p>
<p>Despite the challenging circumstances presented by the global pandemic, Bitcoin <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-halving-coronavirus-14-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showcased</a> resilience and embarked on a remarkable rally. The rally led to Bitcoin reaching unprecedented price levels of nearly $70 000 in 2021, captivating the attention of investors worldwide.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> co-founder <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/bill-gates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Gates</a> met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday. The talk between them comes on the third day of Gates’ visit and one day after his meeting with the mayor of Beijing, Yin Yong.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although there are no official details of Bill Gates’ meeting with President Xi Jinping, the meeting with the Beijing mayor reportedly involved partnering with China on drug discovery. Xi Jinping </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/15/bill-gates-meets-with-president-xi-jinping-in-beijing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reportedly</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> told Gates the meeting was his first with an “American friend” this year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On Wednesday, Gates </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1668978640414179329" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> his visit to China is the first since 2019 and confirmed he plans to visit with partners “working on global health and development challenges” with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for 15 years.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gates also spoke at the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute (GHDDI), which develops new medications for infectious diseases. The institute focuses on diseases affecting the world’s indigent population, including ailments like malaria and tuberculosis.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During his </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/speeches/2023/06/bill-china-ghddi-innovation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">remarks</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Gates said there is more of a need to address global challenges as seen in the world since his last visit to China in 2019. Gates mentioned climate change, a hunger crisis in some parts of the world, and “a resurgence of infectious diseases.” He added:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“China has made significant gains reducing poverty and improving health outcomes within China. I’m hopeful China can play an even bigger role in addressing the current challenges, particularly those facing African countries.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gates also said he is optimistic that the world can overcome these challenges best on progress measured over the last few decades. According to him, nearly 1 in 10 children in low-income countries died before 5 years in 1990 from preventable diseases. The current state according to him is 1 in 25 children, with China’s death rate of young children plunging by 94%.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Xi Jinping Administration to Foster Working Relationships with Bill Gates and Other Prominent Persons</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gates is optimistic about the possibility of eradicating infectious diseases in other parts of the world because of China’s related successes. For instance, Gates said the World Health Organization declared China malaria-free in 2021. This is a long way from the 1950s when China recorded over 300,000 malaria deaths from 30 million annual cases.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a statement from the Beijing mayor </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/P37ycuL41UVoYb5ZdydOsw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">published</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in Beijing Daily, the city is interested in a deeper relationship with the Gates Foundation. Yong said Beijing is “willing to deepen cooperation with the Gates Foundation” for scientific research and talent training.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bill Gates’ visit comes shortly after </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tesla Inc</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk met with Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang to discuss business.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/adobe-revenue-profit-ai/">Adobe Raises Revenue and Profit Outlook on Generative AI Optimism</a></p>
<p>In a significant development for the technology industry, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/adobe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Inc</a> (NASDAQ: ADBE) the renowned software company, has announced a raised full-year revenue and profit outlook. The optimistic projection is primarily driven by the company&#8217;s assumption that the incorporation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into its software solutions will fuel growing demand.</p>
<p>According to its latest release, the company now <a href="https://biz.crast.net/adobe-raises-sales-forecast-as-company-rolls-out-ai-features/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">anticipates</a> sales of around $19.3 billion, up from its previous projection of $19.2 billion. Similarly, Adobe has boosted its adjusted earnings forecast to potentially reach $15.75 per share, up from $15.60 per share previously.</p>
<p>In the prediction, Adobe increased the expected income for its Digital Media division, which includes Photoshop and other creative applications. As <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/adobe-blizzard-generative-ai-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> of its generative AI development spread, Adobe&#8217;s shares also experienced a surge in extended trading.</p>
<p>On June 9, Adobe stock experienced a notable breakout in its stock price, breaking out of a cup base with a buy point of $451.15, as indicated by <a href="https://get.investors.com/marketsmith/?src=APA1BQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">IBD MarketSmith</a> charts.</p>
<h2>Adobe and the Opportunity Optimization</h2>
<p>These revised financial projections reflect Adobe&#8217;s excellent performance and the company&#8217;s confidence in its ability to capitalize on new opportunities. By leveraging its innovative software offerings and integrating generative AI features, Adobe aims to drive increased demand and enhance user experiences.</p>
<p>Adobe is making a significant leap forward by integrating generative AI features into its product offerings. These AI capabilities are being introduced across Adobe&#8217;s software suite, catering to the needs of creative professionals and organizations. Additionally, Adobe also unveiled enterprise-level subscriptions for these new tools, which come with an added feature of legal assurance against copyright claims.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s commitment to technological advancement and its understanding of market dynamics have positioned it favorably for sustained growth. Furthermore, in a bid to maintain its position as the leading provider of creative software, Adobe has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/adobe-figma-20-billion/">proposed</a> a substantial $20 billion acquisition of Figma, a design startup.</p>
<p>This strategic move aims to increase Adobe&#8217;s design-related capabilities and offers. The acquisition procedure has, however, encountered hurdles, such as a thorough review and probable legal objections from US regulatory organizations.</p>
<p>The company said it remains committed to cooperating with these regulatory bodies to ensure a smooth acquisition process. Executives of the firm have expressed optimism about completing the purchase by the end of the year, as mentioned in a transcript of remarks prepared for a conference call.</p>
<h2>Adobe Tops Revenue Target as Cloud Software Demand Soars</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Adobe has <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/adbe-stock-adobe-beats-q2-goals-on-cloud-software-demand/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> its financial results for the quarter ended June 2. The company&#8217;s adjusted earnings for the quarter were $3.91 per share, surpassing analysts&#8217; expectations of $3.79 per share, as polled by FactSet. Adobe&#8217;s sales for the quarter reached $4.82 billion, slightly exceeding the projected sales of $4.77 billion.</p>
<p>In comparison to the previous year, Adobe witnessed a significant increase in earnings, with a 17% jump, while sales climbed by 10%. These positive year-over-year growth figures indicate the company&#8217;s strong performance and its ability to capitalize on market opportunities.</p>

<p>Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) has granted crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/okx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OKX</a> a minimal viable product (MVP) preparatory license. This implies that the exchange is now cleared to fulfill all requirements to bag a full operational license in the region.</p>
<p>According to a Thursday <a href="https://www.okx.com/learn/okx-receives-mvp-preparatory-license-from-vara" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement</a> by OKX Middle East, once it receives this license, it will be able to extend its &#8220;approved suite of duly regulated virtual assets activities&#8221;. That is, it then can start offering spot, derivatives, and fiat services. By that time, the firm will also be able to carry out various transactions such as US dollar and UAE dirham deposits and withdrawals and also offer spot pairs to institutional and qualified retail customers.</p>
<p>Recall that OKX Middle East had been offering certain products and services in the region since last July. That was after VARA granted it a provisional virtual assets provider license.</p>
<h2>OKX Signals Expansion in the Region</h2>
<p>With the new MVP license, it appears that the ambition of the firm to scale its business in the Middle East is now in full throttle. And riding on the current wave, OKX has revealed plans to increase its staff in Dubai to 30 people. However, most of the recruits will be locals and top management, says OKX.</p>
<p>According to the exchange, the UAE is a strategic point for its business. More so, given that the region is fast establishing itself as a haven for crypto businesses in light of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-crypto-companies-abroad-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory pressure</a> and uncertainties in the US.</p>
<p>As a result, OKX is looking to establish its presence in the region by all means necessary. The firm has already opened an office at Dubai&#8217;s World Trade Centre building. It has also revealed plans to extend its nine-figure brand partnerships to the region, albeit with different customer-based activities.</p>
<p>OKX&#8217;s move into the Middle East follows a March announcement of its planned exit from Canada. At the time, the exchange revealed that it will no longer operate in Canada by June 22.</p>
