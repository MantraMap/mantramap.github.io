<p>In their latest tweet, Binance said that they have paused &#8220;large volumes of pending transactions&#8221; and that the team is working to bring back BTC withdrawals asap. Currently, as per on-chain data, there are nearly half a million pending transactions on the Bitcoin network due to high gas costs.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Currently 479,000 unconfirmed transactions on the Bitcoin network. </p>
<p>BRC20 tokens are exploding and with it gas fees and wait times. <a href="https://t.co/joVhwiFUrL">pic.twitter.com/joVhwiFUrL</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The recent events brought some selling pressure on Bitcoin, whose price has dropped more than 2% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $28,228 with a market cap of $546 billion.</p>
<p>On Sunday, May 7, <a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-binance-temporarily-suspends-bitcoin-btc-withdrawals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance halted BTC withdrawals</a> for nearly 90 minutes while blaming congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain. As a result, volumes on the Binance exchange have exceeded $6 billion in the past 24 hours, five times the next platform OKX.</p>
<p>Binance assured investors that the funds are SAFU while adding that they are replacing the pending BTC withdrawal transactions with higher fees so that they get picked up by the mining pool. The exchange recently tweeted that its team is working to resume transactions within the next hour.</p>
<p>Binance said that they are also thinking to enable Bitcoin Lightning Network to help in such situations. It <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419624962527233" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed. Our team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Bitcoin Ordnials Clogging the Network?</h3>
<p>Earlier in 2023, Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor released a protocol dubbed <a href="https://coingape.com/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals-and-how-do-they-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ordinals</a> that would help mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for the first time. These have boosted the transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>As per Hayden Hughes, co-founder of social-trading platform Alpha Impact, Ordinals led to a “massive run up in network fees and congestion&#8221;. Interestingly, the use of Bitcoin Taproot, which makes transactions anonymous, surged on Sunday. Crypto journalist Colin Wu explains that &#8220;the increase in Taproot adoption means that block sizes are increasing, resulting in an increase in transaction costs&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">According to glassnode, a total of 75.77% of Bitcoin on-chain transactions used Taproot on May 7, a record high, compared to only 1.536% at the beginning of the year. The increase in Taproot adoption means that block sizes are increasing, resulting in an increase in transaction… <a href="https://t.co/dFP9KmO80s">pic.twitter.com/dFP9KmO80s</a></p>

According to the tweet containing the update, the exchange said the reason for the halt is based on the congestion that is being experienced on the Bitcoin network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Typically, periods of network congestion can cause a lot of discomfort for traders as deposits and withdrawal requests typically take a considerable amount of time before it goes through. The suspension of withdrawals by Binance is considered an avenue to save its users from this stress, until the congestion is cleared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As revealed, Binance said one of its dedicated team is “currently working on a fix until the network is stabilized and will reopen</span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=cashtag_click"><span style="font-weight: 400"> $BTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> withdrawals as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that Binance has made a name for itself as the biggest exchange with the deepest liquidity as confirmed by its proof of reserve asset has helped maintain calm in the community. Binance has maintained its lead in the industry despite the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/pepe-reverses-gain-as-whales-takes-profit-on-binance-listing/"><span style="font-weight: 400">record listing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of PEPE and Floki Inu memecoins over the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the sustained congestion, however, questions about the health of the Bitcoin protocol have risen up in the industry.</span></p>
<h2><b>Possible Cause of Bitcoin Congestion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hours before Binance exchange reported the halt in withdrawals, a Twitter user who doubles as a major node operator @proofofjogi confirmed that Bitcoin is under a DOS attack. According to him, “high transaction fees are the chosen pain point by the attacker, probably to make bitcoin unusable for smaller players.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bitcoin is under DoS attack. High transaction fees are the chosen pain point by the attacker, probably to makes bitcoin unusable for smaller players. <a href="https://t.co/0J56liNSGf">pic.twitter.com/0J56liNSGf</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Jogi, the mechanism of the attack appears to be </span><a href="https://coingape.com/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals-and-how-do-they-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ordinals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> shitcoining and by his predictions, the whole attack may just be starting off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin is renowned as the most versatile protocol in the blockchain ecosystem. This recognition may soon be cleared off since some smart contracts functionalities are now being built on the network at this time. These smart contracts have a lot of attack vectors that may largely compromise the integrity of the network just as is being experienced at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In all, Bitcoin price remains unfazed as it is </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400">changing hands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> at $28,941.90, up by 0.71%. At the time of writing, the exchange said it has resumed the Bitcoin withdrawals.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> withdrawals are now resumed on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and we apologize for any inconvenience.</p>

However, it seems the retracement phase is precisely resonating between two downsloping trendlines projecting the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bull-flag-pattern-in-crypto-meaning-and-how-to-identify/">flag pattern</a>. This famous chart pattern is often spotted between established uptrends offering an excellent long-entry opportunity to interested traders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decreasing volume activity indicates the ongoing correction is temporary</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout above the overhead resistance trendline will signal the end of this retracement phase</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $393.5 Million, indicating a 43% loss.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/c/CWccGxyh.png" alt="XRP Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the falling <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a> took a temporary sideways turn and resonated between the $0.486 and $0.43 horizontal levels. The cluster of daily candles in a short space reflects the indecisiveness among market participants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coin price continues to move sideways it would hit the pattern’s resistance trendline which may recuperate the selling momentum. Until the overhead trendline is intact, the XRP price will prolong the correction phase to lower levels.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/low-cap-crypto-gems-gunning-to-explode/">Low Cap Crypto Gems Gunning To Explode In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, under the influence of the flag pattern, the XRP price is more likely to breach the resistance trendline and flip it into potential support. This breakout will offer an entry opportunity to new buyers and may drive the prices up 20% to rechallenge the $0.55 barrier.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Fibonacci Retracement Indicator: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price correction still hovering above the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> indicates the overall market trend remains bullish</span></p>
<p><b>Moving Average Convergence/Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) line moving sideways hints weakening of bearish momentum.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.45</span></li>

In the tweet it shared, the ShimmerEVM Network revealed that it is experiencing heavy congestion which is currently challenging its chain limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the exact visitor count that overwhelmed the protocol was not revealed, the team said the setback is helping it strategize to discover a way to improve performance in the long run. While it confirmed that its team is working relentlessly to resolve the issues, the community has rallied round in support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ShimmerEVM is the IOTA spinoff that has been under development to help introduce smart contracts to the latter. At the current pace of evolution in today’s blockchain ecosystem, more primary non-smart contract focused layer-1 protocols are seeing increasing need to jump and follow the bandwagon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ShimmerEVM was designed to bridge this gap and the testnet has been deemed a very necessary one to stretch and test the limits of the protocol before the mainnet launch. According to one IOTA community member, @iota_penguine, it is better to encounter these challenges at this time than when the mainnet is live.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2><b>IOTA ShimmerEVM: Lagging Behind in EVM Pivot</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the ShimmerEVM testnet campaign still ongoing, the protocol and the broader IOTA ecosystem can be said to be lagging behind other core protocols like EOS and Filecoin, both of whom made the move into smart contract support recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As </span><a href="https://coingape.com/filecoin-virtual-machine-goes-live-with-smart-contracts-fil-shoots-11/"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> earlier by Coingape, the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) went live back in March after months of active development. The FVM launch was a very pivotal one and </span><a href="https://coingape.com/filecoin-price-skyrockets-25-on-fvm-launch-binance-announces-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400">support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> was given to the protocol by Binance exchange at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, EOS also pivoted into the smart contract scene when it launched its WebAssembly (WASM) protocol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the number of high profile protocols launching their smart contract compatibility, the ShimmerEVM appears to be coming late to the party overall. However, a solid protocol development and accompanying utility can help it compete with its peers around now.</span></p>

However, the daily chart shows the coin price is specifically resonating between two converging trend lines projecting the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a>. This well-known continuation pattern can be used to predict the most possible outcome for BTC in the coming week.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the symmetrical triangle pattern is a continuation pattern that encourages the prevailing trend once the price breaches the trendline barrier of the respective side.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ongoing consolidation in Bitcoin price remained above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level indicating the overall market trend is bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $12.06 Billion, indicating a 30.5% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/n/NLqPuvTW.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> traded at $29035 with an intraday gain of 0.8%. With today’s jump, the coin price rebounded from the triangle pattern’s support trendline indicating the ongoing consolidation will prolong for a few more sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sideways trend will continue until the price breaks either trendline of the chart pattern. As mentioned above, the triangle pattern favors the prior price trend and thus, the bitcoin price is more likely to break the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing above the trendline will signal the resumption of a bullish recovery and offer an entry opportunity to traders. The low of the breakout candle will act as key support to put your stop loss. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/ways-to-earn-passive-income-crypto/">Top 10 Ways To Earn Passive Income From Crypto In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this breakout will create a high possibility for the BTC price to surpass the last swing high resistance of $30788 and hit the $34000 mark registering a growth potential of 15%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While things look bullish for Bitcoin, a breakdown below the support trendline is possible which may undermine the bullish thesis and prolong the correction phase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic support from a 50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> gives an extra edge to Bitcoin buyers.</span></p>
<p><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The falling <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) went sideways above the midline suggesting an additional confirmation for bullish recovery. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $29031</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $31200 and $34600</span></li>

For investors in memecoins particularly PEPE, the listing on Binance that was recorded on Saturday marked a major milestone for the memecoin as well as that of Floki Inu (FLOKI), however, the accompanying price plunge proved otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That PEPE has been a major sensation since it was launched is an understatement. The coin has been shooting toward new price discoveries for over a week, </span><a href="https://coingape.com/pepe-token-jumps-73-to-print-new-ath-what-happens-next/"><span style="font-weight: 400">hitting a series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of new All-Time Highs (ATHs) along the way. As part of its parabolic growth, PEPE swiftly hit the unicorn status with its market capitalization now pegged at $1.17 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the 42nd largest altcoin, PEPE reversed some of its gains following the Binance listing as early buyers and whales dumped their assets to take profit on their holdings. The extreme volatility that trailed the listing forced the largest trading platform to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/binance-suspends-market-order-functions-for-shib-floki-pepe/"><span style="font-weight: 400">suspend the market order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> functions for PEPE, FLOKI and Shiba Inu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the losses accrued as showcased by the more than 56% drop in the trading volume, PEPE price has started regaining its momentum at the time of writing. The token is changing hands at $0.000002991 atop a marginal growth of 1.35% over the past 24 hours.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_147434" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147434" style="width: 1077px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-147434 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/07195504/PEPE-CHART1.jpg" alt="" width="1077" height="634" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-147434" class="wp-caption-text dfdfdf1">Image source: <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/">CoinMarketCap</a></figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>Is the Memecoin Hype Over?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This remains a question on the heart of many observers in the digital currency ecosystem. There are quite a number of whales and influencers who </span><a href="https://coingape.com/missed-pepe-and-shiba-inu-shib-track-these-whales-investing-early-in-projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400">reportedly missed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the PEPE hype and some others who would like to know whether it is too late to buy in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For what it’s worth, PEPE and other memecoins now represent a movement that may continually be recycled. With PEPE now trading on Binance, there may be a significant price correction, however, if the core developers continue to introduce additional utility and unique ecosystem updates like SHIB, the entire hype surrounding the token may just be starting over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The volatility at this time, however, calls for caution and following </span><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-advocate-shares-scary-warning-about-memecoins/"><span style="font-weight: 400">the words of Chris Blec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, this memecoin revolution may come back to hurt some unsuspecting investors.</span></p>

Thus, these two converging levels are gradually squeezing the ADA price indicating the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/education/descending-triangle/">descending triangle pattern</a>. In response to this pattern, the coin price is more likely to break the bottom support and prolong the prevailing downtrend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 38.2% FIB and 100-day EMA accumulated at the $0.38 level create a strong support zone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout from either side of the triangle pattern will determine the future trend of Cardano&#8217;s price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the ADA coin is $189.3 Million, indicating a 13% loss</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/cardano/">Cardano coin price</a> trades at the $0.38 mark and shows a 0.8% intraday gain. The recent reversal from the $0.377 support suggests the altcoin will continue its consolidation phase within the triangle pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if the supply pressure persists, the ADA price is most likely to breach the $0.377 neckline support in the coming week. A daily candle closing below the neckline will provide sellers with a new resistance level to offset the recovery attempt from buyers.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/low-cap-crypto-gems-gunning-to-explode/">Low Cap Crypto Gems Gunning To Explode In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-breakdown level may tumble the Cardano price 24% lower to hit the $0.285 support at 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a less likely yet possible breakout above the overhead trendline will undermine the bearish thesis and trigger a new recovery cycle.</span></p>

The coin price bounced thrice from this support trendline indicating the traders are actively accumulating at this support. Thus, with the current uncertainty in the market, the Ethereum price is likely to revisit this support to replenish bullish momentum. When can you enter?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum Fear and Greed index at 57% reflect a positive sentiment among traders for a further rally </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A retest to the ascending trendline may offer a pullback opportunity to potential buyers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $8.2 Billion, indicating a 24% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 6th, the Ethereum price witnessed a significant outflow which recorded a nearly 4.8% intraday loss. With this price drop, the sellers offset the reached breakout of $1944 creating a situation of fake breakout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This breakdown must have trapped the aggressive buyers as any further fall will likely trigger the stop loss of several long positions. Thus, the potential downfall may tumble the ETH price another 3-5% before hitting the long-coming support trendline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the key support of buyers to maintain the ongoing recovery rally. If the coin sustains above the trendline amid this downfall, the buyers may trigger a fresh rally that could surpass the last swing high of $2130, registering 12-15% growth potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown below the ascending trendline will trigger a significant correction.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Directional Movement Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DI+ above the DI- slope reflects a bullish direction in the Ethereum price. Moreover, an uptick in ADX slope near the 17% mark projects a great position to start a new recovery.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Along with support trendline, the 50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> offers additional support to buyers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/pepe-price-prediction-healthy-retracement-prepare-pepecoin-for-further-rally/">Pepecoin price</a> gained massive popularity with its remarkable recovery this month and reached an All-Time High of $0.00000449. However, after such massive growth, it&#8217;s common for this memecoin to whiteness a correction and stabilizes the rising selling pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the PEPE price tumbled 43% from the ATH and reached the crucial support of 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a>. The 4-hour time frame chart showing several lower price rejection candles at this support indicates buyers are accumulating at this level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buyers manage to sustain above this level, the coin price may resume the bullish recovery and rise 76% higher to rechallenge the ATH barrier.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floki(Floki)</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sideways trend in <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/floki-price-analysis-floki-price-will-witness-60-rally-if-these-conditions-are-met/">Floki price</a> has started to bend upwards and shows the formation of new higher highs and higher lows. This new wave formation indicates the DOW theory which is used to identify a price trend has changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the FLOKI price trades at $0.0000385 and is witnessing a correction phase following the massive rally on May 5th. The bearish pullback is trying to take support at the 61.8% FIB level and may assist buyers to recuperate the bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buying pressure persists, a reversal from the aforementioned level will create a new higher low which will encourage the bullish rally 50% higher to hit the last swing higher of $0.0000579.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After spending two months of sideways trend between $0.0000117 and $0.00000968 levels, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu price</a> has breached the lower support as a signal of downtrend resumption. On May 6th, the coin price gave a decisive breakdown from the $0.00000968 support and flipped into a suitable resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming days, the coin price may retest this breached level to check price sustainability at lower levels and also offer a short-selling opportunity to traders. The potential downfall may tumble the SHIB price 16-18% down to hit the December 2022 bottom support of $0.00000789.</span></p>

The consolidation reflected uncertainty among traders as the prices strictly resonated between the aforementioned levels. However, the crypto market witnessed a sudden sell-off today and assisted sellers to breach the lower support of this range. Here’s how you may trade this breakdown.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish breakdown below the $0.00000975 support accelerates the supply pressure in the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) hint any potential recovery attempt may face multiple resistance in its way</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $180.45 Million, showing a 45% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/RkTBWb41.png" alt="SHIB Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the daily time frame chart, the Shiba Inu price shows a decisive breakdown from $0.00000975 support of the current range formation. This breakdown backed by the above average volume indicated sellers are confident to plunge this memecoin’s market value lower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the pierced support may flip to viable resistance and offer sellers an additional barrier to pressurize buyers. If the daily candle closes below $0.00000975, the interested traders may wait for a bullish pullback to get a better entry opportunity.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> dives deeper into the bearish territory reflecting the increased negative sentiment among traders.</span></p>
<p><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the coin price falling close to the lower band of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger Band indicator</a> reflects momentum selling in the market.</span></p>

Crypto advocate Chris Blec made a tweet about the possible </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1654694693446332418?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400">harm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of investing in memecoins, including PEPE which he hinted could be a potential scam. He explained to his 48k Twitter followers that the memecoin may eventually cost people their lives if they are not careful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Coins like $PEPE don’t happen by accident. Big money, powerful people &amp; careful planning goes into creating these scams. You’re just a pawn in a much bigger game. And games like this have cost many people their lives. Don’t be a fucking idiot,&#8221; he tried to clarify.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Coins like <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PEPE</a> don’t happen by accident.</p>

<p>You’re just a pawn in a much bigger game.</p>
<p>And games like this have cost many people their lives.</p>
<p>Don’t be a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>&mdash; Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1654694693446332418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to his post, a Twitter user asked for the difference between PEPE and traditional finance TradFi and all Blec could itemize is the lack of regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notably, Blec is not the first crypto expert that has warned the public about an impending collapse of the memecoins. Many are still in awe of how the coin is about to reach a $1 billion market capitalization in just a few weeks after it went live.</span></p>
<h2><b>PEPE Outrageous Price Rally Pulls in Traders</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within the last two weeks, PEPE has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/pepe-coin-trading-volume-the-largest-after-btc-and-eth-8m-worth-of-coins-locked/"><span style="font-weight: 400">gained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> up to 500% according to data from CoinGecko and is still shooting further. Only yesterday, the price of FLOKI jumped by 40% and PEPE skyrocketed by 60%. This price rally has caused a high volume of hype around the meme coin causing crypto exchanges like </span><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-exchange-wazirx-follows-binance-to-list-pepe-coindcx-denied-listing/"><span style="font-weight: 400">WazirX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and Binance to list PEPE on their platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Global leading digital asset service provider Binance listed the memecoin together with FLOKI. On the other hand, the Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX wants nothing to do with PEP while citing high-risk factors. Investors seem to be paying more attention to the price rally than the sustainability of the uptrend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Billy Markus, the creator of Dogecoin (DOGE) has not made an attempt to discourage PEPE investors even though he has not bought the much-hyped memecoin. Instead, he congratulated every investor who has made a profit so far from their PEPE trade. Also, he </span><a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/dogecoin-creator-has-this-to-say-to-pepe-investors/"><span style="font-weight: 400">advised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> them to tuck away enough money as such short-term capital gains have tax implications.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 4-hour time frame, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/binance-coin/">Binance coin price</a> gave a decisive breakdown from the support trendline of the triangle pattern. The breakdown backed by above-average volume reflects the sellers’ conviction to prolong the ongoing correction phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the BNB price may show a minor pullback to retest the pierced support as potential resistance. If the coin shows sustainability above the trendline, interested traders may grab a short-sell opportunity. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-breakdown fall may tumble the Binance coin price 10% down to hit the $290 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the $290 mark is still above the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> indicating the overall market trend remains bullish and the long-term traders should not worry.</span></p>

<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With the recent drop, the BNB price plunged below crucial <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a>(20, 50, 100, and 200) giving an additional edge to short sellers.</span></p>

The global crypto market cap fell over 2.60% to $1.18 trillion, with over <strong>$182 million</strong> worth of crypto assets liquidated in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price fell 5% to below $28,500, with the price currently trading at 28,573. In the last 24 hours, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price</a> recorded a low and high of $28,468 and $29,820, respectively.</p>
<p>Ethereum prices also plummeted sharply below the $2,000 level. The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH price</a> fell over 7% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $1,882. The 24-hour low and high are $1,870 and $2,017, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Ethereum Foundation</strong> and Ethereum creator <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong> selling over 15,000 ETH is likely the trigger behind the recent crypto market selloff. CoinGape Media reported that the last major selloff of ETH by Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik Buterin in November 2021 caused the ETH price to fall 40% in 2 months.</p>

<p>Altcoins including PEPE, FLOKI, LUNC, Arbitrum, Litecoin, and Aptos witnessed a major downfall. Massive Profit-booking was recorded in PEPE and FLOKI after both rallied over 50% in the last 24 hours. <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-suspends-market-order-functions-for-shib-floki-pepe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance introduced some restrictions</a> in the market order functions for majorly Shiba Inu (SHIB), FLOKI, and PEPE trading pairs.</p>
<h2>Massive Liquidation In Bitcoin and Ethereum</h2>
<p>Data from <strong>Coinglass</strong> revealed massive longs liquidation of over $182 million today, May 6. Almost <span class="bybt-font0">65k </span>traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours, with the largest single liquidation order on <span class="bybt-font0"><strong>Bitmex’s ETHUSD pair</strong> </span>worth <span class="bybt-font0">$7.70 million.</span></p>

<p>Open interests fell nearly 5% today as traders anticipated a slight correction in the market. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has jumped higher, which indicates a difference in Coinbase Pro price (USD) and Binance price (USDT). However, Bitcoin aSOPR has <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/market-indicator/adjusted-sopr-asopr?window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=log&amp;chartStyle=line" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climbed</a> over 1, indicating that more investors selling at a profit.</p>

<p>It looks like BTC price will fall below the 50-DMA as the pattern shows weakness and high possibility of a correction. Moreover, the 20-DMA is crossing below the 50-DMA. Bitcoin price needs to reclaim $29.2k for upside momentum and hold above the $28.4k level.</p>

This is a well-known bullish reversal pattern that could intensify the underlying buying momentum and initiate a sustained directional uptrend. Amid the recent growth in the crypto market, the sideways trend in FLOKI price formed a new higher low, indicating an early sign of trend reversal. Here’s how interested traders may grab an entry opportunity in this coin for a massive price rally </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The formation of a rounding bottom pattern gives an early sign of a new recovery cycle</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent breakout from $0.000041 resistance set the Floki price for a 61% rise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the Floki coin is $318 Million, indicating a 73% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/5/5xUKINV8.png" alt="Floki Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 5th, the Floki coin price witnessed a massive inflow and recorded a 50% intraday gain. This strong growth is likely to be associated with the Floki coin listing announcement on the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent price rise, the FLOKI coin breached a local resistance of $0.000041 offering a significant launching for buyers to further extend the bullish rally. However, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> is 9.5% down on intraday retest of the pierced resistance as potential support.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the aforementioned support aligned with the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement</a> which created a strong reversal point for Floki price. Interested traders can look for an entry opportunity at $0.000041 mark if the coin price shows sustainability above it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of this pattern, the Floki price may rise 61% just to hit the $0.0000685 neckline resistance. A bullish breakout from the neckline will accelerate the buying pressure. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Moving average convergence/divergence : </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wide gap between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) line after a bullish crossover accentuates the aggressive buying in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Exponential Moving Average:</strong> An uptick in 20-and-50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a> reflects the short-term trend in Floki price is bullish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Glassnode highlighted that across the 4 different Bitcoin Epochs, the relative addition of new non-zero addresses slowed, however, the absolute growth soared to new heights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first Epoch, the addresses on the Bitcoin network were approximately 1 million with a 1.3 million percent growth.

<h2><b>Bitcoin Adoption: the Visible Attraction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In championing the adoption of Bitcoin, there are visible attractions that both retail and institutional investors are always banking on. One of these is the price action of the mega digital currency. Bitcoin has maintained a relatively more resilient price action thus far this year when compared to most of the top investment assets on Wall Street and other stock markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With inflationary fears that has largely fueled the interest rate hikes, Bitcoin has acted as a viable hedge against this inflation with a 72.64% growth in the Year-to-Date (YTD) period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In deciding the factors boosting the adoption of BTC, the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/btc-price-29k-1-year-countdown-bitcoin-halving/"><span style="font-weight: 400">upcoming Halving event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a major consideration as many experts are already projecting a subsequent price upsurge following the event.

<p>Typically, Ethereum Foundation sells small amounts of ETH to manage operations and Vitalik Buterin usually dumps meme coins he received in his wallet for ETH. But this time it&#8217;s different.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik Buterin Transfers Over 15K ETH</h2>
<p>On Friday, Vitalik Buterin related address vitalik.eth <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xedbb0d22f37376b415e449d582a14afd162b92ba801916547834551f499201c8" target="_blank">transferred</a> 200 ETH to crypto exchange Kraken as per PeckShieldAlert. As per Etherscan <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x8ae0231ca03e2808dd78c43d7742b2cd8cf01e72" target="_blank">data</a>, this is not the first time the address transferred ETH to the same Kraken wallet. There are 5 similar transactions to Kraken in the last 2 months.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FvW4GY4acAAJgy-?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>Ethereum Foundation followed suit and transferred 15k ETH to Kraken, as per the transaction <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x22dbf6ddbaf25a394c70cbd937c21b82f57352ea2cf1c849c727a160dc5fa76f" target="_blank">reported</a> by PeckShieldAlert on Saturday, May 6. The large transaction by Ethereum Foundation raised FUD in the crypto community, with many thinking that an ETH price and meme coins crash could be coming.</p>
<p>As per historical data, a large ETH move by the Ethereum Foundation led to a massive fall in ETH prices. The last time 20,000 ETH was <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf22e8254c32866d28f5b69f009d59ca2b45891f05e2a073b94679bd107c828a1" target="_blank">transferred</a> to Kraken on November 12, 2021. After the Ethereum Foundation cash out at $4,722, near ATH, the ETH price fell 40% in 2 months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin has sold several meme coins historically. The coins Vitalik Buterin sold mostly get rekt, similar to last time when shitcoins lost most value after he dumped massive amounts of shitcoins. In March, <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-creator-vitalik-buterin-dumps-multiple-memecoins-is-a-crypto-crash-imminent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik sold</a> 50 billion MOPS for 1.25 ETH, 10 billion CULT for 58 ETH, and 500 trillion SHIK for 380 ETH. In Addition, he sold 3.4M <span class="link-complex-target">BITE</span> for 5.9 <span class="link-complex-target">ETH and transferred <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">214 </span><span class="r-18u37iz">ETH</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> worth $337k to Ethereum Foundation.</span></span></p>

<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/Ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH price</a> jumped 3% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $1,964. The 24-hour low and high are $1,894 and $2,017, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased slightly by 52% in the last 24 hours, indicating an interest among traders.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The BabyDoge team said it has been listening to the concerns of its community and “have come up with an innovative solution to further enhance the security and integrity of our project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It detailed that the 100 quadrillion tokens it wants to burn have been sitting idle since it launched on ETH and that the proposal to burn them off will “reduce potential exploitation risk associated with them.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-burn-rate-plummets-is-shib-allure-fading-away/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Token burns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are not uncommon with memecoins with Shiba Inu notably burning millions of its token on a regular basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Markedly, BabyDoge is keen on providing seamless and cost-effective services to its community. Hence the need to strengthen its project and enhance security. In the end, users can have access to inexpensive transactions on the ecosystem that also offers a higher level of efficiency. </span></p>
<h2><b>BabyDoge Prepares For Official Proposal to DAO</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, the proposal has received 4,812 votes with 96% in favour of a burn and the other 4% requesting that things are left the way they are. Others who have not voted still have about 23 hours to take a stance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While this is an unofficial voting process, the protocol has promised to draft an official proposal for the DAO when the time comes. This time would be after the current proposal records overwhelming support from its community. With the turn of events, it seems like the official proposal will be going out very soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">BabyDoge believes that there is a very high likelihood that this would go down as one of the biggest token burns in history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The burn is currently estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. For this initial phase, BabyDoge is leveraging the ETH blockchain but it would eventually move to BNB Chain depending on its success. Meanwhile, BabyDoge is still in close </span><a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/floki-surpasses-babydoge-bone-up-33/"><span style="font-weight: 400">competition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with FLOKI and Shiba Inu whose burn rate has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-spikes-30000-can-shib-price-make-a-comeback/"><span style="font-weight: 400">jumped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by more than 30,000%.</span></p>

<h2>Coinbase Moving Ahead Of Being Just A Crypto Exchange</h2>
<p>Asheesh Birla, Board Member at Ripple commented on the recent actions taken by the <a href="https://coingape.com/companies/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> lately. He stated that Coinbase is transitioning from a crypto exchange to a crypto enabled banking service.</p>
<p>Birla mentioned that Coinbase has updated its mission in order to build a crypto economy that will be a more fair, efficient, accessible, and transparent financial system for digital assets. However, Coinbase in a blog stated that it is dedicated to partnering with high bar regulators across US and Non US jurisdictions in order to update the financials system. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/?utm_source=menubar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More Ripple News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>

<p>Coinbase recently shared its quarter 1 2023 earnings. As per the data, its revenue on deposits via interest income, custodial fees and blockchain rewards are now making a huge part of its revenues. Birla mentioned that interest generated on the USDC deposits is alone generating $199 million which is 18% of all the Coinbase’s revenue.</p>
<p>This directly depicts that Coinbase revenues are now shifting from consumer to high margin institutional customers. Its institutional trading revenue has increased by 67% over the last quarter. Ripple board member added that the U.S. biggest crypto exchange is benefiting from banking like revenues that are less dependent on the crypto market. </p>
