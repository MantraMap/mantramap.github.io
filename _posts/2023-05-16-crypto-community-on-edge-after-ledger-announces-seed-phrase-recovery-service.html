Users will have to pay a monthly subscription fee and provide a copy of their passport/national identity card to sign up for this service. The crypto community expressed concerns that this update could jeopardize wallet security by exposing private keys to third parties. Crypto proponents also cited Ledger&#8217;s previous data breach from 2020. [&#8230;]
