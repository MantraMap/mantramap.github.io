SBF pleaded not guilty to each of the criminal charges before the U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan which he is currently being held accountable for.</p>
<h2>SBF&#8217;s Trial Set For October</h2>
<p>According to the latest reports, the court has suggested October 2, 2023, as the date for the beginning of the SBF trial. Moreover, the prosecuting attorneys have requested an additional requirement that the disgraced cryptocurrency exchange founder be prohibited from accessing or transferring any assets associated with <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> or <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, as reported earlier on CoinGape, <a href="https://coingape.com/sam-bankman-fried-wants-to-keep-these-people-a-secret/">SBF&#8217;s request to redact the identities</a> of his two bail guarantors was readily accepted by Judge Kaplan.</p>

<p>In what prosecutors have referred to as a fraud of epic proportions, Bankman-Fried is accused of stealing billions of dollars worth of customer deposits from FTX in order to prop up his Alameda Research hedge fund, carry out real estate purchases, <a href="https://coingape.com/sbfs-alameda-research-secretly-financed-the-block-crypto-news-website/">loan out crypto media outlets</a> and make political contributions totaling to millions of dollars.</p>
<h2>The $8 Billion Hole In FTX</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-hearing-ceo-john-ray-claims-embezzlement-root-cause-of-ftx-collapse/">John J. Ray III</a>, the newly appointed CEO of FTX, testified before the House of Financial Services Committee last month, that the exchange had lost close to $8 billion worth of customer funds. And even though, in several interviews with various media outlets last year, Bankman-Fried was seen denying the commingling of funds, later admitted to the fact that FTX did not place enough emphasis on risk management.</p>
<p>Following his initial appearance in <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> federal court on December 22, Bankman-Fried was released on a $250 million bail. The Palo Alto home where he resides with his parents &#8212; who are renowned Stanford University law professors &#8212; was also ordered to remain under house arrest.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, who was claimed to be one of the wealthiest individuals in the crypto-sphere and the increasingly becoming the public face of the crypto industry until the latter half of last year, has seen a remarkable fall from grace as a result of recent events.</p>
<p>If found guilty, Bankman-Fried could be sentenced to 115 years in prison.</p>

Backed by disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/solana-sol/">Solana (SOL) price</a> saw record-breaking depreciation in value in the months leading up to the new year. However, the SOL token has now gained more than 22% in just a couple of days entering into 2023.</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL) Price Jumps On BONK News</h2>
<p>The price of Solana (SOL) hit a new low last week that hadn&#8217;t been witnessed since February 2021. After over nine days of consecutive losses, that pushed the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin&#8217;s</a> price to roughly $8 on Friday, increased by more than 12% in the past twenty-four hours on Tuesday.</p>

<p>BONK, a new <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> with a Japanese guard dog theme, was a major driver behind the price increase of the 15th-ranked cryptocurrency, which also saw a bull run recently of 380% gains since its launch. The doppelganger of a Shiba Inu (SHIB) that operates on the SOL <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/#:~:text=A%20blockchain%20is%20a%20distributed,functions%20to%20become%20a%20chain.">blockchain</a> has caused a major stir and is currently trending on Crypto Twitter.</p>
<h2>BONK&#8217;s Wider Market Acceptance</h2>
<p>As a result, Magic Eden &#8212; the largest <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/">NFT marketplace</a> on the Solana network &#8212; is currently considering integrating BONK in the midst of the mass exodus of builders flocking to the Ethereum (ETH) or Polygon (MATIC) networks. Magic Eden smitten by the latest canine memecoin craze, took to Twitter to ask whether or not they should incorporate the recently created Solana-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s a new year, maybe we should integrate some new cryptocurrencies or chains</p>
<p>Should we start with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BONK</a>? Idk</p>
<p>&mdash; Magic Eden <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1fa84.png" alt="🪄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@MagicEden) <a href="https://twitter.com/MagicEden/status/1610007500928991232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency community as a whole has responded favorably to the sudden surge in popularity of the new memecoin. Additionally, the fact that people can take advantage of free airdrops of the BONK token, provided by a number of well-known crypto celebrities and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFT</a> collectors has added more fuel to the SOL token&#8217;s price.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Found some <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BONK</a> in my burner, who still holds 0 and want some ? <a href="https://t.co/viw3HOzwoR">pic.twitter.com/viw3HOzwoR</a></p>

<h2>BONK Helps Sinking Solana</h2>
<p>Within the last twenty-four hours, the on-chain volumes of Bonk reached more than $19 million. Since it was first issued on December 25, Bonk has been owned by more than 85,000 investors as of Tuesday, giving it a market valuation of roughly $93 million. According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://dune.com/wagg/bonk-stats" rel="nofollow">statistics</a> collected during the past week, users have completed more than 500,000 transactions utilizing bonk tokens.</p>
<p>Moreover, the news of the MEXC <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> listing the Bonk token for trading with a USDT pair on Tuesday, has further ignited the interest of traders and investors alike.</p>
<p>As things stand, the Solana (SOL) price is currently being traded at $13. This represents an increase of 4.84% in the past one hour, in contrast to a whopping 22% during the last 24 hours as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

This famous bearish pattern can be identified as two swing highs(shoulders) covering a higher upswing(head); refer to the chart image. In theory, this pattern displayed a sharp trend reversal, where the higher formation(movement from the left should head) turns to a lower low formation(head to right shoulder). This pattern also displays fixed base support whose bearish breakdown signals the resumption of a bearish rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish breakdown from $0.3 support threatens for 38% drop</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing above $0.41 will offset the bullish thesis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP price is $898.5 Million, indicating a 21% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/c/c1BuRSwZ.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the Ripple(XRP) price traders at the $0.34 mark, currently forming the right shoulder of the mentioned pattern. However, If the selling pressure persists, the downward spiral will continue and plunge the coin price to multi-month support of $0.316-$0.3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aforementioned support is also the neckline of the head and should pattern and has prevented any further losses for XRP price in the last seven months. Moreover, on January 2nd, the daily chart showed a long-lower price rejection candle which indicates the buyers continue to defend this level. </span></p>
<p>Also read: <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-might-not-end-in-settlement-heres-why/">XRP Lawsuit Might Not End In Settlement; Here’s Why</a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, under the influence of the bearish pattern, the XRP price is more likely to break the $0.3 neckline support. This breakdown will accelerate the bearish momentum and prolong the bearish fall to the $0.21 mark. Thus, the interested trades can look for selling opportunities once the price breaks below the $0.3 support.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if XRP price starts to rise again, a bullish breakout from $0.37 resistance will weaken the bearish thesis and provide a long entry opportunity for traders. However, for a safer entry, traders could wait for a breakout of the $0.41 mark too. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Average Directional Movement Index:</strong> the ADX slope rising on every dip in price accentuates the overall trend is bearish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD:</strong> a number of crossovers between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal line show ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market. However, both these slopes are still below the midline, indicating the seller has the upper hand.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP intraday price levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.342</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>

As a result of the occurrence, the values of cryptocurrencies have significantly decreased, which in turn has negatively impacted the value of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/grayscale/">Grayscale&#8217;s Crypto Trusts</a>. The sequence of events caused a tidal wave of capitulation, which has resulted in the premium rate of the fund going down on a continuous decline, eventually resulting in the current discount rate of 60%.</p>
<h2>Grayscale&#8217;s ETHE At 60% Discount</h2>
<p>As of right now, the discount to net asset value (NAV) of one of the trust&#8217;s most well-known funds, the Ethereum Trust (ETHE), has dropped to a record 60%; marking the fund&#8217;s all-time low premium rate since it was first established. After showing signs of progressive improvement throughout the month of September 2022 in the midst of the enthusiasm surrounding the &#8220;Ethereum Merge&#8221; update, the premium rate for ETHE began to drastically decline by the end of October 2022.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the discount on the fund increased by more than 33% in just the final month of 2022 by alone. According to information provided by YCharts, the ETHE discount was somewhere around 45% on the first of December, but it skyrocketed to 59.30% at the end of that month.</p>
<h2>Grayscale&#8217;s Other Crypto Trusts</h2>
<p>It is important to note that Grayscale Investments&#8217; primary offering, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gbtc/">Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)</a>, has also been selling at historic discounts over the past few months. The GBTC discount is currently somewhere around 45%, which is a modest increase from its all-time high of somewhere around 48%.</p>
<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1610273482016694272/photo/1" rel="nofollow">data</a> received, the other funds under Grayscale are also witnessing heavy discounts &#8212; with the Litecoin Trust dropping by 65%, Zcash declining by 47%, and Ethereum Classic&#8217;s staggering depreciation of 77%.</p>

<p>He believes Bank of America might have a trademark dispute with the recent application. The registration may conflict with Bank of America&#8217;s plans to offer crypto services in the future.</p>

<p>Some believe the use of only &#8220;Bitcoin Bank&#8221; will work and block BofA from winning a trademark dispute. Although, the use of phase &#8220;Bank America&#8221; does create an avenue for a valid attempt at infringement.</p>

The technical chart has identified this pattern as the DOGE prices reject from a downsloping trendline(yellow color line) and, on the other hand, maintained fixed neckline support at $0.073-$0.07(off-white range). In theory, the lower low formation in the price action indicates the gradual loss of bullish momentum, which encourage a breakdown from the neckline to bolster further downfall.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dogecoin price is wavering just below a high concentrated resistance zone near $0.073-$0.071.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the resistance trendline will release the Dogecoin price from its ongoing downtrend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $617.8 Million, indicating a 192% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/f/FMQVH5Es.png" alt="Dogecoin Price " width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 28th, Dogecoin gave a massive breakdown from the $0.073 support zone, intensifying ongoing selling pressure. However, with the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the altcoin continues to waver just below the $0.073 mark, testing this level as valid resistance. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This memecoin currently trades at $0.0716 with an intraday gain of 0.28%. Moreover, in the last two days, the daily candles showed higher price rejection at $0.073 resistance, projecting the sellers are defending the new resistance.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This increases the likelihood of the Dogecoin price turning down from the resistance trendline and triggering the next bear cycle. This potential downfall may breach the local support of $0.066 and plunge to the $0.057 accumulation zone, registering a 20% drop.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, the traders looking for a bullish entry opportunity can wait for the DOGE price to break the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI indicator:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> is walking sideways despite a falling price action, indicating the bearish momentum is gradually weakening. This bullish divergence suggests the price may eventually break the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the 50-and-100-day EMAs are on the verge of a bearish crossover offering an additional sell signal for traders. </span></p>

In addition, SBF has requested that the identity of two individuals who will assist him in posting bail be kept under wraps by the judge.</p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s New Request</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, attorneys for Bankman-Fried filed a letter requesting redactions of the identities of the two people who are seeking to sign on as sureties to his bail package. They argued that there is no purpose for public publication of this information and that the names should not be made public.</p>
<p>According to reports, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers wrote that,</p>
<blockquote><p>If the two remaining sureties are publicly identified, they will likely be subjected to probing media scrutiny, and potentially targeted for harassment, despite having no substantive connection to the case,</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the lawyers claimed that the privacy of the sureties and their safety are &#8220;countervailing factors&#8221; that greatly exceed the presumption that the public should have access to the relatively limited material that is at stake.</p>

<h2>SBF&#8217;s Two New Guarantors</h2>
<p>In addition to Bankman-Fried and his parents, the judge requested that the bond be signed by two other people of substantial means, neither of whom can be related to Bankman-Fried. SBF&#8217;s attorneys mentioned in the letter that the two individuals have not yet signed but they expect to do so by the January 5th deadline.</p>
<p>This has led to widespread speculation in the crypto community regarding the identity of the other two individuals. While some believe them to be close employees of SBF from his FTX exchange, others sarcastically link Shark Tank investor <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/kevin-oleary/">Kevin O&#8217;Leary</a> for his public support for the crypto founder.</p>

<p>In December, a <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-founder-sbf-released-on-250-mn-bond-placed-under-house-arrest/">bail package for $250 million was approved for Bankman-Fried</a>, making it one of the highest in the history of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a>. The equity in Bankman-parents&#8217; Fried&#8217;s home in Palo Alto, California, was used to finance the personal recognizance bond that was allowed by the judge.

While the crypto exchange temporarily suspended its LUNC Burn mechanism until March, Binance can offer support to developers building on the Terra Classic <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a>.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Community To Get Support From Binance</h2>
<p>Last week, Binance announced that it will burn 50% of the LUNC spot and margin trading fees instead of 100% and <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-suspends-terra-classic-lunc-burn-lunc-price-falls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspend LUNC burn</a> mechanism until March. However, Binance also <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-to-make-changes-to-the-burning-of-terra-classic-lunc-trading-fees-4769eab576c4479eaa14adc1eb587226" target="_blank" rel="noopener">welcomed</a> developers to apply for the Industry Recovery Initiative (IRI). Developers wanting to continue to build the Terra Classic chain may receive support from Binance as part of the initiative.</p>
<p>In the latest developments, many LUNC developers are planning to apply for Binance&#8217;s initiative and receive funding to build on the Terra Classic chain. It was confirmed by Terra Classic influencers Classy Crypto and DemonMonke777 in a recent AMA.</p>
<p>Classy Crypto in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ClassyCrypto_/status/1610018223650476034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on January 3 revealed that developers are now working to get the Terra Classic chain back to parity and stop LUNC tokens from reminting. Also, there is a possibility of a merger between LUNC and LUNA in the future.</p>
<p>Moreover, the community has passed the <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-lunc-price-soars-5-developments-proposals-burns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crucial Proposal 11168</a>. It will create the “Joint L1 Task Force” developers team led by core developers Zaradar and Edward Kim, which will look over the maintenance and L1 developments on the chain. Tobias &#8220;Zaradar&#8221; Anderson in an <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrpLYR-wpKo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMA</a> with Classy Crypto revealed that many developments are coming on the chain. The community will witness utility coming back on the chain in the next 3 months.</p>
<h2>LUNC Price Shows Upside Momentum</h2>
<p>Terra Classic price continues to show upside momentum, with an increase in trading volumes in the last 24 hours. The LUNC price is currently trading at $0.000157. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000152 and $0.000167, respectively. Thus, the LUNC price has skyrocketed almost 10% from the low, before losing earlier gains.</p>
<p>The LUNC price will face some pressure as this <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-on-chain-data-signals-bullish-scenario-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">week will be crucial</a> for the crypto market. Thus, traders must do research before investing in LUNC.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">&#8220;Yeah, but your size is not size,&#8221; Do Kwon responded, effectively labelling Algod poor. He later added, &#8220;$10 short incoming, everyone take cover.&#8221;</p>

However, <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-up-5-on-chain-data-shows-strong-bull-case-scenario-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price</a> registered a sudden spike of 5% on Tuesday amid building speculation around the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-might-not-end-in-settlement-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no possible settlement in the Ripple lawsuit</a>. On top of that data depicts that crypto whales have moved a heavy amount of XRP tokens in the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Crypto Whales riding XRP price high?</h2>
<p>As per the data provided by WhaleAlert, crypto whales have moved more than 1 billion XRP tokens in the last 24 hours. Around $366 million worth of XRP tokens were moved in multiple transactions.</p>
<p>This <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1609956840523055105" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">single largest transaction</a> recorded by the tracker has been of moving 500 million XRP tokens (approx worth $175.2 million). However, data shows that around $106 million worth of XRP was moved from an unknown wallet to a wallet named Ripple.</p>
<p>While a whale transferred around 40 million XRP (approx worth $14.1 million) to the crypto exchange, Bitstamp in order to book profit amid the price jump. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>XRP price jumped around 5% in the last 24 hours. Ripple’s native token is trading at an average price of $0.35, at the press time. However, its 24 hour trading volume stands at around $1 billion. XRP is still holding a market cap of over $17.4 billion in spite of facing a lawsuit from the US SEC.</p>
<h2>700 Mln XRP locked in Escrow</h2>
<p>However, WhaleAlert also reported that whales locked around 700 million XRP in an escrow account in <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1609957533560569858" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">multiple transactions</a>.

<p>The report, titled &#8220;Travel in 2023: Connecting People, Places, and Planet,&#8221; focuses on the future of tourism. However, it is done by identifying eight sector trends within existing travel themes that will shape the industry.</p>
<h2>Top 5 Travel Trends For 2023</h2>
<h3>NFT Travel</h3>
<p>The travel sector is embracing <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible tokens</a></strong> (NFTs), digital assets that exist on the blockchain. They will be used as keys by early adopters to gain access to physical travel experiences and private spaces in the real world all over the world. The market for luxury travel is also expected to grow significantly for NFTs. They can also be used to raise money and support sustainability projects, further increasing their versatility.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/5-ways-to-spot-fake-nft-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 Ways To Spot Fake NFT Collection</a></strong></p>
<h3>Virtually Enhance Destinations</h3>
<p>Following Covid -19, a lot of travel agencies are being forced to embrace technology in novel and intriguing ways. During the pandemic, the untapped potential of <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/top-5-technologies-that-power-the-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">augmented reality and virtual reality</a></strong> to improve travel experiences has exploded. You can visit the Ajanta medieval caves, take an ice bath in the Ram Sarovar, or shop in the Sikkim markets on almost a single night.</p>
<h3>Electrified Escape</h3>
<p>In 2023, as fuel prices soar and consumer demand for low-carbon activities rises, the electric market will prosper. Following the recent global e-bike boom, electric scooter tours, sleds, boat trips, and safaris are all beginning to be taken. Skyscanner made his e-car rental filter available on their websites this year. However, to make it simple to find electric rental cars, Hertz has put together a guide to 15 all-electric road trips across Europe.</p>
<h3>Rail Revival</h3>
<p>In 2023, convenience, cost, and carbon footprint will all play a role in reviving your love of rail travel. As people attempt to travel in a more environmentally friendly manner, a few private companies are reviving night trains across Europe. A global consortium led by OBB in Austria, Nightjet is one of the most exciting projects. However, the &#8220;new generation sleeper train&#8221; is how Nightjet describes its offering.</p>
<h3>Hutlife</h3>
<p>The desire to commune with nature is a growing trend in travel. Additionally, a growing number of tourists choose rustic cabins and huts over hotels. These tiny retreats draw in an ever-wider range of demographics by capitalizing on the contemporary &#8220;van life&#8221; and aesthetic appeal of small homes.</p>

The week is crucial as traders await US manufacturing PMI data on Tuesday, the latest <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> policy meeting minutes on Wednesday, and the December jobs report on Friday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index (<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DXY</a>) records a 0.63% increase on Tuesday, rising again above 104. Therefore, volatility in the crypto market can be seen this week, which will decide the Bitcoin price&#8217;s direction in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The total crypto market volume increased by <span class="sc-f1e838b2-0 dRLonq">14.02%</span> over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin price will remain under pressure this week, while most of the upside push will come from <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">altcoins</a>.</p>
<h2>On-Chain Data Signal Bullish Scenario For Bitcoin Price</h2>
<p>According to on-chain analysis, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio (30DMA) data on January 2 again generated a signal to buy Bitcoin. This is the fourth time a buy signal has been shown by the metric.</p>
<figure id="attachment_133966" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133966" style="width: 721px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-133966" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03142945/4e8SKMO.webp" alt="Bitcoin on-chain data" width="721" height="312" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-133966" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin &#8211; Taker Buy/Sell Ratio (30DMA).

<p>Taker Buy/Sell Ratio (30DMA) is one of the best metrics for identifying a buying cycle. However, it applies only in a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bull market</a>. In times of instability or bear market, this indicator almost perfectly generates only sell signals. Therefore, one must confirm the buy signals with other short-term on-chain indicators as per trading strategy.</p>
<p>As the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio (30DMA) generated buy signals for Bitcoin four times during the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a>. Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, the Terra-LUNA crisis, and the collapse of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> only negatively impacted the Bitcoin price action in 2022.</p>
<p>However, the 4th buy signal is likely a bullish call as BTC SOPR MA30 data indicates the possibility of BTC price turning bullish in 2023 is quite higher. Investors can take the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/dca-dollar-cost-averaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCA</a> strategy to accumulate Bitcoin at lower levels, as experts believe institutional investors and whales will start a rally anytime.</p>
<h2>Can Bitcoin Turn Bullish Now?</h2>
<p>Popular analyst <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-bottom-approaching-fast-buy-the-dip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael van de Poppe believes</a> Bitcoin price can rally above $17K in the coming days. The BTC price will continue to hold strongly above the crucial $16.5K support level.</p>

<p>As per technical indicators, the BTC price moves in Bollinger Bands Squeeze and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSI</a> is increasing. Thus, the BTC price will continue to move sideways until the squeeze ends.</p>

Macroeconomic developments will continue to shape the crypto economy as well as the overall economy.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The following is a look at three separate events that might have a significant influence on the global economy and the values of equities, precious metals, and crypto assets.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">Inflation</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">In most major economies, inflation is expected to peak. Inflation is a key concern for investors, and it will certainly play a role in US markets in 2023. Rising inflation may make it more difficult for companies to increase sales and revenue. It might also dissuade retail investors from investing in high risk digital assets.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Therefore, investors will be paying careful attention to how inflation impacts the US and global economies.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">Recession</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva recently said in an interview that the new year is going to be &#8220;tougher than the year we leave behind.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color: #252525">She said, &#8220;We expect one-third of the world economy to be in recession. Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color: #252525">As the world&#8217;s three big economies, the US, EU, and China, are all slowing down simultaneously, the markets are facing the threat of a looming recession.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">With aggressive monetary tightening and geopolitical shocks, economic downturns may force crypto companies (or projects) to close their doors or hinder their growth. Fears of a recession have clouded global markets.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">Global Supply Chain Disruptions</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine doesn&#8217;t show any signs of slowing down. Additionally, the COVID-19 situation in China is far from &#8220;under control.&#8221; Both of these situations are straining the already strained global supply chains.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">From the movement of wheat and natural gas to electronics and other commodities, the fragmented global supply chain may lead to high prices for items. If there&#8217;s a continued crisis in the financial market due to this, it may translate into apathy for the crypto industry. And may hamper the growth of the crypto industry.<br style="color: #252525" />
