			            <description><![CDATA[The increased greed in the market is fueled by several factors, including institutional BTC accumulation, two consecutive green quarters, and positive on-chain metrics. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Market sentiment shows that crypto investors have renewed their bullishness and confidence in BTC as the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency continues to flirt with the $31,000 mark.</p>
<p>According to the Fear and Greed Index &#8211; a popular tool used to measure overall sentiment &#8211; greed has taken over the market as investors are getting too comfortable with bitcoin at its current price.</p>
<h2>Greed Takes Over</h2>
<p>The Fear and Greed Index evaluates market sentiment by analyzing key factors, including volatility, market momentum, social media trends, and bitcoin&#8217;s dominance. It uses a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 represents &#8220;Extreme Fear&#8221; and 100 means &#8220;Extreme Greed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past week, the <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">greed index</a> has consistently climbed above 50, reaching a high of 64, coinciding with Bitcoin&#8217;s price surpassing $30,000.</p>
<figure id="attachment_258747" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-258747" style="width: 693px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-258747" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Greed-index-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="431" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Greed-index-300x187.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Greed-index-1024x639.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Greed-index-768x479.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Greed-index-50x31.jpg 50w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Greed-index.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-258747" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Fear and Greed. Source: Alternative.me</figcaption></figure>
<p>The increased greed in the market is fueled by several factors, including institutional BTC accumulation, two consecutive green quarters, and positive on-chain metrics.</p>
<h2>Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation Surges</h2>
<p>One of the key drivers behind the resurgence of greed in the crypto market is the exponential increase in institutional Bitcoin accumulation.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, prominent institutional players, including major financial institutions and corporations, have been actively acquiring bitcoin as part of their investment strategies, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/institutional-bitcoin-btc-accumulation-sees-exponential-increase-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">according</a> to blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.</p>
<p>This wave of institutional adoption validates bitcoin as a store of value while signaling institutional confidence in its long-term potential. The strategic move by institutional investors to accumulate BTC is underpinned by the belief that the crypto asset can act as a hedge against inflation and provide diversification in traditional investment portfolios.</p>
<p>The institutional accumulation has also contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding bitcoin and has drawn the attention of retail investors seeking to capitalize on the growing institutional interest.</p>
<h2>2 Consecutive Green Quarters Ignite Optimism</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent milestone of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-posts-2-consecutive-green-quarters-for-the-first-time-since-2021/" data-wpel-link="internal">posting</a> two consecutive green quarters for the first time since 2021 has further fueled optimism among investors. After a period of market uncertainty and bearish sentiment throughout last year, bitcoin&#8217;s back-to-back positive quarterly performances signify a potential shift in market dynamics.</p>
<p>The consecutive green quarters demonstrate BTC&#8217;s resilience as it navigates through the bear market and emerges stronger. This accomplishment has instilled confidence in investors, signaling a possible reversal in the market trend. The bullish sentiment resulting from the milestone has ignited renewed greed among market participants.</p>
<h2>Investors&#8217; Behavior Points to a Bull Run</h2>
<p>Beyond institutional accumulation and two consecutive positive quarterly performances, on-chain metrics and investor behavior provide further evidence of a potential bull run in the crypto market.</p>
<p>According to Bitfinex&#8217;s latest weekly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/on-chain-metrics-and-investor-behavior-suggest-signs-of-a-bull-run-bitfinex-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">report</a>, on-chain data, such as Bitcoin&#8217;s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) and Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) indicators, show that almost all bitcoin trades have been profitable since the crypto asset broke above $29,500.</p>
<p>Investor behavior also reflects an increasing appetite for risk and the potential for substantial returns. The report noted that traders are confident about their spot position as they are unwilling to sell at a loss.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the crypto community continues to ride the wave of meme coins, a new contender is turning heads – Wall Street Memes ($WSM).</p>
<p>During a massively successful presale that has now raised $12.5m, <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=traders-think-this-new-meme-coin-could-explode-after-raising-12-5m" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> has positioned itself as a token with the potential to erupt.</p>
<p>With an established community and an endearing legacy, Wall Street Memes seeks to leverage the current meme coin craze to its advantage.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Harnesses the Power of Virality &amp; Breaks $12.5m Barrier</h2>
<p>Following its presale launch in late May, Wall Street Memes quickly caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts worldwide – leading to the project recently breaching the $12.5m milestone.</p>
<p>What sets Wall Street Memes apart from the other meme coins that are flooding the space is the project’s impressive pedigree.</p>
<p>The team behind Wall Street Memes is no stranger to the digital space, having successfully launched a popular NFT collection called “<a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall St Bulls</a>” in 2021.</p>
<p>This collection sold all 10,000 pieces in just 32 minutes – raising a whopping $2.5 million for the creators.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258766" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-3.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="301" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-3.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-3-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-3-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Aside from that, Wall Street Memes also harnesses the potential of a community that extends beyond 1.1 million followers across several social media platforms, including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallstbets/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Its internet community is celebrated for engaging and hilarious content surrounding financial markets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the $WSM token was launched to tokenize this movement, fuelling a deeper level of engagement within the community.</p>
<p>Moreover, with high-profile names like Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636924379086077954" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">interacting</a> with Wall Street Memes content, the foundation has already been laid for Tier-1 CEX listings – which are scheduled for once the presale concludes.</p>
<h2>WSM Tokenomics Help Foster a True Community Spirit</h2>
<p>Wall Street Memes’ team has made a bold move in structuring its tokenomics.</p>
<p>Unlike many other meme coin projects, the team has decided not to set aside any <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=traders-think-this-new-meme-coin-could-explode-after-raising-12-5m" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$WSM tokens</a> for themselves.</p>
<p>Instead, they’ve designed a structure where 100% of the token supply, capped at two billion $WSM, is distributed among the community.</p>
<p>This setup will see 50% of the tokens used for the presale, 20% for CEX/DEX liquidity, and the remaining 30% for community rewards.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258765" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-4.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="209" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-4.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-4-300x104.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-4-50x17.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Naturally, this tokenomics structure aligns the developers&#8217; incentives with the $WSM holders, solidifying the project&#8217;s focus on community.</p>
<p>The developers have also initiated a $50,000 airdrop as part of the presale launch celebration, stimulating engagement within the community.</p>
<p>Community members must join the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4E538pzeGX" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> and complete various social media-related tasks to participate in the airdrop.</p>
<p>The prize of $50,000 worth of $WSM will be split among five winners once the presale concludes, providing an exciting opportunity for early adopters to increase their holdings.</p>
<h2>Final Countdown Begins</h2>
<p>With Wall Street Memes&#8217; presale in its final stages, interested investors can buy $WSM tokens for just $0.031 – a discount to the planned exchange listing price.</p>
<p>Given the presale&#8217;s impressive fundraise, it&#8217;s clear that Wall Street Memes has leveraged the meme coin frenzy, but the team isn&#8217;t stopping there.</p>
<p>As the official website notes, Wall Street Memes has set a clear goal to reach a $1 billion market cap.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258764" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-4.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="311" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-4.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-4-300x155.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-4-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Not only that, but the developers plan to foster partnerships with well-known influencers and even launch an exclusive “gated community” for $WSM holders.</p>
<p>Two prominent crypto personalities, <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCryptoJamie" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Crypto Jamie</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aaron_cryptonoob?_t=8dT7rgz3ikE&amp;_r=1" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Aaron CryptoNoob</a>, have also become brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>Excitingly, Wall Street Memes&#8217; team has left the third ambassador role blank, with a message saying &#8220;Coming Soon,&#8221; – leading investors to speculate that another high-profile endorsement could be on the horizon.</p>
<p>The next few months could be pivotal for Wall Street Memes, but with huge YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIq4jd5UlGs&amp;pp=ygUYd2FsbCBzdHJlZXQgbWVtZXMgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CryptoWendy0</a> already taking note, it’s no surprise that many early investors believe $WSM is primed to explode.</p>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=traders-think-this-new-meme-coin-could-explode-after-raising-12-5m" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Visit Wall Street Memes Presale</strong></a></p>
<h2>Thug Life Also Gaining Traction as Investors Seek the Next Big Meme Coin</h2>
<p>Alongside Wall Street Memes, another meme coin has caught the eye of investors – <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357?referrer=traders-think-this-new-meme-coin-could-explode-after-raising-12-5m" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life ($THUG)</a>.</p>
<p>This new meme token has now raised nearly $400,000 via its ongoing presale phase, which indicates growing investor interest.</p>
<p>Driven by the famous “Thug Life” meme, $THUG is already creating ripples in the meme coin space.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258763" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-2.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="337" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-2.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-2-300x168.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-2-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Its appealing tokenomics setup, in which 70% of the $THUG supply is reserved for presale investors, provides a strong incentive for early investment.</p>
<p>Moreover, Thug Life has captured the attention of notable figures in the crypto industry; for example, crypto influencer Michael Wrubel recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR9Tt9Q_Kgk&amp;t=3s&amp;pp=ygUQdGh1ZyBsaWZlIGNyeXB0bw%3D%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">endorsed</a> the token.</p>
<p>Early investors can buy $THUG tokens for just $0.0007 – a price that will be fixed for the duration of the presale.</p>
<p>However, given that the presale has a hard cap of just over $2 million, opportunities to secure $THUG at such a low rate could be limited, so investors are piling in while they can.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin continue to lose momentum, as both are down by over 3% for a second consecutive day.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s endeavor above $31,000 seems to be short-lived, at least for now, as the asset has retraced to just under that level.</p>
<p>Most alts are also slightly in the red on a daily scale, but the weekly charts are a whole different story for assets like COMP, MKR, AAVE, and others.</p>
<h2>BTC Below $31K Again</h2>
<p>Bitcoin went through a highly-volatile trading day last Friday when it <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-buys-more-btc-but-bitcoin-wobbles-around-30k-amid-sec-etf-rejection-rumors-this-weeks-crypto-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">plummeted</a> from over $31,000 to a 10-day low of $29,500 in minutes. This came after a report suggesting that the US SEC deemed the recent spot Bitcoin ETF filings as &#8220;inadequate,&#8221; which was regarded as a sign that the regulator could turn them down again.</p>
<p>However, the bulls intercepted the move and didn&#8217;t allow any further nosedive. BTC went back on the offensive and reclaimed the $30,000 line almost immediately.</p>
<p>The weekend was calm, with the cryptocurrency remaining stuck at around $30,500. Monday didn&#8217;t provide any fireworks, but bitcoin finally initiated a leg-up on Tuesday that <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-taps-31k-on-blackrocks-etf-refiling-aptos-jumps-10-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">drove</a> it to $31,250 for the third time within a week or so.</p>
<p>However, the asset failed to overcome decisively the $31,000 level and currently sits just below it. As such, its market cap has dipped below $600 billion, while its dominance over the alts stands still at 49.6%.</p>

<h2>COMP, MKR, AAVE on the Rise Weekly</h2>
<p>Most altcoins have mimicked BTC&#8217;s 24-hour performance and have turned red. Ethereum and Binance Coin are down by just over 1% to under $1,950 and $245, respectively.</p>
<p>Ripple, Cardano, Polkadot, Polygon, and Avalanche are also in the red. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, which were the top performers last week, charting <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/litecoin-ltc-soars-to-14-month-high-above-100-bitcoin-btc-reclaims-30k-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">14-month peaks</a>, have lost between 3-4% once again. As a result, LTC sits at $105, while BCH is under $275.</p>
<p>On a weekly scale, Compound, Maker, and Aave have taken the main stage, as all three native tokens are up by triple digits. MKR has soared by 46%, COMP by 43%, and AAVE by $30.</p>
<p>Overall, though, the total crypto market cap has declined by just over $10 billion in a day and sits at $1.2 trillion on CMC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Hong Kong is wasting no time since it opened its doors to the crypto industry last month. A recent proposal is for the creation of an HKD stablecoin to compete with USD-denominated ones.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 4, the Vice President of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Cai Wensheng, penned a proposal for an HKD stablecoin. The policy proposal was also made by Wang Yang, Lei Zhibin, and Wen Yizhou but was not endorsed by the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>The academics have a vision for a local currency stablecoin that competes against industry-dominant Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A Proposal for Hong Kong to Issue a Hong Kong Dollar Stablecoin to Compete with USDT/USDC</p>
<p>By Vice President of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Chairman of Meitu</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://t.co/pCTxkqMLM7" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/pCTxkqMLM7</a></p>
<p>— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1676207017705484289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Hong Kong Govt Stablecoin Preferred</h2>
<p>According to Chinese journalist Wu Blockchain, the <a href="https://wublock.substack.com/p/a-proposal-for-hong-kong-to-issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">proposal</a> for the issuance of an HKD stablecoin would help to solidify Hong Kong’s leadership in the blockchain sector.</p>
<p>Other reasons justifying the proposal include propelling the local currency, enhancing transaction efficiency, reducing transaction costs, improving current payment systems, and “further strengthening Hong Kong’s fintech capabilities.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Moreover, the Hong Kong Dollar stablecoin can enhance the efficiency and inclusiveness of Hong Kong’s financial system; its stability, freedom of exchange, high security, openness, and cross-border liquidity can support a wider range of financial innovations.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The proposal noted that the government’s current plan is limited by allowing and encouraging private institutions to issue HKD stablecoins.</p>
<p>“This measure is too conservative,” they said, because it doesn’t align with the government’s ambitions to promote the digital economy.</p>
<p>Therefore, the academics suggest the government issues a stablecoin called HKDG backed by Hong Kong’s foreign exchange reserves which were around US$430 billion as of March 2023.</p>
<p>A local stablecoin would also help with de-dollarization, they said.</p>
<p>However, any central bank-issued asset would be highly controlled and potentially used as a surveillance tool as it is in <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/china-will-dominate-global-digital-finance-warns-coinbase-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal">China</a>, which has oversight over Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Hong Kong launched new regulations for virtual asset service providers last month and is now working on establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins.</p>
<h2>Asia Rushing to Regulate</h2>
<p>Hong Kong is currently leading the way on crypto regulations in the region, but other Asian countries are catching up.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/japan-eases-crypto-tax-requirements-to-entice-fintech-companies/" data-wpel-link="internal">Japan</a> has ramped up its crypto regulations and KYC policies as it competes to become a regional digital asset hub.</p>
<p>South Korea passed the Virtual Asset User Protection Act last week, and Singapore’s central bank has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/singapore-requires-crypto-companies-to-hold-customer-funds-in-a-trust-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">proposed</a> new crypto exchange rules to keep customer assets in trust.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Creditors of bankrupt crypto lending platform Voyager Digital will pay more than $5 million for the third interim fee period, which ended in mid-May.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In total, McDermott Will &amp; Emery has charged the Voyager creditors’ group roughly $16.5 million for its services for less than a year.</span></p>
<h2>Legal Expenses</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">McDermott Will &amp; Emery, the law firm that represents the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the bankruptcy case of cryptocurrency platform Voyager Digital Holding Inc., has billed the creditors’ group $5.17 million for the third interim fee period of 1 March 2023 and 18 May 2023. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For the entire fee period from 22 July 2022 to 18 May 2023, the law firm has <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175307042380000000001.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">billed</a> the creditors’ group $16.48 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Initially, $11.2 million was earmarked to be paid to the law firm for its services. So far, the creditors’ group has paid out $8.9 million. A big part of the bill &#8211; $1 million &#8211; accrued on planning and disclosure settlement. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Discussing sale options, meeting buyers, and examining objections were significant in this part of the work. And it mostly involved Voyager’s sale to FTX.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Failed Deals </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After filing for bankruptcy, Voyager Digital was close to being acquired twice. In October, FTX won the bid to buy it for $1.4 billion, piping Binance in the race. However, the creditors opposed the deal as it included a clause that provided <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/creditors-oppose-immunity-from-future-bankruptcy-lawsuits-plans-for-voyager-execs/" data-wpel-link="internal">immunity</a>, or “broad releases,” from future bankruptcy lawsuits for top Voyager executives. Subsequently, FTX landed in a liquidity crisis leading it to file for bankruptcy.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After suffering huge losses due to its exposure to Singapore-headquartered hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Voyager Digital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In April, Binance.US <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-us-pulls-out-of-1-billion-asset-purchase-deal-with-voyager/" data-wpel-link="internal">pulled out</a> of a $ 1-billion deal to purchase Voyager’s assets following issues with local regulators. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“While our hope throughout this process was to help Voyager’s customers access their crypto in kind, the hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States has introduced an unpredictable operating environment impacting the entire American business community,” Binance’s US affiliate said in a statement. </span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[TON users will able to retain the ability to send messages via the decentralized blockchain in an event of "apocalypse," according to a core dev. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The TON Foundation &#8211; the non-profit association behind The Open Network (TON) &#8211; announced the integration of messenger encryption on the network. The move aims to enhance user privacy by deploying necessary safeguards in a text sent with a transaction.</p>
<p>The new feature uses end-to-end encryption. This essentially guarantees that only the sender and recipient are able to view the message, thereby improving levels of security for TON&#8217;s user base.</p>
<h2>Enhancing User Privacy</h2>
<p>According to the official update shared with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the network fee for delivering an encrypted message via TON is around 0.006 Toncoin (TON) per transaction. The low price is expected to make the service accessible all across the chain&#8217;s increasing user base.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest addition, TON Foundation&#8217;s core developer Anatoly Makosov said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now this popular feature &#8211; which is not available on most other blockchains &#8211; is available with full encryption. Even in the event of an apocalypse and the failure of conventional messenger servers, you will retain the ability to send messages via the decentralized TON blockchain. Rest assured that these messages will be reliably delivered and safeguarded through encryption.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Several crypto wallets, as well as standard web and desktop wallets (Windows, MacOS, Linux), have already added support for the encryption feature, the statement by the foundation revealed. Meanwhile, the encryption for messages will be available in upcoming updates for TON mobile wallets and the Tonkeeper wallet.</p>
<h2>TON&#8217;s Evolution</h2>
<p>TON &#8211; which happens to be a layer-1 blockchain previously created by Telegram &#8211; had a much turbulent start. The project has been run as a community-led, open-source project after Telegram&#8217;s abandonment a few years back. Since then, the TON Foundation has managed to ink several partnerships.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/telegram-to-receive-10m-for-ton-blockchain-effort/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">partnership</a> with DWF Labs, the blockchain industry market maker invested $10 million towards TON&#8217;s development last November.</p>
<p>DWF Labs is reportedly slated to participate in an estimated 50 seed investment rounds scheduled over a few months. The focus of the funding rounds will be to accelerate the scaling of the TON ecosystem as well as its associated projects.</p>
<p>More recently, TON <a href="https://twitter.com/ton_blockchain/status/1660652193123389443" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">unveiled</a> a $25 million fund dubbed &#8220;TON Accelerator Program,&#8221; which aims to invest between $50,000 and $250,000 per project and be accompanied by partnerships and mentorships from TON&#8217;s staff.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[There are two main avenues to get a Bitcoin spot ETF through the SEC - but neither may be likely to work. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fate of Bitcoin’s price throughout the rest of the year largely lies in the answer to one question: Will a Bitcoin spot ETF be approved in the United States?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Joe Carlasare – a commercial litigator supporting Bitcoin – tweeted on Monday that he gives such a product a 30-40% chance of launching inside of a year. He later spoke with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CryptoPotato</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to explain how he arrived at those numbers. </span></p>
<h2>The Trouble With Grayscale’s Lawsuit</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Carlasare, the market’s best bet at launching a spot ETF remains with Grayscale’s lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the owners of the world’s largest Bitcoin fund, Grayscale sued the regulator last year for denying its ETF application in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner, despite approving multiple similar products in the form of Bitcoin futures ETFs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The case went to its first oral hearing in March, during which judges seemed more sympathetic to Grayscale’s arguments than the SEC’s. This spurred certain analysts including Bloomberg’s Elliot Z. Stein to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-has-70-odds-of-winning-sec-lawsuit-bloomberg-analyst/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">assign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> 70% odds to Grayscale’s victory, thus boosting the odds of a spot ETF approval by the end of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Carlasare, however, refuses to be so optimistic – especially as a Grayscale victory won’t necessarily lead to a spot ETF.<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">For what seems like the 100th time, my personal view is that the probability of success in approving a spot bitcoin ETF in the near term (inside of a year) is still 30-40% —- which I consider to be fairly good odds.</p>
<p>I strongly reject the view that approval is highly probable… <a href="https://t.co/fAuNJ9pkhh" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/fAuNJ9pkhh</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Joe Carlasare (@JoeCarlasare) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeCarlasare/status/1675975751630290944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The hard part about handicapping the Grayscale v SEC suit is that a “win” may just mean the court of appeals directs the SEC to revisit their decision,” explained the lawyer to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CryptoPotato</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> via DM. “In other words, the Court could just send the case back for further proceeding and assessment in front of the SEC .”</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>BlackRock’s SSA With Coinbase</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A review by the SEC has inevitably meant rejection for every applicant with a similar product thus far. Nevertheless, the market is optimistic that a filing last month from BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager – can get through, given the firm’s phenomenal </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrocks-etf-success-rate-with-the-sec-is-575-to-1-what-about-its-bitcoin-application/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">success rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> against the SEC with past applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The SEC called BlackRock and Fidelity’s filings “</span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dumps-below-30k-as-sec-warns-that-recent-btc-spot-etf-filings-are-inadequate-wsj/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">inadequate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">” last Friday for failing to share a specific spot Bitcoin exchange with which their respective exchanges, NASDAQ and CBOE, would form a surveillance sharing agreement (SSA). Both firms have already refiled, clarifying that their planned SSA will be with </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-stock-surges-12-as-blackrock-names-it-as-surveillance-partner/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Coinbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Coinbase is the largest Bitcoin exchange in the United States, Carlasare fears the platform doesn’t represent a market of “sufficient size,” as the SEC requests. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sufficient size is somewhat ambiguous, but they have said it has to be a market large enough so that a person or firm attempting to manipulate the Bitcoin spot market would need to necessarily trade on that platform,” he explained. “If you apply that to the SSA with Coinbase, one can conclude that’s not going to satisfy [the] SEC, especially where the majority of spot trading volume is outside the U.S.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, Carlasare gives Grayscale 50% odds of victory against the SEC in its lawsuit, and Coinbase 40% odds of being the “secret sauce” needed to get BlackRock’s ETF approved. He considers both sets of odds “optimistic.”</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The current amount held by LTHs is just 20,000 BTC shy of the all-time high of 14.49 million.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to data provided by Glassnode, long-term holders currently hold almost 14.5M bitcoin (BTC). LTHs have been on a gradual accumulation spree in the past year and a half despite the prolonged bear market. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has recently revealed that institutional investors (hedge funds, pension funds, commercial banks, insurance companies, and more) have also shown an increasing appetite for holding the primary cryptocurrency in the long run.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So Close to the ATH</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Glassnode&#8217;s figures </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1675842010261979137" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">showed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that BTC investors willing to hold the asset for the long term have purchased a significant amount between April and early July 2023. The largest crypto asset has performed quite well during those months, as it recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-posts-2-consecutive-green-quarters-for-the-first-time-since-2021/" data-wpel-link="internal">closed</a> its second consecutive quarter in the green for the first time since 2021.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Long-term holders also showed rising interest in BTC between September 2022 and the end of the year. Moreover, their accumulation efforts continued even during<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal"> the FTX meltdown</a> in November, which shook the entire crypto industry to its core. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In fact, other market participants, such as those holding less than 1 BTC (described as &#8220;shrimps&#8221;) and those with no more than 10 BTC (&#8220;crabs&#8221;), also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/massive-spike-in-bitcoin-accumulation-from-retail-investors-after-ftx-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">bought</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> significant amounts of bitcoin shortly after the collapse of the once-prominent cryptocurrency exchange. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Overall, long-term holders have amassed a total of 1.01M BTC over the past 602 days and now possess 14.47M BTC (around 75% of the circulating supply). The figure is just 20K BTC less than the all-time high.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth mentioning that long-term holders were even more aggressive during the bull run in 2021. They accumulated over 2.4M BTC between April and November 2021, when bitcoin&#8217;s USD valuation was considerably higher than now, peaking at almost $70,000.<br />

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Institutional Investors Are Also Flocking</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/institutional-bitcoin-btc-accumulation-sees-exponential-increase-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> by CryptoQuant, the institutional accumulation of bitcoin has been on the rise, too. The analytics company further outlined that investment firms, hedge funds, private funds, and others seek to join the ecosystem for the long run:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Analyzing the holdings of these funds provides valuable insights into the market dynamics and investor sentiment…Monitoring fund holdings not only provides an understanding of the market sentiment but also highlights the confidence institutional investors have in bitcoin as a long-term asset.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One reason behind that enthusiasm could be the long list of financial giants which recently filed to launch a spot BTC ETF in the States. The spree was started by the world&#8217;s largest asset manager &#8211; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">BlackRock</a>. Fidelity Digital Assets, Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and more followed suit a few days later, infusing optimism and hope in the entire crypto sector.</span></p>
