Let's take a look at who's involved, and what they're each bringing to the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Leading the pack is the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, which was hired as counsel. Along with them, the administrators have also retained Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan and Landis Rath &amp; Cobb as special counsel for the proceedings. Meanwhile, consultancy firm AlixPartners was brought in to conduct forensic analysis on DeFi products and tokens that were in FTX's possession.<p></p><p>On the financial front, Alvarez &amp; Marsal and Perella Weinberg Partners were tasked with sorting through FTX's accounting records and determining which assets it could sell. According to court filings, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell billed $16.8 million for January, while Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan billed $1.4 million, and Landis Rath &amp; Cobb billed $663,995. Collectively, the three firms have over 180 lawyers assigned to the case and over 50 non-lawyer staff, such as paralegals.</p><p>What's more, court filings show that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lawyers and staff billed a total of 14,569 hours for January. The largest project that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell worked on was discovery, followed by asset disposition and asset analysis and recovery.</p><p>Interestingly, the U.S. Department of Justice initially objected to FTX hiring Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, citing potential conflicts of interest. Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's founder, also objected to the bankruptcy administrators hiring the firm, claiming that the law firm's staff had pressured him into filing for bankruptcy in November. However, in late January, a Delaware bankruptcy court judge approved the firm to continue representing FTX.</p><p>In early February, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell submitted a bill for $7.5 million for the first 19 days of bankruptcy work after FTX filed in November. The majority of billed time for Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan was spent on Asset Analysis and Recovery as well as Avoidance Action â€“ legalese for attempts to undo certain transactions that the debtor engaged in before bankruptcy. As for Landis Rath &amp; Cobb, a significant amount of time was billed for hearings, litigation, and asset disposition.</p><p>But that's not all. AlixPartners billed $2.1 million for 2,454 hours of work. Investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners billed $450,000 (its monthly fee), and court documents show that it spent a significant amount of time on developing a restructuring strategy, as well as correspondence with third parties.</p><p>According to its billing breakdown, the bank spent a large amount of time working on the sale of FTX assets LedgerX and FTX Japan. In January, a bankruptcy judge gave the sale the green light to create liquidity to pay back creditors.</p><p>Last but not least, Alvarez &amp; Marsal billed $12.3 million, the second-largest charge for the month, behind Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. Some of the largest items it billed for were Avoidance Actions, at 3,370 hours, financial analysis, at 1,168 hours, and accounting at 1,106 hours.</p><p>In November, shortly after FTX declared bankruptcy, interim CEO John J. Ray III said that the exchange had a "complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information." Ray, who also oversaw the liquidation of Enron and Nortel Networks when they collapsed, called the FTX situation "unprecedented".<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">-------<br /></span></span><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: red; font-weight: bolder;">Author:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #333333;">Mark Pippen<br /></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;"><span style="color: #0b5394;">London News Desk&nbsp;<br /></span></span></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;"><a href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/"><span style="color: #444444;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></span></span></i></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
