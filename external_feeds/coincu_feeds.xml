<p>The bank, which is expected to open by the end of the year, will offer a suite of digital banking services, including digital asset trading, custody, and management. The Group has indicated that it aims to attract a global client base.</p>



<p>The Central Bank of Bahrain has granted the bank &#8220;in principle approval,&#8221; pending the fulfillment of all requirements, according to Bloomberg. The approval represents a significant milestone in the Group&#8217;s plans to establish a foothold in the region&#8217;s burgeoning digital banking sector.</p>

<p>Whampoa Group is associated with two prominent Singaporean Lee families, including Amy Lee, niece of Singaporean statesman Lee Kuan Yew, and Lee Han Shih of Singaporean multimedia conglomerate Potato Productions. The Group&#8217;s LinkedIn page reveals that its digital arm, Whampoa Digital, was founded in 2021. The company has been involved in several high-profile investment initiatives, including a $500 million fund created by Binance Labs, the cryptocurrency exchange&#8217;s venture capital arm, in June 2022. In September of the same year, it launched a $100 million venture capital fund to support Web3 startups. It is also an investor in ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.</p>



<p>The Middle East and North Africa region was identified as the world&#8217;s fastest-growing crypto market in a Chainalysis report released in October. Whampoa Group CEO Shawn Chan cited the kingdom&#8217;s solid reputation in the financial services sector, transparent regulatory framework, and ongoing pledge to collaborate and innovate as key reasons for launching the initiative in Bahrain. The move is part of the Group&#8217;s broader strategy to expand its digital banking footprint in the region.</p>



<p>Binance received a license to operate in Bahrain in March 2022, and local payment platform EazyPay partnered with Binance Pay to enable the use of crypto at more than 5,000 points of sale in the country in October. Bahrain is also home to CoinMENA, a Shariah-compliant cryptocurrency exchange, creating a favorable environment for digital banking and payment solutions.</p>

<p>On May 17, 2023, a lawsuit was filed against former Sam Bankman-Fried and other top FTX insiders concerning the Embed acquisition. On the same day, a separate lawsuit was filed seeking to claw back funds from Embed’s CEO Michael Giles and its shareholders, accusing FTX of paying a “wildly inflated” price of $220 million for the stock-trading platform.</p>



<p>Court documents filed in relation to the case provide a number of insights into the acquisition process and the concerns of some Embed employees. For instance, Embed’s Chief Technology Officer Laurence Beal expressed shock at the amount paid by FTX during a short meeting with Giles. In correspondence with another senior employee at Embed, Beal described due diligence process with a cowboy emoji. This suggests that there were concerns around the acquisition process and whether sufficient checks were carried out.</p>



<p>As part of the acquisition, FTX also paid Embed employees a total of $70 million in retention bonuses. The majority of that sum — $55 million — was paid to Giles, who later became concerned about how he would justify this amount to other employees. Between the day that Giles signed the acquisition agreement on June 10, 2022, and the closing of the acquisition on September 30, 2022, he was being paid a staggering $490,000 each day, assuming that he worked seven days every week. He was also awarded an additional $103 million when the deal closed, due to his standing as Embed’s largest shareholder.</p>

<p>This amount stands in stark contrast to Giles’ normal salary of $12,500 per month as Embed’s CEO. Despite a number of Embed employees being awarded retention payment agreements, Giles was the only one who was paid his full retention bonus on the closing date. The other employees were obligated to remain at Embed for two years if they wished to receive their full bonuses.</p>



<p>As a result of these disproportionate payouts to Embed insiders, FTX is now seeking to claw back $236.8 million from Giles and Embed executives as well as an additional $6.9 million from Embed’s smaller shareholders. In addition to this, lawyers have accused FTX insiders of taking “advantage of the FTX Group’s lack of controls and recordkeeping to perpetrate a massive fraud” by using misallocated funds to facilitate the purchase of Embed, while being fully aware that the company was insolvent when finalizing the deal.</p>



<p>FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, 2022. The firms’ new leadership — headed by bankruptcy attorney John Ray III — has been focused on clawing back funds to repay customers and creditors. More recently, FTX lawyers have considered a possible reboot of the exchange.</p>

<p>According to Saylor, developing applications based on the functionality of Bitcoin can also promote general Bitcoin adoption among individuals, companies, and governments.</p>



<p>Saylor did not specify which use cases MicroStrategy could investigate, but he noted that the ability to transfer data onto the Bitcoin blockchain has many potential uses beyond mere transactions.</p>

<p>Often used to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin, Ordinals launched in January 2019, and the protocol &#8211; although not fully adopted by the Bitcoin community &#8211; has created a new wave of experimentation with the oldest coin of cryptocurrencies. And since then, thousands of other so-called BRC-20 tokens have been created.</p>



<p>Despite mixed opinions from experts that this wave can deviate from Bitcoin&#8217;s original goal and cause network congestion causing gas fees to skyrocket, there is no denying the huge attraction from the community to BRC- 20, although most tokens currently are memecoins.</p>



<p>Many people still believe that Ordinals/BRC-20 will be the driving force to &#8220;revive&#8221; the world&#8217;s oldest, somewhat dull blockchain. The living proof is that the rise of Pepecoin is taking the market by storm, and the market has grown by 7000% since its launch on April 16.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cuscal, the third-party payments provider for Binance Australia, suggests a connection between &#8220;scams and fraud&#8221; and crypto activity, prompting questions about why it stopped supporting Binance Australia on May 18.</em></li>



<li><em>Cuscal said it was committed to identifying and implementing detection services to protect clients from financial crimes.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance Australia&#8217;s Australian dollar services were suspended, but Cuscal declined to comment on Binance Australia specifically or why it instructed its partner payments firm Zepto to &#8220;offboard&#8221; the exchange.</em></li>

<p>The payments provider did not specifically mention Binance Australia or any other crypto exchanges in its statement but did mention that it&#8217;s committed to identifying and implementing detection services for its clients across the Australian payments system.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>While Cuscal declined to elaborate on why it pulled support for Binance Australia specifically, it did mention that it has, and will continue to, terminate any clients or their customers and/or merchants that fail to meet its onboarding and compliance requirements. This decision comes in the wake of media attention on the impact of scams and fraud in Australia, with particular focus on account fraud, ID takeover, and crypto activity.</p>



<p>Binance Australia, on the other hand, said its Australian dollar services were suspended with immediate effect on May 18, citing a decision made by its third-party payment service provider. The Sydney-based B2B financial services firm, however, reassured Cointelegraph that it&#8217;s focused on supporting the financial industry in protecting Australians from financial crimes and scams.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/filecoin-foundation-rejects-secs-classification-of-fil-as-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoSlate</a>, the Filecoin Foundation has refuted the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) assertion that its FIL tokens are securities in a statement.</strong></h5>

<p>The Filecoin Foundation describes its blockchain network as a &#8220;decentralized peer-to-peer network for storing files&#8221; and emphasizes that FIL is not a security.</p>



<p>&#8220;Over the last decade, thousands of people worldwide have contributed to this open-source project to create a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity&#8217;s most important information. That includes hundreds of organizations and teams building on the network, thousands of storage providers, and 13,000 Github contributors, building a foundational layer for the next generation of the web.&#8221; The Foundation said.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Grayscale revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked it to withdraw its application to launch a Filecoin trust product (FIL). Grayscale said in a statement that it received comments from the SEC stating that the FIL &#8220;meets the definition of a security.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the organization <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188212-us-sec-deems-filecoin-a-security-grayscale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disagrees</a> with the opinion of the SEC staff and does not believe that the FIL is a security under federal securities laws. Grayscale intends to respond promptly to SEC staff to explain the legal basis of the company&#8217;s position.</p>

<p>Grayscale cannot predict whether or not SEC staff will be convinced that their position is correct, and if not. Suppose the SEC employee disagrees with Grayscale&#8217;s position. In that case, Grayscale may need to seek alternative arrangements allowing the Trust to register under the Investment Companies Act of 1940 or consider dissolution.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Meta executives have announced that a new round of mass layoffs will begin next week.</em></li>



<li><em>In March of this year, Zuckerberg said that the company planned to cut 10,000 jobs by the end of May, and the company cut 4,000 jobs last month.</em></li>



<li><em>The layoffs due to massive hiring during the boom period are still happening to cut costs even though the loss-making Metaverse division is still focused on growth.</em></li>

<p>The layoffs will affect Meta&#8217;s business units, potentially affecting thousands of employees. Although the company&#8217;s executives did not confirm the specific size of the layoffs, Zuckerberg said in March of this year that the company planned to cut 10,000 jobs by the end of May and it had cut 4,000 jobs last month.</p>



<p>The afternoon before layoffs occur, the head of human resources at Meta will post a note to employees with details on when the layoff process begins and which teams will be affected. Affected employees will then be notified, followed by unaffected employees. The company will require all employees &#8220;whose work allows&#8221; to work from home.</p>



<p>Downsizing is one of the clearest examples of how big tech companies are due to over-hiring during the pandemic combined with massive changes in the tech industry at large. It is tightening its belts after nearly two decades of relentless growth.</p>



<p>Metaverse, a technology once famous when CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisioned a future where billions of people would live, work and play in the digital world, has almost &#8220;died&#8221; after being abandoned by the business world.</p>

<p>In October 2021, Facebook changed its name to Meta and turned to building virtual universes. After a well-known debut, the metaverse immediately became a craze for Wall Street investors. However, the hype couldn&#8217;t save the lack of a consistent vision for the final product that led to the demise of the virtual world universe.</p>



<p>In the context that the technology world is moving to a new and more potential trend like AI, the fate of the metaverse is already predetermined.</p>



<p>Recent comments by Mark Zuckerberg and company&#8217;s management show that the company focuses on AI (artificial intelligence) and no longer prioritizes the metaverse. Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Andrew Bosworth said the company focuses most of its time on AI. Facebook&#8217;s parent company plans to launch an AI ad-generating tool later this year.</p>



<p>However, on April 26, Mark Zuckerberg denied &#8220;abandoning&#8221; the metaverse to focus on developing AI. He said Meta has been developing both areas for many years now and will continue to focus on both.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s virtual reality projects division reported an operating <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184215-meta-loss-3-9b-after-pumping-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loss of $3.9 billion</a> for the first quarter of 2023. This is slightly lower than its $4.3 billion loss in the previous quarter.</p>

<p>The initial money will assist Azteco in its objective to create a solution that promotes financial inclusion and long-term stability to billions of individuals who confront untrustworthy or fluctuating economic situations. The funds will be used to develop new products and grow into the European and South American markets.</p>



<p>Consumers in cash-centric communities may access the asset by buying vouchers, and the firm is paid a fee for each transaction. Additionally, many users are unfamiliar with the complexity of crypto exchanges and Web3 wallets. For them, vouchers are significantly more accessible, familiar, and easy.</p>



<p>Azteco co-founder Paul Ferguson stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;This funding will fuel our market activation and product refinement efforts, enabling us to reach consumers more effectively, to develop deeply intuitive products and empower individuals worldwide to participate in global commerce regardless of their financial or technical experience level.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Azteco, founded in 2014 by Paul Ferguson, is a supplier of a voucher system that enables customers to store, spend, and distribute small amounts of Bitcoin via a worldwide network based on trust and local relationships.</p>



<p>The solution was developed in response to the discovery that over 2 billion individuals globally own smartphones but lack access to conventional banking services. For these individuals, bitcoin offers a low-cost, safe, and flexible alternative to conventional banking that eliminates payer fraud and enables the unbanked population to hold money, make transactions, and obtain credit without the need for a typical bank account.</p>



<p>Azteco Vouchers, which are equivalent to the traditional paper coupons provided by mobile phone networks, may be purchased by users. These are redeemable directly on users&#8217; mobile phones, similar to how top-up coupons function to add call time to Pay-as-You-Go mobile phones.</p>



<p>Azteco intends to expand beyond the vouchers. In the next months, the business intends to streamline the process of purchasing Bitcoin online by eliminating the need for customers to register accounts or go through a lengthy Verification procedure. The present deal values the firm at $84 million pre-money. For a firm that is just a year old, this demonstrates that investors are confident in Azteco&#8217;s growth potential.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Nevin Shetty, a former CFO for a Seattle company, was charged with wire fraud in the United States District Court in Seattle.</em></li>



<li><em>Shetty is accused of diverting nearly $35 million from the startup&#8217;s coffers to a cryptocurrency network under his own control, according to the indictment.</em></li>



<li><em>Shetty faces a potential sentence of 20 years in jail if convicted of wire fraud.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a federal indictment <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/former-company-chief-financial-officer-indicted-using-35-million-company-cash-invest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handed</a> by a grand jury on Wednesday, the former chief financial officer of a Seattle-based firm stole $35 million of his employer&#8217;s money without authorization and lost it by trading in bitcoin before the crypto market fell last year.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-905.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="720" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-905.png" alt="Former CFO Of Seattle Uses $35 Million To Invest In Crypto Leading To Losses" class="wp-image-188493" title="Former CFO Of Seattle Uses $35 Million To Invest In Crypto Leading To Losses 32"></a></figure></div>


<p>Nevin Shetty, 39, was appointed as CFO of fabric, a company that creates software systems for retail commerce, in March 2021.</p>



<p>Once the employer told him that he was being let go due to work performance issues, he discreetly stole the money and moved it to HighTower Treasury, a crypto platform he operated as a side business, according to the indictment.</p>



<p>Shetty reportedly moved a considerable sum of $35,000,100 from his employers to an account related to HighTower without the knowledge of any other employees inside the organization between April 1 and April 12, 2022.</p>



<p>The purported goal of this transaction was for HighTower to deploy the cash to investments in the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.</p>



<p>His plan was to pay the firm 6% interest while keeping any earnings beyond that, but the $35 million investment quickly became nearly worthless, according to a press release by the US Attorney&#8217;s Office in Seattle.</p>



<p>When the startup discovered the embezzlement, it immediately reported it to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which launched an inquiry into the case. Shetty faces a potential sentence of 20 years in jail if convicted of wire fraud. He is scheduled to appear in court on May 25, 2023.</p>



<p>Prosecutors said that as the firm obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in startup investment, it developed a cautious approach to handling that money – a strategy that Shetty assisted in developing.</p>

<p>The developers behind the wallet have been working tirelessly to deliver a more user-friendly and efficient experience for Bitcoin users, and this release is a major milestone in their journey.</p>



<p>One of the most notable features of the new release is the integration with MoonPay, which allows users to purchase BTC directly from the wallet. This feature is particularly useful for those who are new to the world of Bitcoin and may not have a lot of experience with buying and selling cryptocurrencies. With the integration of MoonPay, users can now buy BTC with just a few clicks, making it easier than ever before to get started with Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Another important change in this version of the wallet is the disabling of RBF (Replace-by-Fee), which will prevent accidental wrong spending. RBF is a feature that allows users to replace an unconfirmed transaction with a new one that has a higher fee. However, this feature can sometimes lead to confusion, especially for users who are new to Bitcoin. By disabling RBF, the UniSat team has made it easier for users to avoid making accidental mistakes with their transactions.</p>

<p>The updated wallet also now displays the output value of the inscription by default, which makes it easier to keep track of your transactions. This feature is particularly useful for users who want to monitor their spending and keep accurate records of their transactions. Additionally, users can now view their transaction history via mempool.space, which provides valuable insights into their spending patterns.</p>



<p>Overall, the Bitcoin Inscription <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186702-unisat-removed-the-access-points/">UniSat Wallet</a> v1.1.20 release is a major milestone for the UniSat team.
