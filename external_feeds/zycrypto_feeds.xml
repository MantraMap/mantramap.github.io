<p>Luke Dashrj, one of the longest contributing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-recorded-338-more-transactions-despite-bitcoins-lead-in-search-interest-in-2022/">Bitcoin</a> Core developers, claims to have lost well over 200 BTC (roughly $3.34 million) this past weekend after his wallet keys were compromised. The developer disclosed the incident in a tweet on Monday, January 1st, saying;</p>



<p><em>“My PGP key is compromised, and at least many of my bitcoins stolen. I have no idea how. Help, please.”</em></p>



<p>PGP, or “Pretty Good Privacy”, is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and safety. It can encrypt data stored in a server to protect such data from unauthorized access.</p>



<p>Dashrj had reportedly used PGP to verify whether Bitcoin Knots or Bitcoin Core downloads were infected with malware before losing control of his keys in the process. Whereas Bitcoin Core is the most popular software used to connect to the Bitcoin network and run a node, Bitcoin Knots is a software with more advanced features than Bitcoin Core, but they are not as well-tested, making it more vulnerable to attacks.</p>



<p>Although the developer managed to track the stolen Bitcoins to an address, he was yet to receive help at the time of publication. Earlier, he had criticized the FBI and local law enforcement agencies for not responding to his calls for help. Hours later, he wrote- “Never mind. It&#8217;s basically all gone”.</p>



<p>The latest hack comes after the developer faced a similar incident in December and November 2022, where an unknown person accessed his server after bypassing his software-side security measures by rebooting the server of an unknown storage device. At the time, the developer confirmed the presence of new malware on the system. Further investigations suggested it was not a standard trojan but something created specifically to compromise his server.</p>



<p>Following the hack, crypto Twitter has been consoling the veteran developer. Earlier Yesterday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao promised to help by monitoring and freezing the coins if they were deposited to the exchange.</p>



<p><em>“If there is anything else we can help with, please let us know. We deal with these often, and have Law Enforcement (LE) relationships worldwide.”</em> Tweeted CZ.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, some crypto adherents have expressed worries over how the hackers managed to also access the developer&#8217;s cold wallet keys, with Dashrj maintaining that he also has no idea. The developer, however, warned against downloading Bitcoin Knots until the issue was resolved. He also advised those who had downloaded the software in the last few months to “consider shutting that system down for now.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethereum transactions outpaced BTC over fourfold in 2022 with over 400 million trades.&nbsp;</li>



<li>BTC topped the search charts as expected, with Ethereum finishing the year in a distant fourth place behind Shiba Inu and DOGE.</li>



<li>A cross-section of crypto users believes that ETH has all the metrics to outpace BTC in terms of growth in 2023.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite a bad run for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-fundamentals-better-than-ever-but-investors-remain-wary-about-price-falls/">Ethereum</a> (ETH) and most digital assets last year, ETH’s community has some positives to kickstart the new year. </p>



<p>According to data from Ycharts and Nasdaq on Jan 2, the Ethereum blockchain trumped Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of transaction volumes last year by a huge margin. Ethereum recorded  338% more transactions than Bitcoin as its figure climbed to 405 million over BTC’s 93.1 million.</p>



<p>On average, ETH recorded 1.1 million daily transactions, while BTC had 255,000. ETH was way ahead as these figures do not include layer 2 transactions which would have increased Ethereum’s numbers. According to reports, the ETH layer 2 transactions were above their Layer 1 figures in October.</p>



<p>This metric is not quite shocking to many as Ethereum plays host to top decentralized applications (DApps) increasing its transaction volume, but several users suggest that a “flippening” may soon occur with BTC getting more volume, although this is unlikely in the near future.</p>



<p>Ethereum has continued its fine form this year, tapping 924,614 transactions on Jan 2, 300% over Bitcoin’s 229,191 transactions in the same period. While BTC trails ETH in transaction volume, it attracted more search interest in 2022.</p>



<p>BTC hit 28.4 million Google searches in 2022, attracting more people than other digital assets. Ethereum was far behind in fourth place behind Shiba Inu and Dogecoin with 3.8 million global monthly Google searches.</p>



<h2 id="h-time-for-a-fresh-start"><strong>Time for a fresh start</strong></h2>



<p>The year has kicked off with Bitcoin and Ethereum making modest gains after the first day of trading as they pushed to recover from a turbulent 2022. BTC started the year with a little increase of 1%, trading above $16,730, while ETH also moved slightly upwards by 1.7% and traded at $1,217. Solana has also started the year with positives, as it is back in double figures after its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-why-solanas-future-is-still-bright-despite-sol-price-nuking-97-below-ath-vitalik-buterin/">slump</a> in the last days of 2022. </p>



<p>BTC and ETH were still shy of their status this time last year. In Jan 2022, BTC exchanged hands at $47,300, 64% higher than its current price, while ETH traded at around $3,730. On the bright side, the year starts with great enthusiasm, with several asset bulls looking to make the first run of the year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin enthusiasts are bracing themselves for new lows amid a bland opening to the year.</li>



<li>Underneath the charts, Bitcoin miners are seeing one of the most brutal capitulations since 2016 ahead of the network’s difficulty adjustment.</li>



<li>The assets supply has also taken a hit in recent weeks as the impetus to sell is at an all-time low for holders.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) entered 2023 showing little signs of activity, but analysts are construing the data as the calm before the storm.</p>



<p>Bitcoin started the year with prices bouncing sideways without its inherent volatility. The doldrum in prices has left enthusiasts with little hope of a rally after a torrid 2022 that saw a staggering 64% loss. </p>



<p>BTC currently trades at $16,718, with the one-week chart indicating a decline of 0.75%. Transaction volumes over 24 hours are at an all-time low at $11.9 billion as popular on-chain analyst Pentoshi eyes $12,000 as a tentative support zone for the asset.</p>



<p>With the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report a week away, it is widely believed that traders are waiting on the sidelines to gauge the macroeconomic trends that could shape BTC’s future. BTC holders are also keeping a keen eye on the Federal Reserve on whether or not it would reverse its trend of rate hikes.</p>



<p>Away from macroeconomics, Bitcoin is set to undergo a difficulty adjustment which analysts say will eliminate the gain made by the network. Bitcoin’s network difficulty climbed 3.27% before Christmas, but with miners under <a href="https://zycrypto.com/are-fears-of-bitcoin-miners-selling-pressure-overblown-this-expert-thinks-so/">pressure</a> from the asset’s price performance, difficulty levels are expected to drop by as much as 3.5%.</p>



<p>Hashrate levels hit their lowest in 2022, and there is little sign of a trend reversal since the start of the new year. Charles Edwards Of Capriole Investments termed it “the most brutal Bitcoin miner capitulation since 2016 and possibly ever.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-volatility-no-supply"><strong>No volatility, no supply</strong></h2>



<p>As prices continue to swing sideways, Bitcoin is experiencing its highest levels of stationary assets in wallets. Glassnode reports that holders have little incentive to trade their BTC while speculators continue to watch from the sidelines as short-term BTC trading declines.</p>



<p>With supply drying up, investors remain unsure of the market&#8217;s general direction. Bitcoin’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-sentiment-wavers-as-crypto-fear-and-greed-index-in-extreme-fear-territory/">Fear and Greed</a> Index hovers at “fear” levels but could slip into extreme fear given the grim metrics around the network.</p>



<p>For now, investors can only watch with bated breaths to see how BTC holds up in the coming days.</p>

<p>2023 is the year that Ripple wins its hard-fought $1.3 billion suit with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). More interestingly, it will also be the same year that Gensler steps down as SEC chairman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the prediction of Ben Armstrong, known as BitBoy Crypto on YouTube.</p>

<p>It is over two years since Ripple, the company which develops the crypto-based cross-border payments protocol, has been fighting the high-profile lawsuit filed by the SEC.</p>



<p>The case pitting Ripple against the American top financial cop is now nearing conclusion, and many crypto onlookers believe the blockchain firm stands a good chance of winning the lawsuit. YouTuber Ben Armstrong, whose videos produced under the moniker BitBoy Crypto have 1.45 million subscribers, has suggested that 2023 will be the year the XRP lawsuit concludes “and the Ripple curse is broken”.</p>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">charged </a>Ripple in December 2020 with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering when the company sold the XRP cryptocurrency to raise capital for its business. The crux of the case is whether the token passes the Howey Test, established in 1946, which determines when assets meet the criteria for being considered investment contracts under U.S. Federal law. A judge could soon give the answer to the question of whether XRP is an unlicensed security. Billions of dollars are riding on the ultimate answer.</p>



<p>As for BitBoy Crypto, Ripple is set to win the closely watched courtroom battle.</p>



<h2><strong>Prediction 2: Gary Gensler Steps Down</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC has long been criticized for consistently lacking clarity regarding its approach and unwillingness to provide useful insight. The securities watchdog has also raised eyebrows in the cryptosphere over its dealings with Ethereum, the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>In 2018, a senior official at the agency gave a historic speech saying the sale of ETH tokens did not constitute a securities breach because the project was “sufficiently decentralized.”</p>



<p>Gary Gensler, the agency’s chairman, has posited several times his view that most crypto assets are securities, with the exception of bitcoin, which is a commodity.</p>



<p>Like many Ripple faithfuls, Brian Armstrong wants Gensler to bow out. In fact, he broadly predicted that the SEC boss would be forced to resign this year, possibly after Ripple wins the case.</p>

<ul>
<li>Charles Hoskinson says he will test IOHK’s new Lace Wallet with $1,000,000 worth of ADA.</li>



<li>He points to the recent LastPass hack as the key reason why several tests are required before wallets are open to users.&nbsp;</li>



<li>In another development, Hoskinson refutes claims of disappointment over Gemini’s rejection of listing ADA.</li>
</ul>



<p>Cardano (ADA) has experienced an all-around growth this year from network security to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and now its latest wallet has been rolled out for early adoption.</p>



<p>Cardano’s co-founder Charles Hoskinson says he is willing to place $1,000,000 worth of ADA in Input Output’s (IOHK) new digital asset wallet as security tests are still in progress. He expressed confidence in the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption of paper wallets and challenged users to hack it.</p>



<p>“<em>When Lace wallet starts supporting PGP encryption of paper wallets, I’m going to take some ADA, probably a million dollars worth of it, put it into a paper wallet encrypted with PGP, and publicly post it on my Twitter so you guys can try to break it. I’m very confident in those standards. Master passwords, even if they’re quite long, it’s just a dead standard, and it shouldn’t be done anymore,” </em>says Hoskinson.</p>



<p>Lace, a lightweight wallet developed by IOHK, aims to seamlessly connect data in web2 and web3 in a single interface. The network prioritizes security by integrating Nano X into the wallet. </p>



<p>In a new YouTube release, Hoskinson spoke about the recent LastPass hack calling it <em>“a screw up and a pretty dirty hack.” </em>LastPass is a password management firm that got compromised as hackers gained access to a third party’s cloud-based storage used by the company to store data.</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-s-team-pledges-more-development"><strong>Cardano’s team pledges more development</strong></h2>



<p>The Cardano project has taken giant strides this year in several areas, including key partnerships with payment tools, web3 projects, as well as engaging users in vital security upgrades.</p>



<p>In October, Cardano announced its partnership with Obsidian Systems to drive development based on its Hydra Payment tools. Hydra is Cardano’s layer 2 scaling solution <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-finally-gaining-massive-traction-as-upcoming-hydra-upgrade-proves-to-be-a-game-changer-for-ada/">created</a> to make the network more efficient with increasing traffic.</p>



<p>Cardano’s NFTs are surging, growing over 300% in volume in Q4 2022 alone. Still leading Cardano’s NFT marketplaces are CNFT and JPG Store, both experiencing growth with top projects and creators leveraging on the network’s improving web3 efforts. </p>

<ul>
<li>Solana loses its top two NFT projects to rival networks as yOOTs and DeGods plan exodus.</li>



<li>The two NFT projects have had an increase in sales following the announcement signalling a bad trend for Solana. </li>



<li>Polygon and Ethereum pick up late wins before the end of the year following the news that yOOts and DeGods will be moving to their respective networks in Q1 2023.</li>
</ul>



<p>More troubles pile on for the community dubbed “Eth killer” <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-why-solanas-future-is-still-bright-despite-sol-price-nuking-97-below-ath-vitalik-buterin/">Solana</a> with its Non-Fungible Token (NFT) division which has been its highest winner this year, losing two top projects.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, yOOts and DEGods announced that they would both leave the Solana network confirming rumours that have been circulating for months. yOOTs will be moving to Polygon, while sister project DeGods will be on Ethereum in Q1 2022.</p>



<p>So far, the news has sparked divergent opinions from the community and the teams. For a section of the Solana community, it is disappointing to see the projects leave; however some feel it is the fault of the network with recurring hacks and downtimes, among other issues.</p>



<p>The project’s leader Rohan Vora said the move was for the project&#8217;s growth in 2023.</p>



<p><em>“There’s an argument to be made that [DeGods] has capped out on Solana. It’s hard to accept, but it’s been tough to grow at the rate we want to grow. If Ethereum is where we have to go to keep growing, it’s what we have to do.”</em></p>



<p>yOOts’s exodus to Polygon was a paid move influenced by a grant from Polygon’s partnership fund to the project. The grant is said to last a year or two, with further details withheld from the public.</p>



<h2 id="h-solana-s-loss-rivals-win"><strong>Solana’s loss, rivals win</strong></h2>



<p>This year, Solana’s NFT projects went head-to-head with Ethereum and had more trade <a href="https://zycrypto.com/despite-network-outages-solana-trumps-ethereum-as-nft-sales-hit-947-million/">volumes</a> in some months despite general network issues. Losing yOOts and DeGods will come at a huge price for Solana. The network is about to experience a huge setback, with both yOOts and DeGods accounting for 70% of the network&#8217;s NFT sales.</p>



<p>DeGods price, which stands at 515 SOL, the highest in the network, surged by 12% following the news that it will be on Ethereum next year. yOOts also has a little uptick by 5% as it expected to commence its partnerships with Polygon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Layer 2 blockchain, Polygon, has had a brilliant partnership in 2022, attracting huge deals with Instagram, Reddit, Nike, and Starbucks, as it looks to start 2023 on a high with yOOts. Ethereum, on the other hand, remains the king of NFTs and will cement its place following closest rival Solana&#8217;s loss of two of its top projects.</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-new-dates-in-the-sec-vs-ripple-case-point-towards-a-final-court-verdict-in-q1-2023/">SEC vs Ripple</a> case extends into the new year, XRP supporters are on the lookout for any edge Ripple could have over the SEC in hopes that it might strengthen Ripple’s chances of winning the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-ripple-another-step-ahead-of-the-sec-in-the-ongoing-case"><strong>Is Ripple another step ahead of the SEC in the ongoing case?</strong></h2>



<p>Luckily, XRP supporters can look at the recent statements made by the U.S. Department of Justice, which classifies two cryptocurrency tokens as “commodities.” The statements have spurred optimism among community members, who consider the statement a valid point of reference for Ripple&#8217;s lawyers in the ongoing case.</p>



<p>The classification of two cryptocurrencies, namely CRV and MNGO, as commodities by the U.S. DOJ, can be seen in a recent court filing against Avraham Eisenberg.</p>



<p>Avraham Eisenberg, who was allegedly involved in hacking the decentralized exchange platform Mango Markets, was recently charged with market manipulation after being arrested on the 28th of December in Puerto Rico.</p>



<p>The documents filed against Eisenberg, who allegedly made away with over $50 million from the hack, were filed in the same court where the SEC vs Ripple case is currently taking place.</p>



<p>In the filing, the DoJ refers to CRV and MNGO as commodities in different paragraphs. This has triggered positive sentiments among Ripple supporters who speculate that if the DoJ can classify these other crypto assets as commodities, Ripple&#8217;s XRP might also be categorized as a commodity, not a security.</p>



<p>However, some notable figures in the cryptocurrency industry have debunked these claims, highlighting the difference in the DOJ&#8217;s situation.</p>



<p>One such figure was General Counsel at Delphi Labs Gabriel Shapiro. Shapiro explained that the label on both cryptos isn&#8217;t bullish for XRP or cryptocurrencies in general.</p>



<p><em>“The fact that the case doesn&#8217;t characterize the relevant tokens as securities is not in any way bullish/positive and merely arises from litigation strategy&#8211;the fewer predicate issues the govt has to litigate in its case, the better. Moreover, swaps are just as big if not a bigger regulatory quagmire than securities.” He wrote in a tweet.</em></p>



<p>Similarly, popular attorney John E Deaton has pushed back on these takes, saying that prosecutors&#8217; choice of language does not hold any weight as a defence tool for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-to-develop-national-stablecoin-for-island-country-palau-xrp-up-6/">Ripple</a>.</p>



<p>Per his tweet below ;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“NOT TRUE. Prosecutors are simply calling the tokens commodities for their own prosecutorial reasons. Whether the underlying asset is a commodity or a security isn’t important &#8211; the fraud is. Calling it a security creates an unnecessary burden of proof.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The heightened volatility in the digital asset class has caused investors to flee, says JPMorgan’s strategist. </li>



<li>2022 has been a tough year for cryptos because of macroeconomic factors.</li>
</ul>



<p>JPMorgan&#8217;s senior investment strategist said that large individual and institutional investors are not interested in cryptos due to the volatility seen in 2022. Jared Gross told Bloomberg in a podcast that the class of investors was happy that they did not put money in crypto this year and may not do so soon.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>As an asset class, crypto is effectively non-existent for most large institutional investors. The volatility is too high, and the lack of an intrinsic return that you can point to makes it very challenging. Most institutional investors probably are breathing a sigh of relief that they didn&#8217;t jump into that market and are probably not going to be doing so anytime soon.</em>&#8221; Gross said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2020, cryptocurrencies boomed. The following year, many digital assets surged to their all-time high, including Bitcoin, which topped $68,000. That was not the case in 2022. A high inflation rate, costly borrowing rates, and the collapse of large crypto companies saw the flagship cryptocurrency touch $15,000 in November, a drop of about 77% from the ATH.</p>



<h2 id="h-bitcoin-has-never-been-a-hedge-against-inflation-says-gross"><strong>Bitcoin Has Never Been A Hedge Against Inflation – Says Gross </strong></h2>



<p>Such heightened volatility cannot qualify Bitcoin as digital gold or as a hedge against inflation &#8211; which has never been &#8211; according to Gross. He added that the interest in digital assets could have disappeared or was not there initially.</p>



<p>It is not the first time JPM has expressed scepticism against crypto, especially in the current bear cycle. The investment bank&#8217;s CEO Jamie Dimon has remarked in the past that he was not a supporter of bitcoin, adding that he &#8220;<em>personally (thought) that bitcoin (was) worthless</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>On the contrary, the largest US bank by assets opened access to its wealth management clients for six crypto funds in 2021. The multinational is also involved in, among other funds, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust. Regarding the matter, Dimon said that the decision is investor-driven.</p>

<p>On December 13, 2022, John Ray III, the new CEO of FTX Group overseeing its bankruptcy, testified before congress on the collapse of FTX. Ray’s testimony highlighted a number of corporate failures at the now defunct FTX and the efforts underway by his new management team to identify and recover the company’s assets of the company, and to minimise further customer loss.</p>



<p>According to Ray, some of the failures at FTX included the lack of basic bookkeeping, lack of trusted financial records, compromised systems integrity, lack of a clear record of the company’s employees, concentration of controls in the hands of a small group of inexperienced individuals, the commingling of deposits and insider lending with Alameda Research (his crypto trading firm), use of an unsecured group email that had access to critical and sensitive data, and the lack of an accurate list of the company’s bank accounts.</p>



<p>Some of the past and significant corporate failures occurred during the accounting scandals witnessed during the 1990s and early 2000’s. The management failures found at FTX are not new to the corporate world. The failures at FTX have also occurred across various sectors ranging from energy, telecommunications, banking, and insurance to name a few.</p>



<p>The energy trading company Enron rocked the world when its executives employed dubious accounting practices that gave an illusion of higher current profits to boost the stock price to sell their shares and to claim huge bonuses. WorldCom, a telecommunications firm, also inflated earnings on its financial reports.</p>



<p>However, these accounting scandals resulted in a wave of new regulations and legislation. In particular, congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) that imposed harsh penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating financial records. The Act also aimed to protect investors by increasing the accuracy of financial reporting for publicly traded companies.</p>



<p>The collapse of FTX has undoubtedly rocked the crypto world. One may argue that many of the failures at FTX are traditional management failures and are not specific to crypto. The same failures could happen in any industry. However, many of the other industries have been around longer than crypto and have hence benefited from existing and new regulation.</p>



<p>The crypto industry is relatively nascent. In a number of jurisdictions, there is little or even no crypto. Where crypto regulation exists, it is also largely fragmented in nature. The events at FTX will prompt authorities to speed up the passing of crypto regulation.</p>



<p>The former CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is facing several counts that include civil securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders, wire fraud on lenders, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>



<p>SBF was remanded in custody after being denied bail by a judge in the Bahamas. He advised the court in the Bahamas that he would not waive his right to fight extradition to the United States.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethereum is currently the largest proof-of-stake blockchain after its Merge and has over 491,000 validators securing the network. </li>



<li>The blockchain leads the way by a huge margin in NFTs, with over $23.7 billion worth of tokens minted in the network this year</li>



<li>In a related development, Bloomberg’s senior macro strategist Mike McGlone says that ETH will outperform BTC in the next bull run.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Ethereum (ETH) has struggled for the most part of the year, but its fundamentals look better than its current market value. </p>



<p>The network’s much-anticipated Merge went live this year as it transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The effects on the blockchain were huge as its energy usage was cut by 98%, with validators replacing miners.</p>



<p>Over 100 days since the Merge, ETH still struggles below $1,500, trading at $1,217. The network currently has over 490,000 validators with the number expected to grow in 2022. According to Beaconcha.in, an open-source Ethereum blockchain explorer, there are currently 15.7 million ETH staked on the network since September, worth around $19.2 billion. </p>



<p>ETH began the year with prospects of hitting new highs after ETH2, which will make the platform more efficient and faster, but the price has struggled in recent months. The asset has lost over 55% in value this year, although market experts are usually impressed by its fundamentals.</p>



<p>Bloomberg’s senior macro strategist, Mike McGlone, has tipped ETH to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-is-positioned-to-outperform-bitcoin-bloombergs-top-strategist-asserts/">outperform</a> its rival, Bitcoin (BTC), in the next bull run. His views on ETH are shaped by the smart contracts active on the network and wider mainstream adoption. </p>



<p><em>“Migration into the mainstream is our key takeaway and once the dust settles from some reversion in risk assets amid inflation pressures, Ethereum is more likely to resume doing what it has been—outperforming”</em></p>



<h2 id="h-nfts-are-still-at-home"><strong>NFTs are still at home</strong></h2>



<p>The Ethereum Network is the largest smart contract-enabled network, attracting huge decentralization applications (DApps) over the years. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are more prominent on Ethereum, with the blockchain playing host to top NFT projects, including CryptoPunks, Axie Infinity, Decentraland, etc.</p>



<p>This year, NFTs worth over $23.7 billion were minted on Ethereum as it remains ahead of closest rivals Solana and Cardano. This year, Solana’s NFT <a href="https://zycrypto.com/despite-nagging-issues-nft-mints-on-solana-sets-a-new-all-time-high-record/">mints</a> got to an all-time high with several speculations that it may unseat Ethereum as the home of NFTs, but so far, Ethereum remains king.</p>

<p>The year 2022 was a turbulent one for the cryptocurrency market. According to the crypto market behaviour analytics platform Santiment, 2022 has arguably solidified the thesis that news events impact the space. </p>



<p>Santiment notes four news events that influenced and continue to influence crypto market participants. These include the pandemic, FTX and SBF, interest rates, and the Russia-Ukraine tensions. According to Santiment, traders are watching these events. As fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) on the topics ease, crypto prices will likely rise.</p>



<p>Two of these events — the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical tensions and interest rate hikes — have been at play for much of the year. Russia launched an attack on Ukraine back in February. According to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/22/crypto-prices-bitcoin-btc-sinks-on-mounting-russia-ukraine-tensions.html">report</a> at the time, the entire crypto market slipped as the tensions between the two countries mounted.</p>



<p>Similarly, the market has responded to several Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. The latest 0.5 percentage points rate hike was implemented earlier this month. It was followed by the price of Bitcoin (BTC) rising above $18,000 on the announcement before dropping again. </p>



<p>The collapse of FTX last month and the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sam-bankman-fried-set-to-return-to-the-u-s-wednesday-after-signing-extradition-papers/">criminal case against Sam Bankman-Fried</a> have had similar effects on market sentiments. </p>



<h1 id="h-market-optimism-is-still-strong-for-2023"><strong>Market optimism is still strong for 2023</strong></h1>



<p>Overall, Bitcoin, the benchmark cryptocurrency, lost 60% of its value in 2022. BTC currently trades at around $16,560, down 0.43% in the last 24 hours. The wider crypto market capitalization also shrunk by $1.4 trillion from the start of the year. Reuters&#8217; analyst <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cryptoverse-bye-bye-year-that-broke-bitcoin-2022-12-20/">opines</a> that 2023 may still be tough for the crypto market as the global market could face a recession.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, crypto market participants continue to be optimistic for 2023. Anthony Georgiades, the co-founder of the Pastel Network blockchain, told Reuters that it is hard not to be optimistic going into 2023, especially for projects like Ethereum. His optimism is tied to Ethereum finally completing the Merge upgrade that will be the foundation of further improvements in 2023.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;This event was a technological feat and one of the lone positive events in a year that otherwise has been rather dark for crypto. These upgrades will make the Ethereum ecosystem far easier to use for people all around the world. Because of all this progress, it&#8217;s hard not to be a crypto optimist going into 2023,&#8221; he said.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Trust Wallet token, SONM, and GMX lead the chart as the higher gainers of 2022, recording over 100% gains since Jan 1.</li>



<li>OKB, BNB, and DOGE were the best-performing assets in the top 10 digital assets by market capitalization.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Digital asset enthusiasts continue to project coins to watch with a keen interest in 2023, rolling out several indices. </li>
</ul>



<p>This year has been riddled with ups and downs in the cryptoverse, although the negatives have been more in the spotlight. As the year wraps up, we have seen assets spring up, surprises and some just disappointing.</p>



<p>Leading the winning table is Trust Wallet&#8217;s native token (TWT), making a huge leap this year, going from $0.710 in January to $1.5, gaining 106.24% this year to date (YTD). Closely following TWT is SNM, the token of the SONM platform, recording a sharp increase of 106% so far this year, trading at $0.51.</p>



<p>GMX, the utility token of the GMX exchange, follows closely as the last asset that made over a 100% gain YTD. GMX recorded a 103% growth and currently trades at $46.86.</p>



<p>The top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap were all in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/new-week-new-trouble-for-the-market-as-crypto-prices-tumble-rubbing-in-the-pain-of-a-torrid-couple-of-weeks/">red zone</a>, but OKB, Binance Coin (BNB), and Dogecoin (DOGE) recorded the least losses. OKB, the native token of OKX digital asset exchange, is currently the 10th largest asset by market cap after it made a loss of 24.06% YTD.</p>



<p>BNB has had a fluctuating year without hitting 2021 highs but still sits at No 5 according to market cap after shedding 52% since the start of the year. Popular meme coin, DOGE comes in third, trading at $0.07 after a turbulent year for the asset, which saw it fall back by 57% but still sits at No 8 by market capitalization.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-bad-year-for-the-big-guns"><strong>A bad year for the big guns</strong></h2>



<p>The question for most users has been, “what happened to BTC and ETH? Will they bounce back?” This year has seen most digital assets in the red zone because of both internal problems in the cryptoverse, like the collapse of Terra and FTX and macro factors, like inflation and interest rate hike.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) started the year with lots of prospects but has lost 65% of its value since the start of the year. Starting the year at $47,827, the top virtual currency now trades at $16,583. Ethereum (ETH) started this year with lots of defining <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">moments</a> lined up, like the Merge (ETH 2), but that was not enough, as the leading altcoin has lost 67.92% of its value this year. </p>

<ul>
<li>Mark Cuban makes acquiring more Bitcoin a top priority in the new year and hopes to get them at a cheap price.</li>



<li>He takes a swipe at gold in comparison with digital assets and says BTC is a better way to store value.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Experts weigh in on the unending Gold versus Bitcoin debate in light of new points by Cuban.</li>
</ul>



<p>For the majority of bulls, this has been a disappointing year, but that is not the story of Mark Cuban, who sees new possibilities in the bear market.</p>



<p>The Shark Tank host revealed his plans to buy more Bitcoin (BTC) next year, restating his <a href="https://zycrypto.com/mark-cuban-deems-bitcoin-a-superior-store-of-value-but-maintains-dogecoin-will-dominate-payments-heres-why/">bullish</a> stance. He added that he wants the price of the top digital asset to go down more so that he can pick them up at a cheaper rate.</p>



<p><em>“I want Bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more,” </em>he said.</p>



<p>Speaking on Bill Maher’s ‘Random Club’ podcast, the tech billionaire praised digital assets as the game changer of investments. He went ahead to diss gold, saying investing in gold “<em>isn’t worth it anyway.”</em></p>



<p>He added that owning gold these days is exactly like owning a digital transaction, and he would rather invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets to expand his portfolio.</p>



<p>The billionaire finally referred to Bitcoin as a safer investment than gold making reference to how gold can be easily stolen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Gold is a store of value, and so is Bitcoin. If everything went to hell in a handbasket and you had a gold bar, you know what would happen? Someone would beat the f*** out of you or kill you and take your gold bar. It’s useless.”</em></p>



<h2 id="h-the-unending-debate">The unending debate&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Mark Cuban has not always been on the side of bitcoin as he was once a major critic, but the Dallas Maverick owner says he now sees it as a wise investment. During the show, Maher argued that Bitcoin is not backed by anything, making it a risky investment, but Cuban fired back by claiming that holding “<em>shares in 90% of companies out there” </em>are pointless. </p>



<p>After a turbulent year for the market leader, which saw it lose over 55% of its market cap and 75% of its value since its all-time high last year, BTC currently trades at $16,862. Gold, on the other hand, has had a better 2022, selling at $1,800 per ounce. </p>



<p>Mark Cuban is a huge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/billionaires-elon-musk-and-mark-cuban-bullish-on-dogecoin-as-doge-dominates-traditional-retail-market/">investor</a> in Polygon, BTC, Ethereum, Dogecoin (DOGE), etc., and his Dallas Mavericks outfit has incorporated DOGE payments.</p>

<p>iPhone users can now stake <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-price-massively-discounted-ada-envisioned-to-moon-dramatically-in-2023/">Cardano&#8217;s</a> native token ADA on the Trust wallet, earn interest, and secure the platform. The official Binance self-custody wallet app rolled out the service for Android users in December.</p>



<p>According to the announcement, the staking option is done in three simple steps. You first send $ADA to the Trust wallet and click the &#8216;stake&#8217; button on their login address. Then select the validator to stake with.</p>



<p>The wallet team added that staking rewards are not automatically rolled over and that one must have at least 4 ADA to stake and unstake their funds. As reported by Binance, data shows that the Cardano network increased smart contract usage by 340% in 2021 amid a growing developer interest, despite the ongoing bear cycle. </p>



<p>Some of the benefits that iOS users will enjoy from the new offering include direct ADA purchases from the Trust Wallet app. According to the announcement, users can also transfer and receive ADA through a single application, including a unified interface for tracking price movements of their stored assets for a better trading strategy. The latest app supporting Trust wallet via Cardano&#8217;s network is version 6.16.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-increasing-popularity-of-cardano-s-monthly-active-users-and-the-popularity-of-self-custody-wallets"><strong>The increasing popularity of Cardano&#8217;s monthly active users and the popularity of self-custody wallets</strong></h2>



<p>Further, following the collapse of FTX, there is a growing trend of individual and institutional investors moving their funds to self-custodial wallets. Analytics platform CryptoCompare shows that the increasing popularity of the wallets has expanded Cardano&#8217;s active users by 5.34% to 2.32 million as of last month, the highest volume ever recorded since April.</p>



<p>According to its website, Trust Wallet is a non-custodial wallet powering more than 3 million crypto assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs.) The platform supports over 65 blockchains and lets users store their private keys away from centralized exchanges. It is used by more than 50 million people globally.</p>



<p>Described by its co-founder <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-says-indias-anti-crypto-regulatory-environment-is-preventing-cardanos-entry/">Charles Hoskinson</a> as the third generation of blockchain, Cardano is an open-source consensus, which boasts more than 1,000 projects building on it. The blockchain uses a proof of stake consensus algorithm to secure its transactions, powered by its native token, ADA, which is used for settling transaction fees on the blockchain.</p>
