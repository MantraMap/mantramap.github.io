<p>Balinese authorities said they would crack down on foreign tourists who pay for products and services using cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Tech in Asia reports the Bali Provincial Government threatened to impose strict sanctions on tourists and businesspeople who use cryptocurrencies for payments. Authorities decided to take action after a local news publication, Kompas, found tourists had been paying for services such as motorbike rentals, meditation practices, and meals using cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, digital assets are officially recognised as tradeable commodities on future exchanges but cannot be used as a payment method.</p>
<p>Bali Governor Wayan Koster spoke at a press conference on Sunday, where he warned foreign tourists of using crypto assets as a means of payment.</p>
<p>Koster said:</p>

<p>Foreign tourists who behave inappropriately, carry out activities that are not in accordance with visa permits, use crypto as a means of payment transactions, and violate other provisions will be dealt with strictly according to laws and regulations.</p>

<p>The Governor said individuals contravening the laws would be dealt with in terms of a 2023 law which states that individuals found conducting foreign exchanges without a necessary permit may be subject to one to five years in prison and a fine of 50 million ($3,300) to 22 billion rupiahs ($1.4 million).</p>
<p>Oversight of the crypto industry in Indonesia is governed by the Indonesia Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency, also known as Bappebti.</p>

<p>The exchange, dubbed the Nat&rsquo;l Exchange, will act as a mediator between buyers and sellers and, as a custodian, will manage the flow of assets.</p>
