Stellar (XLM) has registered a surprise surge, catapulting itself into the forefront of the crypto market frenzy. Beginning July 18, this surge has taken the digital asset on a solid price rally, propelling its value to new heights. Currently, XLM is trading at $0.1617, representing a 22.1% increase over the past 24 hours. Even more remarkable is its exceptional performance over the previous week, which has soared by 68.8%, and dominating the top 100 roster of cryptocurrencies.
