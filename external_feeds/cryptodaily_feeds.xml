<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) extended recent sideways trading activity early in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 30491.62 area, representing the 50% retracement of the appreciating range from 29539.57 to 31443.67.&nbsp; Selling pressure recently intensified around the 31000 figure, a test of the 23.6% retracement of the same appreciating range.&nbsp; Upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Following recent trading activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 29926, 29477, 28937, 28845, 28213, 28137, 27430, 27338, 27312, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Multichain (MULTI) may become only three years old this July, but crypto analysts predict profitable growth for Multichain (MULTI) in the coming years. </p>
<p>This article explores Multichain&rsquo;s (MULTI) unique features while exploring a new token, Uwerx, and learning about its exploding presale. </p>
Multichain (MULTI): The Ultimate Web3 Router
<p>Multichain (MULTI) is predicted to become the main router for Web3 soon. Multichain (MULTI) was launched in 2020 on the 20th of July to provide solutions for various blockchains, especially regarding their communication needs. </p>
<p>With &nbsp;Mulltichain (MULTI), every blockchain has its community, unique services, and development ecosystem. </p>
<p>Multichain (MULTI) is selling at $4.33 and is predicted to reach $7.42 by 2024 if its community grows at the current pace.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): â€‹The Freelancers&rsquo; Community
<p>Uwerx is set to be launched on the 4th of August, 2023. Over the months, and during its presale, Uwerx has released several mouthwatering updates about the platform and its launching, leaving freelancers and crypto investors eagerly anticipating.</p>
<p>Uwerx is an upcoming freelancing platform that will provide freelancers with a perfect virtual world to work in and provide crypto investors with a stable and profitable investment choice. For freelancers, the Uwerx team has emphasized that Uwerx is to become the freelancer&rsquo;s first choice. With its 1% flat fee, unlike the ludicrous 10% and 20% fees offered by other freelancing platforms, Uwerx is ready to put its money where its mouth&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>A blaring green light for crypto investors about Uwerx is its successful audit approval by both InterFi Network and SolidProof. This audit approval alone shows interested crypto investors that Uwerx is that token! Uwerx will be renouncing its contract ownership once it&rsquo;s launched on the 4th of August, 2023, and this will be done to ensure the prevention of all cryptocurrency-related scams and frauds. </p>
<p>Perhaps these positive updates about the upcoming platform are the secrets behind Uwerx&rsquo;sgrowing numbers. Uwerx is making great steps to ensure that these figures have extra zeroes at their end before Q4 2024. Uwerx has already been listed on CoinSniper and will soon be listed on Uniswap by the 1st of August, 2023. </p>
<p>Also, to ensure that the WERX tokens are protected, Uwerx will implement a 25-year liquidity lock before the end of its presale. Uwerx will also be launching a Test Airdrop for its users before the 31st of July, 2023, the scheduled date for the end of Uwerx&rsquo;s hard cap presale. To further provide Uwerx users with extra security, the Uwerx Vault has now been unveiled. Storing your WERX tokens in the Uwerx Vault works just like staking, and you can store your tokens for different periods and earn rewards depending on Uwerx&rsquo;s variables. </p>
<p>The Uwerx team is working on releasing the Alpha platform in phases. The PDF Version of these pages has now been released: the Signing-Up Page, the Logging-In page, and the job creation process, amongst others. Soon, Uwerx will be transitioning from the Alpha platform to the Beta platform, so users can try out the platform for themselves while sharing their observations with the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
Uwerx&rsquo;s (WERX) Presale Shoots Higher
<p>The Uwerx Presale has not stopped soaring since its start. The presale stages 1 to 4 were sold out in record time, showing crypto investors that the demand for Uwerx is truly high. The Uwerxteam has had to make key token modifications due to increased Uwerx demand.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Meme coins have a robust reputation for their potential to deliver huge returns on investment over a short period of time. Meme coin lovers are attracted by projects that could experience exponential growth, leading to high returns overnight. However, finding the right projects is not such an easy task, especially as more and more coins appear on the market each day.</p>
<p class="s5">To help you out, we&rsquo;ve done the research on your behalf and we discovered the best altcoins to buy with huge potential for growth in the next period. Here are the 5 crypto picks for 100x returns that currently generate hype and attention within the community: DigiToads (TOADS), Floki Inu (FLOKI), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Monacoin (MONA).</p>
<p>DigiToads</p>
<p class="s5">DigiToads is one of the few presales this year that have generated huge buzz in the media. However, TOADS is more than a simple meme coin. In fact, this coin departs from the purely speculative business model and puts forward a robust ecosystem with plenty of opportunities to generate returns both actively and passively.</p>
<p class="s5">DigiToads combines a play-to-earn gaming universe with a stake-to-earn rare feature. These core elements attract gaming enthusiasts, who get to play with digital toads in an immersive world to earn TOADS in gaming competitions, but also long-term investors, who can buy TOADS and use them to purchase and stake trending NFTs in return for regular passive income.</p>
<p class="s5">Perhaps another crucial aspect is the deflationary nature of the TOADS ERC20 coins. This leads to the scarcity effect, unlike other inflationary coins, which means that TOADS holders do not only stand to benefit from value appreciation but also enjoy the potential for long-term passive returns.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s11">FLOKI</p>
<p class="s5">FLOKI started out as a joke coin, but the dev team decided to expand into key areas like decentralized finance, NFTs, and the Metaverse. Despite being relatively new, just like TOADS, FLOKI is expected by experts to deliver significant growth and success in the next year.</p>
<p class="s5">The crypto project differentiates itself from other meme coins. Just like TOADS, it focuses on real-life use cases, which are expected to keep generating demand for the token.</p>
<p class="s11">Shiba Inu</p>
<p class="s5">Shiba Inu has been at the top of the list for quite some time now. Despite some bumps down the road this year, SHIB is still expected to live up to its reputation. The purpose of SHIB is to become one of the main decentralized cryptocurrencies that focus on a fun community of users.</p>
<p class="s11">Dogecoin </p>
<p class="s5">Dogecoin&rsquo;s cultural appeal has remained unaltered thanks to its lighthearted origin. Just like SHIB, a key driver for growth for this meme coin is the internet meme that has created a strong community. Also, DOGE has enjoyed multiple celebrity endorsements, with figures prominent in business, entertainment, and crypto industries offering attention to this meme coin.</p>
<p class="s11">Monacoin</p>
<p class="s5">Monacoin first appeared in Japan and garnered attention after appearing on a Japanese TV network, where land was purchased using MONA. Monacoin is essentially a payment network that facilitates P2P transactions.</p>
<p class="s5">One of the earliest meme coins, Monacoin enjoys a huge appeal, particularly in the Japanese crypto community. In addition to this, while some meme coins lack utility, MONA is used for multiple purposes, including tipping, donations, or as a means of exchange.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s11">Summary</p>
<p class="s5">The rise of meme coins has taken many by surprise. Among the top contenders, DigiToadsstands out for its unique approach that combines play-to-earn gaming and a stake-to-earn mechanism with multiple community contests and awards.</p>
<p class="s5">As the meme coin landscape evolves, investors and traders are becoming more discerning than ever. The meme coin market offers huge potential for excitement, adrenaline, and gains, but it&rsquo;s important to focus on projects like DigiToads with robust growth potential and a solid foundation.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Celsius co-founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky was arrested on Thursday after an investigation into the bankrupt lender&rsquo;s collapse. </p>
<p>Alex Mashinsky, co-founder and former CEO of the insolvent cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network was arrested on Thursday according to a US Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment.</p>
<p>Mashinsky and others have been charged with seven counts, including securities, commodities, and wire fraud, and a conspiracy charge to manipulate $CEL, Celsius&rsquo; native token, Bloomberg reports.</p>
SEC, CFTC, and FTC File Lawsuits Against Mashinsky
<p>The DOJ&rsquo;s indictment is accompanied by separate lawsuits by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against the company and Mashinsky.</p>
<p>Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022, and the Fahrenheit consortium recently won a bid to acquire the lender&rsquo;s assets.</p>
DOJ: Mashinsky Misled Investors for Years
<p>The Department of Justice accused Mashinsky and Celsius&rsquo; Chief Revenue Officer Roni Cohen-Pavon of running &ldquo;a years-long scheme to mislead customers&rdquo; on Celsius&rsquo; market value and its interest in CEL.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports the DOJ indictment further accused Mashinsky of making false and misleading public statements regarding his own sales of CEL.</p>
<p>The DOJ indictment reads:</p>

<p>Mashinsky portrayed Celsius as a modern-day bank, where customers could safely deposit crypto assets and earn interest. In truth, however, Mashinsky operated Celsius as a risky investment fund, taking in customer money under false and misleading pretences.</p>

CFTC Alleges a Fraud Scheme
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) accused Mashinsky and Celsius of participating in a &ldquo;scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of customers by misrepresenting the safety and profitability of its digital asset-based finance platform.&rdquo; The complaint adds despite worsening market conditions, Celsius continued to &ldquo;promote the safety and viability of Celsius, and failed to disclose these losses to customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The regulator further alleges Celsius violated several federal commodities regulations, failed to register as a Commodity Pool Operator, engaged in fraud, and did not provide sufficient disclosure documents.</p>
<p>Investigators from the CFTC previously concluded that Mashinsky and Celsius violated several US laws.</p>
SEC Accuses Celsius and Mashinsky of Securities Fraud
<p>In a separate lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mashinsky and the firm of securities fraud. According to the SEC, CEL and Celsius&rsquo; Earn product are securities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges:</p>

<p>In this case, Celsius offered and sold CEL and the Earn Interest Program as securities. Celsius and Mashinsky never filed a registration statement or had one in effect with the SEC for their offers and sales of securities through the Earn Interest Program.</p>

FTC Announces $4.7 Billion Settlement With Celsius
<p>The barrage of claims against Celsius and its former CEO further included a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint.</p>
<p>The FTC said Celsius violated the Federal Trade Commission Act &ldquo;in connection with the marketing and sale of cryptocurrency lending and custody services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The commission said:</p>

<p>Defendants assured customers that Celsius maintained sufficient reserves to meet customer obligations.</p>

<p>However, the FTC reached a settlement agreement with Celsius &ldquo;that will permanently ban it from handling customers&rsquo; assets&rdquo; and prohibits it from &ldquo;offering, marketing, or promoting any product or services that could be used to deposit, exchange, invest or withdraw any assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celsius has agreed to a $4.7 billion judgement which will only be paid after creditors and investors have been repaid in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC&rsquo;s Bureau of Customer Protection, commented on Celsius's alleged conduct, saying:</p>

<p>Celsius touted a new business model but engaged in an old-fashioned swindle.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action banning Celsius from handling people&rsquo;s money and holding its executives accountable should make clear that emerging technologies are not above the law.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Polygon, the prominent Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, is making strides towards a significant upgrade, changing its token from $MATIC to $POL.&nbsp;</p>
$POL token to have increased functionality
<p>The team behind Polygon has put forward a proposal that could change the game for its native token, $MATIC. This isn't just a minor tweak; it's part of the grand plan for Polygon 2.0., and if the community gives the green light, $MATIC tokens will transform into Polygon ($POL) tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But these aren't just any tokens. $POL tokens will have the power to be staked across multiple chains within the Polygon ecosystem. This isn't just about changing the name; it's about boosting the scalability of the ecosystem without putting security on the line. The new $POL token won't be confined to a single protocol. It's designed to be a jack-of-all-trades, operating across all Polygon protocols. That includes Proof of Stake (PoS), zkEVM, and Supernets.&nbsp;</p>
What does this mean for Polygon validators?&nbsp;
<p>They'll have the ability to secure transactions across different chains, making the ecosystem even more robust. If $MATIC token holders are wondering what this means for them. Well, the transition from $MATIC to $POL is designed to be one easy and smooth transaction. A holder would just need to send their $MATIC tokens to a specific smart contract in order to receive an equivalent number of $POL tokens.&nbsp;</p>
An upgrade to enhance Polygon ecosystem
<p>In addition, in order for everyone to get adjusted to the new $POL token, the Polygon team is thinking of allocating a period of at least four years for token holders to complete the upgrade process, which is probably plenty of time to get used to the new token and its functionalities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed upgrade is still to be signed off by the Polygon community, and if they give the thumbs up, the migration to $POL could happen in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polygon&rsquo;s proposed upgrade is an exciting development for the entire ecosystem. Should the upgrade be approved it has the potential to push Polygon further to the forefront of the Ethereum layer 2 race.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Uniswap users can now start swapping their Avalanche tokens on the Uniswap website, as the decentralized exchange has now launched on the Avalanche network.&nbsp;</p>
Uniswap&rsquo;s C-Chain Debut&nbsp;
<p>Leading decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM), Uniswap, has made its debut on Avalanche C-Chain, marking another significant expansion of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector on the Avalanche blockchain. Uniswap's move follows in the footsteps of other prominent DeFi platforms like Curve and Aave, who have already established a presence on Avalanche.</p>
<p>This expansion was made possible through a governance proposal initiated by the University of Michigan's blockchain club, Michigan Blockchain. The proposal, aiming to promote a diverse and robust multi-chain future, received overwhelming support during the on-chain vote, with an impressive 95% majority in favor of the deployment.</p>
Ava Labs Head Welcomes Uniswap
<p>The integration of LayerZero, an interoperability protocol facilitating Avalanche's BTC.b, played a crucial role in enabling the deployment. LayerZero acts as a communication bridge between Ethereum and Avalanche, allowing for seamless cross-chain asset transfers and governance proposals.</p>
<p>Expressing excitement about the integration, Luigi D'Onorio DeMeo, the Head of DeFi and Developer Relations at Ava Labs, said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to welcome battle-tested DeFi mainstay Uniswap to C-Chain, strengthening the competition between DEXes on Avalanche. The opportunity set for DEXes on Avalanche is huge. As new Subnets launch, more liquidity for DEXes like Uniswap will likely come to C-Chain. Furthermore, Avalanche Warp Messaging creates other unique opportunities for DEXes that aren&rsquo;t possible on other EVM chains.&rdquo;</p>

Leading DEX For Traders And Liquidity Providers
<p>Uniswap, originally launched on Ethereum in 2018, revolutionized the market with its innovative AMM model. By facilitating trades through liquidity pools, the platform offered traders and liquidity providers an efficient and indirect trading method. With over 139 million trades conducted and a trading volume exceeding $1.5 trillion, Uniswap remains a dominant force in the AMM space.</p>
<p>The current iteration, known as V3, introduces concentrated liquidity, allowing liquidity providers to allocate their assets within specific price ranges. This feature empowers liquidity providers to customize their strategies for each pool, potentially generating higher fees.</p>
<p>Uniswap's integration into Avalanche's ecosystem, alongside other pioneering Avalanche-native exchanges like Trader Joe, Dexalot, and DeltaPrime, further enriches the DEX options available to users.</p>
Uniswap V4
<p>Uniswap's recent expansion onto the Avalanche blockchain aligns with its upcoming upgrade to version 4 (V4), a highly anticipated development that hinges on the Ethereum Cancun upgrade, which is expected to be deployed in September.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a developer from Uniswap Labs, the V4 upgrade will grant users the ability to construct their own features, paving the way for endless possibilities. Among the notable advancements in V4 is the introduction of a novel smart contract variant known as "hooks." This feature empowers developers to create innovative solutions on top of Uniswap's liquidity pools, further expanding the platform's capabilities.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Blockchain Association has alleged that Prometheum&rsquo;s Broker-Dealer license approval by the SEC is part of a &ldquo;sweetheart deal&rdquo; between the two.&nbsp;</p>
BA Appeals To SEC Inspector
<p>Prometheum Ember Capital, a Special Purpose Broker-Dealer (SPBD), has come under scrutiny due to potential impropriety surrounding its approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Blockchain Association (BA), a leading nonprofit organization advocating for a pro-innovation policy environment for the digital asset economy, has called for an investigation by the SEC's Office of Inspector General, Deborah Jeffrey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group has alleged that Prometheum has benefitted from a &ldquo;sweetheart deal&rdquo; with the regulatory body, in which the former received license approval in return for co-CEO Aaron Kaplan&rsquo;s testimony in the House Financial Services Committee in June.</p>
How Did Prometheum Obtain SEC Approval?
<p>The SEC has maintained an overtly hostile approach towards the digital assets industry, motivated by its Chair Gary Gensler's stance that all digital assets, except for Bitcoin, should be classified as securities.</p>
<p>Amidst this hostility, Prometheum managed to obtain a first-of-its-kind license to operate as an SPBD, raising ethical concerns from several US lawmakers considering the circumstances surrounding it. The fact that the company has no working product or asset listings goes against the SEC&rsquo;s recent actions against Coinbase and Binance, where it deemed that exchange, clearing, and broker-dealer functions should be separated into distinct entities.&nbsp;</p>
BA Alleges &ldquo;Sweetheart Deal&rdquo;&nbsp;
<p>In an effort to shed light on these matters, the Blockchain Association submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act to the Commission on June 16, 2023, seeking relevant documents and communications. As the industry awaits answers, the Association urges the Office of Inspector General to initiate an investigation to uncover any impropriety or confirm the absence of any wrongdoing in these allegations. The investigation will serve to address the concerns raised and ensure transparency and fairness within the digital asset industry.</p>
<p>The group has alleged that Prometheum received preferential treatment from the SEC because co-CEO Aaron Kaplan had testified before the Congress supporting the SEC&rsquo;s stance that new legislation for digital assets is unnecessary.</p>
<p>The association writes,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prometheum&hellip;promotes the same false narrative propounded by Chair Gensler that there exists a clear pathway to registration for digital assets and legislation is unnecessary. Echoing this narrative, on June 13, 2023, co-CEO of Prometheum, Aaron Kaplan, testified before Congress, stating that new legislation is not in the best interest in the investing public or blockchain industry.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;SEC Chair Impeding Legislation Efforts&rdquo;: BA
<p>Representing over 100 member companies like Circle, Kraken, and Digital Currency Group in the blockchain industry, the Blockchain Association aims to promote regulatory clarity and educate policymakers, regulators, courts, and the public about the benefits of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The Association is particularly concerned that Chair Gensler is using Prometheum and the SPBD licensure process to impede congressional efforts toward legislation by perpetuating the false narrative that the law is already clear regarding digital asset securities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A very welcome downtick in US inflation to 3% in June has led to a rally in stocks. Today, the crypto market has woken up and is trending higher.</p>
Crypto not moving on good inflation data?
<p>A report in the India-based Business Standard somewhat jumped the gun. It accused the crypto market of standing still as stocks and bonds increased in value following the perceived good news in the June inflation figure of 3%.</p>
<p>Based on what was seen as the crypto market not making hay while global markets were doing just that, an analyst who commented in the article went as far as to suggest that this was a &ldquo;bad sign&rdquo; and that bitcoin&rsquo;s odds of falling to $26,000 to $25,000 were increasing.</p>
Crypto wakes up
<p>Only one day later and crypto is painting a different story. Bitcoin suddenly shot out of its sideways slumber and is currently up 0.6%. It may be that it only increases to the top of the range at around $31,400 but the longer this accumulation phase lasts, the more explosive the resulting move is likely to be.</p>
<p>USDT dominance has moved in the opposite direction which is probably only to be expected, and this has released the altcoins from their shackles of the last few days. Comparing the USDT dominance chart to Bitcoin shows the former to be on the brink of breaking down, while the latter is looking like breaking higher.</p>
<p>The Total 3 chart, which includes all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and ethereum, has just broken to the upside and is now under the next resistance at $334.5 billion. A break of this should lead to $345 billion and then potentially $352 billion.</p>
DoJ bitcoin overhang
<p>However, it&rsquo;s not all blue skies ahead for crypto by any means. The overhang of the US Justice Department selling its bitcoin can dent the market. News broke recently that the next batch of 9000 BTC has been transferred to a new address, perhaps being made ready to be sold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last same-size batch to be sold hardly made an impression as the market swallowed it and recovered immediately. The impact of this latest tranche remains to be seen, with 3 further tranches still to be sold by the end of this year.</p>
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies good long-term?
<p>Whether bitcoin and crypto go up or down over the next few weeks and months is generally immaterial. The dire state of the dollar and all other fiat currencies, as they continue to heavily lose their purchasing power, is a major reason to have at least some of one&rsquo;s wealth in bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are more speculative, but if it is accepted that they are bringing a huge technical revolution, not just to finance, but to many other areas of economic activity, then as things stand, this speculation may not be as risky as just holding fiat in the bank.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The European Union recently approved the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), which came into force in June 2023, bringing crypto assets, crypto asset issuers, and crypto asset service providers under a single regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MiCA regulations introduce increased transparency and create a comprehensive regulatory framework for service providers and issuers and compliance with anti-money laundering rules. Additionally, the new rules also cover asset-referenced tokens and stablecoins.</p>
A Closer Look At MiCA
<p>MiCA, or the Markets in Crypto Assets, is the new legislation adopted by the European Union on cryptocurrency, aiming to bring greater clarity to the crypto ecosystem in the EU. The introduction of the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation represents a significant step forward for the crypto industry and is the most significant effort yet to bring transparency to the sector. MiCA will provide stakeholders with a clear set of rules, definitions, and guidelines for companies operating in different spheres of the crypto space, such as custody, trading, and marketing of crypto assets.</p>
<p>MiCA also puts significant emphasis on stablecoins, which are digital assets whose value is typically backed by fiat currency, although they could be backed by other assets as well. It introduces heavy compliance requirements for stablecoin operators, thus ensuring that these assets are stable, secure, and not subjected to any fraud. MiCA also requires entities offering crypto assets to provide a whitepaper that contains information about the issuer, obligations, capital raised, and the underlying technology behind the asset. According to MiCA, this would help improve transparency and fuel technological innovation.</p>
<p>MiCA also mandates the recording of all sender and recipient information, regardless of the transaction amount. Against the backdrop of this emphasis on regulatory compliance, how will companies that operate with a focus on privacy operate?</p>
Striking A Balance
<p>Protocols must take a unique and innovative approach to ensure compliance with MiCA, with transactions conducted on their platform being private and secure but also auditable by the concerned authorities. As such, it is important for protocols to strike a balance between user privacy and regulatory requirements. For example, Dusk encrypts the user key with an auditor key. This means only the auditor can decrypt it. Users can utilize zero-knowledge proofs to prove that the auditor key was used to encrypt the user key. This innovative approach ensures compliance by combining digital identity, privacy, and encryption.</p>
<p>The new EU regulations are expected to considerably impact those protocols that do not have simultaneous privacy and auditability at the base layer. Protocols that are privacy-focused and do not feature built-in auditability will face considerable difficulties when it comes to gaining traction in the European Union. Many public and anonymous tokens will also face considerable challenges.</p>
How Dusk Is Ready To Comply With MiCA
<p>Dusk believes that regulatory clarity is critical for the broader adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. The approval of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation rules by the European Union is a significant step towards achieving greater regulatory compliance and clarity in the crypto space. Through the combination of privacy and auditability, Dusk has put itself in the best position to comply with the new regulations.</p>
<p>Dusk is also working on its European Union Digital Identity (EUDI) ambitions and is leveraging Citadel as the underlying technology, allowing the protocol in a much more favorable position when compared to other crypto companies. Dusk uses privacy, a digital identity solution, two custom-made transaction models, and a proxied license to be compliant.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>This exclusive DM feature has been built using the open-source Web3 messaging network of Texas-based startup XMTP.</p>
<p>Coinbase, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchange platforms, has launched an encrypted messaging service on its self-custodial wallet app. This messaging feature has been built using the open-source Web3 messaging network of Texas-based startup XMTP. This service will be initially made available to a small group of users. Ethereum addresses will be able to communicate with each other in a human-readable manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
What can be done with the wallet?
<p>The message feature allows NFT and POAP holders to connect with others who own the same digital assets through direct messaging. This feature will elevate the wallet from mere key holders into a highly interactive platform. It may even evolve into become identities for the wallet holders. All messaging is encrypted, ensuring user privacy.&nbsp;</p>
Coinbase isn't the first with the messaging feature
<p>Coinbase isn't the first to explore Web3 messaging, but it definitely is the largest one so far. Coinbase wallet has a staggering 1.3 million users worldwide. Using the wallet, Coinbase users will be able to move over their conversations from any of the ~450 applications built on XMTP to the Coinbase Wallet. Do note that the messages aren't recorded on-chain, meaning they are not stored as transactions. Instead, XMTP messages travel across nodes managed by XMTP Labs.</p>
What can you do with messaging feature?
<p>Users can leverage the messaging feature to make crypto payments, similar to PayPal's Venmo or Block&rsquo;s Cash App. While the feature will support "thousands of coins" at launch, users who conduct transactions in the USDC stablecoin won't have to pay gas fees. Coinbase wallet users will also have access to personalized wallet labels through Coinbase Decentralized ID (cb.id) &ndash; created in collaboration with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).</p>
Building through the FUD
<p>Coinbase is currently entangled in an ugly lawsuit with the US SEC. On June 6, 2023, when the US regulatory body filed charges against Coinbase, claiming that the crypto exchange had offered investors unregistered securities since 2019. The &ldquo;unregistered securities,&rdquo; in this case, were several cryptocurrencies. Coinbase&rsquo;s responded by saying that the SEC lacks the jurisdiction to regulate the crypto exchange&rsquo;s activities.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The bitcoins were seized from the Silk Road hacker. The government has plans to sell the remaining BTC in batches over the year.</p>
<p>It looks like the U.S. Department of Justice(DoJ) is finally moving the BTC reserves it seized from the Silk Road. The notorious online marketplace, which was predominantly used for illicit activities and operated using Bitcoin for transactions, was taken down by U.S. authorities in October 2013. Here is what Wu Blockchain tweeted:</p>

<p>"Breaking: The Silk Road BTC-related addresses which are suspected to be seized by the US Department of Justice, are transferring more than 9k BTC.&nbsp; https://oklink.com/btc/address/bc1qmxjefnuy06v345v6vhwpwt05dztztmx4g3y7wp?tab=commonTxThe U.S. government previously sold 9,800 BTC on March 14 and said it plans to sell another 41,500 BTC related to Silk Road in four batches within a year."</p>

<p>In November 2022, the US DoJ seized &gt;50,000 bitcoins from James Zhong &ndash; the infamous Silk Road hacker. The transfer was noted across two addresses linked with the DoJ, while the remaining portion of the Bitcoin haul remained untouched. As per Wu Blockchain, the U.S. government plans to sell the remaining bitcoins over the year.</p>
Transactions facing confirmations delays
<p>These transactions faced confirmation delays mainly due to the low transaction fees allocated by the DoJ. The DoJ has made two transactions with a combined $8 in transaction fees. The last time they sold the government sold the seized BTC, they paid over $215,000 in transaction fees, as per court filings. Interestingly, many have noted that by liquidating bitcoin instead of holding on to it, the government has missed out on $5.6 billion. As the practice of seizing cryptocurrencies from illegal activities becomes more common, the financial implications of how and when to sell these assets will become increasingly significant.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The world of cryptocurrency mining has undergone a remarkable transformation since its inception, and one of the most significant advancements in recent years is the rise of cloud mining.</p>
<p>This innovative approach has revolutionized the mining landscape by offering an alternative to the traditional hardware-intensive methods. In this article, we will explore how cloud mining is rapidly emerging as the primary means of mining cryptocurrencies and discuss its numerous advantages.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will delve into the remarkable opportunities presented by Liquid Mining, an application that allows users to mine startups effortlessly, without the need for hardware or coding knowledge. In conclusion, it will be apparent why cloud mining has emerged as the preferred option for crypto devotees, rendering mining both accessible and lucrative via the simplicity of a smartphone.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXZ0UGKpBKo&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Emergence of Cloud Mining:During the initial stages of cryptocurrency mining, people were required to make significant investments in specialized mining hardware and handle intricate configurations. Nevertheless, the emergence of cloud mining has streamlined this process, abolishing the requirement for tangible hardware and technical expertise. Cloud mining provides users with the opportunity to lease computational resources from distant data facilities, thereby delegating the mining operations.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>South Korea will mandate all companies that own or issue cryptocurrencies to disclose their holdings in financial statements from 2024.</p>
<p>South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) issued draft rules requiring companies holding or issuing cryptocurrencies to disclose their holdings in financial statements from 2024.</p>
Local Crypto Firms to Disclose Holdings
<p>In a press statement, the FSC said firms would have to disclose information about their holdings' characteristics, quantities, business models and internal accounting policies. Additionally, domestic companies must disclose information regarding profits, book value, and the market value of their cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The new accounting standards are expected to take effect in January 2024.</p>
<p>In its statement, the FCA said:</p>

<p>The government is enhancing accounting transparency in virtual asset transactions by requiring companies to disclose detailed information, following the&nbsp;passage of the Virtual Assets Act&nbsp;in the parliament on June 30.</p>

<p>South Korean lawmakers passed legislation that protects investors and grants the FSC and The Bank of Korea the power to oversee crypto operators and asset custodians. The newly enacted Virtual Asset Users Protection Act also authorizes the power to impose penalties and liabilities for damages caused by unfair trading practices.</p>
Guidelines Seek to Provide Accounting Clarity
<p>Until now, firms and their auditors differed in their view regarding the timing and criteria for determining whether the sale of virtual assets to customers constituted profit.</p>
<p>Under the FSC's new rules, if companies sell assets, the sale will be regarded as profit after the company fulfils obligations to its holder.</p>
<p>The announcement added that the cost incurred in developing virtual assets and their platforms would not be considered intangible assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With industry-wide crackdowns from the likes of the SEC and exacting regulatory demands coming into force in Europe, it&rsquo;s never been more crucial to implement proper AML procedures.</p>
<p>The crypto industry has received bad press from various mainstream media sources citing how crypto can be used for all kinds of nefarious practices, money laundering in particular. Be that as it may, cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology, and therefore transactions are inherently transparent, and the trail of a suspected wrongdoer can usually be followed.</p>
<p>However, there are always ways and means that a bad actor, who wishes to circumvent anti-money laundering (AML) processes, can employ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One key aspect of AML compliance is the implementation of transaction monitoring systems, such as Know Your Transaction (KYT). KYT involves real-time monitoring of individual transactions to identify suspicious activities, while the verification of addresses helps assess the legitimacy of wallet addresses involved in cryptocurrency transactions, mitigating risks associated with high-risk entities.</p>
<p>In a September 2022 article, the World Economic Forum (WEF) reported a 1,964% increase in cryptocurrencies that are laundered by way of decentralised finance (DeFi). This percentage was equivalent to around $900 million in laundered value.</p>
<p>To combat this type of activity, blockchain analytics tools and experts have made their niche in the market and are being used by companies in their struggle to become and remain compliant. Companies that provide this kind of service normally also offer the ability for a client to be able to fully investigate blockchain transactions as part of their AML responsibilities.</p>
<p>As the crypto sector seeks clarity in the regulatory environment in order to become a more accepted part of the financial system, complying with AML requirements will surely be a non-negotiable item on this path.</p>
How Does Funds Tracing Work On The Blockchain?
<p>Blockchain analytics is a form of data science focused on the analysis, identification, and clustering of data on the blockchain, which is a digitally distributed public ledger. In other words, blockchain analytics is a method that companies use to investigate blockchain transactions and flag potentially fraudulent or illicit activities.</p>
<p>Blockchain analytics involves scraping data from crypto transactions, analysing wallets, and clustering wallets with similar typologies. Analytics providers can create a database and group wallets with similar typologies into clusters. This is an integral step when discovering both the source and destination of illicit funds. Law enforcement agencies and businesses utilise blockchain analytics to combat fraud, enhance compliance, and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>According to the US-based security website CSO Online a crucial part of the puzzle is identifying various addresses that might be linked to the same wallet, and then finding out who owns it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowing the exact entity behind a batch of addresses can be crucial, and blockchain intelligence companies have ways of finding that. They aggregate information from multiple sources, often using off-chain data to enrich their understanding of transactions. They look at dark web forums, social media posts, and court papers among others.&rdquo;</p>

How to Choose the Right Analytical and Business Protection Tools for Effective AML
<p>When it comes to selecting analytical and business protection tools for effective anti-money laundering, 4 key parameters should guide your decision-making process.</p>
<p>Firstly, prioritize a comprehensive and extensive database. The effectiveness of your AML or analytical solution relies on accurate risk identification and detection of suspicious activities.</p>
<p>Secondly, accessibility is essential, ensuring that businesses of all sizes can easily integrate the solution. The onboarding process should be user-friendly and the pricing structure should be affordable. This allows businesses to leverage AML services without facing significant barriers or excessive costs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, consider blockchain support. Your chosen provider should be compatible with a wide range of blockchains, including popular ones, enabling comprehensive monitoring and analysis across multiple networks.</p>
<p>Lastly, visualisation and user-friendliness play a vital role in selecting an analytics tool. The system should provide clear and intuitive visualisations of checks and analysis results. This simplifies the interpretation of data and facilitates informed decision-making.</p>
<p>Considering these 4 parameters when choosing analytical and business protection tools for effective AML will help businesses combat money laundering and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
A comparison of the top 7 AML tools
<p>For crypto projects looking to become properly compliant as regards AML it behoves them to do their research into the leading proponents of blockchain investigation. To this end, the top 7 tools in this industry niche are compared below. Both compliance and analytics tools are considered.</p>
Chainalysis (https://www.chainalysis.com)
<p>Probably the most prominent transaction monitoring and investigation tool out there is Chainalysis, used by government and private agencies to trace and understand blockchain activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainalysis uses its Reactor investigation software that seeks to connect the transactions with the entity behind them. In its transaction monitoring product called &ldquo;KYT&rdquo;, Chainalysis puts its identifications through a rigorous process and offers an API to access this data.</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expensive and inaccessible for small companies. Chainalysis is known to be costly, making it unaffordable for small businesses to access their services. The entry barrier for smaller companies is high, limiting their ability to utilize Chainalysis effectively.</p>
<p>Database&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainalysis boasts one of the most extensive and top-tier databases among all AML providers. Their database is known for its completeness, enabling thorough analysis and investigation of transactions.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wide range, including popular blockchains.</p>
<p>Chainalysis offers a broad set of cross-chain visibility, covering a diverse range of blockchains. They support and analyse some of the most popular and widely used blockchains, enhancing their ability to track transactions across different networks.</p>
<p>The possible drawback of the Chainalysis offering is the lack of cross-chain visibility and an inability to view all address connections in EVM-compatible networks.</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness</p>
<p>When it comes to visualisation and user-friendliness, Chainalysis falls within the average range. While their tools and interfaces are functional, they do not offer the highest level of user-friendliness compared to some other AML providers in the market.</p>
<p>It's important to note that Chainalysis is primarily used for transactional AML/CFT checks (&ldquo;KYT&rdquo;) Chainalysis also offers address screening; however it only shows a direct* exposure (meaning that it analyzes only direct transactions of a wallet).&nbsp;</p>
<p>*KYT transaction monitoring shows both direct and indirect exposure, while address verification is only for direct exposure.</p>
<p>Advanced tracing techniques include automatic peel chain detection and cross-chain graphing, all of which provide a comprehensive solution for de-anonymising wallet addresses.</p>
AMLBot (https://amlbot.com)
<p>AMLBot&rsquo;s one-stop solution includes the screening of all a client&rsquo;s incoming and outgoing transactions, plus wallets screening for AML compliance through integration of its API, with developers on hand to make sure the setup is seamless and conduct blockchain investigations in the case of discovered theft.</p>
<p>Add to this the easy signup and user-friendly interface, and you have an AML solution that is accessible for all businesses, including the medium and small enterprises.</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses</p>
<p>AMLBot offers accessibility to a wide range of businesses, including both B2B and B2C sectors. It provides an easy entry process and offers favourable conditions for businesses, making it accessible to all types of organisations.</p>
<p>Database</p>
<p>AMLBot boasts a broad database that integrates top databases from other AML providers, along with its own proprietary database. As a result, it has one of the most comprehensive and deep databases in the market, enabling thorough analysis and investigation.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company supports a wide range of popular blockchains and continuously adds new ones. This ensures that it stays up to date with emerging technologies and can effectively track transactions across various blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness&nbsp;</p>
<p>AMLBot prides itself on being highly user-friendly, providing clear and intuitive data visualisations. Users can easily interpret and analyse the data presented. Additionally, AMLBot has plans to release a new investigation visualisation tool, which will elevate its capabilities to the level of major companies in the industry.</p>
<p>Overall, AMLBot offers accessible entry for businesses, a deep and comprehensive database, support for popular blockchains, and user-friendly interfaces with clear data visualisations.&nbsp;</p>
Crystal (https://crystalblockchain.com)
<p>Crystal offers simple but powerful visualisation tools and intuitive dashboards, helping a business to screen and monitor all transactions for AML compliance. Crystal also boasts that by using its services a crypto business can achieve compliance in only a matter of days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not available for all types of businesses but more accessible than Chainalysis. Crystal offers limited accessibility when compared to some other AML providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Database&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crystal boasts a broad database that covers a wide range of information. Their database provides comprehensive data to support AML investigations and compliance efforts.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crystal supports the most popular blockchains in the industry. This enables users to track transactions and analyze data across multiple blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness</p>
<p>One of the best visualisations with average user-friendliness. Crystal stands out for its exceptional data visualisations, which are considered among the best in the industry.

<p>Blockchain analytics involves scraping data from crypto transactions, analysing wallets, and clustering wallets with similar typologies. Analytics providers can create a database and group wallets with similar typologies into clusters. This is an integral step when discovering both the source and destination of illicit funds. Law enforcement agencies and businesses utilise blockchain analytics to combat fraud, enhance compliance, and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>According to the US-based security website CSO Online a crucial part of the puzzle is identifying various addresses that might be linked to the same wallet, and then finding out who owns it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowing the exact entity behind a batch of addresses can be crucial, and blockchain intelligence companies have ways of finding that. They aggregate information from multiple sources, often using off-chain data to enrich their understanding of transactions. They look at dark web forums, social media posts, and court papers among others.&rdquo;</p>

How to Choose the Right Analytical and Business Protection Tools for Effective AML
<p>When it comes to selecting analytical and business protection tools for effective anti-money laundering, 4 key parameters should guide your decision-making process.</p>
<p>Firstly, prioritize a comprehensive and extensive database. The effectiveness of your AML or analytical solution relies on accurate risk identification and detection of suspicious activities.</p>
<p>Secondly, accessibility is essential, ensuring that businesses of all sizes can easily integrate the solution. The onboarding process should be user-friendly and the pricing structure should be affordable. This allows businesses to leverage AML services without facing significant barriers or excessive costs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, consider blockchain support. Your chosen provider should be compatible with a wide range of blockchains, including popular ones, enabling comprehensive monitoring and analysis across multiple networks.</p>
<p>Lastly, visualisation and user-friendliness play a vital role in selecting an analytics tool. The system should provide clear and intuitive visualisations of checks and analysis results. This simplifies the interpretation of data and facilitates informed decision-making.</p>
<p>Considering these 4 parameters when choosing analytical and business protection tools for effective AML will help businesses combat money laundering and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
A comparison of the top 7 AML tools
<p>For crypto projects looking to become properly compliant as regards AML it behoves them to do their research into the leading proponents of blockchain investigation. To this end, the top 7 tools in this industry niche are compared below. Both compliance and analytics tools are considered.</p>
Chainalysis (https://www.chainalysis.com)
<p>Probably the most prominent transaction monitoring and investigation tool out there is Chainalysis, used by government and private agencies to trace and understand blockchain activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainalysis uses its Reactor investigation software that seeks to connect the transactions with the entity behind them. In its transaction monitoring product called &ldquo;KYT&rdquo;, Chainalysis puts its identifications through a rigorous process and offers an API to access this data.</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expensive and inaccessible for small companies. Chainalysis is known to be costly, making it unaffordable for small businesses to access their services. The entry barrier for smaller companies is high, limiting their ability to utilize Chainalysis effectively.</p>
<p>Database&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainalysis boasts one of the most extensive and top-tier databases among all AML providers. Their database is known for its completeness, enabling thorough analysis and investigation of transactions.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wide range, including popular blockchains.</p>
<p>Chainalysis offers a broad set of cross-chain visibility, covering a diverse range of blockchains. They support and analyse some of the most popular and widely used blockchains, enhancing their ability to track transactions across different networks.</p>
<p>The possible drawback of the Chainalysis offering is the lack of cross-chain visibility and an inability to view all address connections in EVM-compatible networks.</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness</p>
<p>When it comes to visualisation and user-friendliness, Chainalysis falls within the average range. While their tools and interfaces are functional, they do not offer the highest level of user-friendliness compared to some other AML providers in the market.</p>
<p>It's important to note that Chainalysis is primarily used for transactional AML/CFT checks (&ldquo;KYT&rdquo;) Chainalysis also offers address screening; however it only shows a direct* exposure (meaning that it analyzes only direct transactions of a wallet).&nbsp;</p>
<p>*KYT transaction monitoring shows both direct and indirect exposure, while address verification is only for direct exposure.</p>
<p>Advanced tracing techniques include automatic peel chain detection and cross-chain graphing, all of which provide a comprehensive solution for de-anonymising wallet addresses.</p>
AMLBot (https://amlbot.com)
<p>AMLBot&rsquo;s one-stop solution includes the screening of all a client&rsquo;s incoming and outgoing transactions, plus wallets screening for AML compliance through integration of its API, with developers on hand to make sure the setup is seamless and conduct blockchain investigations in the case of discovered theft.</p>
<p>Add to this the easy signup and user-friendly interface, and you have an AML solution that is accessible for all businesses, including the medium and small enterprises.</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses</p>
<p>AMLBot offers accessibility to a wide range of businesses, including both B2B and B2C sectors. It provides an easy entry process and offers favourable conditions for businesses, making it accessible to all types of organisations.</p>
<p>Database</p>
<p>AMLBot boasts a broad database that integrates top databases from other AML providers, along with its own proprietary database. As a result, it has one of the most comprehensive and deep databases in the market, enabling thorough analysis and investigation.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company supports a wide range of popular blockchains and continuously adds new ones. This ensures that it stays up to date with emerging technologies and can effectively track transactions across various blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness&nbsp;</p>
<p>AMLBot prides itself on being highly user-friendly, providing clear and intuitive data visualisations. Users can easily interpret and analyse the data presented. Additionally, AMLBot has plans to release a new investigation visualisation tool, which will elevate its capabilities to the level of major companies in the industry.</p>
<p>Overall, AMLBot offers accessible entry for businesses, a deep and comprehensive database, support for popular blockchains, and user-friendly interfaces with clear data visualisations.&nbsp;</p>
Crystal (https://crystalblockchain.com)
<p>Crystal offers simple but powerful visualisation tools and intuitive dashboards, helping a business to screen and monitor all transactions for AML compliance. Crystal also boasts that by using its services a crypto business can achieve compliance in only a matter of days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not available for all types of businesses but more accessible than Chainalysis. Crystal offers limited accessibility when compared to some other AML providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Database&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crystal boasts a broad database that covers a wide range of information. Their database provides comprehensive data to support AML investigations and compliance efforts.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crystal supports the most popular blockchains in the industry. This enables users to track transactions and analyze data across multiple blockchain networks.</p>

<p>One of the best visualisations with average user-friendliness. Crystal stands out for its exceptional data visualisations, which are considered among the best in the industry. The platform provides visually appealing representations of data, aiding in the analysis and interpretation of information. However, in terms of user-friendliness, Crystal falls within the average range.</p>
<p>The Crystal platform does offer EVM compatibility across multiple networks, although cross-chain visibility is not provided. In addition, real risk scores aren&rsquo;t always accurately reflected.</p>
<p>Overall, Crystal offers a wide-ranging database, supports popular blockchains, and provides exceptional data visualisations. While it may not be as accessible for all types of businesses as some other providers, it offers a valuable toolset for AML investigations and compliance efforts.</p>
OKLink (https://www.oklink.com)&nbsp;
<p>OKLink says on its website that it is committed to making blockchain data accessible to everyone. It provides data analysis of the major blockchains and its OKLink KYA is a data-driven risk assessment tool that classifies address, and spot transaction risks.</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>OKLink offers accessibility to businesses of all sizes. Whether it is a large corporation, a medium-sized company, or a small business, OKLink provides entry options for a wide range of organisations.</p>
<p>Database&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company has a relatively shallow database, which affects the accuracy of risk scores. Due to the limited depth of their database, the effectiveness of AML analysis and risk assessment may be compromised.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains</p>
<p>OKLink supports a limited number of blockchains. While they may cover some popular blockchains, the range of supported networks is relatively small compared to other AML providers. This could potentially limit the coverage and effectiveness of their services.</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness</p>
<p>OKLink stands out for its excellent data visualisations, which are considered among the best in the industry. Their platform offers visually appealing representations of data, enhancing the user experience and facilitating the interpretation of information. The user-friendliness of OKLink's interface is rated at a high level, making it easy for users to navigate and utilise their tools effectively.</p>
<p>In summary, OKLink provides accessibility to businesses of all sizes, but their database is shallow, which can impact the accuracy of risk scores. They support a limited number of blockchains, potentially limiting their coverage. However, OKLink excels in data visualisation, offering excellent visual representations, and maintains a high level of user-friendliness on their platform.</p>
Metasleuth (https://metasleuth.io)
<p>The Metasleuth investigative tool is still in the Beta stage and accordingly it is free to the user. In fact it does appear to be a very user-driven tool given that user feedback and requests for added features are very much encouraged.</p>
<p>In addition Metasleuth allows analysis results to be shared with others for further analysis, thereby encouraging the creation of a collaborative community.</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>Metasleuth provides accessibility to businesses of all sizes and types, particularly it is useful for individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>

<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses</p>
<p>Available for all types of businesses.</p>
<p>Database&nbsp;</p>
<p>Misttrack has a relatively shallow database, which may limit the depth and coverage of their AML analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains</p>
<p>Misttrack supports only a small number of blockchains. While they may cover some popular blockchains, the range of supported networks is relatively small compared to other AML providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness</p>
<p>Misttrack's data visualisation capabilities are rated at an average level. The user-friendliness of Misttrack's platform is also considered average, providing a functional but potentially less intuitive interface for users.</p>
<p>In general, Misttrack offers accessibility to businesses of all types. However, their database is shallow, which may impact the depth of their analysis. They support a limited number of blockchains, limiting their coverage. The visualisation capabilities and user-friendliness of Misttrack's platform are rated at an average level.</p>

Conclusion
<p>Individuals and businesses are very much encouraged to explore and evaluate for themselves the diverse solutions offered by the top AML tools presented here in order to find the most suitable one for their particular crypto AML requirements. Of course, the list mentioned here is not an exhaustive compilation. There are numerous similar tools available in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s world of fast-moving and highly intelligent entities in the crypto sector, not all of which are following the regulatory rules, the businesses that desire to make sure that they are fully compliant are the ones that are far more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time in coming, but comprehensive regulations are going to be widely enforced across most global jurisdictions. It is incumbent upon all crypto businesses to ensure that their particular AML solution is sufficiently robust for their needs, as penalties for transgressors are likely to be harsh.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Tortola, British Virgin Islands, July 12th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>In its ongoing journey to reshape the crypto investing landscape, Struct Finance, a DeFi platform that enables investors to engage with tailored interest rate products linked to digital assets, is thrilled to announce the launch of the BTC.B-USDC Vaults.</p><p>The tranche-based BTC.B-USDC Interest Rate Product was made possible by effectively leveraging Avalanche&rsquo;s BTC.B (Bridged Bitcoin) for DeFi applications. The new vault beautifully complements Struct Finance&rsquo;s Genesis USDC Vaults, heralding an exciting era in DeFi yield opportunities. Struct Finance built the new vault on top of GMX's Liquidity Provider Token (GLP) to generate predictable yields for BTC in the form of fixed returns, and USDC in the form of variable returns, while still leveraging a secure asset and minimizing volatility and exposure to other risks.</p><p>&ldquo;Our BTC.B-USDC Vaults represent an innovative application of Bitcoin in DeFi.
