			            <description><![CDATA[The tech billionaire intends to make X the “most valuable brand on Earth.”]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Twitter’s sudden rebranding to X has caught many by surprise, it seems Elon Musk has had a radical transformation for the platform in mind for a while.</p>
<p>Here’s what we know about how he plans to change the old “Twitter” – and what it might mean for crypto.</p>
<h2>Baking In Financial Services</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683656350046232578" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tweet</a> published on Tuesday, Musk said that Twitter was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-rebrands-twitter-to-x-this-cryptocurrency-soars-1400-in-return/" data-wpel-link="internal">acquired</a> by X Corp. both to accelerate X’s growth and to “ensure freedom of speech,” one of the billionaire’s primary commitments upon buying the platform last year.</p>
<p>According to the billionaire, Twitter’s name made sense “when it was just 140 character messages going back and forth – like birds tweeting.” However, given the variety of new features on the platform (ex. Long form video) and many others to come, he has chosen to “bid adieu to the bird.”</p>
<p>“In the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world,” he added.</p>
<p>Musk expanded on X’s financial aspirations in an interview this week, when he explained that it could potentially become “half of the world’s financial system,” and the “most efficient database for the thing that is money.”</p>
<p>His statement has raised questions about whether certain crypto-financial integrations could be a part of his plans. Dogecoin – the entrepreneur’s favorite cryptocurrency – is in particular focus, especially after he <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoin-doge-pumps-10-as-elon-musk-links-memecoin-to-x/" data-wpel-link="internal">added</a> the memecoin’s logo to the location field of his X profile on Tuesday.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/LayahHeilpern/status/1683931511496536064</p>
<p>Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino added on Monday that X will be “powered by AI,” onboarding a fast-growing trend among major tech companies like OpenAI, Google, and most recently Apple.</p>
<p>“X will be the platform that can deliver, well….everything,” she tweeted.</p>
<h2>Will This Ruin Twitters Brand?</h2>
<p>Musk’s corporate life has a long history with the letter X: he purchased X.com in 1999, owns SpaceX, and attempted to <a href="https://twitter.com/chafkin/status/1683475959981264900" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">rename</a> Paypal to “X” over a decade ago.</p>
<p>Critics have suggested that his intent to promote the letter will ultimately bite him by scrapping Twitter’s well know brand. However, Musk is convinced that X will become an even more powerful brand of its own.</p>
<p>“X will become the most valuable brand on Earth. Make my words,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683946564115394561" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Rain will now provide the only regulated on-ramp and off-ramp of AED into virtual assets in the UAE.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bahrain-headquartered crypto exchange Rain announced receiving the first Financial Services Permission (FSP) from Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority to operate a virtual assets brokerage and custody service.</p>
<p>The license would enable Rain to offer institutional and retail clients in the UAE the ability to buy, sell and store digital assets. The brokerage will also allow users to on- and off-ramp to the UAE dirham.</p>
<ul>
<li>Announcing the development, Rain co-founder and CEO Joseph Dallago <a href="https://twitter.com/_jayd3e/status/1683774860961497090" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a>,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, Rain is launching in the UAE, as the first licensed retail exchange. This is a 5-year effort, as we were one of the first exchanges to enquire about licensure back in 2018 when the ADGM released their virtual asset framework.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dallago added that the UAE residents will now be able to fund their accounts in minutes, thanks to a partnership with a local UAE bank.</li>
<li>The exec further noted that the customers will be protected through the supervision of a local regulator and a thorough legal framework.</li>
<li>Several prominent crypto exchanges have pivoted to the UAE lately amidst rising uncertainty in the US.</li>
<li>In May, Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-sees-uae-as-a-strategic-hub-for-international-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> that it was considering the West Asian country as a potential strategic hub for its international operations.</li>
<li>More recently, the Winklevoss-led crypto exchange Gemini announced <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/gemini-eyes-uae-expansion-amid-us-uncertainty-crypto-com-gets-mpi-license-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">initiating</a> the process of acquiring a crypto license to serve customers based in the UAE as part of its global expansion plans.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Binance Japan could reportedly go live as early as next week.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange &#8211; Binance &#8211; will purportedly launch services on its new platform in Japan next month. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The firm pulled out of the Land of the Rising Sun in 2018 after having a major dispute with the local regulators. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance&#8217;s CEO &#8211; Changpeng Zhao (CZ) &#8211; has supposedly </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/binance-to-start-full-services-on-new-japan-platform-in-august-1.1950162" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">confirmed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the news in a video conference in Tokyo on July 25 (as seen by Bloomberg).</span></li>
<li>The exchange previously <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/this-is-when-binance-japan-will-officially-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that it will start operating on the Japanese market after June this year. It also informed that customers willing to join the venture will have to re-apply for account opening and pass all verification requirements.</span></li>
<li>It is worth noting that Binance <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-acquires-jfsa-registered-sakura-exchange-bitcoin-committed-to-enter-japan-under-regulatory-compliance-1479109563632749072" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">acquired</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the local crypto platform Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC) to return to the Asian country. </span></li>
<li>The latter, which is directly supervised by Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency (FSA), said it will terminate services between the end of May and the day of the opening of the new entity.</li>
<li>Upon purchasing SEBC, Takeshi Chino &#8211; General Manager of Binance Japan &#8211; described the nation as one of &#8220;the world&#8217;s leading economies with a highly-developed tech ecosystem,&#8221; which is &#8220;poised for strong blockchain uptake.&#8221;</li>
<li>While Binance has expanded to numerous regions globally over the past years, it has stayed away from Japan for over five years.</li>
<li>The domestic financial regulator <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-japan-idUSKBN1GZ096" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">issued</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a warning to the exchange in 2018 for engaging with Japanese residents without having the necessary permission to do so. Shortly after, the organization left the country after failing to comply with the watchdog&#8217;s requirements. </span></li>

			            <description><![CDATA[A Dogecoin video artist just helped create an animation for Twitter’s “X” logo that was picked up by Elon Musk.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) shot up another 10% on Tuesday on greater excitement surrounding Elon Musk’s rebranding of Twitter to “X”.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s rise follows a related post on Musk’s Twitter, where the tech mogul appeared to link X to the famous dog meme.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin and X</h2>
<p>Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683877911315599360" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reposted</a> a nine-second animated graphic of the platform’s new “X” logo. The animation itself was sourced from DogeDesigner – the UX/UI &amp; Graphic Designer at Dogecoin &amp; MyDoge Inc.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/dxbsqwcYv7" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/dxbsqwcYv7</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683877911315599360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 25, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Musk also added the Dogecoin symbol to the location field of his Twitter bio, right next to the X logo.</p>
<p>After publishing the tweet at 12:32 pm on Tuesday, DOGE shot from $0.077 to $0.083 within just 2 hours. It trades for $0.082 at writing time – up 10% over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>A similar rise occurred after Musk officially acquired Twitter last year, and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-teases-dogecoin-integration-for-twitter/" data-wpel-link="internal">rumors circulated</a> about him potentially integrating Dogecoin payments into the platform.</p>
<p>After rebranding to X, Musk promised to evolve the platform for “comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world.” He’s given no confirmation about whether crypto would play a role in that.</p>
<h2>Elon Posts, Doge Pumps</h2>
<p>The price pump is reminiscent of countless times Musk has influenced the memecoin’s price with a single statement or action. In early April, Musk <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoin-explodes-25-after-elon-musk-changes-twitter-icon-to-doge-meme/" data-wpel-link="internal">changed</a> Twitter’s logo into a Shiba Inu, causing DOGE to pump by 25%.</p>
<p>Later that month, DOGE <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/doge-jumps-6-following-elon-musks-1m-dogecoin-offer/" data-wpel-link="internal">pumped</a> 6% after Musk promised a $1 million DOGE donation to anyone who can verify rumors that his family owned an emerald mine.</p>
<p>Musk was also largely behind Dogecoin’s run to its all-time high of $0.70 in May 2021 following a series of bullish tweets about the cryptocurrency – though the coin has since fallen ~90% in value.</p>
<p>For some, his public antics about DOGE are no joke. In June, an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-sued-for-insider-trading-with-dogecoin-using-publicity-stunts/" data-wpel-link="internal">amended filing</a> against the billionaire accused Musk of “insider trading” using his DOGE holdings, deliberately fostering hype for the crypto and using his followers as “prey.”</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Fundstrat envisions a bullish future for Bitcoin and stocks despite pressure from the Fed.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC)’s supply and demand dynamics suggest that the asset could surge as high as $180,000 by April 2024, according to a research note from Fundstrat on Monday.</p>
<p>The forecast – which precedes the U.S. central bank’s next meeting – largely rests on a Bitcoin spot ETF being approved in the United States, which the markets research firm suspects will blow apart BTC’s current price equilibrium.</p>
<h2>The Impact Of A Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>At present, Fundstrat <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-price-outlook-blackrock-etf-filing-demand-180000-crypto-halving-2023-7" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">finds</a> that Bitcoin experiences roughly $25 million in daily demand – about the same value of new coins brought into circulation by miners each day.</p>
<p>“This [bitcoin ETF launch] would bring daily demand to $125 million, while daily supply is only $25 million,” wrote Tom Lee, Fundstrat’s Head of Research. “The implied equilibrium price would need to rise so daily supply matches daily demand.”</p>
<p>“Equilibrium analysis suggests that a clearing price is $140,000 to $180,000, before the April 2024 halving,&#8221; Fundstrat continued.</p>
<p>The “halvening” (another way to refer to the Bitcoin halving) is when the Bitcoin network slashes its BTC emissions per block in half. The event occurs once every four years, and has consistently been followed by major crypto market bull runs in the following year.</p>
<p>The next halving will take Bitcoin’s emissions from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC every ten minutes. Though researchers at Coinbase have suggested it may not cause another bull run, Fundstrat’s analysis suggests the halving won’t even be necessary for reaching a new all-time high.</p>
<p>This bullish outlook is largely shared by <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/banking-giant-standard-chartered-sees-bitcoin-tapping-50k-in-2023-and-120k-in-2024-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">Standard Chartered Bank</a>, whose analysts predicted that Bitcoin will touch $120,000 before 2025, thanks to miners hoarding their newly minted coins in the medium term.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bloomberg ETF analysts Athanasios Psarofagis and James Seyffart <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-pump-and-dump-sell-the-news-or-massively-bullish-analysts-on-potential-approval-of-spot-btc-etf/" data-wpel-link="internal">estimated</a> this month that a Bitcoin spot ETF could accrue $54 billion in capital over time, based on the success of Canada’s much smaller market.</p>
<h2>The Fed’s Upcoming Meeting</h2>
<p>Fundstrat’s prediction comes days before the next Federal Open Markets Committee Meeting (FOMC) when the Federal Reserve is largely expected to raise its target interest rate by another 25 basis points. Despite the Fed’s persistent rate hikes, both stocks and Bitcoin are up year to date, and expectations of an incoming recession are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-are-cutting-back-their-recession-expectations-74118938" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">on the decline</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It is surprising to me that every time the market wobbled this year, our institutional clients are ready to short<br /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&#8211; there is no “buy the dip” <br />&#8211; likely happens when drop in inflationary pressures more evident<br />&#8211; because <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Fed</a> can eventually relent <a href="https://twitter.com/fs_insight?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@fs_insight</a> <a href="https://t.co/6wxrS6zalW" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/6wxrS6zalW</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Fundstrat’s Lee predicts that tomorrow’s announcement will move stock prices by 1%, and believes institutions shouldn’t expect a major market correction anytime soon.</p>
<p>“We’re still in a position where people are bearish and ready to sell,” said Lee to CNBC’s Squawk Box. “No one is really embracing this as an upward new bull market.”</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recently launched Worldcoin human identity verification system elicited mixed reactions among people. While the project deems itself as a privacy-preserving digital identity, many prominent players in the community view the iris scanning process specialized Orb hardware device to be Orwellian.</p>
<p>The crypto-focused project, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has witnessed significant security concerns being raised due to the potential for hackers to exploit it.</p>
<h2>Slow Mist Founder&#8217;s Views on Worldcoin</h2>
<p>Worldcoin is drawing a fresh wave of criticism from the founder of Slow Mist, who does not believe the project has much hope. The executive of the blockchain security expert <a href="https://twitter.com/evilcos/status/1683521011235586050" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a> that if Worldcoin succeeds, it will be an &#8220;evil&#8221; creation but added that it has a &#8220;high probability of failure.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What is an iris? It is the most stable and durable unique mark of your person (unless you are blind), which is much more reliable than face and fingerprint verification. I have read the Worldcoin white paper, and the promises in it are really good, but we still need to be vigilant about a new category of things.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The founder also asked users to exercise a lot of vigilance while interacting with the project.</p>
<h2>Backlash So Far</h2>
<p>Former American intelligence contractor Edward Snowden drew a striking analogy, comparing the protocol&#8217;s approach to treating the human body as a mere ticket punch. The privacy advocate urged his followers not to &#8220;catalog their balls.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Don&#8217;t use biometrics for anti-fraud.</p>
<p>In fact, don&#8217;t use biometrics for anything.</p>
<p>— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1451993036196618251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">October 23, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also published a detailed <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-problems-with-sam-altmans-worldcoin-according-to-vitalik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">blog pos</a><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-problems-with-sam-altmans-worldcoin-according-to-vitalik/" data-wpel-link="internal">t</a> on Monday weighing on &#8220;decentralized proof-of-personhood,&#8221; the concept at the center of Worldcoin. He said the privacy issues in the project are relatively mild but pointed out some glaring centralization issues. The exec also indicated risks such as malicious entities linking one person&#8217;s iris with another&#8217;s app and AI-generated 3D irises.</p>
<p>Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, who is more famously known as &#8216;Shibetoshi Nakamoto,&#8217; <a href="https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1683501141974470656" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">referred</a> to the newly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-crypto-project-worldcoin-launches-wld-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> cryptocurrency WLD as &#8220;creepy and weird.&#8221; Stephan Livera, a popular Bitcoin podcaster from Australia, <a href="https://twitter.com/stephanlivera/status/1683728294267457536" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a> the project is a &#8220;complete dumpster fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the uproar, Worldcoin investors reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1683668998410342403" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">boast</a> high-profile names, including a16z, Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group (DCG), as well as some shady ones such as former FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried and bankrupt hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital (3AC).</p>
<p>Worldcoin, for its part, has been careful not to launch its WLD token in the United States to ensure it won&#8217;t end up running head-first into legal issues, especially at a time when the country watchdogs have amplified their scrutiny.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has once again failed to break above the psychological resistance level of $2,000. While the PA has been bearish over the past few days, there is hope that the market might rebound soon.</p>
<h2><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has been dropping since getting rejected around the key $2,000 level. The 50-day moving average is providing support near $1,850 at the moment.</p>
<p>However, if it breaks down, the 200-day moving average located around the $1,800 level can be counted as the next strong support zone. On the other hand, if the price rebounds from either of these levels, a rally toward $2,300 would be highly probable in the coming weeks.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262480" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262480" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-262480 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_2507231" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262480" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, the price is getting supported at the $1,850 level, following a bearish reversal from the $1,930 resistance zone. While the market is rebounding, there is still a high probability of the breakdown of the $1,850 level in the short term.</p>
<p>In this scenario, a further decline toward $1,750 could be expected. The RSI indicator also demonstrates values below 50%, pointing to the current bearish momentum. Therefore, another bearish move is likely on the horizon before a rally toward the $2,000 mark or higher may be expected.</p>

<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price is currently consolidating around the $2,000 level without showing any intention to rally higher.</p>
<p>One of the most valuable metrics in evaluating the futures market sentiment is the taker buy-sell ratio, which shows whether the buyers or the sellers are executing their trades more aggressively. Values above 1 indicate bullish sentiment, while values below one are associated with a bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>The metric has dropped below 1, indicating that the sellers are selling aggressively. This pressure is one of the prominent reasons for the price&#8217;s failure to climb higher. Moreover, this behavior can also lead to a bearish downturn in price if nothing changes soon.</p>

<h2><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has been consolidating above the $30K level before dropping below it. The 50-day moving average, located around the $29K mark, is currently providing support for the price.</p>
<p>If this level holds, the market will be more likely to rally toward the $38K resistance zone in the coming months. However, if the mentioned moving average breaks down, the 200-day MA trending near the $26K area would be the next likely target.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262522" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-262522" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="BTCUSDT 4H - Jul 25 2023" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262522" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, the price action becomes clearer. The cryptocurrency is currently breaking below the $30K support area, with the next level located around the $27,500 mark.</p>
<p>However, the RSI indicator is approaching the oversold region, pointing to a potential reversal or pullback in the short term. If the price climbs back above the $30K level, a bullish continuation higher may be expected.</p>

<h2><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Bitcoin Funding Rates</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has gradually declined over the last few weeks, failing to rise above $30K. The funding rates indicate that this drop might be due to the futures market sentiment.</p>
<p>The funding rates metric determines whether long traders or short sellers are currently dominant. Positive values indicate bullish sentiment, while negative values indicate bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>Considering the recent funding rates values, marketing sentiment is trending relatively bearish after a few months of optimism. Therefore, one of the prominent reasons why the market has failed to keep rallying above $30K is the selling pressure from the futures market.</p>

<p>Currently, it&#8217;s challenging to identify Ripple&#8217;s direction due to the choppy price action. The most likely scenario seems to be a consolidation phase for the mid-term.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Analyzing the daily chart reveals that Ripple faced significant rejection upon reaching the crucial resistance zone at $0.85. This indicates robust selling pressure and substantial supply around this price range.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to recognize that a consolidation correction stage is necessary after impulsive price surges to validate the trend&#8217;s strength and allow the market to rest.</p>
<p>As a result, it seems likely that the price has entered a mid-term correction phase leading to higher volatility and pullback periods before the next significant movement occurs.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>In the 4-hour chart, it can be seen that the price successfully broke above the upper edge of a channel. However, after reaching the $0.85 region, it experienced a decline with consecutive red candles.</p>
<p>This suggests that a correction period is likely, retracing back to the upper boundary and completing a pullback. If this correction is successful, the market can expect to continue the bullish rally, propelling the price to higher levels.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Market data shows consecutive inflows into crypto-backed investment funds, signaling that traditional investors are experiencing renewed interest in Bitcoin.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest weekly publication of Bitfinex revealed that bitcoin (BTC) balances on centralized exchanges have retraced to levels last seen in January/February 2018.</p>
<p>Bitfinex <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitfinex-Alpha-64.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">found</a> that the balances have plunged by 32% from the 3.1 million BTC peak in March 2020 to 2.1 million now. At writing time, only 11% of BTC&#8217; circulating supply was found on exchanges, indicating a significant decrease from the 17% recorded in March 2020.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Balances on Exchanges Plummet</h2>
<p>The leading cryptocurrency platform attributed the declining BTC exchange balances to the increasing usage of alternatives like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and funds not covered in the analysis. However, the overarching factor is considered to be the widespread movement of people withdrawing their BTC from exchanges.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is also a testament of how longer-term holders are moving coins to cold storage. We see this as a positive for the price as more investors indicate the desire to accumulate rather than trade. Furthermore, we see derivatives market participation continuing to increase, which has historically preceded a break to the upside, as spot prices keep decreasing,” Bitfinex said.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the same time, market data shows consecutive inflows into crypto-backed investment funds, signaling that traditional investors are experiencing a renewed interest in bitcoin and increasing their demand for the asset.</p>
<p>Bitfinex cited the latest analysis by Coinshares, which <a href="https://etp.coinshares.com/knowledge/market-activity/fund-flows-24-07-23?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=Market_FundFlows_240723&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=Minor-outflows-july" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">discovered</a> that crypto-backed investment funds saw a net inflow of $137 million last week, with 99% of the assets directed toward Bitcoin-backed entities. Over four weeks, the gross BTC inflows into crypto funds amassed $742 million, representing the largest since Q4 2021.</p>
<h2>Bulls and Bears Continue to Struggle</h2>
<p>While BTC exchange balances retrace, Bitfinex noticed some unusual whale activity within 72 hours. The exchange’s Whale Ratio metric recorded a significant surge of BTC being sent to exchanges, raising speculation about a potential new selling pressure.</p>
<p>However, upon deeper analysis, it was discovered that the U.S. Department of Justice was moving its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-doj-seized-over-50000-btc-related-to-silk-road/" data-wpel-link="internal">seized</a> BTC stash from the darknet marketplace Silk Road, after which they were re-distributed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BTC has been in a tight range between $29,500 and $31,500 for over 33 days, indicating that bulls and bears are still struggling. The leading cryptocurrency’s next direction is uncertain, but Bitfinex believes the outflows from short-Bitcoin funds could cause the asset to break out <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/on-chain-metrics-and-investor-behavior-suggest-signs-of-a-bull-run-bitfinex-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">towards</a> the upside.</p>
