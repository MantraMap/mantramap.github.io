<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aptos is a promising and ambitious new layer 1 blockchain, and initiatives that support liquidity will assist speed its development. Cetus, an effective capital management project powered by a centralized liquidity algorithm, is one of the initiatives assisting Aptos in attracting financial flow into this ecosystem.</strong></h5>

<p>Cetus is an important component of Aptos&#8217; ever-expanding infrastructure, which collectively generates value for all process ecosystem players.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Cetus?</h2>



<p>Cetus Protocol is an AMM Dex that uses a Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMM) and incorporates elements of Uniswap V3 and Trader Joe. Cetus is written in the Move programming language and works with both the Sui and Aptos ecosystems.</p>



<p>Based on CLMM, Cetus is developing a highly customizable liquidity mechanism. Users may execute practically all types of complicated trading strategies possible on CEX by combining swaps, range orders, and limit orders in a customizable manner. Moreover, liquidity providers may use CLMM to use various different techniques in order to enhance their liquidity efficiency.</p>



<p>In the process of developing a centralized liquidity protocol, it focuses on providing the greatest trading experience and excellent liquidity to DeFi customers and a range of functional modules may connect with the link unit. Other programs may simply integrate or utilize Cetus liquidity thanks to the Cetus SDK toolbox.</p>



<p>Cetus&#8217; centralized liquidity algorithm-based feature benefits both liquidity providers and traders. LPs may earn trading commissions more effectively by concentrating liquidity in the active price range.</p>



<p>During their trading session, traders may trade at low spot prices. Moreover, by combining Cetus&#8217; most powerful source of liquidity with publicly accessible SDKs and smart contracts, developers may simply construct their own products and participate in Cetus&#8217; most powerful source of liquidity.</p>



<p>Cetus, as a DEX, allows the trading of digital assets on Aptos and Sui to be frictionless, safe, and trustless. It also adds liquidity to the market by enabling LPs to bet and receive rewards with their digital assets.</p>



<p>Cetus, as a concentrated liquidity protocol, enables users to trade with leverage, allowing them to receive additional rewards. It also allows LPs to receive greater incentives by increasing their liquidity.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-229.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-229-1024x683.png" alt="Cetus Review: Uniswap V3 And Trader Joe&#039;s Advanced Matching Protocol" class="wp-image-185804" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-229-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-229-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-229-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-229-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-229-1140x760.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-229.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Cetus Review: Uniswap V3 And Trader Joe&#039;s Advanced Matching Protocol 3"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is concentrated liquidity?</h2>



<p>Cetus&#8217; core feature is focused liquidity, which enables consumers to add liquidity within defined pricing ranges. Liquidity is provided equitably over the whole price curve in AMM protocols, which are used by the majority of mainstream decentralized exchanges today. Cetus&#8217; innovative technique, on the other hand, enables customers to define their own pricing ranges, resulting in more efficient price discovery and speedier trading.</p>



<p>Moreover, Cetus enables users to trade directly with one another, eliminating the requirement for a centralized order book. This not only saves trading expenses but also makes trading quicker and simpler.</p>



<p>The issue is that when the price of a trading pair rises or falls, it may be difficult to predict which direction the liquidity provider will react. If you are not cautious, you may find yourself on the wrong side of the deal.</p>



<p>This is why it is critical to monitor the price of a trading pair. If you see that the price is trending in one way, you should keep an eye on the liquidity provider&#8217;s stance. If they begin to purchase or sell the other token in the pair, it might be an indication that the price is likely to reverse.</p>



<p>Of course, this is just one tool that may assist you in making better deals. Nonetheless, keep a watch on the liquidity providers since they might offer insight into where the price is heading.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Cetus&#8217; unique approach to liquidity and trading makes it a far more efficient and effective method to trade cryptocurrencies. Cetus is certainly worth a look if you&#8217;re seeking a more efficient approach to trade.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<p>The Cetus maximizes profits for liquidity suppliers (specifically, the more liquidity is used, the more liquidity providers will benefit from the fees it provides). by centralizing liquidity providers&#8217; money inside a single operational area under a consolidated liquidity protocol on the platform. </p>



<p>From then, the protocol&#8217;s operating mechanism may considerably increase the efficiency of liquidity providers&#8217; capital utilization when compared to other standard AMM DEXs (which typically employ the characteristic model x * y = z).</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-223.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="595" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-223-1024x595.png" alt="Cetus Review: Uniswap V3 And Trader Joe&#039;s Advanced Matching Protocol" class="wp-image-185782" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-223-1024x595.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-223-300x174.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-223-768x446.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-223-750x435.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-223-1140x662.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-223.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Cetus Review: Uniswap V3 And Trader Joe&#039;s Advanced Matching Protocol 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>Users may deposit liquidity and choose a pricing zone for effective liquidity, as with other centralized liquidity AMMs. Moreover, Cetus has four modes to accommodate investors with varying risk tolerances:</p>



<ul>
<li>Conservative: This setting is appropriate for people who monitor the market on a regular basis. This model provides a somewhat broad and narrow range based on the last 7 days of market data. Conservative mode may be more suited to emerging mainstream tokens (strong but still very volatile) like APT, SOL, SUI, and so on.</li>



<li>Active: Similar to Conservative, this option is appropriate for people who monitor the market on a frequent basis. This model provides a somewhat broad and narrow range based on the last 7 days of market data. But, significant time-tested currencies like BTC and ETH may be used in Active mode.</li>



<li>Full Range: If you are a lazy LP who seldom checks your liquidity or doesn&#8217;t have time to go into CLMM, you may just add your liquidity to Full Range. In this instance, the CLMM model effectively becomes a generic AMM.</li>



<li>Custom: If you have the leisure to monitor market developments every few days, you may use Custom options to concentrate your liquidity a little more. You might begin with a sufficiently broad pricing range to establish your viewpoint.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Protocol highlights</h2>



<p>Cetus, driven by its centralized liquidity algorithm, may first redefine capital efficiency for this ecosystem. This benefits both liquidity providers and traders. LPs may collect trading fees more effectively by concentrating liquidity within an active price range. During their swap time, traders may enjoy trading with reduced slippage around the current price. Moreover, by connecting with Cetus&#8217; open-access smart contracts and SDKs, developers may quickly design their own products and become Cetus&#8217; most efficient source of liquidity.</p>



<p>The protocol was first established on Aptos, but as the project expands, it will be expanded to other Move-based blockchain networks.</p>



<p>Move is a new open-source programming language based on Rust that allows you to create secure smart contracts. It was created on Facebook to power the Diem blockchain. Move, on the other hand, is intended to be a platform-independent language that enables libraries, tools, and developer communities to be shared across blockchains with vastly diverse data and execution structures.</p>



<p>Move language is developed with security in mind, avoiding numerous typical Web3 security issues such as reuse, harmful permissions, and permission acceptance problems, phony, etc. The Move Prover tool in the language may also offer extra security for programming tools. Aptos and Sui are both built on Move and are part of the expanding MoveVM ecosystem.</p>



<p>Solana was a representation of the high-speed public chain prior to SUI. Yet, one important reason for Solana&#8217;s lack of stamina in ecological evolution is that there has long been a paucity of permissionless pool-building Processes in the ecosystem. It is difficult for community native or MEME ventures to get traction, resulting in inadequate attention to the ecosystem, a lack of fresh hot money, and the formation of a &#8220;large household chain.&#8221; </p>



<p>For the time being, the state of community native initiatives will be crucial in determining if the ecosystem can thrive fast while SUI is active. Users in Cetus may construct liquidity pools without approval, and projects in Cetus can launch new coins without permission. Cetus will be able to recruit more early project participants and swiftly establish pricing power for long-tail assets in this manner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Active Liquidity</strong></h3>



<p>If the price of a trading pair rises or falls in one direction, liquidity providers will earn more than one token in their position since it indicates more demand for another token from swap participants. When the price hits the higher or lower limit of their position, their whole liquidity becomes one asset, and when the price returns to the original price zone, their liquidity becomes two assets and continues. continue to work</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Range Order</strong></h3>



<p>LPs may create liquidity with a one-sided asset by constructing a liquid position with a price range defined on one side of the spot price. This enables liquidity providers to replicate limit orders, which are prevalent in the order book or CEX markets. A limit order is made with a precise pre-determined buy or sell price and may be executed at any time in the future, while a liquidity position order is one side of the protocol. </p>



<p>Concentrated liquidity has a price tag. When the spot price reaches the position&#8217;s predefined range, a continuous token swap is initiated in the position. If the price has totally broken out of the price range of the position, all of the original assets will be swapped for the target assets, which the LP may withdraw to end the position.</p>



<p>Range holders are considered producers since they operate as liquidity providers rather than swappers when a range order is executed. By establishing adequate liquidity positions, LPs may simply purchase when the price falls and sell when the price increases, much like professional traders, while also earning trading fees.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oracle</strong></h3>



<p>Cetus&#8217; centralized liquidity pool may also be utilized as an oracle, granting access to the pool&#8217;s historical pricing and liquidity data to developers or other platforms. This is a novel alternative to conventional oracles based on offline data in the DeFi ecosystem. The prices and data offered by the oracle based on Cetus are real market outcomes established by actual buyers and sellers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cross-Chain Bridge</strong></h3>



<p>Cetus incorporated the Wormhole SDK into its own user interface to provide a cross-chain bridging interface. Wormhole&#8217;s service completely powers this capability, enabling customers to shift their assets across blockchain networks at their leisure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Price Ticks</strong></h3>



<p>A couple of ticks separate the price line of intense liquidity. There is a gap between each check mark and the check mark next to it. As we move the Tick up and down, we see a 0.01% gain or reduction (1 basis point) in price at any position in the pricing area.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tick Spacing</strong></h3>



<p>Each pool is separated into many liquidity portions, each with its own set of predetermined bounds known as &#8220;Ticks.&#8221; A tick distance of 8 implies that each tick equals 0.08%, whereas a tick distance of 128 means that each tick equals 1.28%. To provide a more comprehensive pricing range, the stable team will employ a narrower tick distance.</p>



<p>Only liquidity in positions with an active price range may be utilized by transactions in a centralized liquidity protocol, producing transaction fees. A liquid position&#8217;s transaction fee performance shows its efficiency and contribution to the protocol. </p>



<p>Consequently, one of the most distinguishing elements of Cetus liquidity mining is that mining incentives will be distributed to users based on their real fee performance rather than their liquidity. If the liquidity provider wants to earn higher fees and mining incentives, he or she must participate more actively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Fee</h2>



<p>In the protocol, it is possible to set up multiple pools for the same pair of tokens with different fees. Initially, there will be 4 tiers allowed by the protocol: 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25%, 1%.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">CETUS token</h2>



<p>It is the native cryptographically-secure fungible protocol token of Cetus. The token is a transferable representation of the protocol&#8217;s ascribed governance and utility functions and is intended to be used purely as an interoperable utility token thereupon. Users may earn it by mining liquidity on Cetus.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key Metrics</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Name: Cetus Token</li>



<li>Ticker: CETUS</li>



<li>Chain: Sui</li>



<li>Total Supply (Max): 1,000,000,000</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Investors and Partners</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investors</strong></h3>



<p>Seed round on May 2, 2023, led by OKX Ventures and Kucoin Ventures with participation from numerous funds including Animoca Brands, NGC Ventures, Jump Crypto, Adaverse, Coin98 Ventures, Comma3 Ventures, IDG Capital, AC Capital, and Leland Ventures for an unknown sum.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Partners</strong></h3>



<p>The project cooperates with many partners such as: Hippo Labs, Port3, omniBTC, LayerZero, Tortuga, Port3 Network, x Celer, Fewcha, MoveMarketCap&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Cetus drew influence from Uniswap and Trader Joe to create a more comprehensive offering since it was born later. The protocol, on the other hand, has a very intelligent development strategy when selecting a destination, Sui and Aptos, in these two new networks the DEX CLMMs have not been developed and utilized strongly, so it is extremely competitive.</p>

<p>Before that, withdrawals at Binance were still working, but problems continued with the Bitcoin protocol. As a result, the exchange halted Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals on Sunday morning US time as the Bitcoin blockchain became overwhelmed with pending transactions and sky-high fees.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We&#8217;ve temporarily closed $BTC withdrawals as the #Bitcoin network is experiencing a congestion issue.

</blockquote>



<p>The company resumed withdrawals within two hours of the first Twitter post about the withdrawal. However, on-chain data shows there are almost 400,000 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions, higher than any seen during the 2018 and 2021 bull runs.</p>



<p>Average transaction fees have also doubled since March, pushing it to a two-year high. Transaction fees are now just over $8, a change of 309% from a year ago.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin inscription token, known by the BRC-20 standard designator, currently has a market cap of $482 million across 14,000 tokens. According to the head of content at Luxor Technologies, a full Bitcoin mining team says that the biggest difference today between this transaction fee increase and past transaction fee increases is the standard The BRC-20 standard is a new way to record.

<p>Currently BTC is trading at $28,624.</p>

<p>It has been confirmed that the prosecution is investigating allegations of cryptocurrency trading fraud by Representative Kim Nam-guk (41) of the Democratic Party of Korea.</p>



<p>According to the legal community, on the 6th, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors&#8217; Office received records regarding Congressman Kim&#8217;s cryptocurrency transactions from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) last year and is examining them to check for any illegal activity.</p>



<p>FIU discovered that Congressman Kim withdrew all 800,000 Wemix coins he owned from late February to early March last year. The details of Congressman Kim&#8217;s transaction were then classified as unusual and reported to the prosecution.</p>



<p>Congressman Kim placed Wemix coins, worth about 6 billion won at the time, into his virtual wallet in January and February of last year and disposed of them all before March of last year when the &#8221;real name coin system&#8221; was implemented. The virtual currency exchange where Congressman Kim&#8217;s wallet is registered reported the transaction details to the FIU. The FIU assessed it as unusual, notified the prosecution, and handed over the relevant data.</p>

<p>Generally, exchanges report to the FIU when funds are traded in large quantities. The FIU then determines if there is an unusual transaction and notifies the investigating agency.</p>



<p>The prosecution requested an order to monitor Congressman Kim&#8217;s account based on the FIU&#8217;s data, but the court denied it. Even then, the prosecutor&#8217;s office has not closed case B and continues the related investigation.</p>



<p>Representative Kim confirmed that it was a normal coin transaction. In a phone call with the media, Representative Kim said, &#8220;It was a transaction without any problems, and I was completely unaware (in connection with the investigation by the Southern District Attorney&#8217;s Office).&#8221;</p>



<p>Concerns were also voiced by the Democratic Party. Representative Lee Yong-woo, who initiated the bill to mandate the reporting of virtual assets, wrote on Facebook that if a state official holds virtual assets, there is a high probability of problems such as illicit gains, concealment of assets, or tax evasion.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Helium from a growing network has a lot of potential, but as it moves through the crypto industry, it has run out of steam.</em></li>



<li><em>The challenges the network is facing are still a problem that needs to be solved.</em></li>



<li><em>Since switching to Solana, the network seems to have improved.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Helium&#8217;s popularity may be attributed to its outstanding idea and growing narrative-decentralized Internet and geographic location oracles: a decentralized wireless network for &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; devices.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The Internet of Things is not the same as the regular Internet or the mobile Internet. The Internet of Things focuses on item connectivity and solves the challenge of connecting devices to the Internet. As a result, the quantity of connectable terminals has emerged as a significant competitive advantage for the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things includes shared bicycles, smart cities, smart agriculture, autonomous smart autos, and smart homes.</p>



<p>Helium is powered by cryptography, and the wireless network is comprised of Helium hotspots, which have antennas capable of sending small quantities of data over large distances via radio frequencies. Of all of the initiatives, its story shines the brightest.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, as time passed, the difficulties that were first masked behind the new chain&#8217;s high-yield bubble began to appear. How did the network blow a good hand, and what went wrong for the team? Why did the team reject Helium in favor of the Solana chain?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Helium&#8217;s development</h2>



<p>Helium&#8217;s history may be dated back to 2013, only a few years after the inception of Bitcoin. Helium may be described as an Internet of Things initiative that has nothing to do with blockchain in its early years of existence. Before 2017, the network recognized the significance of the blockchain and then relied on the blockchain&#8217;s incentive mechanism to capitalize on the trend; today, it seems that Helium&#8217;s choice was sound.</p>



<p>Helium reached its high in 2021 after a steady rise from 2019 to 2021. With token sales, $111 million in funding will be finished in 2021. Its funding quantity is greatly overstated in many public chains, and it is not far behind Aptos. Its potential and prospects as a developing public chain are quite promising. This is also the first stage in which the network began to rise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why is Helium not as successful as expected?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Skilled miners have little advantage</strong></h3>



<p>Helium hotspots offer wireless network coverage for millions of LongFi-enabled devices, and miners get Token payouts HNT for this.</p>



<p>The LoRaWAN communication network is at the heart of the network, for which a blockchain-based incentive layer is being constructed. Moreover, it uses its unique Poc (Proof of Coverage) consensus to demonstrate that HotSpot delivers network coverage.</p>



<p>Since its hotspot mechanism is so tightly linked to the mining process, it was quite popular in the early days.</p>



<p>HNT mining equipment is also very light and small, comparable to a home router, with minimal environmental requirements, the creation of a network is not influenced by the surrounding environment, and mining may begin at home or in the office, resulting in exceptionally low energy usage.</p>



<p>The Bobcat mining machine&#8217;s deployment procedures are very straightforward. You simply need to connect the mining machine&#8217;s antenna and network cord.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, after being voted the community&#8217;s most popular hotspot of the year, the &#8220;Lynx&#8221; mining machine has become more scarce, and the domestic price has typically been fired to 2000-2500U per unit, and the cost of mining for miners has rapidly grown.</p>



<p>At the same time, its unique mining process causes complications at the mining level, making it hard for professional miners to enter.</p>



<p>In contrast to typical mining machinery, Helium does not imply that the dense the deployment, the greater the revenue. To provide more consistent revenue and better output, the distance between hotspots must exceed 300 meters to get rewards, which makes it simple for hotspots to engage in PoC to earn more money, so hotspots do not need to be placed too thickly.</p>



<p>Given the city&#8217;s building density, the recommended spacing between hotspots is between 500 and 1000 meters. Several complicated constraints limit the deployment distance of miners, therefore, many particular coverage effects have been debugged and improved many times.</p>



<p>This complicates the mining procedure significantly. A professional miner team has no benefit in purchasing a big number of mining devices.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Helium is accused of misrepresenting partners</strong></h3>



<p>The collaboration is often mentioned on its website, and the Lime firm logo appears in the press with numerous news publications. Salesforce, in particular, was highlighted as one of the largest firms to collaborate with Helium.</p>



<p>Lime and Helium are both Internet of Things elements with clear strong combo qualities. Based on their Helium connection, users may view Lime scooters accessible near them.</p>



<p>The elements Lime and Helium work well together. It will be a powerful partnership if they can establish a constructive connection.</p>



<p>Helium, on the other hand, does not seem to be striving hard to extend its cooperation region and win the Lime market. Instead, before acknowledging the collaboration, it prominently displayed the emblem on its website, raising concerns about deceptive promotion.</p>



<p>It again emphasizes how trustworthy the platform is by users in May 2021 and added Lime and Salesforce to its client list but left out the tagging. Lime&#8217;s Twitter account directly, but exclusively for Salesforce.</p>



<p>A Lime spokesman indicated in August 2022 that the firm has not had any interaction with Helium since a short first test in summer 2019, and that at the time of the test, a request was made not to use the Lime company&#8217;s name in promotional materials.</p>



<p>Helium has purportedly claimed for years that Lime is utilizing its geolocation technology, and a Salesforce spokesperson verified that the business is not collaborating with Helium. Instead of partnering with Lime or the US software giant Salesforce, Helium clearly displays both firms&#8217; logos on its website, causing uproar in the community. After intense criticism from the community and &#8220;partners,&#8221; Helium&#8217;s official website page deleted the two firms&#8217; logos from the list of collaborations.</p>



<p>Yet the upheaval caused by this occurrence seems to have shattered Helium and Lime&#8217;s possible future collaboration.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-222.png"><img decoding="async" width="599" height="572" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-222.png" alt="Has Helium Completely Failed?" class="wp-image-185777" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-222.png 599w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-222-300x286.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" title="Has Helium Completely Failed? 18"></a></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Significant revenue decline</strong></h3>



<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the increased number of hotspots has enabled Helium to make more than $1 million in monthly income. Nevertheless, sales began to fall in 2022.</p>



<p>In July 2022, cryptography investor Liron Shapira announced on social media that the decentralized wireless communication network Helium had secured massive funding of $365 million but that the monthly revenue of the Helium network and a single mining machine were insufficient. According to his figures, the Helium network&#8217;s monthly revenue is just $6,500, while a single mining machine&#8217;s monthly income is only $20.</p>



<p>Kyle Samani, managing partner of Multicoin Capital, did not dispute the amount. Nevertheless, he believes that IoT clients have significant lead times and that customers did not take Helium IoT seriously until 6 months ago, 6-12, when network testing, hardware upgrades, service portal updates, and delivery were all taken into account.</p>



<p>Helium said two months later that it would forsake its own blockchain in favor of Solana. Helium&#8217;s monthly revenue has steadily declined since then. Monthly revenue started to slip below a million dollars in October, and the income of Lynx mining machines became exceedingly low. At this point, several individuals left the circle. The once-hot Lynx mining equipment seems to be extinct now.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Compatibility issues with EVM</strong></h3>



<p>Helium L1 was created and constructed with the Erlang programming language, which is uncommon in the crypto world. Although this has drawn the attention of important developers and contributors in the blockchain world, the Helium development community is limited in comparison to the Rust language used by Ethereum, Solidity, and Solana.</p>



<p>Erlang is a virtual machine-based interpreted language that currently includes a native code compiler. Erlang has also supported script execution from the R11B-4 version. Erlang is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports functional, parallel, and distributed programming paradigms. Sequential Erlang is a functional programming language with eager evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing.</p>



<p>In contrast to Helium&#8217;s unpopular programming language and development environment, the Ethereum EVM ecosystem has attained unparalleled prosperity after the 2020 DeFi summer.</p>



<p>As a result, BSC has supported EVM since the beginning of the ecosystem, allowing developers to simply convert and deploy Ethereum dApps.</p>



<p>Helium plainly suffers more from the drawbacks than non-EVM-compliant chains benefit from. According to the most recent statistics given by @ProofofGitHub, the number of developers of certain well-known non-EVM-compatible public chains on GitHub greatly outnumbers that of the network in GitHub&#8217;s daily development activity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Helium was not initially an encryption company; instead, it was attempting to establish typical long-range, peer-to-peer wireless networks. Due to financial constraints, encryption was later used as an incentive technique. To create a decentralized network, it used encryption technologies. It got positive feedback and a large number of committed users early on, which is why Helium triumphed in the start.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the company&#8217;s decision to turn to crypto caused it to lose several chances to disrupt the status quo since it did not properly comprehend the encryption area.</p>



<p>Yet, happily, the new IOT Token surged dramatically in the week after its migration to the Solana network. IOT, like HNT, is mined using Helium hotspot equipment. These Tokens are supported by the original HNT and may ultimately be converted to HNT.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The NFT market has dropped significantly recently.</em></li>



<li><em>However, potential factors still suggest that the NFT will return to dominance if the market turns.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Recently, there has been a significant reduction in trading volume as well as interest in the non-fungible token (NFT) market.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-217.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="523" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-217-1024x523.png" alt="Will the NFT Market Return To Prosperity Like Before 2021?" class="wp-image-185768" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-217-1024x523.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-217-300x153.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-217-768x392.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-217-750x383.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-217-1140x582.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-217.png 1463w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Will the NFT Market Return To Prosperity Like Before 2021? 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>Nonetheless, as some claim, NFT will never disappear since the market cycle is normal. There must be a bear market if there is a bull market. Despite the market&#8217;s brief fall, NFTs will continue to exist. Market volatility is typical, and the crypto business has seen comparable ups and downs. Let us now get down to business and explain why another bull market is on the way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Current NFT market scene</h2>



<p>Two years ago, the NFT market saw exponential growth, gaining momentum among institutions, investors, and companies like never before, resulting in the majority of NFT projects reaching new all-time market highs.</p>



<p>Regrettably, the non-fungible token market has seen a terrible downturn in recent months, leaving most NFT projects with substantial losses. The NFT market slump began in June of last year and has since prolonged into early this year.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, numerous industry analysts have predicted that the broader crypto will retest the euphoria in recent weeks.</p>



<p>Key NFT measures, such as trading volume and revenue, were at annual lows last month. Although there hasn&#8217;t been much of a noticeable change, the analytics show that the sequence of new daily lows is coming to an end.</p>



<p>Just six of the top 20 NFT collections by market value grew trade volumes in the previous 30 days, according to data from blockchain analytics company <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/insights/nft/analytics/all-collections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IntoTheBlock</a>. The remaining collections were significantly reduced, ranging from 20% to 99%.</p>



<p>The popular NFT collection CryptoPunks, which is the second-largest by market size, has seen its trade volume fall by 60.30% in the last month. Nevertheless, Azuki, Autoglyphs, and Captainz were the only collections that witnessed overall growth, with price increases of 5.29%, 1.44%, and 36.60%, respectively, supported by an increase in trade volumes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Factors driving the NFT market in the next bull run</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The growth of Layer 2 networks </strong></h3>



<p>Remember CloneX, Moonbirds, and Doodles, the ostensibly blue-chip NFT ventures with floor costs over $80,000? They are now all priced below $5,000 on the ground level. NFT&#8217;s core is a digital collection, some of which are useful, but its primary value derives from the IP+ community.</p>



<p>There are more and more NFT projects now, and this number will only grow until the next bull market, increasing liquidity. Even if the total cake pan gets bigger, the &#8220;cake&#8221; that can be distributed will become less and smaller for most NFT projects.</p>



<p>However, it should be noted that it appears to be human nature to collect things, whether they are physical objects or digital collections, so NFT will not disappear, but the NFT market dominated by expensive projects is likely to change in the future, and mass adoption may be achieved through more Cheap NFT implementation, Reddit is a good example, and they also boldly try to promote popular applications through Layer 2, after all, paying $10 for a $50 NFT is meaningless.</p>

<p>There is little question that the second-tier solution will play an important role in the NFT market since L2 will lower prices and boost transaction speed, making NFT collections accessible to everyone, such as y00ts.</p>



<p>But, when more users pour into the NFT market, even though most people would gather lower-priced NFTs, the values of certain NFTs will rise to some level, just as various automobiles, watches, and other items do. NFT, like other collections, has a variety of pricing points.</p>



<p>Based on the above assumptions, the next NFT bull market cycle is expected to include certain decentralized liquidity initiatives, resulting in a more balanced and stable market, and a varied ecosystem is more favorable to content providers and NFT holders.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New participants in the NFT market</strong></h3>



<p>As the NFT industry develops, additional content providers and traders will join the market, driving innovation and development. In reality, this shift has already started, and the ongoing change is beneficial.</p>



<p>Projects with actual value and long-term potential will thrive in the next bull market, while short-term hype will not provide long-term returns, so which NFT projects should you pay attention to and keep for a long time? A solid NFT project typically consists of three components: strong foundations, an active project creator, and an engaged community.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hard times will highlight surviving projects</strong></h3>



<p>The genuine worth of NFT is found in its creativity, execution, creation of unique experiences, and prioritization of the community through tough times. Having a Web2 audience is no longer important since fewer and fewer individuals are ready to spend $10,000 for a JPG.</p>



<p>In this instance, future initiatives that appeal to both Web2 and Web3 audiences have the potential to ignite the next NFT bull market by increasing exposure, and the subsequent growth will revolutionize the NFT sector as these two worlds merge.</p>



<p>More importantly, new NFT projects in the next cycle will benefit from previous projects&#8217; lessons learned, resulting in better and more innovative initiatives, and this positive cycle of improvement will drive the NFT market to continue to develop, even attract more Web2 giants to enter the market.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFT also has many aspects of long-term value</strong></h3>



<p>With the further popularization and implementation of NFT technology, it will be further validated and pushed. Don&#8217;t forget that the nature of humans who want to gather will keep us interested in this new subject.</p>



<p>Real estate may also be tokenized, which means that a property can be divided into several portions, each with its own set of features. For example, one area may be near a lake, while another is closer to the forest. Each piece of land may be distinct, valued differently, and represented by an NFT, depending on its attributes. Real estate dealing, which is a difficult and bureaucratic process, might thus be sped up by combining pertinent information into a unique NFT that is associated with just the related section of the property.</p>



<p>NFTs, like stocks, may reflect ownership in a corporation; in fact, stock ownership is currently documented via ledgers that include information such as the stockholder&#8217;s name, date of issue, certificate number, and number of shares. </p>



<p>Since a blockchain is a distributed and secure ledger, issuing NFTs in the form of shares serves the same goal as issuing stocks. The fundamental benefit of combining NFTs with blockchain instead of a stock ledger is that smart contracts can automate ownership transfer—once an NFT share is sold, the blockchain can handle the rest.</p>



<p>The excitement, optimism, and FOMO surrounding NFTs will inevitably spark another bull run, pushing the market to a new level &#8211; which is why NFTs are far from dead, and we will definitely see another bull run, though certain market conditions are required, the field will continue to develop and mature, and as NFT technology advances and more people enter the market, the future of NFT market will only get brighter.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>NFTs are the next step in the development of the very basic notion of cryptocurrencies. NFTs advance the reconfiguration of this infrastructure by allowing digital representations of assets.</p>



<p>Notwithstanding fluctuations in the crypto market, the NFT market will soon see the development of a new NFT market considerably richer in culture than earlier ones.</p>

<p>The kidnappers wanted one million euros and gained access to his cryptocurrency software. The kidnappers were unaware that the victim had snapped a picture that may have revealed the location to a coworker, prompting a police response and the arrest of three kidnappers. The victim was unharmed.</p>



<p>The victim is Syrian, resides in Hungary, and, according to what he stated, owns a cryptocurrency management firm in Dubai. Since he had been partying with his new coworkers for many days, his abduction was not forced. </p>



<p>They had met at a beautiful resort on Wednesday, and he had appeared. According to what he told the agents, as soon as he arrived, one of those present greeted him in a PPE suit, which made him suspicious that something was amiss.</p>



<p>He&#8217;d flown in from Hungary for a two-week holiday on the Costa del Sol. He came alone, with just his suitcase, and asked a buddy from Dubai if he knew anybody in the region who could show him around. </p>

<p>He introduced him to an Albanian with whom he had been partying for many days at fine restaurants in Marbella, and they had met this Wednesday in a luxury property in Benalmádena. What he didn&#8217;t expect was for the host and his colleagues to become his own kidnappers.</p>



<p>They tied him up, placed a pistol to his head, and demanded a million euros in exchange for his freedom. According to accounts, the kidnappers allowed him to use his phone to access the programs he uses as a Bitcoin manager and to contact the person who had to pay the ransom.</p>



<p>To release him, an inquiry against time started here. The National Police negotiator at Malaga police station was providing the guy from Hungary instructions on how to continue. </p>



<p>One of the inmates has many phony identities and a history of armed robbery in another part of the nation. Moreover, two of them were in possession of fake Greek passports, but the Albanian did have his legitimate documents. The three remain in police custody, and it is likely that they will appear in court on Saturday, accused of kidnapping, unlawful possession of firearms, and injury.</p>



<p>Kidnapping for ransom by crypto is not a new form, Coincu previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/175563-thailand-kidnappers-extort-in-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> a case of kidnapping in Thailand committed such an act.</p>

<p>According to the meeting, the trading hype activities of Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and other virtual currencies gravely disrupted the economic and financial order and risked people&#8217;s property safety.</p>



<p>To prevent and control the risk of speculation in virtual currency trading, The State Council&#8217;s relevant departments have issued a series of policies and measures, clarifying that virtual currency does not have the status of legal tender, prohibiting the development and participation of virtual currency-related businesses, cleaning up and banking domestic virtual currency trading and token financing platforms, and so on.</p>



<p>When attempting to relate to crypto, the People&#8217;s Court shall carefully study the adjustment of national financial regulation, industrial regulation, and other public policies over time and accurately determine the validity of legal acts related to virtual currency carried out by the parties in accordance with the provisions of Article 153, second paragraph.</p>



<p>As a result, virtual money has certain network virtual property characteristics. If the parties agree that a modest quantity of virtual money will be used to repay debts deriving from mutual trade, labor service, and other fundamental relationships, and if there are no other invalid grounds, the People&#8217;s Court will regard the contract as legal.</p>



<p>Moreover, the trial addressed the subject of mining, which has been a source of contention for the country&#8217;s crypto sector. The disagreement generated by &#8220;mining&#8221; may be divided into two sorts based on the case hearing. </p>



<p>One is that the parties acquire and lease the mining machine that generates virtual currency in order to earn virtual currency via mining activities, and the dispute arises as a result of the mining machine payment. Another way of business is the cooperative mode, which combines mining machine trade, cooperative sharing or custody service, and other various legal relationships.</p>

However, with the evolution comes both the positive and negative most cryptos continue to dip while others experience a surge. Cryptos like Synthetix (SNX) and Optimism are among the ones that have been having quite a rough time within the crypto market.</p>



<p>However, for other cryptos, including SPRK, things seem to be working out. This unique crypto will offer unique advantages and features, making it a must-have crypto portfolio. Sparklo will be a real representation of the bright future that precious metal investors will be part of.</p>



<p>This piece will focus on why<a href="https://sparklo.finance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Sparklo </a>will be a must-have crypto join early for only $0.019.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Sparklo (SPRK) Benefits</h2>



<p>Sparkle will be the first platform to offer investors an opportunity to trade precious metals like gold, silver and platinum. This means that this platform will open up many advantages to its users, including but not limited to the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Security, immutability and transparency: SPRK will provide users with a decentralised platform allowing transparent yet secure transactions without intermediaries. It will apply a unique approach that uses cryptographic algorithms to ensure that each transaction is tamper-proof, meaning it cannot be altered once recorded.</li>



<li>Increased Liquidity: Gold, silver, and platinum can be less liquid, owing to the fact that selling and buying these precious metals is quite challenging. However, applying blockchain technology will help increase the liquidity of these investments by allowing faster and more efficient transactions.</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://invest.sparklo.finance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO</strong></a><strong><a href="https://invest.sparklo.finance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> </a></strong><a href="https://invest.sparklo.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Synthetix (SNX) Takes a Drop in Value</h2>



<p>On April 21<sup>st</sup> 2023, Synthetix (SNX) made a big announcement concerning its low fees and the innovative mechanism used in promoting delta-neutral markets. Synthetix (SNX) went further to announce that it will be working on promoting even lower fees, OI caps, and additional markets.</p>



<p>However, despite all this, Synthetix (SNX) only managed to trade at $2.53 by April 22<sup>nd</sup> 2023, after experiencing a decrease of 0.65% within the last 24 hours. Currently, Synthetix (SNX) is trading at $2.48, leaving investors with doubts about its promises and future expectations. Synthetix (SNX), will therefore, need to put in place the right measure if it intends to grow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Optimism (OP) Future Expectations</h2>



<p>Optimism (OP) is a layer-2 blockchain built to help utilise optimistic rollups to boost the Ethereum ecosystem&#8217;s scalability. With optimistic and reliable rollups, it becomes easy to record all Optimism (OP) transactions, which in turn gains from the security of Ethereum mainnet, ensuring transparent transactions.</p>



<p>Well, Optimism (OP) still remains a prominent scaling solution for Ethereum. This is because Optimism (OP) managed to attract almost $500 million in TVL. However, Optimism (OP) is still struggling to capture the market with a trading value of $2.22 within the past day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Sparklo (SPRK) Upward Trajectory</h2>



<p>With the momentum that the SPRK presale is showing, Sparklo will undoubtedly attain its 40x prediction—a reason why you need to be part of this amazing movement. It recently completed its<a href="https://github.com/Block-Audit-Report/Sparklo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> KYC audit</a> after having completed the<a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/1b45ecb9/files/uploaded/Sparklo_AuditReport_InterFi.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> InterFi Network Audit</a>. This means that SPRK will hold a bright future that guarantees safety and reliability regarding precious metal investment.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Since the Shanghai upgrade, it seems that investors are still interested in staking Ethereum.</em></li>



<li><em>The number of addresses holding more than 1 ETH hit a one-month high</em>.</li>



<li><em>The rise in active deposits seems to be linked to the introduction of a new memecoin named PEPE.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Following Shanghai&#8217;s execution last month, the network has shown that the majority of Ethereum aficionados are still keen to begin staking. The proof is that the number of addresses holding over 1 ETH has hit a new 30-day high.</strong></h5>

<p>Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding more than 1 Ethereum reached 1,750,726, a new one-month high.</p>

<p>When the dust has cleared from Ethereum&#8217;s historic Shanghai upgrade, it&#8217;s time to examine some of the main staking lessons. With the Shanghai update, Ethereum investors may finally withdraw their assets from the mainnet. Some have been expecting to do so since December 2020, when the staking option was first offered.</p>



<p>For over a year, Ethereum pricing has struggled to close above a critical resistance level, and it is now trying to do so again after failing to do so earlier this month. This important psychological threshold is also linked to approximately 24% of the total circulating quantity of ETH, making a breach much more significant.</p>



<p>PEPE, a new memecoin, has resulted in an increase in Ethereum active deposits, with traders transferring their winnings into ETH, possibly pushing the price past $2,000 if the wave continues.</p>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/R2c7gez4__sCl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Santiment</a> chart, an intriguing trend has occurred. The data revealed a significant increase in active deposits inside the network, revealing a pattern that began on 3 May. Nonetheless, it peaked on the 4th and 5th of May, reaching heights not seen since November 2021.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Such optimism is crucial for recovery and may have been a driving factor in the ETH price approaching $2,000. Nonetheless, some selling by 100,000 to 1 million ETH holders has been detected in the recent week. Retail holders, on the other hand, have only begun selling after ETH collapsed last month.</p>



<p>Yet, since $2,000 is a major psychological support level, it would almost definitely generate enough bullishness to start investors moving.</p>
