			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">HSBC Hong Kong, a subsidiary of one of the world's largest banking and financial services organizations, has recently added support for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">This move expands access to digital asset derivatives in the flourishing Asian crypto hub. Jeff Feng, co-founder of Sei Labs, believes that ETFs deliver "simplicity and convenience" for newcomers to the crypto space.</p>
Broader Exposure to Digital Assets
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As of Monday, HSBC Hong Kong customers are now able to trade ETFs that offer exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures based on derivative contracts listed on commodity exchanges. These ETFs, treated as securities, were listed on HSBC Hong Kong's mobile app "Easy Invest."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">HSBC Hong Kong has confirmed to Decrypt that the specific offerings are CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF. The news was initially reported by Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu, who underscored that HSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong, is the first lender in the region to grant its customers access to digital asset ETFs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Jeff Feng, including ETFs on its investment platform provides HSBC Hong Kong investors with access to derivatives, which they might otherwise seek on unregulated exchanges. This new offering represents a clear opportunity for the bank to take the lead and fulfill a clearly identified customer need.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF and CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF are managed by CSOP Asset Management. This firm listed the two products on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December of last year, marking the first time ETFs in Asia had tracked digital asset futures. Both ETFs invest in futures contracts trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), providing a straightforward way for investors to participate in the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
Safer Path Through Regulatory Scrutiny
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the strong demand for spot access to crypto among retail investors in Hong Kong, Feng noted that the demand for derivatives is equally high, if not higher. ETFs offer companies a way to provide crypto exposure without exposing themselves to regulatory risk in a rapidly evolving industry. Hong Kong's financial authorities have recently signaled a shift toward a more open stance on cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The regulatory scrutiny around centralized exchanges has led to caution in launching new platforms.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"If all of the centralized exchanges are getting this much regulatory scrutiny, it wouldn't be too wise to go out and try to launch another," Feng stated. "It's much safer to do what's already been proven. There's a clear playbook."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the United States, futures ETFs related to the performance of digital assets have become more common. Despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) not yet approving a spot-based Bitcoin ETF, ProShares' Bitcoin futures ETF was launched on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"When you have simplicity, what you eventually will get is volume,&rdquo; he said. "People will eventually speculate because it&rsquo;s just so easy," Feng said.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Feng, the "simplicity and convenience" offered by ETFs make them an attractive option for retail traders, particularly compared to other derivatives like options, which require an understanding of more complex concepts.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In a recently leaked internal announcement, Robinhood Markets, the popular online brokerage firm, reportedly plans to lay off approximately 150 full-time employees, equating to about 7% of its total workforce.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This move signifies the third wave of job cuts the company has undertaken in just over a year, reflecting its ongoing adjustments to fluctuating market conditions.</p>
Aligning to Volumes and Team Structures
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As per an internal message obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Robinhood CFO, Jason Warnick, stated that the layoffs were part of a plan to "adjust to volumes and to better align team structures." The company's spokesperson has not issued any statement to confirm or deny the layoffs, but asserted that the firm continually strives for "operational excellence."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The representative's statement read:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We&rsquo;re ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis. In some cases, this may mean teams make changes based on volume, workload, org design, and more."</p>

Possible Reaction to Recent Acquisition and Decreasing Margins
<p class="md-end-block md-p">News of the layoffs follows shortly after Robinhood's acquisition of credit card company X1 for $95 million, which took place just five days prior. It's worth noting that the company had already conducted two rounds of significant job cuts in 2022, reducing its total headcount by 9% in April and by a further 23% in August.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The move was seen as a response to dwindling trading activity and decreased prices of equities and cryptocurrencies, both of which considerably squeezed the firm's profit margins. Together, these layoffs accounted for a loss of more than 1,000 staff members.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Three weeks ago, the firm mulled the delisting of a number of tokens due to an SEC citation. It later went on to delist Solana, Cardano, and Polygon. </p>
Dwindling User Base and Revenue Decline
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At its peak in Q2 2021, Robinhood boasted a user base of 21.3 million active users, generating more than $565 million in revenue. However, recent financial figures paint a less rosy picture. The firm's Q1 2023 results indicated a stark 44% decline in monthly active users and a 30% year-over-year decrease in revenue.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the turbulence, Robinhood shares have seen some positivity, trading at $9.63 per share, representing an 18% increase year-to-date. However, this is significantly down from its August 2021 all-time-high, having fallen more than 82% since then.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The latest layoffs at Robinhood underline the shifting dynamics in the financial technology sector, illustrating the necessity for firms to adapt rapidly to the ever-changing market environment.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Swiss authorities have reportedly seized over $26 million worth of Bitcoin and other digital assets connected to Terraform Labs and its former executives. This move comes as the latest in a series of legal repercussions following the collapse of Terraform Labs' crypto project in May 2022.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The confiscated crypto assets, previously held at the Zurich-based Sygnum Bank, belonged to Do Kwon and Han Chang-joon, former CEO and CFO of Terraform Labs, respectively, according to the news outlet Digital Asset. Swiss authorities executed this action in response to a request from the New York Federal Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, the amount seized&mdash;$26 million&mdash;doubles Bloomberg's prior reports, which suggested that Kwon stored $13 million in Sygnum Bank. This disclosure from June 8 also noted that Kwon had moved an additional $29 million of cryptocurrency outside of the Swiss account. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The seizure comes as authorities in the U.S. and South Korea continue to seek separate charges against Kwon and his associates following the spectacular failure of Terraform Labs and its various projects.</p>
The Collapse of Terraform Labs and Kwon's Troubles
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Terraform Labs and its algorithmic stablecoin project, Terra-Luna, collapsed in May 2022, erasing $40 billion in market cap and sending ripples through the broader crypto market. South Korean authorities subsequently charged Kwon in September 2022 for violating its Capital Markets Act and issued a warrant for his arrest. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Shortly after, the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) issued a red notice for Kwon, a South Korean national. The notice is essentially an international arrest warrant, instructing law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and detain him on charges of fraud.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">U.S. Federal prosecutors also indicted Kwon with multiple counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy. Both South Korea and the U.S. are currently seeking Kwon's extradition.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Kwon and his associate Han Chang-Joon were sentenced to four months in jail by a Montenegro district court for forging travel documents. The co-founder of Terraform Labs was arrested in March in Podgorica, the Montenegro capital, while attempting to travel to Dubai with a forged passport. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite being released on bail in June, the duo has remained in custody, with their detention time to be included in the four-month sentence. Notably, Kwon and his associates reportedly fled multiple countries in 2022 after Terraform Labs' project failure.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As investigations continue and more assets are seized, the full scope of the fallout from Terraform Labs' implosion becomes clearer. What remains to be seen is how the pursuit of justice will continue in this complex, cross-border case involving crypto-assets and high-profile individuals.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Australia's Treasury Department is developing its token mapping framework for digital assets to be both "tech agnostic" and "principles-based," rather than adopting a rigid, "token specific" methodology. This innovative approach aims to flexibly classify tokens based on their function and purpose.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Trevor Power, the Australian Treasury assistant secretary, shared in an interview with Cointelegraph during the Australian Blockchain Week that the purpose of this approach is to structure regulations around the principles of the token's function, rather than focusing solely on the specific technology or token.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"The token mapping paper spends a lot of time talking about the token, the system, the value delivered for the very purpose of trying to structure whatever regulation such that it draws on those principles so then a token can be placed within that," Power stated. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">He further emphasized the intent behind the approach, stating: "It's trying to be tech agnostic. It's not trying to be token specific."</p>
Shaping the Framework
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Power outlined that crypto assets, which change their utility and function over time, would be subject to regulatory review, particularly if they become significant within the ecosystem. This review will ensure that they "graduate through the regulatory system" accordingly, despite previous delays.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">He stressed the importance of creating a robust token mapping regulation that could function in a "tech-neutral" and "principles-based manner," to adequately account for such changes.</p>
Influence and Reception
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Power highlighted that the token mapping initiative hadn't been influenced by recent regulatory enforcement actions by the United States Securities Exchange Commission. Instead, he hinted that Australia's crypto framework might lean closer to the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation in its approach.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As Australia's token mapping framework takes shape, Power welcomed U.S. and foreign digital asset firms to consider the Australian market, asserting that they should align with the token mapping framework, designed to balance innovation and consumer protection:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"There are two arms to every component of regulation. One is to make sure that that framework is there, and the second one is to make sure there's room for industry to grow and be innovative."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Australia's Treasury Department believes that token mapping is essential to understanding how the crypto ecosystem interacts with the country's existing financial regulatory frameworks. They had earlier conducted a consultation process, inviting stakeholders' views on the proposed token mapping framework.</p>

Instead, he hinted that Australia's crypto framework might lean closer to the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation in its approach.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As Australia's token mapping framework takes shape, Power welcomed U.S. and foreign digital asset firms to consider the Australian market, asserting that they should align with the token mapping framework, designed to balance innovation and consumer protection:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"There are two arms to every component of regulation. One is to make sure that that framework is there, and the second one is to make sure there's room for industry to grow and be innovative."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Australia's Treasury Department believes that token mapping is essential to understanding how the crypto ecosystem interacts with the country's existing financial regulatory frameworks. They had earlier conducted a consultation process, inviting stakeholders' views on the proposed token mapping framework.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">NEAR Foundation, the firm behind the NEAR protocol ecosystem development, is partnering with Alibaba Cloud, Alibaba Group's digital technology and intelligence backbone.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The strategic alliance aims to galvanize the NEAR Foundation's reach into Alibaba Cloud's extensive developer ecosystem in Asia and the Middle East. By simplifying the process of launching new NEAR validators via Alibaba Cloud's "plug-and-play" infrastructure, the partnership seeks to attract more developers to build on the NEAR protocol.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;Our partnership with Alibaba Cloud is a major milestone for the NEAR Foundation. It proves that NEAR protocol&rsquo;s technology can truly lift the restrictions surrounding Web3 development, allowing more creators to build exciting applications and helping to onboard billions of Web2 users to the possibility of Web3," said Marieke Flament, CEO of the NEAR Foundation.</p>

Tooling and Infrastructure: Empowering Developers
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The NEAR Foundation and Alibaba Cloud are joining forces to offer Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) as a service to developers and users in the NEAR ecosystem. This service, coupled with multi-chain data indexing, provides developers with a data-query API, simplifying the process of searching data across multiple blockchains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">App developers working on the NEAR Blockchain Operating System (BOS) can now leverage Alibaba Cloud's infrastructure. BOS offers a unified layer for browsing and discovering open web experiences compatible with any blockchain. Its standout feature, FastAuth, enables developers to onboard new users with just an email, eliminating the need for crypto.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;Together with NEAR&rsquo;s Node-as-a-Service initiative and BOS, we support the Web3 community to create exciting applications that will benefit a wide consumer audience. We are looking forward to what we can achieve with this partnership," said Raymond Xiao, Head of International Web3 Solutions, Alibaba Cloud Intelligence.</p>

Market Response and Future Collaborations
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Following the partnership announcement, NEAR's market price witnessed an 8% surge to $1.57, signaling the market's positive response. As part of the partnership's future endeavors, both entities plan to expand their collaboration through participation in a variety of global Web3 conferences and events.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The announcement follows closely on the heels of Alibaba's appointment of new Chairman Joseph Tsai, known for his active investments in the Web3 sector.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to steadily soften early in the Asian session as the pair hovered around the 30266.94 area, a level that represents the 61.8% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 29539.57 to 31443.67.&nbsp;&nbsp; Buying pressure recently emerged around the 29975.80 area when BTC/USD tested the 78.6% retracement of the same appreciating range.&nbsp; &nbsp;The depreciation to this area accelerated after Stops were elected below the 30198.14 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 24750 to 31443.67.&nbsp; The recent rapid appreciation to the 31443.67 area was its strongest level in twelve months and represented a test of the 31488.23 area, an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently elected above the 30127.80 area during the ongoing appreciation, an upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The world&rsquo;s top cryptocurrency exchange is eyeing a move to Dubai, in the midst of its battle with the United States&rsquo; Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance Dubai General Manager Alex Chehade has said that the UAE is the prime destination for crypto businesses and has noted its pro-crypto stance and policies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Chehade notes that the UAE is diversifying away from fossil fuels and has turned to cryptocurrency to achieve this. He also expects the influx of young people to the country to contribute to the rapid adoption of cryptocurrency. In a tweet last June 15, Binance MENA retweeted that over 27.7% of the UAE&rsquo;s population are crypto owners.</p>
Virtual Assets and Financial Diversity
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The UAE has its own regulator exclusively for virtual assets, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Just last June 15, top crypto exchange OKX received an MVP preparatory license from VARA. MVP stands for &lsquo;minimal viable product&rsquo; and a preparatory license allows approved licensees to fulfill all pre-conditions required to undertake MVP operations within the VARA regime. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance itself received its own MVP license last September 2022. All of these point to the UAE&rsquo;s pro-crypto environment and why numerous crypto businesses are eyeing to expand on the country. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a clear framework for people and businesses to engage with, whereas you&rsquo;re just not seeing as much of that elsewhere,&rdquo; Chehade said.</p>
Contrasts and Regulation
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This is in contrast to the United States and the SEC. Binance is currently in the middle of a dispute with the United States&rsquo; SEC and has just filed a lawsuit against the commission last June 23. The SEC and its chairman Gary Gensler in particular, have not flinched on their hardline stance against virtual assets and businesses and there seem to be no signs of a shift anytime soon.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance's interest in Dubai emphasizes the potential for countries with forward-thinking policies to position themselves as global crypto centers. By welcoming industry leaders like Binance, they can drive innovation and economic growth. Conversely, regulatory hostility or uncertainty, as observed in the US, can deter businesses and stifle the sector's development.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The implications of Binance's strategic move extend beyond individual companies or countries. This shift illustrates a key aspect of the future growth of the cryptocurrency industry &ndash; the necessity of harmonious interaction between crypto businesses and regulatory bodies. While the robustness and security of the crypto market are paramount, overregulation can inhibit innovation and advancement. Striking this delicate balance could determine the trajectory of the global crypto landscape.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Polkadot (DOT), one of Ethereum&rsquo;s biggest rivals, has announced an update to its governance system, removing the voting group formerly referred to as &lsquo;First Class Citizen&rsquo; from the network. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a part of our everyday lives, Tradecurve, a new hybrid exchange will become the first crypto trading platform to integrate the technology into its system allowing for AI-assisted trading.</p>

▪ Polkadot (DOT) has entered into a new era after a major update to its governance system
▪ The update has made the Polkadot network more decentralized by eliminating &lsquo;First Class Citizen&rsquo; groups
▪ A new hybrid exchange, Tradecurve (TCRV) will integrate AI into its trading platform to allow for AI-assisted trading.
Polkadot Makes Update to its Governance System
<p class="s5">Polkadot (DOT), a major Ethereum challenger, has announced a major update to its governance system to take the network into a new era of decentralization. As part of the network update, Polkadot launched OpenGov to give the Polkadot community full control of the network by allowing holders of the DOT token to vote and propose referenda to make changes to the network.</p>
<p class="s5">Polkadot hopes to transform its network into a fully autonomous, transparent, &amp; efficient decision-making network by giving users equal rights to vote. As a result, OpenGov has removed the so-called first-class voters like the Polkadot Council and the Technical Committee from the voting. Now, the amount of DOT tokens a holder has determines their voting strength.</p>
<p class="s5">In addition, this new governance infrastructure will allow for multiple governance proposals to be simultaneously voted on by the Polkadot community. With OpenGove in place, Polkadot has been transformed into a fully decentralized Web 3 project where all the governance processes are directly controlled by its community members.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve to Integrate AI Support Into Its Hybrid Exchange
<p class="s5">Since the launch of OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT in November 2022, many projects have been exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.</p>
<p class="s5">Tradecurve is a new hybrid exchange that is building the first crypto-exchange platform with AI integration to support algorithmic or automated trading.</p>
<p class="s5">With the inclusion of AI-assisted trading, Tradecurve users will be able to leverage the advanced mathematical models of the platform to make trading decisions. The AI trading feature of the platform will support several variables, including price, timing, and volume, for users to place trades automatically.</p>
<p class="s5">To add to AI trading, Tradecurve will also support copy trading. With this feature, traders can directly copy the trading positions of other more successful traders on Tradecurve.</p>
<p class="s5">As a hybrid exchange, Tradecurve combines the best features known to centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to create a well-rounded platform. Tradecurve is currently in the fourth stage of its presale, where its native utility token currently retails for $0.018 apiece, but is expected to rise by up to 40% in the upcoming week.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Japanese tax administration has offered companies that issue cryptocurrencies a 30% tax break under a revision of its corporate tax rules. </p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s National Tax Agency (NTA) has revised its corporate tax rules to provide a tax exemption to companies issuing cryptocurrencies. Under the revised regulations, companies will no longer be taxed on unrealized gains. Under the previous rules, companies issuing cryptocurrencies were taxed on unrealized gains at the end of a tax period.</p>
<p>The NTA explained that companies&rsquo; holdings would be excluded from the market evaluation of a company&rsquo;s assets if specific terms are met.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s previously harsh tax regulations forced many domestically established crypto and blockchain firms to set up shop elsewhere. Japan&rsquo;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) approved the proposal for the revised rules in December to improve business conditions for companies issuing cryptocurrencies in Japan.</p>
Japan Introduces Stricter AML Measures
<p>The Japanese crypto industry is changing after introducing stricter anti-money laundering (AML) procedures. Since June 1, tougher AML measures were introduced to trace crypto transactions to align Japan&rsquo;s legal framework with international crypto laws after its AML measures were found to be lacking by the Financial Action Task Force. The cabinet revised the relevant crypto rules in December, focusing on monitoring the movement of illicit funds under the pretext of legal crypto transactions.</p>
<p>Japan is such a significant player in the global crypto market, and the government was forced to address the risk associated with the industry.</p>
<p>Part of Japan&rsquo;s stricter policy includes the enforcement of the &ldquo;Travel Rule.&rdquo; The Travel Rule aims to ensure the precise monitoring of illicit proceeds. Under this rule, any financial institution processing a crypto transfer exceeding $3,000 must share customer information with the recipient exchange or institution.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>If you're a crypto enthusiast seeking the next big investment opportunity or simply looking for meme coins with utility, you're in the right place. In this article, we'll explore the top cryptos of 2023, including Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Ripple, and the newcomer, Caged Beasts (BEASTS).</p>
1. Caged Beasts: Instant 20% USDT On Referrals
<p>Caged Beasts (BEASTS) is not your ordinary meme coin. With its vibrant art style and rewarding referral system, it sets itself apart from the other meme coins littering the market. It has just gone live with the first stage of its presale.</p>
<p>The nascent meme coin rewards members of the community who actively participate in growing the community through its referral system. This system operates by allowing users to generate a shareable custom code that they can send to their friends to invite them to the community. When someone makes a purchase with this code, the referrer instantly receives 20% of the deposit made by the friend in BNB, USDT, or ETH, while the referred friend receives an extra 20% on top of their purchase as a welcome gift.</p>
2. Avalanche: Riding the Wave of Potential
<p>With a $0.18 increase in value over the past 24 hours and a 1.06% upward trend in the last 7 days, Avalanche (AVAX) is capturing the attention of investors. In the last month alone, AVAX's price has risen by 22.61%, demonstrating its ability to be a solid asset if the current trend persists. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, price predictions for Avalanche range from a minimum of $10.04 to a maximum of $9.98, with an average trading price projected around $9.92, and an estimated ROI of -11.7%.</p>
<p></p>
3. Cardano: Top Crypto Of 2023?
<p>Cardano (ADA) is another crypto project that has been gaining momentum recently. With a $0.01 increase in value within the past 24 hours and a promising 6.37% upward trend over the last 7 days, Cardano presents a favorable investment opportunity. The growth of ADA, as evidenced by a 28.45% increase in the last month, positions it as a solid asset for those looking for long-term gains.</p>
<p>In 2023, price predictions for Cardano range from a minimum of $0.173 to a maximum of $0.282, with an average trading price projected around $0.391, and an estimated ROI of 8.5%.</p>
<p>4. Ripple: Recovering From Legal Trouble</p>
<p>Ripple (XRP) seems to be recovering well from its case against the SEC. With a $0.0010 increase in value over the past 24 hours and a positive trend of 5.24% in the last 7 days, XRP continues to show promise. While the growth may be more modest compared to other projects, a 4.75% increase in the last month indicates the reliability of XRP as an asset.</p>
<p>For 2023, Ripple's price predictions range from a minimum of $0.422 to a maximum of $0.489, with an average trading price projected around $0.555. Although the potential ROI is estimated at -0.2%.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Solana: Harnessing the Power of Innovation</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) has been making waves with its recent positive trend, with a $0.02 increase in value within the past 24 hours and a 2.98% upward trend over the last 7 days, Solana presents a favorable investment opportunity. The growth of SOL, as evidenced by a 22.44% increase in the last month, indicates its potential as a reliable asset.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain-based lending platform Soil says it&rsquo;s ready for prime time after achieving compliance with Estonia&rsquo;s local financial markets regulator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The startup has created a decentralized finance protocol that aims to bridge the gap between borrowers such as businesses and private debt foundations, and stablecoin holders who wish to lend their capital to earn yield. The&nbsp; protocol hosts a debt marketplace through which borrowers can obtain financing using tokenized collateral. Lenders, who pledge capital to Soil&rsquo;s marketplace, will earn a highly competitive yield on their stablecoins, Soil says. The protocol&rsquo;s revenue is derived from fees earned for connecting borrowers to lenders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soil said its platform&rsquo;s compliance with Estonian regulations is a key step for the company as it confirms the validity of its business model. According to Soil Chief Executive Jakub Bojan, the company hired teams of lawyers from multiple jurisdictions to ensure its protocol would be validated by local regulators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Despite this great success, we continue to work and do our best to ensure that our project is at the forefront of the cryptocurrency market and is transparent and safe for our partners and investors around the world,&rdquo; Bojan added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soil explained that the security and compliance of its platform is a major priority for the company, as it seeks to position itself for the EU&rsquo;s upcoming MICA regulation, which aims to protect consumers from the risks associated with investing in digital assets. The new legislation ensures that crypto asset service providers respect strong requirements to protect user&rsquo;s wallets, and have certain liabilities in cases where customer&rsquo;s assets are lost. The legislation also covers aspects such as market manipulation and insider dealing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soil said the solid legal support, along with its innovative business model, means that it&rsquo;s well positioned to inspire greater confidence in the DeFi ecosystem among investors.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After hitting a local high at over $31,000, bitcoin looks to be regrouping ready for another leg higher.</p>
<p>That bitcoin has broken out and that a strong uptrend is forming is not in much doubt. The higher high has been made and bitcoin is currently buoyed up by the strong horizontal support at $30,300.</p>
<p>If what is happening with the traditional monetary system is taken into account bitcoin would appear to be a complete no-brainer as a means of moving wealth out of the system and into bitcoin where it cannot be manipulated, more of it cannot be printed, and where it cannot be confiscated.</p>
More currency will be printed
<p>The mainstream narrative of whether the Federal Reserve will or will not pivot into quantitative easing and start printing more currency is not really here nor there, at least in the long term. That it will print more currency is an absolute certainty given the economics of a debt-based system.</p>
How will bitcoin bear up?
<p>However, many economic commentators are of the opinion that bitcoin will suffer greatly as liquidity becomes more scarce and a descent into what could be a dreadful recession provokes a massive sell-off in risk assets.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has never had to deal with such an environment in all of its lifetime so far, so it is going to be extremely interesting to see how it will bear up among other financial assets.</p>
<p>It must be said that it was built for exactly this. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin the Genesis block bore the text:</p>

<p>Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks</p>

<p>This was a reference to the Times newspaper of January 3 2009, when the Great Recession was in full swing and the world was on the brink of economic catastrophe.</p>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto realised that people would need a lifeline to get them out of constant debasement of the currency and an ever-increasing chance of complete economic meltdown.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is due to start its bull market and with its halving coming in April next year it does look like an incredibly good bet. On the other hand, if one holds fiat currency its inherent debasement is an absolute certainty. Education oneself on these matters is the only way to be able to survive what is coming.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Istanbul, Turkey, June 26th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Metatime, the blockchain project building a complete Web3 ecosystem that promises users full control over their finances, identity and assets, has announced its native ecosystem token Metatime Coin ($MTC) will be listed for sale on the leading cryptocurrency exchange, Bybit. Alongside the listing, Metatime is pleased to announce that its smart contract infrastructure code has been fully audited by the independent auditing firm Hacken, completing the process with full marks. </p><p>The $MTC token, which currently has exactly 415,439 registered users, will go live on Bybit on Monday, June 26 at 10.00 UTC, at which time it will be available for anyone to buy, sell or trade. Investors who bought early during the presale will now be able to sell their $MTC, while those who missed out on early access will now be able to participate in Metatime&rsquo;s growing Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, Metatime witnessed enormous demand for its token, raising a total of $38 million via two pre-sales of the $MTC token on the world&rsquo;s biggest crypto launchpad platforms, helping to fund its goal of onboarding millions of new users to Web3. All told, Metatime sold 100 million $MTC at 5 cents, 100 million $MTC at 6 cents, 100 million $MTC at 7 cents and then 200 million $MTC at 10 cents.&nbsp;</p><p>The $MTC token is currently deployed on BNB Chain but will migrate to Metatime&rsquo;s own blockchain with the launch of the MetaChain mainnet on Nov. 11, 2023. For all $MTC investors, relevant information and technical assistance is available through Metatime&rsquo;s support team.&nbsp;</p><p>The official listing of $MTC on Bybit follows the completion of a full audit of Metatime&rsquo;s smart contract code by the respected independent auditor and testing firm Hacken. The report by Hacken highlighted the &ldquo;exceptional performance of Metatime&rsquo;s documentation, code quality, test coverage and security measures&rdquo;. Metatime achieved a perfect score of 10/10 in the documentation quality category, providing comprehensive functional requirements and detailed technical descriptions. It also achieved a perfect code quality score and, furthermore, demonstrated exceptional test coverage during thorough testing of deployment, basic user interaction and system features.&nbsp;</p><p>Metatime&rsquo;s Web3 ecosystem of products include a comprehensive blockchain network and cryptocurrency exchange, plus NFT marketplace, crypto launchpad, blockchain explorer, wallet and stablecoin. The MetaChain is powered by the Proof-of-Meta consensus mechanism which enables all users to participate in network verification and $MTC mining. Metatime&rsquo;s upcoming MetaExchange will set a precedent in the industry by not assessing commissions for all trades that close at a loss, while its copytrade features will enable novices to emulate expert traders.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>About Metatime</p><p>Metatime has emerged as a visionary ecosystem that builds the world of the future, designed from the start to be beneficial to everyone. By completely self-funding its technology development stages, Metatime aims to establish the world's most comprehensive and transparent ecosystem.
