He expects the transition away from the U.S. dollar to only gain momentum. “This is true not only for Africa, but also for Latin America, our Asian friends, as well as Iran, India, and China,” the top Russian official stressed, noting that the USD&#8217;s share is &#8220;steadily declining.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>De-Dollarization Trend Gaining Momentum</h2>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Monday that the utilization of national currencies in settlements between Russia and its partner countries will continue to gain traction, Tass reported.</p>
<p>Responding to a question regarding Kenya&#8217;s intention to pay for oil exports in local currency, Lavrov remarked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, as trade turnover grows, the transition to payments in national currencies will become more practical — this is the future. This is true not only for Africa, but also for Latin America, our Asian friends, as well as Iran, India, and China.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We are already actively shifting to settlements in national currencies, and the dollar&#8217;s share is steadily declining … So, this process will only gain momentum,&#8221; the Russian foreign minister continued.</p>
<p>He then noted that Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has proposed prioritizing the establishment of a payment system independent of the U.S. dollar or the euro that &#8220;would rely on decisions and agreements that would be developed, including within the framework of the BRICS New Development Bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Brazilian president has been a vocal de-dollarization supporter. He recently urged all developing countries to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-urges-developing-countries-to-abandon-dollar-as-global-reserve-currency/">ditch the USD</a> as a reserve currency and use national currencies in trade. He also supports the creation of a common BRICS currency. The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-to-strengthen-economic-cooperation-sherpa-calls-for-increased-trade-in-national-currencies/">strengthening economic cooperation</a> and pushing for increased trade in national currencies.</p>

<p>Alexey Overchuk, Russia&#8217;s deputy prime minister for Eurasian integration, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gofrom/most_popular/trade-bloc-of-former-soviet-states-ditches-dollar-in-90-of-settlements">revealed</a> during the second Eurasian Economic Forum last week that the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) has made significant progress in moving to payments conducted in national currencies. He detailed that the share of settlements made in national currencies in mutual trade between EAEU member states reached 90% in March. &#8220;Therefore, de-dollarization is already a reality in the Eurasian Economic Union &#8230; The EAEU has virtually shifted to payments in national currencies,&#8221; the deputy prime minister stated.</p>
<p>A growing number of countries across the globe have accelerated their de-dollarization efforts. Besides the BRICS and the EAEU, <a class="sc-datlNk icbdzs" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">10 Southeast Asian nations </a>that are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) recently agreed to promote the use of national currencies. Moreover, top officials of <a class="sc-datlNk icbdzs" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/9-asian-countries-discuss-de-dollarization-measures-in-meeting-hosted-by-iran/">nine Asian countries</a> met in Iran last week to discuss de-dollarization measures.</p>

Connolly acknowledged that he is compelled to comply with the Trustee&#8217;s request.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Trustee Drives for Independent Examiner in FTX Bankruptcy Proceedings With Third Circuit Appeals Motion</h2>
<p>The U.S. government, particularly the Department of Justice-appointed U.S. Trustee designated to the FTX bankruptcy case wants an independent examiner assigned to the proceedings. Last December, an attorney for the U.S. Trustee <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-trustee-plans-to-appoint-an-examiner-to-ftx-case-while-sbf-describes-strange-margin-trading-practices/">submitted</a> a written letter to the court insisting that an impartial examiner is needed. Additionally, a small group of bipartisan U.S. senators have also stressed that an independent investigator should be assigned to the FTX case.</p>
<p>The U.S. senators who wrote the letter asking for an inquiry included <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/we-want-you-pro-bitcoin-senator-cynthia-lummis-invites-crypto-miners-to-wyoming/">Cynthia Lummis</a> (R-WY), Thom Tillis (R-NC), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/senator-elizabeth-warren-demands-answers-from-fidelity-for-allowing-bitcoin-in-retirement-plans/">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-MA), and John Hickenlooper (D-CO). However, the team managing FTX has estimated a separate examiner could cost the estate roughly $100 million in expenses. Then during the first week of February 2023, judge John Dorsey <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-bankruptcy-judge-delays-decision-on-appointing-independent-examiner-amid-cost-concerns/">delayed his decision</a> to appoint an examiner, and a week later he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-bankruptcy-judge-denies-us-trustees-request-for-independent-examiner/">denied</a> the U.S. Trustee’s request.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ded.81702/gov.uscourts.ded.81702.39.0.pdf">court filing</a> registered on May 30, chief judge Connolly said “I have no choice but to grant the Trustee&#8217;s motion” after appellant Andrew Vara filed the motion. “No one contests that the Trustee requested an examiner here or that the debtor&#8217;s fixed, liquidated, unsecured debts, other than debts for goods, services, or taxes, or owing to an insider, exceed $5 million,” the judge stated.</p>
<p>Judge Connolly added:</p>
<blockquote><p>The only issue is whether, given those facts, the bankruptcy court could lawfully reject the Trustee&#8217;s request for the appointment of an examiner.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judge Connolly further decided that the court will issue an order in accordance with this memorandum opinion. He also stated that the evaluation of the appeal&#8217;s merits will be suspended until the Third Circuit delivers a ruling. It&#8217;s been approximately 200 days since Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2022.</p>

The cybersecurity experts explained that the vulnerability could have impacted more than $500 million worth of digital assets held in Tron multi-sig accounts. 0d specified that Tron&#8217;s development team addressed the problem by creating a patch for the bug.</strong></p>
<h2>Cybersecurity Researchers Summarize Bug Found Tied to Tron’s Multisig Mechanism, Tron Devs Patch the Vulnerability</h2>
<p>On May 30, 2023, the research team 0d from Dwallet Labs published a <a href="https://0d.dwalletlabs.com/game-of-tron-critical-0-day-in-tron-multi-signature-wallets-2c3e90668dc0">report</a> that uncovers a vulnerability in Tron&#8217;s native multisig scheme. The vulnerability enables any signer of a multi-sig account to bypass the network&#8217;s security measures, irrespective of the designated threshold and number of signers. “This vulnerability impacts over $500M in digital assets that are held in Tron multi-sig accounts,” 0d reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The researchers further stated that Tron&#8217;s developers were notified about the bug on February 19, 2023, and the programmers created a patch to address the problem. 0d said that the majority of Tron&#8217;s validators have already implemented the patch to prevent any potential exploitation of the vulnerability. “We have received a bounty reward for a high severity vulnerability via the Tron bounty program,” the cybersecurity research team disclosed.</p>
<p>0d explained that the vulnerability originated from the verification process of multisig transactions within the Tron network. The network depends on the uniqueness of signatures for identical messages from an individual. However, because of the deterministic nature of the signature generation process outlined in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6979/">RFC 6979</a>, an untrustworthy signer can utilize various nonces (random numbers) to generate multiple valid signatures for the same message while employing the same private key.</p>

<p>The revelation of the Tron multi-sig mechanism bug coincides with the <a href="https://twitter.com/AnonIndustries_/status/1663229977456967681?s=20">discovery</a> of a privacy vulnerability in the Monero blockchain. The bug is said to have existed on the Monero network for three years and has since been <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/8872">addressed</a>. While discussing the Tron multi-sig problem, 0d researcher Omer Sadika <a href="https://twitter.com/omersadika/status/1663493141037473793?s=20">explained</a> that with the deployment of the fix, $500 million is now &#8220;secured.&#8221;</p>

Tether, the stablecoin issuer, has revealed its latest venture: &#x201C;sustainable bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay.&#x201D; Tether has partnered with a licensed local company to make this happen, as it believes Uruguay is the ideal location for bitcoin mining production.</strong></p>
<h2>Tether&#x2019;s Bitcoin Mining Operations Take Root in Uruguay</h2>
<p>Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin in terms of market capitalization, <a href="https://twitter.com/Tether_to/status/1663516281922809857?s=20">said</a> it is gearing up to invest in energy production resources and establish sustainable bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) mining operations in Uruguay. Paolo Ardoino, the CTO of Tether, <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1663518513439428608?s=20">elaborated</a> on their vision, expressing that the team behind energy production and bitcoin mining is actively seeking talented individuals to join their venture. In a recent <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-invests-in-energy-production-and-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-in-uruguay/">blog post</a>, Tether revealed that it has partnered with a local company in Uruguay to kickstart these operations.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As part of this new venture, Tether is investing in renewable energy sources to support and promote sustainable bitcoin mining&#x2014;an essential component in upholding the world&#x2019;s most robust and secure monetary network,&#x201D; Tether stated on Tuesday. &#x201C;To accomplish this ambitious objective, Tether is actively seeking to augment its team by recruiting experts in the energy sector.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Tether&#x2019;s decision to embark on bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay comes on the heels of its recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-issuer-tether-reveals-plan-to-allocate-profits-into-bitcoin/">declaration</a> to allocate 15% of its profits to bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>). Tether&#x2019;s stablecoin, tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>), is also inching closer to surpassing its previous all-time high in market valuation as the asset is just a few hundred million away from this milestone, currently. Regarding its new undertaking, Tether <a href="https://tether.recruitee.com/energy">emphasizes</a> that the majority, or 94%, of Uruguay&#x2019;s energy production, is derived from renewable sources.</p>
<p>&#x201C;By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay&#x2019;s renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible bitcoin mining,&#x201D; Ardoino said in a statement during the announcement. &#x201C;Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.&#x201D;</p>

The discount is apparently due to a popular Australian payment service preparing to cut off the crypto exchange from withdrawals in local currency.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Trading at Lower Rates on Binance Australia</h2>
<p>Australians traded bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and other cryptocurrencies at discount on Binance Australia compared to other exchanges operating in the country on Tuesday. The price difference has been attributed to a popular domestic payment provider&#x2019;s decision to quit processing withdrawals in Australian dollars (AUD) for its users.</p>
<p>Starting from June 1, customers of Binance&#x2019;s Australian platform will not be able to withdraw amounts in the national fiat to their bank accounts through the Payid service. The exchange&#x2019;s announcement came after earlier this month it informed traders that they will not be able to deposit or withdraw AUD through another Australian payment gateway, Cuscal.</p>

<p>As a result, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was selling below 35,000 AUD (less than $23,000) after noon, Singapore time, on May 30, Bloomberg reported, citing data from Cryptocompare. That&#x2019;s approximately 7,500 AUD lower than the average registered on other exchanges such as Independent Reserve and Coinjar.</p>
<p>The price of bitcoin, the crypto with the largest market cap, was at around 34,000 Australian dollars on Binance Australia compared with 43,000 AUD on the Australia-based cryptocurrency exchange <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Markets, Reuters also noted.</p>
<h2>Binance Suggests Stablecoin Option to Aussie Traders</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, a spokesperson for <a href="https://www.binance.com/en-AU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance Australia</a> said that AUD balances could be converted into tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>), the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, in order to &#x201C;facilitate withdrawals and trading activities&#x201D; after June 1. The representative also emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are working hard to find an alternative provider to continue offering AUD deposits and withdrawals to our users.</p></blockquote>
<p>The latest negative development for Binance&#x2019;s Australian arm comes amid increased regulatory scrutiny on the activities of the world&#x2019;s largest digital asset exchange by daily trading volume, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-reportedly-investigated-in-us-for-russia-sanctions-violations/">probes</a> in the U.S. into its compliance with anti-money laundering rules and alleged Russia sanctions violations.</p>
<p>In April, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) canceled the license issued to Binance for its derivatives business in the country. The regulator has been reviewing the crypto company&#x2019;s operations in Australia.</p>

Prices have risen by as much as 10% in that period, with the latest surge sending the cryptocurrency above $0.50. Solana was also higher, hitting a multi-week high of its own.</strong></p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly known as ripple, was one of the biggest movers in cryptocurrency markets on Tuesday, as it rose above $0.50.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD raced to a peak of $0.5049 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, after starting the week trading at a low of $0.4779.</p>
<p>As a result of this surge, the token moved to its strongest point since April 19, when it hit a high of $0.5390.</p>

<p>Today&#x2019;s rally has also led to the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hitting its highest reading since March 31.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 67.55, which is marginally below a ceiling of 68.00.</p>
<p>In the event this upcoming ceiling is broken, there is a reasonable chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> moves closer to March&#x2019;s high.</p>

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) was also in the green, as it moved close to a key resistance level of $21.50.</p>
<p>After trading at a low of $20.30 during Monday&#x2019;s session, SOL/USD bulls took the token to a high of $21.37 today.</p>
<p>This surge saw SOL hit its highest level since May 8, when the token was trading above $21.80.</p>

<p>Following recent gains, solana is now trading 7% higher than at the same point last week, with today&#x2019;s rally sending the RSI to a ceiling at 55.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is hovering marginally below this point, which has resulted in a drop from today&#x2019;s peak.</p>
<p>Bulls will firstly need to overcome the ceiling at 55.00, and should they achieve this, SOL will likely move above $22.00.</p>

Since Ordinal inscriptions&#8217; inception, bitcoin miners have garnered roughly 1,596 bitcoins, valued at $44.37 million.</strong></p>
<h2>10 Million Ordinal Inscriptions and Counting</h2>
<p>This week witnessed the total Ordinal inscriptions surpassing the 10 million mark; as of this writing, <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/d004a26250bae956bbf1fc39b1cdf5027620bd81264e41549b5310e7fdcca202i0">10,142,233 inscriptions</a> have been issued. Moreover, the BRC20 token economy consisting of 24,677 registered BRC20 tokens boasts a combined value of <a href="https://brc-20.io/">$433 million</a>. Bitcoin inscriptions have carved out a niche in the realm of non-fungible token (NFT) markets and currently stand as the second-largest blockchain in terms of NFT sales.</p>
<p>Data from the past 30 days reveals that <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">$190 million</a> worth of Bitcoin-based NFTs have been traded, with the most significant sale being a Space Pepe <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/space-pepes/mint/2c2433f34d6d67cd157f86c2bccb1144fa57b467694aff5be4848456ab654c8fi0">sold</a> for $4.56 million. Having amassed over 10 million inscriptions, bitcoin miners have obtained supplementary fees equivalent to 1,596 bitcoins or $44.37 million since December 2022. In marketplaces focused on Ordinals, 347,129 transactions have been documented, <a href="https://dune.com/domo/ordinals-marketplaces">generating</a> $176.46 million in trade volume.</p>

<p>Among Ordinals and BRC20 marketplaces are Ordinals Market, Ordswap, Ordinals Wallet, Open Ordex, Gamma, Magic Eden, and Unisat. Recently, Ordinals Market <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMiladys/status/1663266300372701185?s=20">collaborated</a> with Bitcoin Miladys on a project to bridge BRC20s with Ethereum&#8217;s ERC721 tokens. Notably, just days before Ordinal inscriptions hit the 10-million mark, Casey Rodarmor — creator of the Ordinals inscription technology — resigned as the codebase&#8217;s chief maintainer.</p>
<p>Rodarmor <a href="https://twitter.com/rodarmor/status/1662617512700420096?s=20">transferred control</a> of the project to an enigmatic software developer known as Raphjaph. Of the 10 million Bitcoin-based inscriptions hosted on the chain, 91% or 9.2 million feature plain text inscriptions. Over 775,000 Ordinal inscriptions comprise image files like PNGs or JPEGs, while the remainder of inscriptions on Bitcoin consist of videos, applications, and audio recordings.</p>

<p>Although Ordinals have gained popularity, several bitcoiners and cryptocurrency influencers have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/debate-intensifies-over-significance-and-implications-of-ordinal-inscriptions-on-bitcoin-blockchain/">expressed disapproval</a>. Some <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-community-divided-scaling-challenges-trigger-intense-debate-as-mempool-overflows/">argue</a> that Ordinal inscriptions contribute to a considerable backlog of transactions and elevated onchain fees for network activities. Detractors have labeled the inscriptions trend an &#8220;attack&#8221; and &#8220;spam,&#8221; asserting that financial transactions should be the sole transfers on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

The two trend lines have moved closer to one another, with an upwards bullish crossover somewhat imminent. Ethereum was also marginally higher today.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) jumped back above $28,000 on Tuesday, with a possible death cross signaling upcoming bullish momentum.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD hit a peak of $28,044.76 today, following a low at $27,563.88 earlier in the session.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s move led to bitcoin remaining close to a three-week high at $28,473, which was marginally below a ceiling at $28,500.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, Tuesday&#x2019;s rebound comes as the relative strength index (RSI) remained above a floor at 53.00</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is now tracking at 54.29, with a ceiling of 57.00 still a possible target for current bulls.</p>
<p>As the session has progressed, earlier gains have somewhat slipped, as market uncertainty remains high.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was relatively more stable during today&#x2019;s session, remaining above $1,900 for the majority of the day.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,879.08 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $1,916.57, as the session matured.</p>
<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, this move saw ethereum continue to track close to its strongest point since May 8.</p>

<p>An upwards crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages has already occurred, which could likely entice further bulls to reenter the market.</p>
<p>In the event this happens, a ceiling at $1,930 will be one of the last points of resistance preventing a move above $2,000.</p>

<h2>Strict Penalties Imposed for Foreign Tourists Using Crypto in Bali, Warns Governor</h2>
<p>The Bali provincial government is cracking down on the use of cryptocurrency as a means of payment by foreign tourists in hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, and various other establishments, according to a report from the Antara Indonesian News Agency.</p>
<p>Bali Governor Wayan Koster said at the Bali tourism development press conference Sunday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Foreign tourists who behave inappropriately, do activities that are not allowed in their visa permit, use crypto as a means of payment, and violate other provisions will be dealt with firmly.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Strict actions range from deportation, administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, closure of business premises, and other tough sanctions,&#8221; the governor detailed.</p>
<p>Koster clarified that the ban on using cryptocurrencies or any currencies other than the Indonesian rupiah as a payment method is in accordance with Law No. 7 of 2011 on Currency. Under this law, individuals who use currencies other than the rupiah may face penalties of up to one year of imprisonment and a maximum fine of Rp200 million (US$13,300).</p>
<p>The governor further explained that individuals engaged in foreign exchange business activities without proper authorization from Bank Indonesia, the country’s central bank, may face penalties ranging from a minimum of one year to a maximum of five years of imprisonment. Additionally, they may be subject to a minimum fine of Rp50 million (US$3,300) and a maximum fine of Rp22 billion (US$1.4 million).</p>

<p>In addition, Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 17/3/PBI/2015 establishes the requirement for the use of the Indonesian rupiah within the Indonesian territory. Koster stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Violations will be subject to administrative sanctions in the form of written reprimands, obligations to pay fines, and prohibitions from payment transactions.</p></blockquote>
<p>While crypto’s use as a payment instrument is prohibited, Trisno Nugroho, head of Bank Indonesia&#8217;s Bali province representative office, clarified that crypto as an asset is allowed.</p>

The bank also warned in its latest financial stability review that such a perception poses &#8220;a future threat to the participation of South African financial institutions in the global financial system.&#8221; </strong></p>
<h2>Central Bank Tasked With &#8216;Protecting and Enhancing Financial Stability&#8217;</h2>
<p>The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has said the country’s &#8220;non-aligned stance&#8221; on the war between Ukraine and Russia could &#8220;pose a future threat to the participation of South African financial institutions in the global financial system.&#8221; According to the central bank, the possibility of secondary sanctions being imposed on South Africa over its alleged pro-Russia stance further threatens financial stability.</p>
<p>In its recently released Financial Stability Review (FSR) <a href="https://www.resbank.co.za/content/dam/sarb/publications/reviews/finstab-review/2023/financial-stability-review/First%20Edition%202023%20Financial%20Stability%20Review.pdf">report</a>, the SARB noted that U.S. Ambassador Reuben Brigety’s weapons to Russia claims had contributed to the South African rand’s rapid decline on May 12. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-african-currency-plunges-to-new-low-versus-the-dollar-a-day-after-the-us-accused-country-of-secretly-supplying-ammunition-to-russia/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the rand’s exchange rate versus the greenback fell to a new low of 19.51 rands per dollar. The decline has continued and this culminated in the rand setting a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-african-rand-plunges-to-new-low-after-benchmark-interest-rate-is-raised-to-14-year-high/">new all-time low</a> of 19.76 per dollar on May 25.</p>
<p>While several South African politicians and government officials have blasted Brigety and accused the United States of bullying, the SARB appeared to strike a more conciliatory tone in the first edition of this year’s FSR report. Explaining the central bank’s mandate, the report noted that while the central bank is tasked with &#8220;protecting and enhancing financial stability,&#8221; it should nonetheless &#8220;refrain from taking actions that would harm financial stability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the report does not directly identify support for Russia in its ongoing war with Ukraine as a step that threatens financial stability, it does however point to the warning issued to South Africa by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen when she visited the country in Jan. 2023. According to the FSR report, Yellen not only implored the South African government and local businesses to comply with its Russia sanctions policy but threatened penalties against violators of this policy.</p>

<h2>FATF Grey-Listing</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the SARB added that the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-africa-added-to-fatf-grey-list-despite-designation-of-crypto-as-a-financial-product/">grey-listing</a> of South Africa by the Financial Action Taskforce only makes the threat to financial stability even greater.</p>
<p>&#8220;The events reported in the media and recent remarks by the U.S. Ambassador to South Africa could change perceptions about South Africa’s neutrality, which could build up to a point where it triggers secondary sanctions being imposed on South Africa. Considered along with the recent Financial Action Task Force (FATF) greylisting, the potential implications for the South African economy are severe, and the considerations from a financial stability perspective pertinent,&#8221; the SARB warned.</p>
<p>In the event that no secondary sanctions are imposed, South African financial institutions’ foreign counterparts may still react to the recent events by intensifying the scrutiny of local banks, the report warned. They may also respond by reducing &#8220;their exposure to South Africa as part of their own risk management processes.&#8221;</p>
