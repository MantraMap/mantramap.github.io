<h2>Putin Discusses the &#8216;End of the Dollar&#8217;</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to some questions Friday regarding de-dollarization and the U.S. dollar potentially losing its dominance during a plenary session at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF).</p>
<p>Putin was asked whether the allegations that he is using Russia&#8217;s conflict with the U.S. to speed up the process of de-dollarization were true, and if so, what the outcomes would be for him if the U.S. dollar loses its hegemony in the international financial system. The Russian president replied (translated by Google):</p>
<blockquote><p>First of all, I want to say … we have never had and do not have the goal of de-dollarization of the Russian economy. And, there has never been and there is no goal of de-dollarization or influencing the de-dollarization of the world economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The influence of one or another currency on the world economy is directly related to the economic potential of the country that is the issuer of the currency,&#8221; Putin clarified.</p>
<p>However, he asserted that the U.S. economy &#8220;is now inferior to the Chinese economy in terms of purchasing power parity,&#8221; stating that &#8220;the Chinese economy has overtaken the American one in volume.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Putin noted that the U.S. still has &#8220;a great economy,&#8221; emphasizing: &#8220;This is an obvious merit of the American people, talented, capable, nobody denies it. It&#8217;s just that today&#8217;s political leadership abuses the trust of the Americans, the trust of the American people.”</p>
<p>The Russian president proceeded to discuss the U.S. government weaponizing the dollar and the potential <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-acknowledges-sanctions-weaponization-could-hurt-dollar-hegemony/">consequences</a> of the USD losing its dominance — a matter that has raised concerns among various individuals, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. In April, the Treasury Secretary acknowledged the risk associated with using financial sanctions tied to the role of the dollar, stating that over time it could <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-acknowledges-sanctions-weaponization-could-hurt-dollar-hegemony/">undermine the dollar&#8217;s hegemony</a>.</p>
<p>Putin detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Using the dollar as an instrument of armed struggle, and there is no other way to put it, they raise doubts about the reliability of the American currency both as a settlement instrument in world trade and as a means of accumulation, a means of reserves.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The reserves of world countries with large economies in dollars are declining from year to year. Not as fast as, perhaps, as some would like, but they are declining,&#8221; Putin described. &#8220;Just as settlements in the world economy in dollars are reduced, settlements in euros are also reduced. Settlements in national currencies are growing, for example, in yuan, in some currencies of the Arab countries.”</p>

<p>The Russian president added: “It is not by chance that ideas and projects to create their own currencies are being born in Latin America, and it is no coincidence that the Arab world has long been talking about creating its own single national currency, and Asia is talking about it. The share of settlements in yuan is growing. If oil producers in the leading Arab countries are now saying that they are ready to pay in yuan for oil, you know, we have absolutely nothing to do with it.” Putin emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>If this trend picks up momentum on the exchanges or other oil and gas exchanges appear, and settlements are not made in dollars, this is the beginning of the end for the dollar. We have nothing to do with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>“It is they themselves who do everything with their own hands, and this gives me every reason to believe that today&#8217;s political elites are abusing the trust of the American people and are themselves leading to the negative consequences that I have mentioned,” Putin concluded. In May, the Russian president said the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-says-multipolarity-trend-will-intensify-warns-those-who-do-not-follow-will-lose/">multipolarity</a> trend will intensify and those who do not follow this trend will lose.</p>

Furthermore, the economist stressed that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell &#8220;is clearly worried about the evolving financial crisis, but doesn&#8217;t want to spook markets.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Peter Schiff Predicts Larger U.S. Dollar Decline Than Yellen Expects</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff issued more warnings about the U.S. economy, the banking system, and the U.S. dollar in several tweets this week.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-no-alternative-reserve-currency-can-replicate-role-played-by-the-dollar/">warned</a> during her testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday that there would be a “slow decline” in the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. Emphasizing concerns that sanctions imposed by the U.S. have motivated a number of countries to look for USD alternatives, she cautioned that the decline in USD dominance is &#8220;something we have to accept.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on Yellen&#8217;s warning about U.S. dollar dominance, Schiff tweeted Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Janet Yellen warned Americans to expect a decline in the dollar&#8217;s share of central bank reserves. But the decline will be far greater than she thinks, as a result of both dollar depreciation and central bank selling. This portends a significant decline in our standard of living.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We have too much debt,&#8221; Schiff stressed in a follow-up tweet, stating that &#8220;our budget and trade deficits are much larger than any other nation.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Fed Chair Powell Is &#8216;Clearly Worried&#8217; About the Evolving Financial Crisis</h2>
<p>Schiff also commented on the Fed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">pausing</a> its interest rate hikes at the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Fed Chair Powell’s “rationale for skipping a rate hike, while admitting the risks to inflation are still to the upside, doesn&#8217;t make sense,” Schiff opined, asserting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Powell is clearly worried about the evolving financial crisis, but doesn&#8217;t want to spook markets. So he&#8217;s done hiking, but doesn&#8217;t want to admit it.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Don&#8217;t believe the hype on the Fed&#8217;s hawkish pause on rates. If the Fed really was hawkish, it wouldn&#8217;t have skipped this rate hike. There&#8217;s a good chance that the Fed&#8217;s next move on rates will be a cut, not because inflation is lower, but because the labor market finally cracks,” he added. Powell said at a press conference Wednesday that while &#8220;it will be appropriate to cut rates at a time when inflation is coming down really significantly, we&#8217;re talking about a couple years out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schiff also predicted that there will be “the biggest bank run in world history,” noting that “It will make the small runs of the Great Depression look like a Sunday school picnic.”</p>

<h2>More Banks Are on the Verge of Failing, Says Kiyosaki</h2>
<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has issued more warnings about the U.S. economy and the banking system. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>The renowned author warned of impending bank failures in a tweet Thursday. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>More banks about to fail. Rumor is mortgage giant Loan Depot is on the ropes. Regional banks and mortgage companies are falling.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then urged everyone to be careful. &#8220;I would not believe anything Pres Biden, Fed Chairman Powell, or Sec Treasury Yellen says. Think for yourself,&#8221; Kiyosaki advised.</p>
<p>Many people on social media agreed with the famous author that more banks are on the brink of failure, including economist and gold bug Peter Schiff, who tweeted: &#8220;Correct, but this was the inevitable consequence of obvious monetary and fiscal policy mistakes made over the years. Fed and federal policy are the reasons the U.S. banking system is now insolvent, and why this financial crisis will be much worse than the last one they created.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schiff further expressed his concern that the current banking crisis could lead to a major bank run. &#8220;This is going to be the biggest bank run in world history. It will make the small runs of the Great Depression look like a Sunday school picnic,&#8221; he opined. The economist&#8217;s comment was in response to a <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1669808214093725701">tweet</a> highlighting a significant decline in bank deposits, which tumbled by $79.2 billion in the past week — the biggest drop since March 22. The unadjusted drop was even larger, at $86.6 billion.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p>This was not the first time Kiyosaki warned about banks failing. In April, the famous author said the Federal Reserve is destroying regional banks across the U.S. He explained that by supporting only big banks, like JPMorgan Chase, the Fed is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-regional-banks-are-being-wiped-out-calls-fed-criminal/">wiping out regional banks</a> which are &#8220;the heart and soul of America.&#8221; Several major banks failed in March, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/first-citizens-bank-acquires-silicon-valley-bank-costing-fdic-deposit-insurance-fund-an-estimated-20b/">Silicon Valley Bank</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ny-regulators-seize-control-of-signature-bank-depositors-assured-by-federal-bailout/">Signature Bank</a>.</p>
<p>The Rich Dad Poor Dad author’s warnings also extend to the global economy. In February, he warned that the world economy is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-world-economy-on-the-verge-of-collapse-warns-of-bank-runs-frozen-savings-bail-ins/">on the verge of collapse</a>, noting that there will be runs on banks, frozen savings, and bail-ins. He has consistently recommended buying gold, silver, and bitcoin, stating that these three investments are the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-stocks-bonds-mutual-funds-says-bitcoin-best-for-unstable-times/">best</a> for &#8220;unstable times.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Steve Hanke: &#8216;I Think the Fed Doesn&#8217;t Know What It&#8217;s Doing&#8217;</h2>
<p>During a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/4GCU6PbrCjc">interview</a> with Kitco News’ lead anchor Michelle Makori, economist <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/steve-hanke-blasts-bitcoin-it-is-not-a-currency-and-has-a-fundamental-value-of-zero/">Steve Hanke</a> delved into the future of the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s recent decision to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">halt</a> the federal funds rate at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hanke emphasized that while the interest rate garners significant attention, it is the monetary supply that warrants closer scrutiny. He pointed out that Federal Reserve chairman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-chairman-jerome-powell-faces-political-pressure-over-interest-rate-hikes/">Jerome Powell</a> acknowledged the continuation of quantitative tightening despite the pause in rate hikes.</p>

<p>Hanke said the money supply has been contracting since last April, and he noted that it has shrunk by 4.6%. He emphasized that one would have to go back to 1938 or 1939 to &#8220;find that kind of shrinkage.&#8221; The economist insisted that contractions and expansions in the money supply will transmit changes throughout the economy, and within about six months, there will be changes in sensitive asset prices.</p>
<p>He commented that if you look ahead 12 to 24 months, “you get changes in broad-based inflation so what we&#8217;ve seen here is that since the money supply peaked.” “What does that mean?” Hanke asked himself. “That means the economy is going to be crashing.” The economist emphasized that “inflation is falling very rapidly because the money supply has been contracting very rapidly.” Hanke added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eventually, we&#8217;re going to have the economy contracting very rapidly.</p></blockquote>
<p>The economist said that the Fed doesn&#8217;t pay much attention to the money supply because it believes the money supply is &#8220;not a reliable indicator.&#8221; Yet Hanke insists they are &#8220;ignoring the evidence&#8221; and the “models that they have are post-Keynesian macroeconomic models that don’t include money.” Hanke wholeheartedly believes a “recession is baked in the cake given these money supply contractions.” Due to economic lag, Hanke said it could be anywhere between six to eighteen months.</p>
<p>“I think the Fed doesn&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s doing,” he told Makori. “Remember they have doubled down on this money supply business and chairman Powell has repeatedly said in public the Fed doesn&#8217;t pay any attention to the money supply.”</p>

<p>Hanke said that banks are now tightening and reducing assets to &#8220;meet the demands of the regulators.&#8221; He believes that the Fed could change its approach if there&#8217;s a &#8220;credit crunch on Wall Street.&#8221; “The only thing that could make them pivot is if they have some kind of credit or liquidity crash, or squeeze on Wall Street,” Hanke said.</p>
<p>The economist has long been critical of the Federal Reserve, and during the conversation with Makori, Hanke also discussed gold. He expressed a positive outlook on gold, citing its past performance during recessions. He also mentioned how central banks were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-ramped-up-gold-production-during-q1-amidst-steady-demand-from-central-banks/">purchasing</a> lots of gold in recent times. Hanke concluded by discussing how inflation should be handled in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-venezuelan-gold-battle-continues-argentina-seeks-yuan-funding-extension/">Argentina</a>.</p>

Musk&#8217;s attorney, Alex Spiro, stated in a written communication to the plaintiff&#8217;s lawyer that the claim of Musk owning specific wallets is “without basis” and he firmly asserts the plaintiffs “are wrong.”</strong></p>
<h2>Musk&#8217;s Lawyer Claims Plaintiffs Are Wrong to Tether the Tesla Exec to Dogecoin Whale Wallets</h2>
<p>In early June 2023, Elon Musk of Tesla faced <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-faces-insider-trading-accusations-in-dogecoin-lawsuit-over-twitter-logo-change/">new allegations</a> of insider trading in a lawsuit that accuses him of engaging in pump-and-dump activities with dogecoin (DOGE). The lawyers representing the plaintiffs claim that Musk&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/totally-irresponsible-bitcoin-proponents-express-discontent-over-twitters-doge-logo-change/">change of the Twitter logo</a> from the blue bird to the Dogecoin logo was a part of his purported scheme. Nevertheless, the New York Post has <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/15/elon-musk-denies-owning-dogecoin-cryptocurrency-wallets/">obtained a letter</a> from Musk&#8217;s attorney, Alex Spiro, which argues that Musk is not the alleged DOGE whale that the accusers are portraying him to be.</p>
<p>“You specifically allege, without basis, that the following wallets ‘belong’ to defendants,” Spiro’s missive to the plaintiff’s lawyer Evan Spencer. “You are wrong. The sole basis for your claim is that these wallets sold dogecoin at a time when, according to the third amended complaint, prices were up,” Spiro’s letter adds.</p>
<p>In April, Musk&#8217;s legal team <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-asks-judge-to-dismiss-258b-dogecoin-lawsuit-insists-tweeting-support-for-doge-isnt-unlawful/">sought</a> to have the case dismissed, contending that there was no wrongdoing in tweeting about a legitimate currency. The plaintiffs, who filed the case in June 2022, maintain that Musk is involved in a &#8220;crypto pyramid scheme&#8221; with DOGE. The initial complaint alleges that the &#8220;plaintiffs and the class have lost approximately $86 billion in this crypto pyramid scheme.”</p>

<p>Upon reviewing the letter from Musk&#8217;s attorney, the New York Post quoted the plaintiff&#8217;s lawyer, Spencer. In a statement provided to the Post, Spencer remarked, “This case will be fought in court, not the media. “The plaintiffs and I are more confident than ever that the case will be successful.”</p>

Nevertheless, these five charges have been &#8220;severed&#8221; and deferred until 2024, potentially leaving SBF&#8217;s legal team to juggle two cases in the future.</strong></p>
<h2>5 Counts Against SBF Severed and Scheduled for Another Trial</h2>
<p>Initially, FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) faced eight charges when indicted by the U.S. government, but shortly after, an additional five charges were tacked on including alleged <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-faces-new-charges-in-multi-billion-dollar-fraud-case/">bank fraud</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-faces-new-bribery-charges-for-alleged-crypto-payment-to-chinese-officials/">bribing</a> a Chinese government official. Yet, on June 14, federal prosecutors <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/165/united-states-v-bankman-fried/">sought to detach</a> these five supplementary charges, citing the need for approval from the Bahamian judicial system to fulfill the U.S.-Bahamas extradition treaty conditions. Consequently, the U.S. government requested a specialty waiver from the Bahamas regarding this issue.</p>
<p>Although SBF is set to confront the initial eight indictment charges in October, the remaining five charges will be addressed in a trial slated for <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/165/united-states-v-bankman-fried/">March 11, 2024</a>. This trial will encompass counts four, six, nine, ten, and thirteen entailing bank fraud, derivatives and securities fraud, bribery, and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. As reported by Isource News—a Twitter account offering &#8220;minute-by-minute intelligence from named and unnamed sources&#8221;— <a href="https://twitter.com/isource_news/status/1669396297529565186?s=20">sources claim</a> that it appears SBF is &#8220;unlikely to see any jail time after major counts dropped today.&#8221;</p>

<p>Citing an anonymous legal analyst, Isource News stated: &#8220;The prosecution is busily dismantling their own case to a degree that&#8217;s obvious. Someone doesn&#8217;t want SBF to get any jail time.&#8221; Additionally, Isource News <a href="https://twitter.com/isource_news/status/1669395501664579585?s=20">referenced</a> an insider who claimed: &#8220;The rest [of the charges] will be plea-bargained away.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, defense attorney <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-ftx-co-founder-sbf-retains-white-collar-lawyer-who-represented-ghislaine-maxwell/">Marc Cohen</a>—who previously represented convicted sex trafficker, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jeffrey-epstein-confidant-ghislaine-maxwell-reddit-post-bitcoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghislaine Maxwell</span></a>—requested the dismissal of the five charges. &#8220;We think [a] dismissal of those counts would be the better outcome,&#8221; Cohen <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-offers-drop-charges-now-sam-bankman-fried/story?id=100108547">asserted</a>. Maintaining his innocence, SBF pleaded not guilty to all charges, while three high-ranking FTX staff members have already entered guilty pleas for multiple charges.</p>

Under an emergency relief secured by the regulator, Binance agreed to repatriate to the U.S. funds held on behalf of customers of its American subsidiary. </strong></p>
<h2>Binance US Users to Be Able to Withdraw Funds as Agreement With SEC Helps Avoid Asset Freeze</h2>
<p>The U.S. securities regulator <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Saturday it has secured an emergency relief in which all entities responsible for operating Binance US and the founder of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), agreed to repatriate to the U.S. assets held for the benefit of customers of the American unit.</p>
<p>The order from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia helps ensure that Binance US users are permitted to withdraw their assets from the trading platform, the SEC emphasized. Also, the assets kept on Binance US will be protected and remain in the United States, the Commission assured in a press release.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after earlier reports, citing <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.70.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court filings</a>, revealed that Binance and the SEC have reached an agreement on the matter. According to Coindesk and Reuters, only Binance US employees will have access to US customer funds under the deal, and not officials from Binance Holdings, the operator of the global trading platform.</p>

<p>The SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-court-approval-to-freeze-binance-us-crypto-assets-citing-customer-safety-concerns/">sought</a> a temporary restraining order for the assets of Binance’s US subsidiary, citing concerns over their safety, after it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">sued</a> the cryptocurrency exchange for violating US securities laws. The regulator also accused Binance and its founder and chief executive of mishandling of customer funds and misleading investors.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/asset-freeze-to-halt-binance-us-operations-exchange-says-seeks-rejection-of-sec-request/">asked</a> the court to reject the SEC’s request, arguing that an asset freeze would amount to a “death penalty” for the U.S.-based entity. At a hearing in Washington on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/judge-postpones-asset-freeze-as-binance-us-and-sec-agree-to-work-on-deal/">gave</a> the sides an opportunity to work out a deal ensuring user funds are safe without crippling the crypto business.</p>
<h2>Binance Required to Provide SEC With Oversight Over Business Expenses</h2>
<p>The latest court order also prohibits defendants BAM Trading Services Inc. and BAM Management US Holdings, Inc. from spending corporate assets other than in the ordinary course of business, the SEC pointed out. The entities have been also required to provide the SEC with oversight over such expenses.</p>
<p>“Given that Changpeng Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms’ customers’ assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please, as we have alleged, these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets,” its Director of the Division of Enforcement, Gurbir S. Grewal, was quoted as saying. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Further, we ensured that U.S. customers will be able to withdraw their assets from the platform while we work to resolve the alleged underlying misconduct and hold Zhao and the Binance entities accountable for their alleged securities law violations.</p></blockquote>
<p> is now required to maintain U.S. customer assets in the United States for the duration of the SEC litigation and to facilitate customer withdrawals. The court order prohibits BAM from transferring assets or funds or providing control over such, to Binance Holdings, CEO Changpeng Zhao, or their affiliates.</p>

At the time of writing, the global market cap rose by 3.3%, as bullish sentiment returned. Polygon was another notable gainer, surging by over 5% on Saturday.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) raced to a one-week high on Saturday, as crypto prices rallied following a recent spell of downward sentiment.</p>
<p>After falling to a low of $14.47 during yesterday’s session, SOL/USD bounced to a peak of $16.07 to start the weekend.</p>
<p>The move came as the token continued to distance itself from a recent support point at the $14.00 mark.</p>

<p>From the chart, it seems that the latest rise in price has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) to a resistance zone at 36.00.</p>
<p>This has led to earlier bulls abandoning their positions, leading to the index now tracking at 35.77.</p>
<p>In the event this hurdle is overcome, there is a good chance that SOL will move towards $17.00.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Additionally, polygon (MATIC) also made sizeable gains on Saturday, climbing by as much as 6% today.</p>
<p>MATIC/USD jumped to an intraday high of $0.6302 to start the weekend, a day after falling to a low of $0.5624.</p>
<p>As a result of the surge, polygon once again rose past a floor at $0.5760 and seems set to collide with a ceiling at $0.6700.</p>

<p>Despite today’s gains, MATIC still remains oversold, with price strength tracking at the 29.12 level.</p>
<p>This is however a positive for bulls, as there is still substantial upside to entering at this current level.</p>
<p>There is still a degree of uncertainty also, as a resistance point at 31.00 will likely test the strength of buyers.</p>

After a recent spell of consolidation, bulls returned to action, buying the recent dip in the process. Ethereum was also higher, closing in on $1,800 on Saturday.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) surged on Saturday, as bulls of the cryptocurrency moved to buy the recent dip in price.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to a high of $26,769.39 to start the weekend, which comes less than a day after trading at a low of $25,245.36.</p>
<p>The move pushed the price to its highest point since May 8, a day when the price was at a peak of $26,820.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the rally came when the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) finally broke out of a key ceiling at 43.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index is tracking at 50.55, which is close to a new resistance at the 51.00 level.</p>
<p>Traders are likely targeting the $27,300 level, and could hit this if momentum continues to be bullish this weekend.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also rebounded strongly to start the weekend, days after falling to a three-month low.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,653.17 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak at the $1,766.76 level earlier today.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> fell to a bottom at $1,620 on Thursday, which was the weakest point that the price had hit since March 13.</p>

<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, a breakout of the RSI was one of the triggers of the move, with price strength climbing past a ceiling at 41.00.</p>
<p>The index is currently at a reading of 43.79, with the next resistance level at the 50.00 mark.</p>

The Kenyan leader claimed that the African continent already has a mechanism that enables the seamless settling of transactions between traders. Further, freedom advocate and entrepreneur Kimdotcom said as more countries reject the greenback the &#8220;U.S. Govt will pay a higher price for printing money.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Ruto: African Traders Do Not Need to Settle Using the Greenback</h2>
<p>Kenyan President William Ruto has again urged African countries to consider settling cross-border transactions with their respective currencies instead of the U.S. dollar. In his remarks made while addressing the Djibouti parliament, Ruto argued that the African continent’s Afreximbank already has the mechanism in place to enable seamless settling of transactions between traders.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just In: President of Kenya, <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamsRuto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WilliamsRuto</a>, Urges African Nations to Dump the US Dollar for Intracontinental Trade. WATCH <a href="https://t.co/mHE8Bshquv">pic.twitter.com/mHE8Bshquv</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Simon Ateba (@simonateba) <a href="https://twitter.com/simonateba/status/1668415862657671168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The latest remarks by the Kenyan leader, whose country is among several African nations facing dollar shortages, come just a few weeks after he similarly implored his counterparts to kickstart the process to ditch the U.S. dollar. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-president-william-ruto-urges-african-countries-to-commence-process-to-ditch-the-dollar/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, Ruto believes trade between African countries is already hampered by the differences between their respective currencies. He said asking traders to source U.S. dollars only makes things worse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>&#8216;We Are Not Against the U.S. Dollar&#8217;</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/simonateba/status/1668415862657671168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1668415862657671168%7Ctwgr%5Edbd7bd2f8219d277e08657d1eceeda7a26762601%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftodaynewsafrica.com%2Fkenyan-president-william-samoei-ruto-urges-african-nations-to-shift-away-from-us-dollar-in-intracontinental-trade-journalist-simon-ateba-cautions-challenges%2F">video</a> circulating on social media platforms, Ruto doubled down on his earlier call on African countries to de-dollarize, but said that &#8220;we are not against the U.S. dollar.&#8221; He also questioned why Kenyan and Djibouti traders need to settle transactions using the greenback. He asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why is it necessary for us to buy things from Djibouti and pay in dollars? Why? There is no reason. And we are not against the U.S. dollar, we just want to trade much more freely. Let us pay in U.S. dollars what we are buying from the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the Kenyan leader, African countries ought to settle trades occurring on the continent using local currencies.</p>
<p>Commenting on Ruto’s remarks, internet freedom advocate and entrepreneur Kimdotcom warned of the consequences for the United States if more countries were to heed the call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Africa says bye to the US dollar. The President of Kenya, William Ruto urges African nations to dump USD under tumultuous applause. With every nation that rejects USD as reserve currency the US Govt will pay a higher price for printing money (inflation),&#8221; Kimdotcom <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1668663016731340800">said</a>.</p>
