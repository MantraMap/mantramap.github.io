<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do you have a problem looking for a dependable trading platform based on the Ethereum network? Is it difficult for you to stake on a platform that does not provide decentralized insurance or decentralized finance? If so, Bridge Mutual is the greatest choice for you to pursue right now.</strong></h5>

<p>We&#8217;ve all been told we need insurance, but not everyone gets it. Purchasing insurance is a wager that if anything goes wrong, you will be compensated. Occasionally the payout is more than the premiums you pay, but this is not always the case. The simplest way to think of it is as &#8220;just in case&#8221; insurance.</p>



<p>Learn more about Bridge Mutual&#8217;s decentralized insurance and how it leverages the Ethereum blockchain to improve decentralization by joining Coincu. But first, let&#8217;s go over some related concepts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Decentralized insurance</h2>



<p>If anything occurs for which you are covered, you or your donor will be compensated. But, you must subscribe to this benefit by paying a fee. Insurance companies calculate that if ten individuals each pay $100, they will have enough money to pay one person $1000 if anything were to happen.</p>



<p>Yet, if something horrible occurs to all ten individuals, which the insurance company believes is very improbable, everyone may get $1000, with the firm paying out of its own pocket/profits to do so.</p>



<p>The insurance company is responsible for paying out claims in this circumstance. Where do they receive their money? Individual premiums are mostly collected. They then take that money and invest it in additional growing assets after subtracting their &#8220;keeping the lights on&#8221; expenses, so they can pay out claims as they occur.</p>



<p>Bridge Mutual is an excellent solution created on the Ethereum network. This technology is offered as a mix of decentralized insurance and decentralized finance. It is critical to understand how long the cash will be safe in popular success. All insurance plans may be converted into decentralized smart contracts, eliminating the need for a middleman.</p>



<p>Nexus Mutual is a major Decentralized insurance provider. It is also used in the decentralized PoolTogether No Loss Lottery program.</p>



<p>When it comes to high-profile hacking instances, DeFi insurance has always been one of the most important factors. Such occurrences are primarily the result of stolen coins, but they may also occur as a result of the loss of the client&#8217;s private keys or access.</p>



<p>To allow crypto to develop, users should limit losses from different threats. Certain DeFi smart contracts have not been vetted and may include security flaws.</p>



<p>Given the overall climate, it is clear that investing in DeFi protocols is not for the faint of heart. Bridge Mutual comes into play here.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Bridge Mutual?</h2>



<p>Michael Miglio created Bridge Mutual in 2020 as a non-custodial risk management organization that offers coverage for stablecoins and exchanges.</p>



<p>Bridge Mutual offers its consumers a decentralized, scalable, and all-encompassing smart contract solution for insuring stablecoins, smart contracts, centralized exchanges, and other crypto and DeFi goods.</p>



<p>The insurance platform provides its customers with transparent, auditable, on-chain investment options that generate returns and profit-sharing while requiring no KYC or personally identifiable information.</p>



<p>Bridge Mutual provides a decentralized insurance-like interface via which people may insure one another. Fundamentally, users may utilize the interface to find other users who provide the sort of insurance that they need at a price that they can afford. This eliminates the typically time-consuming procedure of clients conversing with numerous insurance brokers at the same time in the hopes of selecting one with whom they are compatible. Moreover, any claims made are published to the central blockchain, where the public may observe and evaluate them. This also applies to user investments of money. This increases user trust and assures that there is little or no fraud.</p>



<p>Bridge Mutual functions as a scalable and all-encompassing solution for various smart contracts to provide centralized exchanges and stable currency! On-chain investing solutions that are auditable or transparent may often be used to deliver yields or profit-sharing to users. Therefore, no KYC or personally identifying information is required.</p>



<p>Users will have improved coverage, be able to vote on insurance payments and share earnings with the aid of this platform. When claims are adjudicated, users are often compensated. Because of its openness, Bridge will eventually replace the old insurance market.</p>



<p>To have access to coverage, you must provide the smart contract address when buying the Smart Contract Cover. Highlight the amount, time range, and currency amount that must be covered. You must create a particular quotation.</p>



<p>Bridge Mutual uses the Ethereum blockchain, which allows individuals to share risk among themselves rather than relying on a centralized insurance firm. Bridge Mutual also owns the &#8220;Regular BMI Tokens,&#8221; which are membership tokens. wBMI encapsulates known, freely transferable BMI tokens.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<ul>
<li>It is a bespoke decentralized insurance application that enables users to &#8220;insure&#8221; each other&#8217;s risks.</li>



<li>Transparency based on blockchain, on-chain, and auditable user compensation evaluations.</li>



<li>All claims are subjected to a three-stage voting procedure with incentives and penalties, ensuring that each claim is thoroughly reviewed.</li>



<li>As a bridge to reinvent conventional insurance since traditional insurance is unfair and prone to litigation owing to a lack of transparency and inequitable incentive allocation.</li>



<li>More efficient than typical insurance, with no need for branch offices, claims experts, or agents.</li>



<li>Turnaround times for claims and voting are constant and fewer than 6 weeks, regardless of claim size.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Leveraged Portfolio</strong></h3>



<p>Users may deposit their coins here to get leverage and exposure to a high-reward-high-risk yield farming situation.</p>



<p>Leveraged Portfolio functions as a leveraged insurance provider, providing a significantly greater APY than traditional insurance does.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reinsurance Pool</strong></h3>



<p>The Bridge Reinsurance Pool (RP) team pooled the protocol&#8217;s money. Interest is generated by three factors: the DeFi Yield Generator, the Protocol Fee, and the Reward Pool.</p>



<p>RP functions as an in-house insurance provider, which may dramatically minimize protocol risk at no extra expense to traditional insurance carriers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Capital Pool</strong></h3>



<p>The BMI platform&#8217;s owner controls and distributes money both internally and externally. It is in charge of cash withdrawals, insurance payouts, and investments in third-party DeFi protocols to create income for the protocol.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shield Mining</strong></h3>



<p>Shield Mining enables users (and projects) to donate X tokens to Project X&#8217;s Insurance Team in order to boost the pool&#8217;s APY and so attract additional liquidity to the coverage.</p>



<p>As a consequence, coverage providers will be compensated with BMI, USDT, and X tokens from the initiative.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BMI Widget</strong></h3>



<p>The simple-to-use technology enables BMI affiliates to offer coverage products directly and increase coverage liquidity via their own channels in return for a fee.</p>



<p>The fee is 5-15% of the policyholder&#8217;s premium.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BMI Mobile Version</strong></h3>



<p>The Bridge Mutual Dapp mobile version is appropriate for viewing and engaging from a mobile device. The design and the complete user interface (UI) have been optimized for a smaller touchscreen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">BMI token</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="token-use-case"><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>



<p>Bridge Mutual (BMI) is a unity token used for on-chain governance and coordination. Some of its functions are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>DApps Staking is a unique scheme created by the Bridge Mutual core team, and only Plasm supports it in the Polkadot ecosystem. Bridge Mutual aspires to be the most prominent DApps hub on the Polkadot Network. DApps will be developed as an incentive mechanism to execute smart contracts on the Plasm Network.</li>



<li>BMI token holders may also stake their tokens on the network (Plasm network validator or matcher). Stakingers get a nomination reward as a result, and the network becomes more decentralized.</li>



<li>Fees for on-chain transactions</li>



<li>Voting and referendums are used to control the blockchain.</li>



<li>The Plasm Network is a Layer 1 platform that may also be used for Layer 2 deployments. Developers of Layer 2 apps invest BMI tokens into their Layer 1 smart contracts and establish Layer 2 applications.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Advantages of Bridge Mutual with Nexus Mutual</h2>



<p>Bridge&#8217;s main rival is Nexus Mutual, which has a market valuation of roughly $200 million. The following are the primary competitive advantages that Bridge and tokenomics architecture may maintain over their competitors:</p>



<ul>
<li>Product Line: Nexus Mutual only covers smart contract assaults, while Bridge is shaking things up by offering new policy categories, particularly for stablecoins but also for exchanges. Additional categories might be added in the future.</li>



<li>Structure: Bridge does not need KYC and all procedures take place solely inside the network, while Nexus Mutual has an off-chain policy and membership fees.</li>



<li>Special pricing model: in the case of Bridge, it is dynamically set by multiple risk variables of the kind of risk you want to protect yourself against, while Nexus implements a policy based only on liquidity.</li>



<li>Claim voting: Bridge delivers automatic claims outcomes for the use case of stablecoin insurance plans, decreasing processing time and maintaining the process clean and fluid.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Roadmap</h2>



<p>While the team works on a new plan that will be released soon, a few items stick out that are worth investigating if they are not currently on the roadmap.</p>



<ul>
<li>Insurance for stablecoin depegging &#8211; this was discussed early on in the project but does not seem to be implemented now. Claims for depegged stablecoin are processed automatically, as opposed to other DeFi protocol claims, which must be voted on by voters. But, considering the recent de-pegging of the USDT, I suppose this would need to be approached with prudence.</li>



<li>Transition to the DAO &#8211; The protocol seeks to move to a fully functional DAO structure by 2022. By that time, only necessary admin workers would be keeping the site running, with the community making the bulk of crucial choices.</li>



<li>vBMI tokens are being phased out &#8211; vBMI tokens are now the entry-level condition for a person to become a voter. In a recent update, the vBMI tokens were phased away, although specifics are still due.</li>



<li>Plans are in the works to deploy the app on Binance Smart Chain and Polygon in the near future. Keep an eye out for them.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Despite the fact that conventional insurance has been around for a long time, lingering issues continue to stymie its progress. As a result, Bridge Mutual is an excellent choice for blockchain-integrated apps.</p>



<p>Bridge Mutual is a platform that has designed and developed a decentralized insurance model by merging DeFi apps on its platform in order to deliver several application solutions on the same DeFi project.</p>



<p>Users will have improved coverage, be able to vote on insurance payments and share earnings with the aid of this platform. When claims are adjudicated, users are often compensated. Because of its openness, Bridge will eventually replace the old insurance market.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US President Biden and Speaker of the US House of Representatives McCarthy have reached an agreement in principle on the debt ceiling. Bitcoin (BTC) price recovered quickly to the $27,000 level.</strong></h5>



<p>The White House and Republican negotiators have reached a preliminary agreement to raise the US debt ceiling and avoid a default that could shake the global economy, people familiar with the matter said.</p>



<p>US President Joe Biden and US House of Representatives Speaker McCarthy must now steer a long-discussed framework deal through the final passage of legislation, despite opposition from hawkish lawmakers bipartisan. US Treasury Secretary Yellen warned that the debt ceiling extension must be completed by June 5 to avoid a historic default.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;After weeks of negotiations, we have come to an agreement in principle. We still have a lot of work to do but I believe this is an agreement in principle that is worthy of the American people,&#8221; </p>
<cite>McCarthy said during a brief statement to reporters.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If passed, tonight&#8217;s deal would not only expand the debt ceiling but also include an agreement to fund the government for the next two years, according to a Democratic source familiar with the negotiations.</p>



<p>That means Congress will skip the shutdown war slated for this fall and launch the next funding war after the 2024 election. In addition, US House of Representatives Speaker McCarthy is scheduled to brief Republicans on the debt ceiling agreement at 9:30 pm local time.</p>



<p>Receiving positive news after a prolonged stalemate, BTC price quickly recovered from $26,700 to $27,100.</p>

<p>As investors watch the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations in Washington and Fed officials split over rate hikes, bitcoin has begun to act as a risk asset once again, just like it started to be traded more along with gold earlier this year.</p>



<p>The market also warmed up along with the recovery of the largest coin. Ethereum (ETH), along with other altcoins, all recorded slight gains of 1-3%.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Manta Network?</h2>



<p>Manta Network is a Layer 1 blockchain built on Polkadot&#8217;s Substrate platform that employs zkSNARK technology for anonymity, cross-chain interoperability, and high speed. Manta, for instance, operates in parallel on both Polkadot and Kusama networks, with Manta Network operating on Polkadot and Calamari Network running on Kusama.</p>



<p>A team of seasoned entrepreneurs from major universities such as Harvard, MIT, and Algorand built the idea. During 2019, the team has been doing research on Zero Knowledge Proof as part of a cross-border payment research project funded by the MIT Digital Currency Project and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Several of the leading web3 investment funds, including Binance Labs and Polychain Capital, have invested in Manta Network, which has expanded via participation in the greatest web3 accelerators, including Alliance DAO and Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator.</p>



<p>The DeFi protocol is the most desired path in the crypto industry, providing all of the advantages of decentralization and anonymity while also having some privacy problems, scalability, and usability.</p>



<p>The majority of these issues have been resolved by the Manta Network project team. One example is when it is important to demonstrate the validity of the transaction to the verifier without disclosing parameters such as the amount, address, and other characteristics. Users have complete control over their assets and data, and they make choices about who they disclose to.</p>



<p>Some Manta Network features coming in the future:</p>



<ul>
<li>Decentralized exchange.</li>



<li>Private Payment protocol.</li>



<li>Lending protocol.</li>



<li>Synthetic asset protocol.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<p>Manta Network has created a cryptographically safe decentralized personal exchange and payment mechanism based on zk-SNARK. Manta Network is the first decentralized private exchange and payment organization that is solely built on cryptographic assumptions. Manta, unlike other decentralized exchanges like as Uniswap and Curve, is compatible with Parachain tokens (including stablecoins) and provides total anonymity. </p>



<p>It is unquestionably more secure than private commercial TEE-based devices in today&#8217;s world, when security equipment has been repeatedly exposed to flaws and assaults. In contrast to public networks such as Findora, which likewise do not need demonstrations of expertise,</p>



<p>Manta Network is the first decentralized exchange that employs zk-SNARK to improve privacy among existing DeFi solutions. zk-SNARK may already be used to provide total end-to-end anonymity &#8211; the sender can validate the transaction without exposing the amount, transaction address, or other data. Manta ensures that users and transactions remain entirely anonymous. The agreement is open source and audited, which helps lower the cost of trust while simultaneously keeping the system safe. Please see the table below for a technical comparison (bold equals better):</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Anonymity</strong></h3>



<p>DeFi is a realistic blockchain application that acts as an alternative to conventional finance while providing all of the advantages of transaction decentralization. Nevertheless, DeFi still has certain drawbacks, including security, access to new user files, and restricted scalability.</p>



<p>Manta Network was created to address these issues adequately. Users have complete control over their assets and information, like funds, wallet addresses, and so on, and may choose whether or not to disclose their information to other parties. In addition, the project will issue a privacy token with a 1:1 correlation to the values of other underlying tokens and stablecoins. Manta Network&#8217;s DeFi devices will employ these privacy tokens.</p>



<p>Moreover, by implementing ZKP Manta, it is feasible to safeguard the privacy of on-chain transactions, as well as scale the privacy in a more distributed and hardware-independent way.</p>



<p>Manta Network&#8217;s current products include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Decentralized Anonymous Payment (DAP) protocol: This is a decentralized anonymous payment protocol that enables users to trade Polkadot tokens for zk-SNARKs privacy tokens. On Manta Network&#8217;s DeFi products, users will pay using privacy tokens, which can be exchanged for native tokens.</li>



<li>Decentralized Anonymous Exchange (DAX) protocol: On the Manta Network platform, users may exchange privacy tokens anonymously with one another. The exchange&#8217;s pricing strategy for privacy tokens will be identical to that of standard AMMs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Interoperability and combination</strong></h3>



<p>Unlike decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap and Curve, Manta Network supports Parachain tokens (including stablecoins) while offering users total asset privacy. Manta Network can connect with other Layer-1s in the Polkadot ecosystem thanks to the cross-consensus messaging (XCM) method.</p>



<p>In contrast to public blockchains that use Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology, such as Findora, Manta Network may handle numerous cross-chain assets in the Polkadot ecosystem. Manta Network, at the same time, eliminates repeated efforts in the development of Polkadot&#8217;s consensus layer ecology.</p>



<p>Manta Network is currently the only anonymous DeFi system that is compatible with all asset classes, including stablecoins, and offers security via encryption rather than hardware.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Manta ecosystem</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Infrastructure</strong></h3>



<p><strong>MantaPay</strong></p>



<p>MantaPay is a decentralized mobile payment service that enables users to make and receive payments quickly and securely. The software is based on the Manta Network, a decentralized platform for producing and exchanging digital assets, and its native token is the Manta Coin (MANTA). It uses a BYOT (Bring your own token) concept, which allows users to privatize and trade with many cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Upcoming</strong></h3>



<p>Manta Network launches mainnet.</p>



<p>You can find the up-to-date version of the project roadmap&nbsp;<a href="https://mantanetwork.notion.site/3b1b61e0aee8484396d674f4653e0813?v=451a4ad2105d4f9cb35fb74680359c1d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Team</h2>



<p>Manta Network was created by an experienced and high-quality team that includes academics and researchers from major colleges such as Harvard and MIT. Among them are three founders who are key members of the core team and have made significant contributions to the growth of Manta Network:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shumo Chu is a cryptographer with substantial industry expertise, having previously worked as a scientific researcher at Algorand. He has collaborated with several of the world&#8217;s leading cryptographers and has received the Turing Award, the most prestigious prize in computer science.</li>



<li>Kenny Li is an MBA graduate business manager from MIT Sloan with over ten years of startup growth expertise. He has been involved in Blockchain initiatives since 2013 and has strong knowledge of Bitcoin.</li>



<li>Victor Ji is a former YC China researcher with a master&#8217;s degree in economics from Harvard. He is primarily responsible for Manta Network&#8217;s product.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Investors and partners</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investors</strong></h3>



<p>February 2, 2021: Manta Network conducts its first funding round of $1.1 million, led by the Polychain fund.</p>



<p>October 19, 2021: Manta Network continues to raise $ 5.5 million for the second time, led by ParaFi and Coinfund funds.</p>



<p>November 16, 2021: Manta Network successfully raised USD 28.8 million through the Squad Game Community Token program from the community. Of which, 80 million MANTA tokens (accounting for 8% of the total supply) were exchanged by the community.</p>



<p>February 17, 2022: Binance Labs announced a strategic investment in Manta Network, but the amount of capital was not disclosed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Partners</strong></h3>



<p>Manta Network has a number of renowned blockchain industry partners, including Acala, Parallel or Polkadot, and Dora Factory.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Manta operates in the most promising cryptocurrency field &#8211; DeFi. This gave the project the opportunity to take the lead, including the usage of Polkadot.</p>



<p>In addition to exchange and trading capabilities, lending services and the possibility for digital asset holders to lend their tokens at interest will be accessible, improving liquidity. In a nutshell, users will be able to establish private deposits and borrow money on the Manta Network platform anonymously.</p>



<p>Owing to technological challenges, there is no decentralized trading platform in the present Polkadot ecosystem, much alone the whole crypto world, that secures user privacy end to end. Manta wonderfully fills this vacuum. Manta is essential for consumers who need to safeguard their privacy, particularly institutional customers, since it combines both decentralized private payments and decentralized private transactions for the assets of the Polkadot environment network. As a result, Manta Network anticipates Manta to become the decentralized, privacy-preserving platform leader in the Polkadot ecosystem and the whole cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<p>LayerZero cross-chain bridge protocol Stargate has recently issued a proposal to disable Fantom Pool and cross-chain paths due to concerns over the stability of anyUSDC, which is Fantom&#8217;s primary USDC asset. These concerns arose after Multichain announced a &#8220;force majeure&#8221; event impacting some parts of its service. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While most of the cross-chain routes of Multichain protocol are functioning well,  some of the cross-chain routes are unavailable due to force majeure, and the time for service to resume is unknown. After service is restored, pending transactions will be credited automatically.…</p>&mdash; Multichain (Previously Anyswap) (@MultichainOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1661443109019062272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 24, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This event created a need for more clarity about Multichain&#8217;s current status, which in turn has created uncertainty around the stability of anyUSDC.</p>



<p>At launch, Stargate included anyUSDC within its pools as it was considered the &#8220;native&#8221; asset for Fantom. Currently, there are 11.4 million dollars worth of deposited LP into this pool, and effectively, Fantom pools are isolated from other Stargate pools. The proposal aims to mitigate risks associated with uncertainty by taking several steps. These steps include setting STG emissions on the Fantom pools to 0, disconnecting the Fantom pools from every other pool, removing and unwinding anyUSDC POL via Multichain, and depositing the POL into the Ethereum USDC pool.</p>

<p>Existing LPs would be whitelisted to enable redemption of their LP out to any other chain. LPs can manually remove their LP throughout the voting process and unwind their anyUSDC balance over Multichain. From now on, Stargate should consider expanding bridging options for Fantom users in other ways, including possibly via Hydra. The removal of the Fantom USDC pool and DAO-controlled funds from the pool would mitigate risks to Stargate and its liquidity providers.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The recent introduction of the LTC-20 token standard seems to have revitalized the Litecoin ecosystem.</em></li>



<li><em>The LTC-20 standard is a Litecoin token standard that lets developers construct tokens that can interact with the network and have built-in smart contracts. It is an outgrowth of the BRC-20 standard.</em></li>



<li><em>LTC is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies due to its cheap transaction fees and rapid confirmation rate. As a result, analysts anticipating the coin is not surprising.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Litecoin community has chosen to propose a test standard for LTC-20 and has created a test token to that end.</strong></h5>

<p>LTC-20 will become a reservoir for capital overflow, driven by the wealth-building impact of BRC-20 in the past and backed by the story of halving in the future. It is now possible to bet on multi-party market games with very high odds.</p>



<p>The standard is a fork of the BRC-20 standard, and the community characterizes it as simply a fun experimental standard proving that off-chain balancing states may be created using inscriptions. Let&#8217;s dive deeper into this topic with Coincu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">BRC-20&#8217;s new narrative</h2>



<p>The Bitcoin market has expanded in recent months, giving rise to several misconceptions about becoming wealthy. The movement of wealth creation in the currency circle is simply the development of the token distribution mechanism, which is also the finest pipeline for generating encrypted affluent individuals in each cycle.</p>



<p>Finally, using the latest BRC-20, deploy, mint, and transmit Bitcoin inscriptions. It is a more decentralized and equitable form of token distribution.</p>



<p>Although the global crypto market has failed to keep up with macro changes, Litecoin has managed to send shockwaves across the industry with the introduction of its LTC-20 standard.</p>



<p>Many believe that the recent implementation of the LTC-20 standard &#8211; a substantial advance in the Litecoin ecosystem &#8211; is the driving force behind Litecoin&#8217;s fresh life. Some experts believe that this new update will continue to spread enthusiasm for Litecoin, while others do not.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is LTC-20?</h2>



<p>The standard is based on the Litecoin Ordinals Protocol and has an 84 million supply. The BRC-20 standard in question is the standard form for experimental fungible tokens created using Ordinals and inscriptions and kept on the Bitcoin base chain.</p>



<p>Litecoin is one of the market&#8217;s earliest cryptocurrencies and remains important. The goal is to determine if the flexibility is appropriate for the Litecoin blockchain. The test&#8217;s purpose is to deploy LTC-20 tokens, mint a certain number of tokens, and transfer some tokens.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://litecoinlabs.gitbook.io/ltc-20-experiment-forked-from-brc-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documentation</a> for the LTC-20 experiment:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;This is just a fun experimental standard demonstrating that you can create off-chain balance states with inscriptions. It by no means should be considered THE standard for fungibility on litecoin with ordinals, as I believe there are almost certainly better design choices and optimization improvements to be made. Consequently, this is an extremely dynamic experiment, and I strongly discourage any financial decisions to be made on the basis of it&#8217;s design. I do, however, encourage the litecoin community to tinker with standard designs and optimizations until a general consensus on best practices is met (or to decide that this is a bad idea altogether!).&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">LTC-20 generates interest in the Litecoin ecosystem</h2>



<p>Following in the footsteps of the BRC-20 Ordinals, LTC-20 permits memes and NFTs to be connected to the Bitcoin base chain.</p>



<p>Importantly, the LTC-20 token standard has been widely adopted by the Litecoin community worldwide. Since May 1, the number of new wallet addresses produced on the Litecoin network has reached an all-time high.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the first rise began with many individual investors establishing wallets for less than one LTC. On-chain data, however, reveals that crypto whales are now participating.</p>



<p>The following is an on-chain study of the current Litecoin rebound, as well as a data-driven estimate of how much LTC price upside is possible.</p>



<p>Importantly, hundreds of new users are joining the LTC-20 movement, resulting in unprecedented levels of Litecoin network activity. According to Santiment statistics, the number of daily active Litecoin addresses (DAA) surged by more than 200% in May. The DAA indicator counts the daily amount of transactions on the blockchain network made by unique wallet addresses.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the increase in the number of people participating in the network indicates that demand for the base currency is increasing. If Litecoin network members continue on this path, the current LTC rise might set new records.</p>



<p>Despite being late to the LTC-20 Ordinals party, Litecoin whales seem to be transacting more than they did in the first week of May 2023. In conclusion, a positive price forecast is likely if the LTC-20 wave continues its present velocity and whales continue to buy in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What are the outstanding features of LTC-20?</h2>



<p>The many xRC protocols that have sprung out like mushrooms in the market are a manifestation of FOMO, and consumers are eagerly seeking the next chance that will increase by a thousand times. And at the time, LTC-20 is the best option.</p>



<p>Litecoin generates a block every 2.5 minutes (Bitcoin every 10 minutes), allowing for faster transaction confirmation, and the Gas fee is extremely low (less than $0.1 per transaction, a few dollars to hundreds of dollars per transaction in Bitcoin), giving it more advantages in terms of block generation speed, flexibility, transaction costs, and so on.</p>



<p>In comparison to DRC-20: The dogecoin community&#8217;s DRC-20 protocol now lacks formal leadership, and the parties are fragmented and dispersed. Moreover, LTC-20 is a subscription market with legitimate organizations and platforms. Second, Dogecoin has a larger per-transaction gas price, around three times that of Litecoin.</p>



<p>In comparison to ORC-20, ORC-20 is an addition to the BRC-20 environment. The currency-issuing form is more flexible, tokens may be produced in addition, and the namespace is not restricted. ORC-20 is a Bitcoin equivalent of Ethereum ERC-20. It deviates from the fundamental disk of the inscription hype to some amount. One issue it raises is why, if Bitcoin is ERC-20ized, we don&#8217;t utilize Ethereum&#8217;s ERC-20 directly.</p>



<p>The growth of BRC-20 has been marketed as a counter-movement against centralization and big wealth whales. The idea is that regular investors will become serfs and sing while institutions, major forces, and exchanges accept everyone&#8217;s instructions.</p>



<p>There are just individual investors, and the market is like a pan of loose sand without the involvement of major funds.</p>



<p>The primary benefit of LTC-20 over other xRC protocols is that with the Litecoin halving event in August, market capital and flows will be centered on Litecoin. LTC-20 will become a reservoir for capital overflow after being propelled by the wealth creation impact of BRC-20 and then sustained by the halving story. There are greater chances for major businesses, institutions, and exchanges to join the industry.</p>



<p>The market value of LTC is around $6.41 billion, while the market value of BRC-20 is approximately $450 million. It simply takes a little money outflow from the market to the LTC-20 to generate hundreds or thousands of investment chances.</p>

<p>Beijing, China&#8217;s capital city, has released a white paper promoting the innovation and development of the web3 industry. Dubbed the &#8220;Web3 Innovation and Development White Paper (2023),&#8221; the document states that web3 technology is an &#8220;inevitable trend for future Internet industry development.&#8221; </p>



<p>The release of the white paper is another important work measure taken by the Municipal Science and Technology Commission and Zhongguancun Management Committee to promote the development of the Internet 3.0 industry. The white paper systematically analyzes and expounds on the Internet 3.0 connotation, system architecture, domestic and foreign development status, Beijing development status, and development suggestions.</p>



<p>However, Wu Blockchain recently reported that the white paper focuses on AI and the Metaverse &#8211; two areas the Chinese government particularly supports, and any view that the Beijing web3 white paper is related to cryptocurrencies is wrong or deliberately exaggerating emotions.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The web3 white paper was released by the Beijing Municipal Science &amp; Technology Commission, which is also known as the Administrative Commission of Zhongguancun Science Park. The document is part of the commission&#8217;s efforts to promote the development of the Internet 3.0 industry and to make Beijing a global innovation hub for the digital economy.</p>



<p>While the white paper does not cover cryptocurrencies, it provides a detailed analysis of Internet 3.0 connotation, system architecture, domestic and foreign development status, Beijing development status, and development suggestions. The document aims to promote innovation and development of the web3 industry and is another crucial work measure taken by the Municipal Science and Technology Commission and Zhongguancun Management Committee.</p>

<p>Although the white paper has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, its release has still generated interest in the crypto community. Some have speculated about the timing of the release, given that Hong Kong&#8217;s crypto rules are set to kick off on June 1.

<p>Users may now achieve Verified Seilor jobs on the platform thanks to the incorporation of Humanode face verification, which ensures that users are genuine individuals and not bots.</p>

<p>The frequency of automated bots has increased, as have the difficulties in identifying legitimate users from fake ones. By achieving the desired &#8220;Verified Seilor&#8221; position, individuals are given a mark of authenticity that distinguishes them as genuine people in the broad digital world.</p>



<p>Humanode face verification is a big step forward in Sei Network&#8217;s commitment to maintaining authenticity within its ecosystem. Sei Network may authenticate people&#8217;s identities by forcing them to undertake face verification, reducing the danger of impersonation and fraudulent actions.</p>

<p>The platform guarantees that incentives and airdrops on the mainnet are awarded only to actual humans, rather than automated bots or fake accounts, by pushing users to attain the Confirmed Seilor position and employing Humanode face verification.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the mainnet airdrop hinders Sybil&#8217;s assaults. A Sybil attack employs a single node to run many active false identities (or Sybil identities) concurrently inside a peer-to-peer network. This sort of assault seeks to weaken the authority or power of a respected system by acquiring control of the network. Discord is employing the Crypto Bio authentication tool BotBasher to guarantee the community is made up of actual individuals.</p>

<p>CZ <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1662337430698053632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that for Binance to close its business in Australia and the Australian dollar trading pair, this is a decision made by the legal currency channel, that is, the bank partner stops cooperation with it. Without access to fiat currency, there is no way to deposit or withdraw AUD, and the pair is illiquid, he stated.</p>



<p>Binance Australia has told customers that its Australian currency services have been terminated after its local payment services provider was directed to discontinue support for the exchange.</p>



<p>The Australian arm said on May 18 that Australian dollar PayID deposits and bank transfer withdrawals might be affected owing to a decision made by its third-party payment service provider.</p>



<p>Binance later <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190173-binance-is-leaving-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> an announcement that it would delete and delist the relevant Australian dollar trading pairs on June 1. Users of Binance&#8217;s platform may still trade the impacted assets on other trading pairs, according to the company. It would, however, discontinue its Trading Bots services for the aforementioned pairs.</p>



<p>Previously, Westpac Bank, one of Australia&#8217;s four main banks, barred clients from trading with Binance after its own statistics revealed that investment scams accounted for about half of all scam losses, and one-third of all scam funds were transmitted straight to cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>



<p>This drawback is coming when Binance’s operation in Australia faces much regulatory scrutiny.</p>

<p>In April, the exchange canceled its derivatives license with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). At the time, the financial regulator said it was investigating the platform’s compliance with local laws.</p>



<p>Not only is the exchange being challenged in Australia, but it is also being sued by the US authorities. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of the United States sued Binance and CZ in March for breaches of commodities law. The exchange does not support the trading of derivative orders on commodities for US persons, which makes sense to the regulator.</p>

<p>Paradigm said that it &#8220;wrote FLX to 0,&#8221; but Reflexer objected, calling it a deception and stating that they no longer wanted to work with Paradigm.</p>

<p>Previous reports <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190006-vc-paradigm-expands-investment-past-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that the emphasis of encryption venture capital company Paradigm has shifted away from blockchain and toward a wider variety of cutting-edge technology such as artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang co-founded Paradigm in 2018. The business will complete a $2.5 billion fundraising in November 2021. Well-known firms in its portfolio include Uniswap, OpenSea, and Fireblocks. Paradigm has currently invested in over 100 crypto companies.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, references to crypto and web3 have been deleted from the company&#8217;s main page, and it now refers to itself as a &#8220;research-driven technology investment firm&#8221; rather than investing expressly in &#8220;disruptive crypto/Web3 companies and protocols.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former owner of the now-defunct exchange FTX, participated in a Paradigm-managed fund in late 2021. According to bankruptcy court filings this week, the same $2.5 billion Paradigm One fund subsequently invested in his FTX and FTX US exchanges.</p>



<p>At the time, Paradigm One was the largest crypto-focused venture capital vehicle. Bankman-Fried invested in and received funding from that single pot of money as a consequence of the transactions.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the FTX flash collapse had unforeseen repercussions, and Paradigm was one of the firms affected. Reflexer now requires Paradigm to destroy all remaining FLX tokens after the company &#8220;rebranded away from crypto.&#8221;</p>
