					<description><![CDATA[Kaspa continues to captivate the blockchain sphere with its interesting nature as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based proof-of-work (PoW) platform. Emerging onto the scene precisely when the blockchain realm was searching for an Ethereum (ETH) alternative, Kaspa&#8217;s protocol arrived as a timely solution. This came after Ethereum&#8217;s transition from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake (PoS) framework the previous year. A DAG-based PoW is a variation of the traditional proof-of-work consensus mechanism used in blockchain systems.

					<description><![CDATA[According to Etherscan data, the number of active ERC-20 addresses has not changed much in 2023. It has stayed between 200,000 and 300,000 while Ethereum prices stagnate below July 2023 highs. As of August 2, there were about 275,000 active ERC-20 addresses, up from 156,000 on June 18. Although activity has been low overall, there was a significant increase on June 11, with over 446,000 active ERC-20 addresses. Ethereum&#8217;s price trajectory has been tumultuous in tandem with this activity pattern, looking at the charts. For instance, Ethereum bulls have failed to breach the $2,100 liquidation level posted in the latter stages of H1 2023.  Ethereum Prices Volatile, Few Coins Burned At the moment, ETH prices hover around the $1,800 range, teetering precariously and likely to drop, looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. Although Ethereum has been bullish in the past two months, bulls have been tamed, and a drop below the $1,800 level may signal a shift from bullish to bearish in the medium term. With ETH under pressure, the number of active ERC-20 addresses remains constant and relatively lower than the 2021 peaks. This means there is less demand for ETH, which is used to pay transaction fees. As a result, gas fees are lower because there is less competition for block space. Typically, this would encourage more people to participate and even deploy complex contracts in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Heat Up As Filings With SEC Climbs To Six With EIP-1559 in the equation, low activity means fewer coins are taken out of circulation. Despite low network activity, the protocol continues to issue 2 ETH after each validated block, watering down deflationary effects enforced by EIP-1559.  DeFi Activities Falling Falling activity could be attributed to the waning interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities over recent months. As of August 2, the total value locked (TVL) remains below $50 billion, with a significant portion of assets tied in Ethereum. DeFi projects like LidoDAO, Curve, and Uniswap facilitate the trading of ERC-20 tokens. Furthermore, on-chain data highlights USDT as the most actively transacted token. Given its position as the third-largest coin by market cap, with substantial circulation in Ethereum and Tron networks, such a trend is expected. Looking back at ERC-20 transactions from June and July, it is evident that transfers stayed constant despite temporary price increases. Ethereum prices rose from $1,630 to $2,000 between mid-June and mid-July 2023, but ETH is now lower.  Related Reading: BNB Nears $250 Level As Market Suffers Volatility; What’s Driving It? On-chain ERC-20 activity has remained stable despite price volatility. It&#8217;s unclear whether there will be a change in activity as prices continue to drop. However, lower prices may force token holders to wait and see, leading to less activity. Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView]]></description>

<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price trajectory has been tumultuous in tandem with this activity pattern, looking at the charts. For instance, Ethereum bulls have failed to breach the $2,100 liquidation level posted in the latter stages of H1 2023. </p>
<h2>Ethereum Prices Volatile, Few Coins Burned</h2>
<p>At the moment, ETH prices hover around the $1,800 range, teetering precariously and likely to drop, looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. Although Ethereum has been bullish in the past two months, bulls have been tamed, and a drop below the $1,800 level may signal a shift from bullish to bearish in the medium term.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/DZsgN32I/" rel="nofollow"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/DZsgN32I/" alt="ETH price on August 2| Source: ETHUSDT on Binance, TradingView" width="1226" height="595"/></a>
<p>With ETH under pressure, the number of active ERC-20 addresses remains constant and relatively lower than the 2021 peaks. This means there is less demand for ETH, which is used to pay transaction fees. As a result, gas fees are lower because there is less competition for block space. Typically, this would encourage more people to participate and even deploy complex contracts in decentralized finance (DeFi). </p>

<p>With <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://ultrasound.money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EIP-1559</a> in the equation, low activity means fewer coins are taken out of circulation. Despite low network activity, the protocol continues to issue 2 ETH after each validated block, watering down deflationary effects enforced by EIP-1559. </p>
<h2>DeFi Activities Falling</h2>
<p>Falling activity could be attributed to the waning interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities over recent months. As of August 2, the total value locked (TVL) <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://defillama.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remains</a> below $50 billion, with a significant portion of assets tied in Ethereum. DeFi projects like LidoDAO, Curve, and Uniswap facilitate the trading of ERC-20 tokens.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on-chain data <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinlore.com/coin/tether" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">highlights</a> USDT as the most actively transacted token. Given its position as the third-largest coin by market cap, with substantial circulation in Ethereum and Tron networks, such a trend is expected.</p>
<p>Looking back at ERC-20 transactions from June and July, it is evident that transfers stayed constant despite temporary price increases. Ethereum prices rose from $1,630 to $2,000 between mid-June and mid-July 2023, but ETH is now lower. </p>

<p>On-chain ERC-20 activity has remained stable despite price volatility. It&#8217;s unclear whether there will be a change in activity as prices continue to drop. However, lower prices may force token holders to wait and see, leading to less activity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu, a cryptocurrency that originated as a meme but has now solidified its market presence, is making waves with the &#8216;Shibarium&#8217; launch on the horizon. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals that the crypto&#8217;s whales &#8211; entities holding large quantities &#8211; have shifted billions of SHIB tokens in the past 24 hours. This vast movement of funds coincides with an increase in Shiba Inu&#8217;s large transaction volume, reaching roughly 1.13 trillion SHIB.

This measure mainly provides valuable insights into the magnitude of transactions made by these influential participants on any given day, reflecting their potential impact on the market dynamics. IntoTheBlock defines large transactions as transfers exceeding $100,000. And as it stands, the recent activity shows increasing movements on the Shiba Inu market, with whales adjusting their holdings. Simultaneously, there has been a significant uptick in the burning of SHIB tokens, doubling in the past 24 hours. According to data from Shibburn, a platform solely for tracking Shiba Inu burn activities, over 62 million SHIB tokens have been eliminated from circulation in the past day, increasing the total SHIB burn rate by 220% over the same period. Notably, this deliberate reduction of available tokens is a strategy often used in the crypto sphere to create scarcity and potentially drive up the value of the remaining tokens in the long, in this case, the price of SHIB. The Shibarium Anticipation The recent activity among SHIB&#8217;s largest holders may be connected to the upcoming Shibarium launch.

Whether the coming changes propel SHIB to new heights or steer it down another path is a story that remains to be written. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu token SHIB has seen quite a retrace in the past 24 hours following a more than 5% increase over the past 7 days.

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin has completed its much-anticipated halving event today, but it seems the investors have reacted by participating in a selloff. Litecoin Has Completed Its Third Halving, Block Rewards Now Down To 6.25 LTC The &#8220;halving&#8221; event is where LTC&#8217;s block rewards are permanently cut in half. This event is periodic, occurring approximately every four years or roughly every 840,000 blocks miners hash. Today&#8217;s halving was Litecoin&#8217;s third, meaning its block rewards have been cut three times since its genesis. In the first halving, the cryptocurrency saw its block rewards go from an initial 50 LTC to 25 LTC, and with the second, the tips dropped further to 12.5 LTC. With the latest halving event, miners&#8217; rewards for solving blocks have been cut down further to 6.25 LTC. The reason that halvings even exist is because they serve as a measure for controlling the asset&#8217;s inflation. These block rewards that miners receive are the only way to introduce fresh tokens into the circulating supply, so cutting them down repeatedly makes sure that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply goes up slower and slower. Eventually, when the halvings would keep on happening, the block rewards would approach zero. This would occur approximately in 2142. After this point, the asset&#8217;s supply will hit the maximum cap, and the miners will have to rely on transaction fees to pay off their running costs. As halvings are important events, it&#8217;s natural that there has been a lot of discussion around this latest event as it has approached. During the start of July, the asset had observed a sharp rally towards the $114 mark, as the market had perhaps become hopeful for the halving, which was only one month away.

LTC has plunged during the past day &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView Today&#8217;s halving hasn&#8217;t been able to change anything in this matter, either, as Litecoin has only plummeted further instead. It would appear that the event has indeed been a buy the rumor, sell the news type of scenario. Following the latest plummet, Litecoin has gone below the $87 level and is down almost 7% during the past 24 hours. These high losses mean that LTC has been the poorest-performing coin out of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap in this period.

The cryptocurrency seems to have done well in terms of userbase and utility-related growth.

					<description><![CDATA[Mike McGlone, Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, has recently suggested that Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) underperformance compared to the stock market may be a warning sign for investors.  BTC’s Failure To Outshine In A Bull Market McGlone notes that Bitcoin has declined compared to the Nasdaq 100 stock index since its 2021 peak and April bounce. This waning performance may presage rising headwinds not only for Bitcoin but also for the broader crypto market. McGlone stated: If Bitcoin truly is the &#8220;fastest-horse-in-the-race,&#8221; as some consider it to be, then it should logically be outperforming in an everything bull market. However, that is not the case.  Notably, McGlone points to the most aggressive liquidity pull from central banks in history, which may be a significant factor in Bitcoin&#8217;s underperformance. Related Reading: Buying Pressure Incoming? MicroStrategy Files Notice With SEC To Sell $750 Million In Stocks The Federal Reserve (Fed) is still sighting in 3Q, despite the producer price index finished-goods gauge at minus 3.1% and dropping from 2022’s 18.3% peak at its fastest pace since 1948, which may be part of what underperforming Bitcoin is “sniffing out,” according to McGlone.  On a one-year basis to August 1st, Bitcoin is up just over 20%, similar to the Nasdaq, yet the crypto’s volatility is about two times greater. McGlone believes Bitcoin&#8217;s underperformance may be a warning sign for the broader market. The fact that Bitcoin is not outperforming as it should be in an everything-bull market could indicate that more significant market issues are at play, particularly in the face of aggressive liquidity pulls from central banks. Bitcoin And Ethereum Volatility At Historic Lows In a statement shared with NewsBTC Luuk Strijers, the Chief Commercial Officer at Deribit, a prominent cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, has recently stated that the Deribit Volatility Index (DVOL) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum is currently trading at an all-time low.  This is a significant development, especially since the DVOL for ETH is trading below the DVOL for BTC, which is a rare occurrence and may have been caused by the activity of a single large trader, commonly known as a whale. Despite the current low levels of volatility, Luuk Strijers highlights that the market is anticipating a considerable upswing in volatility shortly. This expectation is driven by several factors, including the upcoming ruling on the Blackrock spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and the approaching Bitcoin Halving. Strijers notes that Deribit has been observing signs of these expectations in the market, such as the significant steepness of the term structure, with June &#8217;24 trades at approximately 50, and the enduring call skew.  These indicators suggest that the market is anticipating increased volatility and potential price movements shortly, despite the current low levels of volatility. The Blackrock spot ETF ruling is anticipated to impact the cryptocurrency market significantly. If approved, the ETF will allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency, potentially increasing demand and driving up prices.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Is Shibarium The Key To A Trend Reversal? On the other hand, if the ruling is not approved, it may lead to a temporary drop in prices and increased volatility. The approaching Bitcoin Halvening, which is expected to occur in 2024, is another factor contributing to the anticipation of increased volatility, according to Strijers.  The Halvening is a significant event in the Bitcoin network that occurs roughly every four years, where the block reward for Bitcoin miners is cut in half. This tends to reduce the supply of Bitcoin on the market, potentially driving up prices and increasing volatility. Despite the current low levels of volatility, Strijers suggests that investors and traders should remain vigilant and prepare for potential price movements and increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $29,100, representing a slight increase of 0.8% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>Notably, McGlone points to the most aggressive liquidity pull from central banks in history, which may be a significant factor in Bitcoin&#8217;s underperformance.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve (Fed) is still sighting in 3Q, despite the producer price index finished-goods gauge at minus 3.1% and dropping from 2022’s 18.3% peak at its fastest pace since 1948, which may be part of what underperforming Bitcoin is “sniffing out,” according to McGlone. </p>
<p>On a one-year basis to August 1st, Bitcoin is up just over 20%, similar to the Nasdaq, yet the crypto’s volatility is about two times greater.</p>
<p>McGlone believes Bitcoin&#8217;s underperformance may be a warning sign for the broader market. The fact that Bitcoin is not outperforming as it should be in an everything-bull market could indicate that more significant market issues are at play, particularly in the face of aggressive liquidity pulls from central banks.</p>
Bitcoin And Ethereum Volatility At Historic Lows
<p>In a statement shared with NewsBTC Luuk Strijers, the Chief Commercial Officer at Deribit, a prominent cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, has recently stated that the Deribit Volatility Index (DVOL) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum is currently trading at an all-time low. </p>
<p>This is a significant development, especially since the DVOL for ETH is trading below the DVOL for BTC, which is a rare occurrence and may have been caused by the activity of a single large trader, commonly known as a whale.</p>
<p>Despite the current low levels of volatility, Luuk Strijers highlights that the market is anticipating a considerable upswing in volatility shortly. This expectation is driven by several factors, including the upcoming ruling on the Blackrock spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and the approaching Bitcoin Halving.</p>
<p>Strijers notes that Deribit has been observing signs of these expectations in the market, such as the significant steepness of the term structure, with June &#8217;24 trades at approximately 50, and the enduring call skew. </p>
<p>These indicators suggest that the market is anticipating increased volatility and potential price movements shortly, despite the current low levels of volatility.</p>
<p>The Blackrock spot ETF ruling is anticipated to impact the cryptocurrency market significantly. If approved, the ETF will allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency, potentially increasing demand and driving up prices. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if the ruling is not approved, it may lead to a temporary drop in prices and increased volatility. The approaching Bitcoin Halvening, which is expected to occur in 2024, is another factor contributing to the anticipation of increased volatility, according to Strijers. </p>
<p>The Halvening is a significant event in the Bitcoin network that occurs roughly every four years, where the block reward for Bitcoin miners is cut in half. This tends to reduce the supply of Bitcoin on the market, potentially driving up prices and increasing volatility.</p>
<p>Despite the current low levels of volatility, Strijers suggests that investors and traders should remain vigilant and prepare for potential price movements and increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $29,100, representing a slight increase of 0.8% in the past 24 hours.</p>

The moving average in reference is the 50-month moving average (50MA).

					<description><![CDATA[KuCoin, one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has temporarily halted its KuCoin Pool service, effective August 15, 2023, until further notice. The move is part of KuCoin&#8217;s business strategy and aims to ensure the security and integrity of users&#8217; assets. KuCoin Urges Users To Backup Mining Records During the suspension, users will retain complete access and control over their assets, and all other KuCoin offerings will remain operational as usual.  However, users who are involved in cryptocurrency mining are advised to transition their Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) miners to alternative mining pools before the deadline to ensure uninterrupted earnings. KuCoin has also advised users to back up and preserve their mining records and associated data before August 27, 2023, as failure to migrate to alternative mining pools within the specified timeline could affect their mining revenue.  Related Reading: Sell The News? Litecoin Traders Capitulate Ahead Of Today’s Halving Nevertheless, KuCoin Pool will not be held accountable for any potential earnings lapses resulting from users&#8217; failure to migrate to alternative pools. The temporary suspension of KuCoin&#8217;s mining pools may cause some disruption in the crypto market, as mining plays an important role in the ecosystem. Despite this, it is worth noting that KuCoin is just one exchange, and its suspension may not have a significant impact on the overall market. KuCoin has assured its users that the suspension is temporary, and the company is working on a new strategy for its mining pool service. The company has also emphasized that the security and integrity of users&#8217; assets remain its top priority, and it will take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of users&#8217; funds. Litecoin Halving Triggers Price Drop Litecoin, one of the oldest and most popular cryptocurrencies, has completed its third block reward halving at a block height of 2,520,000, as reported by Colin Wu. The halving event has cut the mining reward in half, from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC, as part of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s deflationary monetary policy. The halving is a regular event that occurs approximately every four years and is designed to control the rate at which new coins are minted. By reducing the reward for mining new blocks, the halving helps to prevent inflation and maintain the scarcity of the cryptocurrency. The current price of Litecoin is $89.12, which represents a 3.8% decline over the past 24 hours and a 10% decline over the past six months. The price drop may be related to market uncertainty surrounding the halving event, as well as broader market conditions. Despite the short-term price decline, many analysts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for Litecoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. The halving event is seen as a positive development that highlights the ongoing maturation of the industry and the growing recognition of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class.

The halving event is expected to further strengthen Litecoin&#8217;s position as a leading cryptocurrency and contribute to its long-term growth and success. Overall, the completion of Litecoin&#8217;s third block reward halving is a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency and the broader industry. While short-term price volatility is to be expected, the long-term outlook for Litecoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, remains positive, with many experts predicting continued growth and adoption in the years to come.

					<description><![CDATA[Binance’s utility coin BNB has posted significant gains, surprising investors as the broader crypto market slumps. Bitcoin and Ethereum, including most altcoins, have gone on recess while BNB surges amid rapid expansion plans on the Binance ecosystem. BNB’s spike on Tuesday, August 1, hinged on Binance&#8217;s announcement about the asset&#8217;s debut in the Japanese market through its newly launched subsidiary, Binance Japan. BNB jumped dramatically from $236.8555 to $246.0655, a nearly 4% increase, immediately after the news circulated the market.  BNB Price Bullish Amid Japanese Debut It is noteworthy that BNB is launching on Binance Japan for the first time since the history of Binance. Moreover, Binance Japan is the only Japanese exchange offering the token on its platform. Therefore, venturing into a new market is like achieving a major milestone for BNB and could guarantee a wider user base and increased daily transactions for the token. Alongside the announcement for the launch of Binance Japan, Binance is offering spot and leverage crypto trading on 34 cryptocurrencies. This vast list potentially entails more transactions on Binance, leading to more BNB spending as the platform&#8217;s utility token. Related Reading: Sell The News? Litecoin Traders Capitulate Ahead Of Today’s Halving But surprisingly, the price increase is not reflected in BNB&#8217;s trading volume, down over 47% in a 24-hour period. CoinMarketCap data shows BNB recorded over $1 billion in trading volume toward the close of Monday’s trading session.  The token saw an over 253% surge in trading volume on July 31, which didn&#8217;t reflect its nearly 1% price decline during the same period. After the sudden surge in trading activity and price, BNB&#8217;s movement has stalled as 24-hour trading volume stands at $734 million, with a 0.6% price increase in the last 24 hours. As of the time of writing, BNB trades at $242.9, inching closer to the $250 level as traders accumulate the token in anticipation of major rallies as it trades live on Binance Japan in the coming days.  BNB Vies For More Rallies As It Prepares To Conquer Key Resistance Levels Binance Coin (BNB) trades above three key support levels: $240.4, $242.0, and $243.3. The bulls found strength at $242.0 and $243.3 price levels, facilitating the sharp spike to $246.065 in the early hours of August 1. The chart demonstrates heated strife between the bulls and the bears as they struggle to prevail over the market. However, the stiff resistance at the $246.5 price level allowed the sellers to trigger a trend reversal. The bears have formed bearish candle sticks above the $243.3 price level and are striving to press the token further below. Related Reading: Weeks of Prosperity: MKR Holders See Wealth Grow By Over 100% Amidst Price Boom BNB is in a critical conjecture as the next few hours determine whether a move to the $250 target is possible.

					<description><![CDATA[The latest sign of crypto going mainstream among traditional investors is the race heating up to launch the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to Ethereum futures. In recent weeks, six companies have filed proposals with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Ethereum futures ETFs.  The Race To Launch An Ethereum Futures ETF Cryptocurrency ETFs track the price of the digital currencies they are tied to and they are not a new thing in the crypto industry. Bitcoin futures have gained popularity in recent years and are already being offered by popular investment companies.  However, with bitcoin futures ETFs now established, it is only natural for the next hot product to be an Ethereum futures ETF.
