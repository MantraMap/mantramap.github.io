Polygon (MATIC), a blockchain scalability platform, finds itself in the grip of negative sentiment that casts a shadow over its prospects for a strong price recovery. The crypto market has been a volatile space, prone to sudden shifts in sentiment, and MATIC is no exception. The recent downturn in the sentiment surrounding MATIC has left investors and traders cautiously observing the price charts. Once considered a promising project in the crypto space, Polygon&#8217;s potential for growth has been impeded by the recent actions of the US Securities and Exchange Commission against altcoins. Will the negative sentiment continue to hinder MATIC’s potential for a strong price recovery?

The recent downturn in the crypto market seems to be linked to the press conference held by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on June 14, during which he announced that the central bank would temporarily halt rate hikes for the month of June.

Instead of stabilizing, the market experienced a reversal in its course and resumed the ongoing sell-off that has persisted for the past three weeks. The presence of substantial macroeconomic challenges, coupled with the anticipation of future rate hikes and low trading volume, suggests that the volatility in the cryptocurrency market is likely to persist in the foreseeable future.  The prevailing headwinds, including economic factors on a larger scale, have contributed to the unpredictability and turbulence in the crypto market.
