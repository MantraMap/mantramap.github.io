					<description><![CDATA[When Bitcoin prices fell from $31,000 to below $29,000, the total value of BTC held by China¬†fell by over $388 million to around $5,4 billion.¬† China‚Äôs Bitcoin Stash Fell By $388 Million Bitcoin is trading below $28,500 and looks likely to edge even lower, considering the formation in the daily chart. With every tick lower, China and other countries, including Ukraine and Georgia, are losing money. The loss could even be bigger for the Chinese considering their big stash of BTC, which translates to around 0.924% of the total fixed supply of 21 million, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data.

					<description><![CDATA[Since reaching its yearly high of $0.5842 on March 29th, XRP has experienced a significant price drop. The token has lost its bullish momentum and failed to breach higher levels, disappointing investors who were optimistic about the uptrend of one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. It is worth noting that XRP&#8217;s recent price drop is part of a wider market correction affecting the entire cryptocurrency market. Despite this, trader and crypto analyst &#8220;Dark Defender&#8221; believes that there is still further correction ahead for XRP. Related Reading: Is The Final Shakeout Moment Coming For Bitcoin? Expert Weighs In No Signs Of Recovery For XRP? On April 1st, Dark Defender made a bold prediction for the price of XRP based on Elliott Waves theory. According to Dark Defender, the token completed its first wave (W1) at around $0.59 and is expected to enter a second wave (W2) that will find support between $0.48 and $0.38. As of now, there have been no changes to Dark Defender&#8217;s prediction, and XRP remains in correction unless it breaks its resistance level of $0.59 and stays above it for three consecutive days. Dark Defender has provided a list of support levels for XRP, including $0.4812, $0.45544, $0.42044, and $0.38813. The analyst believes that XRP will finish this last correction at one of these levels before targeting the $3 mark.¬† Furthermore, the analyst has provided a bullish prediction for XRP&#8217;s future, stating that the third wave (W3) of this structure is expected to reach between $2 and $3.47 by the end of this year. However, this wave 3 above $1.33 will be the predecessor of the Grand Wave 3. In scenario 2, Dark Defender predicts that XRP will continue to rise in value. As of this writing, XRP is currently trading at $0.4582, which represents a drop of over 2.6% in the last 24 hours. On wider time frames, the token has recorded significant drops of 11% and 9.2% in the seven and fourteen-day time frames, respectively. This means that if Dark Defender‚Äôs prediction is correct, XRP may still have plenty of downtrends to experience, potentially reaching the lower lows of March 21st at $0.380. XRP&#8217;s Wide Adoption Continues To Increase XRP has been gaining traction in recent months, with its unique utility in cross-border payments attracting attention from financial institutions and investors, which has been raising with its continuous innovations to provide a better service to its users.¬† According to pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton, Uphold, a digital platform that allows users to buy, sell, and hold various cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies, currently holds $1.04 billion in XRP, making XRP the single largest asset holding on the platform. This amount is significantly greater than Uphold‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings, which currently stand at $131 million. In addition, the token volume accounted for 28.33% of total transactions on Uphold&#8217;s platform. This indicates a growing demand for XRP among Uphold&#8217;s user base and suggests a positive outlook for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future growth and adoption.

<p>One thing is for sure, the tool predicting volatility was accurate. Now it‚Äôs time to pay attention.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tornado Cash¬†token (TORN) is trading on a negative 13% in today&#8217;s trade session, canceling its previous day&#8217;s gains and rally, which saw the token rise close to the $12 mark. Coinmarketcap data reveals the token to be trading at $8.77 at the time of writing, a significant drop from where it was in price yesterday. The TORN token and its decentralized mixing service platform became controversial when its developer, Alexey Pertev, was arrested mid-last year allegedly for money laundering. However, news about the possible jail release of Alexey circulated the industry yesterday, April 20, and created a rally for the TORN token.

Here‚Äôs Why Tornado Cash Developer Set To Be Released On This Date According to a recent¬†report, the developer of the TORN token, Alexey Pertev, is expected to be released on April 26, 2023, after spending nine months in detention without trial. The news of his potential release came yesterday when the crypto markets were declining. However, the Tornado Cash token reacted to the news of Alexey&#8217;s release and defied market conditions by displaying bullish price action. While the rally drew investors&#8217; attention, the token could not continue its upward movements today despite positive price speculations by crypto experts and analysts. Alexey Pertev, who is set to be released next Wednesday, will await trial from his home as ruled by a court in the Netherlands. Upon his release, electronic monitoring devices such as an ankle bracelet will be installed on him and other monitoring devices in his home, according to the report. At the time of writing, the TORN token is currently ranked among the top 3 losers in the cryptocurrency market. Alexey Pertev&#8217;s release date is approaching, and we may witness Tornado Cash reacting in price as it did with the news about his release. &#160; TORN token trades in a steep decline after previous day rally &#124; Source: TORNUSD on TradingView &#160; Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Steal 3%, Time To DCA? Bitcoin Price Impact On TORN Token Bitcoin is on its 3-day bearish candle, failing to break the resistance slightly above the $30,000 price region. BTC¬†price lost momentum after its previous week&#8217;s rally and failed to hold the key support level at $29,200. Today&#8217;s trading session saw Bitcoin falling below $28,000 after it failed to hold $28,600 key support. BTC price fell to a 24-hour low of $27,815 but is now slightly back above the $28,000 price region. Some Altcoins, including the Tornado Cash token, have brutally suffered from the Bitcoin price dump and are still yet to recover. However, a healthy recovery for¬†Bitcoin price¬†will be a good turning point for Tornado Cash as Altcoins are known to react to BTC price movements.

					<description><![CDATA[In January of this year, Bitcoin broke above its 200-day MA for the first time since the end of 2021. This was a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency, as it had not seen such a signal in over a year. This breakout was a clear indication of Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish momentum and its potential for further growth in the future. Additionally, Bitcoin retested the 200-day moving average in March and remained well above it, demonstrating its robust behavior. However, the leading cryptocurrency is approaching a lower-level retest at $28,000. Whether Bitcoin will withstand further price decline and continue its bullish trend or if a final shakeout is imminent. Bitcoin&#8217;s Halving Cycle And Potential Dip Below The 200-Day MA Recently, there has been speculation that Bitcoin‚Äôs price might be poised for a significant rally as spring arrives. However, the situation is not quite simple as with many things in the crypto world.¬† According to the expert in the cryptocurrency industry, Mr. Ben Lily, the current halving cycle is an important factor to consider when evaluating Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. When BTC comes off halving cycle lows, it commonly does not immediately clear the 200-day moving average (MA) and stays above it. Instead, it tends to return below the 200-day MA before ultimately moving on to form all-time highs. This pattern can be observed in the chart below, which shows the 200-day MA (represented by the dark red line) and the orange circles, which indicate when the price dipped below the 200-day MA. Furthermore, Lily argues that nothing suggests that the market should expect anything different this time. He believes a catalyst coming this summer will coincide with Bitcoin&#8217;s price dipping below the 200-day MA.¬† FedNow Rollout And Bitcoin: A Tale Of Two Timing Additionally, Ben Lily has provided further analysis on the potential impact of the upcoming rollout of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s CBDC, FedNow, on Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. According to Lily, if the rollout occurs as scheduled in July, it could benefit BTC‚Äôs price trajectory. However, Lily notes that in each of the last three halving cycles, Bitcoin‚Äôs price dipped below the 200-day moving average (MA) between 217 and 315 days before the halving itself. If this pattern holds for the current halving cycle, we can expect BTC‚Äôs price to dip below the 200-day MA sometime between June and August. With FedNow set to roll out in the middle of that period, Lily suggests we can expect regulator &#8220;war drumming&#8221; to be at a fever pitch. This could lead to a final shakeout moment as Bitcoin drops below the 200-day MA, creating a higher low in the market. At the moment of writing, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is being traded at $28,000, indicating a decrease of over 2.5% in the last 24 hours. And, as reported yesterday by NewsBTC, the $27,700 line is key for Bitcoin, as a breakout below this level could signal a shift in the market sentiment and potentially lead to a further decline in price.

					<description><![CDATA[Whales have resumed their Shiba Inu buying spree as the meme coin price declined alongside the global crypto market. According to the WhaleStats report, a top ETH whale picked up $3.22 million worth of SHIB tokens over the past 24 hours. The Ethereum whale performed the purchase in two transactions, scooping over 311 billion Siba Inu tokens within minutes. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Price Correction Attracts Top ETH Whales Shiba Inu has been on the list of preferred assets among top Ethereum whales over the past few months. The whales actively packed large chunks of SHIB tokens between January and February. However, it appears the whales went on break, waiting for another opportunity to strike. Related Reading: Cardano In Strong Demand Zone, Breaking Through Key Level Crucial A recent alert from the crypto tracking platform, WhaleStats, shows the 254th-biggest Ethereum whale purchased 311,998,734,794 SHIB tokens on April 20. The whale performed the transaction in two consecutive transactions. The whale bought 194,114,774,578 Shiba Inu tokens worth $2,069,263 before initiating another transaction for 117,883,216 SHIB worth $1,256,643. The unexpected token accumulation comes as Shiba Inu&#8217;s price fell from its critical support level at $0.0000107. Shiba Inu Price Outlook Amid Burn Rate Spikes The recent price decline comes after several days of massive SHIB token burn by the Shiba Inu community to boost the meme coin‚Äôs price. In the days following the Shibarium PuppyNet launch, large chunks of Shiba Inu coins went into the dead wallets.¬† On April 20, the Shiba Inu token burn rate spiked by 3,500%, according to the burn tracking website, Shibburn. Following Shibburn‚Äôs hourly update, April 20 saw another 5,180% burn rate spike.¬† Related Reading: Cardano Racks Up Nearly 4% Gain Amid Short-Term Losses ‚Äì Will Investors Hold Firm? Given Shiba Inu‚Äôs massive circulation supply of tokens, the recent burn had little effect on the meme coin&#8217;s price. The token traded bearishly yesterday, with a 7.0% price decline, and has continued in the downtrend today. SHIB is slightly recovering after forming three consecutive red candles on the daily chart. The bears have dominated the market, pushing SHIB close to its support zone. Shiba Inu has dropped below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a bearish sentiment for the short and long term.¬† Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 41.22, close to the oversold region of 30. The indicator is moving downwards, suggesting further decline for the asset.¬†SHIB&#8217;s support levels are $0.0000085 and $0.0000102, with resistance levels at $0.0000115 and $0.0000112. SHIB is close to the $0.0000102 support level. If the level does not hold, expect further price decline from the asset in the coming days. At press time, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001061, and the price is rising after declining by 3.6%. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amid the bearish trend that suppressed several coin prices, including Bitcoin, the Zilliqa token emerged among the gainers. Zilliqa secured first place among top-gaining coins in the bearish cryptocurrency market with a 9% uptrend over the past 24 hours. This price move follows a network performance statistics update shared by a Twitter community member @inna_everstake. According to stats, Zilliqa reached a new milestone in network addresses and daily transactions. Zilliqa Hits Milestone In Network Activity Zilliqa is a permissionless public blockchain that offers high transaction throughput. It aims to improve blockchain scalability and speed using sharding as a layer2 scaling solution.¬† The Zilliqa network relies on shards to solve scalability issues. Each shard processes transactions independently. The number of transactions increases as the Zilliqa network grows and the number of shards increases. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Momentum Screeches To A Halt: What‚Äôs The Outlook? The recent network performance statistics suggest the Zilliqa network is rapidly growing and has gained more traction. According to the update, Zilliqa recorded 4,582,116 addresses with 47,937,935 transactions and over 5.5 billion staked ZIL tokens.¬† The statistics are incredible, given Zilliqa‚Äôs position in the cryptocurrency market compared to other Smart Contract platforms like Cardano, Ethereum, and Solana. Another notable fact is that the total addresses recorded participate in active daily transactions. Zilliqa‚Äôs improved performance could be due to the increasing number of new developers coming to build on the network. The Zilliqa ecosystem has been active in running innovative programs that attract new Web3 developers, which is why the network addresses and transactions skyrocketed. ZIL Price Outlook Amid The Boost In Network Performance Zilliqa is among the coins with the most dynamic price movement this year. Zilliqa opened in 2023 at $0.01585 but gradually rallied to its current price of $0.0331, a notable increase amid slight pullbacks. Although ZIL is still 87.33% down from its all-time high price of $0.2563, recorded on May 6, 2021, it has improved considerably since 2020.¬† ZIL&#8217;s price is over 1,210% higher than its all-time low of $0.002477 on March 13, 2020. At press time, ZIL is trading at $0.331, a 9% price increase from the April 20 closing price of $0.03015. Related Reading: OKB Tallies 24% Increase But Active Addresses Fail To Keep Pace ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why Even ZIL&#8217;s trading volume has increased by over 38% from $116.69 million on April 20 to $190.71 million today, April 21. That could be a further confirmation of increased network activity.¬† ZIL also recorded a nearly 11% price gain over the past seven days when coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum gave up theirs. The token now has over 12% price increase in the last two weeks. From the technical perspective, ZIL&#8217;s market sentiment is bullish, with the oscillators and moving averages flagging a strong buy signal.

Despite only recently making its way into the market, it has managed to make a name for itself by establishing exciting offerings for players. The most eye-catching thing about this new casino has to be its welcome bonus for first-time players. For the first five deposits, players can earn up to ¬£9,500 back in bonus credit. The first deposit is matched 300% up to ¬£500, the second 100% up to ¬£1,000, the third 100% up to ¬£2,000, the fourth 50% up to ¬£2,500, and the fifth and final deposit is matched 50% up to ¬£3,500. This is a highly generous potential bonus but the wagering requirements are somewhat restrictive at 45 times the bonus amount. Fully acceptable terms, but a tad bit into the higher end of the scale. The games on offer are also impressive but less numerous than many competing casinos. The slots are numerous and include titles by all of the leading providers. However, the table games are less prominent and not given as much space in the catalog at many other casinos. Its live casino makes up for that slightly, as it includes a good number of games, including gameshows and immersive gaming experiences.

Payments at a Casino Not on GamStop Payments at a casino not on GamStop can vary depending on the individual casino. However, most reputable online casinos offer a range of payment methods, including credit cards, e-wallets, bank transfers, and prepaid cards. It&#8217;s important to note that some payment methods may not be available in certain countries or regions. When making a payment at a casino not with GamStop, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure that the website is secure and encrypted to protect your personal and financial information. Look for casinos that use industry-standard security measures, such as SSL encryption, to safeguard your data. It&#8217;s also important to check the deposit and withdrawal limits and processing times for each payment method. Some payment methods may have lower minimum or maximum limits than others, and processing times may vary depending on the payment provider and the casino&#8217;s policies. Overall, when choosing a casino not with GamStop, it&#8217;s important to consider the payment options available and ensure that they meet your needs and preferences. By doing so, you can enjoy a seamless and secure gaming experience without worrying about payment issues. Advantages of Playing at Non Gamstop Casino Sites UK players who choose to play at a non-Gamstop online casino have more control over their gambling experience, as the casinos are not limited by the same restrictions. Here are a couple of benefits that stem from playing at an online casino without Gamstop. Easier KYC Verification When it comes to making your payments at any online casino, there is often a couple of hoops to jump through, especially with Gamstop sites. You may find that non-Gamstop sites do not have the same verification requirements. They are often referred to as no-verification casinos, as the process is much quicker. In contrast, other sites may have a process that takes a couple of days. Less Brand Tax and More Bonus Rewards One of the biggest advantages of these offshore sites is that they often have fewer taxes to pay. While this is an advantage for the site itself, it also comes at an advantage for you as it means that they can expand and increase their range of bonuses and promotions while lowering the deposit requirements. Ideally Situated Many of these online casinos without Gamstop are still located in Europe. While they are non-Gamstop sites, they are still considered safe and accept UK players. They provide a wide range of perks to enhance the gaming experience. Disadvantages of Casinos Not on Gamstop A couple of drawbacks are tied to non-Gamstop online casinos, which also need to be taken into account. We take a look at some of the disadvantages these sites have to give you a clear view of the experience available on any casino site without Gamstop. Counselling on Your Own Dime When it comes to non-Gamstop sites, you don&#8217;t have the option of free counselling. This is something that isn&#8217;t always noticeable, but it can be a big help in cases where it&#8217;s needed. Most non-Gamstop sites don&#8217;t have counselling options. A Withdrawal Flow With most sites, you find set withdrawal limits that are quite strict. At non-Gamstop casino sites, you will notice a free flow in terms of withdrawals, enabling you to withdraw any amount you want at any moment. Not Always Telephone Support Some non gamstop casinos don&#8217;t offer telephone support. However, many of these casinos provide around-the-clock live support via chat, which can be just as efficient. If you prefer telephone support, it&#8217;s important to check whether this option is available before signing up with a particular casino brand.

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-527833 aligncenter" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Goldenbet-casino-uk.png" alt="Goldenbet Online Casino" width="1280" height="787" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Goldenbet-casino-uk.png 1280w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Goldenbet-casino-uk-460x283.png 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Goldenbet-casino-uk-860x529.png 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Goldenbet-casino-uk-768x472.png 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Goldenbet-casino-uk-750x461.png 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Goldenbet-casino-uk-1140x701.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
<p>As far as UK online casinos go, Goldenbet is a newcomer to the game. Established in 2022, it has had to move quickly to establish itself. Its gaming library is already impressive, though, and the promotions available have helped it stand out.</p>
Highlights
<ul>
<li>Great payment options for UK players</li>
<li>High withdrawal limits</li>
<li>Unlimited 10% cashback</li>
<li>Offers Sports, Racing, Casino, and Live Casino</li>
</ul>
<p>First, as mentioned, the promotions are competitive. The welcome bonus is a little bit lower than some on the market with a 100% deposit match up to ¬£500. However, what really sets it apart is its regular cashback promotion. It is an unlimited-use cashback of 10%. The max cashback amount is ¬£500 but this can be redeemed as many times as the player makes eligible deposits and wagers.</p>
<p>Its game catalogue is extensive and includes progressive jackpot slots from some of the leading providers on the markets, as well as table games and live titles. The live selection is a little less full than the other selections but also includes more specialist games like poker. There are also game shows like Monopoly Live for players looking for something different.</p>
<p>Perhaps what sets it apart from the crowd most is its commitment to supporting players. There is a 24-hour live chat function open seven days a week. This means that if there are any concerns, an answer will be available whenever necessary.</p>

Highlights
<ul>
<li>Up to ¬£9,500 bonus available on first five deposits</li>
<li>Games from leading providers like NetEnt and Microgaming</li>
<li>Extensive banking methods</li>
<li>Live chat support</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a casino that is new to the scene, having been established in 2022. Despite only recently making its way into the market, it has managed to make a name for itself by establishing exciting offerings for players.</p>
<p>The most eye-catching thing about this new casino has to be its welcome bonus for first-time players. For the first five deposits, players can earn up to ¬£9,500 back in bonus credit. The first deposit is matched 300% up to ¬£500, the second 100% up to ¬£1,000, the third 100% up to ¬£2,000, the fourth 50% up to ¬£2,500, and the fifth and final deposit is matched 50% up to ¬£3,500.</p>
<p>This is a highly generous potential bonus but the wagering requirements are somewhat restrictive at 45 times the bonus amount. Fully acceptable terms, but a tad bit into the higher end of the scale.</p>
<p>The games on offer are also impressive but less numerous than many competing casinos. The slots are numerous and include titles by all of the leading providers. However, the table games are less prominent and not given as much space in the catalog at many other casinos. Its live casino makes up for that slightly, as it includes a good number of games, including gameshows and immersive gaming experiences.</p>

It&#8217;s important to note that some payment methods may not be available in certain countries or regions.</p>
<p>When making a payment at a casino not with GamStop, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure that the website is secure and encrypted to protect your personal and financial information. Look for casinos that use industry-standard security measures, such as SSL encryption, to safeguard your data.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also important to check the deposit and withdrawal limits and processing times for each payment method. Some payment methods may have lower minimum or maximum limits than others, and processing times may vary depending on the payment provider and the casino&#8217;s policies.</p>
<p>Overall, when choosing a casino not with GamStop, it&#8217;s important to consider the payment options available and ensure that they meet your needs and preferences. By doing so, you can enjoy a seamless and secure gaming experience without worrying about payment issues.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Playing at Non Gamstop Casino Sites</h2>
<p>UK players who choose to play at a non-Gamstop online casino have more control over their gambling experience, as the casinos are not limited by the same restrictions. Here are a couple of benefits that stem from playing at an online casino without Gamstop.</p>
Easier KYC Verification
<p>When it comes to making your payments at any online casino, there is often a couple of hoops to jump through, especially with Gamstop sites. You may find that non-Gamstop sites do not have the same verification requirements. They are often referred to as no-verification casinos, as the process is much quicker. In contrast, other sites may have a process that takes a couple of days.</p>
Less Brand Tax and More Bonus Rewards
<p>One of the biggest advantages of these offshore sites is that they often have fewer taxes to pay. While this is an advantage for the site itself, it also comes at an advantage for you as it means that they can expand and increase their range of bonuses and promotions while lowering the deposit requirements.</p>
Ideally Situated
<p>Many of these online casinos without Gamstop are still located in Europe. While they are non-Gamstop sites, they are still considered safe and accept UK players. They provide a wide range of perks to enhance the gaming experience.</p>
<h2>Disadvantages of Casinos Not on Gamstop</h2>
<p>A couple of drawbacks are tied to non-Gamstop online casinos, which also need to be taken into account. We take a look at some of the disadvantages these sites have to give you a clear view of the experience available on any casino site without Gamstop.</p>
Counselling on Your Own Dime
<p>When it comes to non-Gamstop sites, you don&#8217;t have the option of free counselling. This is something that isn&#8217;t always noticeable, but it can be a big help in cases where it&#8217;s needed. Most non-Gamstop sites don&#8217;t have counselling options.</p>
A Withdrawal Flow
<p>With most sites, you find set withdrawal limits that are quite strict. At non-Gamstop casino sites, you will notice a free flow in terms of withdrawals, enabling you to withdraw any amount you want at any moment.</p>
Not Always Telephone Support
<p>Some non gamstop casinos don&#8217;t offer telephone support. However, many of these casinos provide around-the-clock live support via chat, which can be just as efficient. If you prefer telephone support, it&#8217;s important to check whether this option is available before signing up with a particular casino brand.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin has experienced a hard couple of days after climbing above $30,000 last week. The coin reaching a new 9-month high triggered euphoria in the market. However, it has begun to wear off as Bitcoin has now returned to $28,000 once more. The question now is where does BTC go from here? Does it continue its uptrend and is further downside more likely for the cryptocurrency? Analyst Shares Expectations For Bitcoin Speaking on where Bitcoin might go from here, analyst Micheal van de Poppe shared his forecasts.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange outflows have seen a significant spike during the past day, a sign that may be bullish for the price. Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Have Observed A Large Spike Today As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a total of 2,138 BTC has been taken out of exchanges during the last day. The &#8220;exchange outflow&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that&#8217;s being withdrawn from the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric has an elevated value, it means the investors are transferring out a large number of coins from these platforms. Generally, holders withdraw their BTC from exchanges for holding onto them for extended periods in offsite wallets. Because of this reason, elevated values of this metric can be a sign of accumulation, and hence, can be bullish for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. On the other hand, the low values of the indicator imply there aren&#8217;t many withdrawals happening in the market right now. Such a trend can be either bearish or neutral for the asset, depending on how the &#8220;exchange inflow,&#8221; the counterpart indicator, is behaving at the moment. Holders usually deposit to exchanges for selling-related purposes, so when the exchange inflow has high values, it suggests the investors may be participating in a selloff of the asset. Naturally, this can have bearish consequences for the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Supply Older Than 7 Years On The Move Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange outflow, as well as in the inflow, over the last day: The value of the outflow seems to have been quite high in recent hours &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange outflow has registered a very sharp spike in the last few hours. In total, the investors have withdrawn 2,138 BTC (about $60.6 million at the current exchange rate) from exchanges with this spike. Since these large withdrawals have come while the price of the cryptocurrency has been in the lower $28,000 values (which are relatively low levels considering the price had been above $30,000 just a few days ago), it&#8217;s possible that these transfers out of exchanges are a sign of fresh buying taking place in the market. From the chart, it&#8217;s also visible that the exchange inflows have remained at low values at the same time, meaning that there aren&#8217;t any deposits happening to counteract these withdrawals. This may imply that there isn&#8217;t any additional appetite for selling at the current levels for now.

BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,000, down 9% in the last week. Looks like the value of the asset has been plunging in the last few days &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Dmitry Demidko on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com]]></description>

Because of this reason, elevated values of this metric can be a sign of accumulation, and hence, can be bullish for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the low values of the indicator imply there aren&#8217;t many withdrawals happening in the market right now. Such a trend can be either bearish or neutral for the asset, depending on how the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-largest-inflow-6-sign-profit-taking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exchange inflow</a>,&#8221; the counterpart indicator, is behaving at the moment.</p>
<p>Holders usually deposit to exchanges for selling-related purposes, so when the exchange inflow has high values, it suggests the investors may be participating in a selloff of the asset. Naturally, this can have bearish consequences for the price.</p>

<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange outflow, as well as in the inflow, over the last day:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://img.cryptoquant.com/280562/quicktake/dJQnO_cd4b12bacf4f7451dbd9305739683c2da9ffdbb9786942f1966d25d994a6b789.png" alt="Bitcoin Exchange Outflow And Inflow" width="1280" height="705" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange outflow has registered a very sharp spike in the last few hours. In total, the investors have withdrawn 2,138 BTC (about $60.6 million at the current exchange rate) from exchanges with this spike.</p>
<p>Since these large withdrawals have come while the price of the cryptocurrency has been in the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/bitcoin-crypto-drop-in-danger-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower $28,000 values</a> (which are relatively low levels considering the price had been above $30,000 just a few days ago), it&#8217;s possible that these transfers out of exchanges are a sign of fresh buying taking place in the market.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s also visible that the exchange inflows have remained at low values at the same time, meaning that there aren&#8217;t any deposits happening to counteract these withdrawals. This may imply that there isn&#8217;t any additional appetite for selling at the current levels for now.</p>

<p>This fresh unimpeded Bitcoin accumulation can be a positive sign for the market, as it means that there are at least some large investors in the sector who view the current prices as a discounted buying opportunity, and not as a sign of more decline to come.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,000, down 9% in the last week.</p>
