<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin maintains solid upward momentum, with the price zone above $30,000 being sustained for over two weeks.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite a drop below $31,000 after the release of the FOMC meeting minutes, demand for Bitcoin futures from institutional and professional investors remains strong.</em></li>



<li><em>BTC&#8217;s price is looking to break the $31,200 resistance level, with a potential target of $35,500 on the weekly chart.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin (BTC) is creating a solid upward momentum when the $30,000 price zone has been maintained for more than 2 weeks.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-404-1024x637.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="637" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-404-1024x637.png" alt="Bitcoin Is Waiting For The Next Bull Run At $35,500" class="wp-image-200646" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-404-1024x637.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-404-300x187.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-404-768x477.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-404-750x466.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-404-1140x709.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-404.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin Is Waiting For The Next Bull Run At $35,500 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>Earlier, the Bitcoin price saw a substantial increase in <a href="https://coincu.com/197227-jerome-powell-raise-interest-rates-2-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling pressure</a> in the wake of the minutes of the United States Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in June.</p>



<p>While BTC has dropped below the $31,000 mark, the growth in demand for Bitcoin futures from institutional and professional investors remains, implying a price squeeze for the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) commodity is possible.</p>



<p>The second Bitcoin halving will take place in May 2024. A bull run is possible if the qualities identified during prior halving occurrences are maintained.</p>



<p>The largest cryptocurrency is up 1.4% to $31,200 on Friday, while the second-largest crypto, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, has, in the last 24 hours, increased 0.75% to trade at $1,945. This can be said to be a step to create momentum for the upcoming rally of the coins with the largest market capitalization.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/199813-bitcoin-pushes-to-31000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> price is securely above the immediate support level of $30,500, with a much stronger support level of $30,000 predicted. BTC soared in June, regaining resistance above $31,000, boosted by various filings by businesses seeking to launch a spot <a href="https://coincu.com/200412-blackrock-ceo-praises-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>



<p>Looking at the daily chart, BTC&#8217;s price is looking to break its $31,200 resistance and move towards a further area. This is evident in the candlesticks retreating and trading higher each day.</p>

<p>More broadly, on the weekly chart, the price area where BTC could place its outlook is at $35,500, which is also its Fib %38.2 level since the drop early last year.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="623" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-1024x623.png" alt="Bitcoin Is Waiting For The Next Bull Run At $35,500" class="wp-image-200637" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-1024x623.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-300x183.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-768x467.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-1536x935.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-2048x1247.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-750x457.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-1140x694.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin Is Waiting For The Next Bull Run At $35,500 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTC 1W price chart. <em>Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The time is now quite favorable for investors to consider as the BTC price zone breaks above $32,000 and retracements in the near term. Waiting will limit the risk and it is safer to buy at the current resistance level.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX Japan has postponed its resale plan in a recent development.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX Trading, the headquarters of the major crypto exchange that went bankrupt in 2022, is now rebuilding.</em></li>



<li><em>The branch in Japan has returned 80% of fiat currency, such as Japanese yen and virtual currency, to customers.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB2339Y0T20C23A6000000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikkei News</a>, FTX Trading, a major crypto asset exchange that went bankrupt in 2022, is undergoing reconstruction and plans to postpone the sale of its subsidiary FTX Japan in Chiyoda, Tokyo. The company is said to have communicated its intentions to the Japan Financial Services Agency through FTX Japan.</strong></h5>

<p>If the trading system used by the predecessor QUOINE (coin) of Japan FTX works well, the Japan Financial Services Agency could allow the Japanese company to resume operations before the end of the year.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://coincu.com/184521-ftx-japan-delays-resale-to-restart-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX Japan&#8217;s</a> customer asset return process, launched in February, is progressing smoothly. FTX Japan has returned 80% of fiat currency, such as Japanese yen and virtual currency, to customers.</p>



<p>Of all the subsidiaries of the 2nd largest crypto empire in the market, only FTX Japan has not been severely affected by its strict adherence to Japanese exchange and reserve regulations.</p>

<p>At the end of June, the new CEO of FTX, John J. Ray III, said that the company had begun attracting interested parties to reopen the crypto exchange FTX.com.</p>



<p>Many people appreciate the FTX platform on a technological level, so it makes sense to attempt to reopen the exchange. The only big obstacle is the huge debt owed to creditors, of which former customers are only a part. Some customers have refused to accept only partial refunds. They could start a new legal proceeding that could delay reopening plans quite a bit.</p>



<p>However, if they can work around this by convincing former customers to accept only partial refunds, they may be able to reopen.</p>



<p>Failed crypto exchange FTX said it would launch a portal &#8220;in the next few weeks&#8221; for customers owed to global crypto trading platform FTX.com and its affiliates to state their requirements. The exchange has stated this on claims.ftx.com, where the portal will be hosted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance is upgrading its wallet infrastructure to enhance efficiency and fund security for users.</em></li>



<li><em>Selected deposit addresses and memos will be retired in batches, with impacted users receiving inmail notifications.</em></li>



<li><em>Users are encouraged to obtain new addresses and memos upon receiving notifications, while funds deposited into expired addresses remain safe and can be manually credited.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a bid to provide better efficiency and enhanced security measures for its users, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/existing-deposit-addresses-to-be-retired-in-q3-july-september-2023-ffbe37cbd85f46db8fe3021ee3f85eb3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> significant upgrades to its wallet infrastructure.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-1024x683.png" alt="Binance Unleashes Wallet Upgrades To Enhance Efficiency And Security" class="wp-image-200609" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391.png 1095w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Unleashes Wallet Upgrades To Enhance Efficiency And Security 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The exchange will be retiring specific deposit addresses and memos in a phased manner across different networks, with affected users receiving inmail notifications.</p>



<p>To ensure a transition, Binance strongly advises seamless users to obtain new deposit addresses and memos (if applicable) upon receiving the official notification. It is important to note that users who have not received any notification are encouraged to continue using their current deposit addresses without any changes.</p>



<p>The retirement of old deposit addresses and memos will only affect users who receive specific notifications from Binance, and the expiry date of the old addresses will be clearly stated in the notifications. However, it is reassuring to know that funds into addresses remain safe and secure, and users can manually credit these deposits via the &#8220;Transaction History&#8221; page on the platform.</p>

<p>To obtain new deposit addresses and memos (if applicable), affected users can conveniently log into their Binance accounts on either the Binance app or website. The exchange&#8217;s ongoing commitment to enhancing user experience and security is evident in this wallet infrastructure upgrade, which aims to streamline operations and provide an even more secure environment for cryptocurrency transactions.</p>



<p>With these improvements, <a href="https://coincu.com/199795-binance-drops-spot-volume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> continues to demonstrate its dedication to maintaining the highest standards of service, providing user funds are well-protected, and upholding its position as a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the industry in the context of the exchange being subject to regulatory imposition in regions around the world.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/200226-binance-stops-multichain-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, from 08:00 UTC on July 7 until further notice, the exchange will halt support for the deposit and withdrawal of Multichain cross-chain bridge tokens created over the following network.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Pendle has reached an all-time high of $171.25 million in TVL, driven by its unique approach to yield farming.</em></li>



<li><em>The project&#8217;s native token has surged by approximately 4,000% this year, from $0.044 to $1.75, attracting significant attention from investors.</em></li>



<li><em>The protocol&#8217;s success can be attributed to factors such as the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, which enabled the withdrawal of staked ETH.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On July 5, total value locked (TVL) in Pendle, a DeFi protocol that divides yield-bearing tokens into principle and yield components, reached an all-time high of $171.25 million.</strong></h5>

<p>This year&#8217;s growth of PENDLE has been spectacular. The token has risen from $0.044 at the start of the year to $1.75. The project&#8217;s token, which collects protocol fees while locked, is up roughly 4,000% this year, trading at levels last seen at the bull market&#8217;s peak two years ago. A spike of this size cannot be explained only by a recent listing. A close look into the on-chain data uncovers some intriguing insights into the factors behind the protocol&#8217;s extraordinary success.</p>



<p>Moreover, whales&#8217; accumulation of PENDLE might be seen as a significant vote of confidence in the protocol&#8217;s long-term potential. Pendle&#8217;s novel approach to yield farming, which allows users to tokenize and exchange future produce, has grabbed the curiosity of forward-thinking investors.</p>



<p>Inflows increased when Ethereum&#8217;s Shanghai upgrade went online in April, allowing for the first-time withdrawals of staked ETH. According to DeFiLlama data, approximately $40 million in stETH has been tokenized on the network since then.</p>

<p>Pendle, in addition to yield-splitting, has an automated market maker (AMM) where traders may buy and sell either the primary token or its related yield independently. On July 3, the AMM <a href="https://dune.com/kaysblc/pendle-all-in-one-by-kays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observed</a> a significant increase in activity, with over 8,500 transactions.</p>

<p>Currently, the price of PENDLE is trading at $0.87, it broke the previous $0.66 resistance area and once reached the $1.75 mark. The current price is also close to the Fib %61.8 level. We need to wait for more signals to consider this price area.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>ShibaSwap, the first decentralized exchange, is set to launch, offering financial freedom.</em></li>



<li><em>Users can stake tokens and earn BONE through liquidity mining.</em></li>



<li><em>BONE will be the native token of the ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shytoshi Kusama, the principal creator of Shiba Inu, unveils Shibapendence Day, an important milestone for the Shiba Inu community, with the highlight of ShibaSwap in a blog post published today.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-1024x577.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-1024x577.png" alt="ShibaSwap Unleashes A New Era Of Financial Freedom Dawns" class="wp-image-200578" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-1024x577.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-768x433.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-1140x642.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383.png 1399w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ShibaSwap Unleashes A New Era Of Financial Freedom Dawns 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>Kusama <a href="https://shytoshikusama.medium.com/shibapendence-day-13c31b01d9f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stressed</a> the necessity of decentralization and breaking free from the shackles of centralized institutions that have long governed society.</p>



<p>The announcement focused on the launch of <a href="https://coincu.com/174194-shibaswap-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ShibaSwap</a>, the first genuinely decentralized exchange affiliated with the <a href="https://coincu.com/116987-shiba-inu-bone-shibaswap-top-trending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shiba Inu</a> ecosystem. ShibaSwap, he claims, is at the vanguard of a wave of decentralized projects that share a shared vision of freedom and aspire to restore people&#8217;s authority. The DEX&#8217;s impending release seeks to permanently remove fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), backed by the ShibArmy&#8217;s unrelenting support.</p>



<p>The Shibapendence Day blog post offered appreciation to the loyal ShibArmy and recognized the various FUD theories around Shiba Inu but underlined the team&#8217;s devotion to their core aim.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>ShibaSwap&#8217;s publication is a watershed moment in the fight against centralized authority. It provides a variety of features that enable users to actively engage in the ecosystem, eventually encouraging financial independence.</p>



<p>The DEX&#8217;s native token, <a href="https://coincu.com/121269-bone-shibaswap-soars-over-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BONE</a>, is crucial to its liquidity strategy, serving as the principal token for ShibaSwap and other ecosystem initiatives. When it becomes online, the BONE supply starts at zero, with an increased emission of 1,000 BONE each block during the first two-week Liquidity Enhancement phase. This guarantees that BONE is widely distributed, resulting in an inclusive environment in which everyone has the chance to contribute. After the first phase, emissions will be reduced, with returns commencing at 100 BONE per block.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get BONE. Users may buy it on ShibaSwap with the exclusive ETH/BONE Pair, or they can farm it utilizing the accelerated rewards schedule by providing liquidity to chosen pairings on the DEX and &#8220;WOOFing&#8221; (staking) the LP (liquidity provider) tokens.</p>



<p>Kusama also emphasized the inclusion of multiple token pairings and their corresponding Allocation Points (AP) for BONE distribution. The AP determines the distribution weight for each pool, with higher AP pools getting more BONE per block.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>South Korea&#8217;s FSC revises code of conduct, requiring employees involved in virtual assets to declare their holdings.</em></li>



<li><em>The code applies to public servants engaged in virtual asset-related activities in the past six months, covering various tasks.</em></li>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://view.asiae.co.kr/article/2023070608470419647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asia Economic Report</a></em>, the FSC issued a revised draft of the &#8220;Code of Conduct for Public Officials,&#8221; requiring employees with virtual asset responsibilities not to invest using relevant undisclosed information while performing their duties and requiring internal employees to report details of virtual asset holdings.</p>



<p>The report&#8217;s target audience is public servants who are now performing virtual asset-related activities and workers who have performed such duties in the last six months. The tasks include developing and executing virtual asset rules or regulations, investigating and analyzing criminal cases involving virtual assets, administering and regulating virtual currency exchanges, support and management, and virtual asset technology development, among other things.</p>

<p>A new form for the &#8220;Report on Virtual Assets Possession&#8221; has also been introduced, which requires the kind of virtual asset owned, date of purchase, quantity, and amount to be recorded. In addition, the definition of virtual assets under the &#8216;Specified Financial Information Act&#8217; was incorporated in response to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission&#8217;s request to amend the code of conduct for each institution. It also contains text to change the order of the provisions from &#8220;virtual currency&#8221; to &#8220;virtual assets.&#8221;</p>

</figure>



<p>In a Twitter thread, Conor Grogan explained that many investors forgot about their cryptocurrency on-chain, or did not keep track of airdrops.</p>



<p>In 2016, the Ethereum blockchain forked and Ethereum Classic (ETC) was created. Anyone who held Ether (ETH) on-chain at that time received an identical amount of ETC through an airdrop. However, many investors never touched these new funds, according to Grogan.</p>



<p>Conor Grogan stated that it is common for investors to forget about their funds on-chain or not keep track of airdrops. As a result, he has helped retrieve six-figure amounts for investors in the past. In one instance, he even notified a Twitter user of 23 ETH that had been sitting untouched.</p>

</figure>



<p>Locating these wallets is not an easy task. Grogan began by searching through the &#8220;ETC rich list&#8221; for accounts that had never used their ETC. After finding around 20 addresses that held over $250,000 worth of ETC, he went through each one, attempting to discover ways to get in touch.</p>



<p>Although he hit a number of dead ends with most of the wallets, he eventually discovered an address with the prefix &#8220;0x475.&#8221; Interestingly, the wallet contained a cryptocurrency called &#8220;EOSDAC,&#8221; which was airdropped to Ethereum holders in 2018.</p>



<p>Grogan used the new information to connect with the holder&#8217;s EOS wallet by utilizing the airdrop amount and snapshot date. Grogan&#8217;s efforts allowed him to track down the legal name associated with the 0x475 ETH address by poring over legal documents. As a result, he was able to inform the owner. </p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum&#8217;s price fails to clear the $1,975 resistance and starts a downside correction, trading below $1,950 level.</em></li>



<li><em>Immediate resistance is near the $1,925 level and the next major resistance is near the $1,945 level.</em></li>



<li><em>Clear move above $1,945 resistance could push the price towards $1,975 and the next major resistance is near the $2,120 level.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>&#8216;s price has encountered a downside correction, failing to clear the $1,975 resistance level. </strong></h5>

<p>As a result, there has been a decline below $1,950, similar to Bitcoin, and even below the $1,920 support level. The price eventually spiked below $1,900, reaching a low of $1,894, and is now consolidating losses. Currently, the price is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,974 swing high to the $1,894 low.</p>



<p>Ether is now trading below $1,940 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend. On the hourly chart of ETH/USD, there is a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,925. The immediate resistance level stands near the $1,925 level, which is the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major resistance level is at $1,945, which is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,974 swing high to the $1,894 low.</p>

<p>However, if there&#8217;s a clear move above the $1,945 resistance level, the price could be pushed toward $1,975. This could be a significant milestone for Ether as the main resistance level still remains near the $2,000 level. A successful push above this level could initiate a decent increase in the value of Ether. The next major resistance level is near $2,120, and any further gains could propel Ethereum toward the $2,200 resistance level.</p>



<p>Ethereum&#8217;s recent price decline and consolidation could be attributed to its inability to clear the $1,975 resistance level. However, the presence of key bearish trend lines and resistance levels should not be ignored. Traders and investors should keep a close eye on the $1,945 and $2,000 resistance levels, as these will be crucial in determining the future price action of Ether.</p>
