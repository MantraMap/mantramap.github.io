			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrencies have run amuck over the last few days as Bitcoin has helped lead the sector out of the doldrums.&nbsp;</p>
An unexpected surge
<p>A huge pump to the upside has seen the total market cap of crypto push through the $1 trillion mark, a level not seen since early November of last year.</p>
<p>At only $830 million on the first day of January, things had not been looking particularly rosy for the crypto asset class, but bitcoin was about to have other ideas and a slow incremental crawl upwards suddenly saw the king of the cryptos catch fire and surge upwards.</p>
<p>Even though BTC dominance continued to climb over the last few days, various cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin&rsquo;s example in a big way. Probably one of the biggest turn-arounds among the large cap cryptos has been Solana.</p>
Solana
<p>When the FTX collapse happened things turned very bad for the Solana price, given that Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research had been big supporters and holders of Solana and the $SOL token.</p>
<p>At one point $SOL was under $8, and for some commentators, was heading for zero. However, such a supremely fast blockchain with such a large ecosystem was not going to keep on going down.</p>
<p>In fact, the price has trebled since that time and has currently settled at around $23. A pullback is possibly on the cards next, and $14 might well be a good place to start accumulating again.</p>
Avalanche
<p>Avalanche is another of the large caps to make some great gains over the last couple of weeks. Although not in the same league as $SOL, $AVAX managed to increase by 75% over this period. Most of this increase would have no doubt been due to the AWS partnership.</p>
Ethereum
<p>Obviously, when large cap alts are mentioned Ethereum will always spring to mind. A more than 35% increase over the last 2 weeks is not to be sneered at, and if Ethereum&rsquo;s market cap is taken into account, the increase in value here is probably more than for any of the other large cap alts.</p>
<p>In fact, it could be said that Ethereum is the main cryptocurrency leading the rest of the pack higher. The ETH/BTC pair has been on an upwards trajectory since June of last year. For many, the ETH flippening of BTC is only a matter of time.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Rockets Above 21000:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 15 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) reached its highest level since early November early in the Asian session as the pair traded as high as the 21321.98 area before coming off to the 20333.33 level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Stops were elected above the 19856.70 and 20947.28 areas en route to the multi-week high, upside price objectives related to buying pressure that emerged around the 16326.16 and 17315.08 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above the 20190.78 area during the ascent, representing the 78.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460, and this level served as technical support during a pullback.&nbsp; BTC/USD bulls are eyeing the 21488.32, 21920, 23127.09, and 23196.08 levels as areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure, related to historical selling pressure that emerged around the 25214.57, 32371, and 48240 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stops were also recently elected above the 19260.93 area, an important upside price objective related to buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 16273.40 levels.&nbsp; Following the recent move higher to multi-month highs, technical support levels and areas of potential buying pressure are around the 19938, 19082, 18390, 17699, and 16714 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, technically significant areas include the 15900, 15512, 15313, 14500, 14364, 13369, 10727, 10432, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17871.93 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 19568.63.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Around 800 victims of the BitConnect scheme will soon receive a portion of $17 million in restitution after a court ruling ordered it so. </p>
<p>A court ruling on Thursday by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California ordered that the roughly 800 victims of the infamous BitConnect scheme are to receive a portion of $17 million in restitution. The court ruling described BitConnect as a crypto lending platform that touted proprietary technology including the &ldquo;Bitconnect Trading Bot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Volatility Software&rdquo; that claimed it would guarantee investors' returns.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice issued a press release that stated:</p>

<p>In truth, however, BitConnect operated a textbook Ponzi scheme by paying earlier BitConnect investors with money from later investors.</p>

<p>The U.S.-based promoter for BitConnect, Glenn Arcaro, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in September 2021 and has been sentenced to 38 months in jail. The DOJ also announced that it would sell $56 million worth of crypto seized from Arcaro to compensate victims of the scheme.</p>
The BitConnect Crypto Scheme
<p>BitConnect launched in February 2016 and employed a multi-tier pyramid structure to reward its investors based on the number of affiliates they introduced into the program. The project reportedly promised a one percent average daily return, claiming that investors could turn a $1,000 investment into $36,000 in one year. Many industry heavyweights such as Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, repeatedly warned consumers against the dangers of BitConnect.</p>
<p>In October 2017, BitConnect&rsquo;s native token, BCC, was ranked as the eighth most valuable token with a market cap of almost $2.6 billion. The project eventually collapsed in 2018 after regulators intervened and forced it to shut down. Following the fall of BitConnect, investors eventually got their BCC tokens back, but by that point, the token dropped from its all-time high of around $500 to less than $1.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>What a week for Bitcoin. Seven daily green bars saw the price of bitcoin break through major resistances and hit a high of over $21,200.</p>
Gloomy price action
<p>Sideways and gradually down since June of last year, Bitcoin has been pretty boring, and for many there may have been a ball of foreboding in the pits of their stomachs as they saw the price just keep on meandering downwards.</p>
<p>As big player after big player in the crypto sector went into bankruptcy, and bad news upon bad news beset the industry, it seemed a bear market like no other, and with the economy approaching (or in) recession there weren&rsquo;t too many chinks of light to be seen.</p>
A glorious surge
<p>However, bitcoin crossed a major trendline last Sunday that it has respected ever since the top of the last bull market back in November of 2021. Around three smallish green candles followed before bigger ones that culminated in a glorious week-long surge.</p>
<p>First the $19,500 resistance was taken out on Friday with hardly a pause, then bitcoin crashed through $20,000, and eventually got as high as $21,270 first thing this morning.</p>
<p>Such a beautiful surge, but there&rsquo;s always more to do. Had bitcoin managed to get above $21,500 it would have made an extremely important higher high. As it is, it failed to do so, and so perhaps the next step is to see if the price can hold above either $20,500, or more significantly above $19,500 by close of play on Sunday.</p>
USDT dominance plunges
<p>As bitcoin was doing its thing, it was gratifying to see how the USDT dominance was heading in the opposite direction. A trendline that also started late in 2021 was being followed closely by USDT dominance. It broke to the downside early last week and fell hard and fast, though without making a lower low.</p>
What&rsquo;s next?
<p>So what&rsquo;s in store for bitcoin and crypto now? Bitcoin has taken a bit of a breather at time of going to press, and the price sits at around $20,700. Some big players have started to take profits, but the picture should be clearer once this week is completed.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Beleaguered crypto lender Hodlnaut is facing possible liquidation after the firm&rsquo;s creditors reject the company&rsquo;s proposed restructuring plan. Creditors are instead seeking liquidation of the lender&rsquo;s assets. </p>
<p>Reports by Bloomberg indicate that Hodlnaut&rsquo;s creditors would rather have the firm liquidated and said that it better serves their interests according to a filing prepared by Hodlnaut&rsquo;s interim judicial managers. Under the proposed restructuring plans, Holdnaut&rsquo;s directors, who were at the helm during its collapse, would continue managing the company. According to one of the creditors, Algorand Foundation, liquidations would instead &ldquo;maximize the company&rsquo;s remaining assets available for distribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hodlnaut first showed signs of trouble in August 2022 when the firm suspended customer withdrawals citing &ldquo;volatile market conditions&rdquo; and a liquidity issue.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beleaguered crypto lender Hodlnaut is facing possible liquidation after the firm&rsquo;s creditors reject the company&rsquo;s proposed restructuring plan. Creditors are instead seeking liquidation of the lender&rsquo;s assets. </p>
<p>Reports by Bloomberg indicate that Hodlnaut&rsquo;s creditors would rather have the firm liquidated and said that it better serves their interests according to a filing prepared by Hodlnaut&rsquo;s interim judicial managers. Under the proposed restructuring plans, Holdnaut&rsquo;s directors, who were at the helm during its collapse, would continue managing the company. According to one of the creditors, Algorand Foundation, liquidations would instead &ldquo;maximize the company&rsquo;s remaining assets available for distribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hodlnaut first showed signs of trouble in August 2022 when the firm suspended customer withdrawals citing &ldquo;volatile market conditions&rdquo; and a liquidity issue. However, it later came to the surface that the company downplayed its exposure to the collapsed Terra ecosystem, and consequently it was revealed that the lender lost almost $190 million. The company executive reportedly later got rid of thousands of documents related to company investments ins an effort to hide Hodlnaut&rsquo;s exposure.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com announced that it would be cutting jobs by 20% as a result of the &ldquo;significant damage&rdquo; the industry has suffered due to the fall of FTX. </p>
<p>Crypto exchange Crypto.com has said that it would be cutting its workforce by around 20% amid the ongoing crypto winter and the ramifications of FTX. The company cited economic difficulties as the overall market downturn continues and the catastrophic collapse of FTX as the reason for its decision. In a company post, CEO and co-founder, Kris Marszalek, said:</p>
<p>We grew ambitiously at the start of 2022, building on our incredible momentum and aligning with the trajectory of the broader industry. That trajectory changed rapidly with a confluence of negative economic developments.</p>
<p>From the company&rsquo;s social media profiles, it has been determined that Crypto.com has somewhere between 3,500-4,500 employees, meaning that around 700-900 employees stand to lose their jobs. The exchange had to make significant staff reductions in mid-2022 after the crypto market took a serious knock following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Marszalek addressed this in the company&rsquo;s post by saying:</p>

<p>The reductions we made last July positioned us to weather the macroeconomic downturn, but it did not account for the recent collapse of FTX, which significantly damaged trust in the industry. It&rsquo;s for this reason, as we continue to focus on prudent financial management, we made the difficult but necessary decision to make additional reductions in order to position the company for long-term success.</p>

Major Crypto Firms Make Staff Reductions
<p>Crypto.com is the latest major firm to cut jobs recently. Earlier this week Coinbase, one of the biggest and most popular crypto exchanges, announced plans to reduce its headcount significantly. A company statement said that the layoffs are a result of the &ldquo;evolving industry landscape&rdquo; and a need to &ldquo;align our company with the current market conditions.&rdquo; In a bid to cut costs, Coinbase will lay off around 950 employees. Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency brokerage, announced on Thursday that it would be letting go of 28%, or 110 members, of its staff. The firm similarly cited macroenvironmental conditions for its decision.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, in an astonishing and highly unusual blog post, stated that he did not steal any funds or stash away billions as claimed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He blamed Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for orchestrating the liquidity crisis that led to the eventual fall of FTX and its associated businesses.&nbsp;</p>
An Unusual Blog Post&nbsp;
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, has claimed that he did not steal any money or have billions stashed away. He made the claims in a blog post published a month after his arrest by authorities on charges of fraud. Federal prosecutors have stated that Bankman-Fried and his associates stole billions of dollars from FTX users to pay the debts of Alameda Research, a crypto-based hedge fund and FTX&rsquo;s sister concern. Prosecutors also allege that customer funds were used to purchase real estate and donate to various US political campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t steal funds, and I certainly didn&rsquo;t stash billions away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him. However, The former CEO&rsquo;s closest associates have pleaded guilty to defrauding users and have agreed to cooperate with authorities. Former Alameda Research executive, Caroline Ellison, stated in her plea that Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives received billions of dollars in secret loans from Alameda Research.&nbsp;</p>
A Lot More To Say&nbsp;
<p>Typically, defense lawyers always advise their clients to refrain from making any public statements before any trial, let alone one as significant as this. In the substack post, Bankman-Fried did not directly address the charges brought against him by prosecutors but stated that he had a lot more to say. Charges against Bankman-Fried are primarily that he misled investors, users, and lenders about the finances of FTX and Alameda research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s spokesperson, and the US Attorney&rsquo;s office in Manhattan, have so far declined to comment on the matter.&nbsp;</p>
Significant Sum Recovered&nbsp;
<p>In the Substack post, Bankman-Fried stated that FTX&rsquo;s US wing is fully solvent, and the parent company also has billions of dollars in assets. He further added that there was a good chance customers could be compensated. Bankman-Fried wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it were to reboot, I believe there is a real chance that customers could be made substantially whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s comments came after a lawyer for the FTX exchange told the federal bankruptcy court in Delaware that the exchange had located around $5 billion in liquid assets. The lawyer further added that it planned to sell several non-strategic investments it had made. These investments had a book value of around $4.6 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This figure did not include the assets seized by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Bahamas, where FTX was headquartered. While authorities in the Bahamas claim they had seized around $3.5 billion, FTX has claimed the value of the seized funds to be around $170 million.</p>
Alameda Research, FTX Fell To Extreme Market Crash&nbsp;
<p>According to Bankman-Fried, Alameda Research fell to an extreme market crash in the cryptocurrency ecosystem after failing to hedge against it adequately. He wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Alameda became illiquid, FTX International did as well because Alameda had a margin position open on FTX.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He alleged that Alameda Research and its assets were the subject of a targeted attack by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, accusing him of orchestrating the liquidity crisis that led to the eventual downfall of FTX. In November, Zhao tweeted that Binance was planning to dump its holdings of FTX&rsquo;s native FTT token. The CEO pointed to a report which stated that Alameda Research&rsquo;s assets were primarily comprised of FTT tokens, sparking a run of massive withdrawals from FTX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This direct attack on Zhao was markedly different from previous occasions when Bankman-Friend had only hinted at Zhao&rsquo;s role in the FTX collapse.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market is set to come under increased scrutiny from the U.S. House of Representatives, with the formation of a new subcommittee.&nbsp;</p>
A new subcommittee
<p>According to a report by Politico, North Carolina Representative Patrick McHenry, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, plans to create the subcommittee to fill a "big hole" in the committee's current structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new panel, led by French Hill of Arkansas and Warren Davidson of Ohio, will discuss issues related to digital assets, financial technology, and financial inclusion.</p>
<p>McHenry, who has placed crypto regulation at the top of his legislative agenda, stated that the group will be responsible for crafting policies that support financial technology to reach underserved communities and providing clear norms among federal regulators. The subcommittee will hold hearings and play a key role in bill development.</p>
Crypto dominates the financial agenda
<p>The establishment of the digital asset group shows how cryptocurrency has come to dominate the financial regulatory agenda in Congress. In the past, the Financial Services Committee was primarily concerned with the oversight of banks, Wall Street corporations, and their regulators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the digital asset industry has grown as a lobbying force, with companies attempting to improve the regulatory environment and gain important allies from both parties.</p>
New FTX hearing in 2023
<p>After a steep drop in recent months and the collapse of the once-dominant FTX, which spurred fraud charges against the exchange's top executives, crypto businesses are now playing defence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The House Financial Services Committee is set to hold another hearing under McHenry to investigate the collapse of bitcoin exchange FTX, with McHenry stating that lawmakers will further discuss the bankrupt crypto business in 2023.</p>

<p>McHenry, who has placed crypto regulation at the top of his legislative agenda, stated that the group will be responsible for crafting policies that support financial technology to reach underserved communities and providing clear norms among federal regulators. The subcommittee will hold hearings and play a key role in bill development.</p>
Crypto dominates the financial agenda
<p>The establishment of the digital asset group shows how cryptocurrency has come to dominate the financial regulatory agenda in Congress. In the past, the Financial Services Committee was primarily concerned with the oversight of banks, Wall Street corporations, and their regulators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the digital asset industry has grown as a lobbying force, with companies attempting to improve the regulatory environment and gain important allies from both parties.</p>
New FTX hearing in 2023
<p>After a steep drop in recent months and the collapse of the once-dominant FTX, which spurred fraud charges against the exchange's top executives, crypto businesses are now playing defence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The House Financial Services Committee is set to hold another hearing under McHenry to investigate the collapse of bitcoin exchange FTX, with McHenry stating that lawmakers will further discuss the bankrupt crypto business in 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>North Korea reportedly stole over $1 billion from the cryptocurrency sector last year through the activities of the Lazarus Group.</p>
<p>So far this year, over a third of all cyber-related attacks on cryptocurrency businesses have the North Korean Lazarus Group behind them, according to a report by the Council on Foreign Relations.&nbsp;</p>
High profile hacks
<p>North Korea's interest in cryptocurrency is no secret. The country has been linked to a number of high-profile hacks and thefts of digital assets, including the $81 million heist of Bangladesh's central bank in 2016 and the $250 million hack of Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck in 2018. However, it's not just illicit activities that are driving North Korea's cryptocurrency craze.</p>
<p>Recent reports suggest that the country is increasingly turning to digital assets as a way to evade international sanctions and earn hard currency. The U.S. government has taken notice, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warning that "we will not allow digital asset service providers to operate in the shadows."</p>
North Korean interest in cryptocurrency
<p>But what exactly is driving North Korea's interest in cryptocurrency? One factor is the relative anonymity of digital transactions, which makes it easier for the country to move money across borders without detection. Additionally, many cryptocurrency exchanges operate outside of traditional financial systems, making them less likely to be subject to the same types of sanctions and regulations that traditional banks are.</p>
<p>However, it's not just the illicit potential of digital assets that is appealing to North Korea. The country is also looking to tap into the growing global market for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. North Korea has a large pool of highly skilled computer scientists and engineers, and the country's government has made a concerted effort to build up its capabilities in these areas.</p>
<p>In fact, North Korea has even begun to hold its own cryptocurrency conferences, which attract participants from around the world. These conferences are not only an opportunity for the country to showcase its own capabilities, but also to learn from others and potentially make valuable business connections.</p>
Avoidance of sanctions
<p>North Korea's growing interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is a worrying development for the U.S. and its allies. Not only does it give the country new ways to evade international sanctions, but it also raises the possibility of North Korea using digital assets to fund its military and nuclear programs.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has taken steps to address this threat, including imposing sanctions on North Korean individuals and entities linked to cyber attacks and cryptocurrency theft. However, it's clear that more needs to be done to address the broader challenge posed by North Korea's cryptocurrency craze. This includes greater international cooperation to track and disrupt illicit digital transactions, as well as efforts to build up the resilience of the global financial system to withstand potential attacks.</p>
Balancing act
<p>The U.S. government will have to navigate a tricky balancing act as it addresses the challenge posed by North Korea's cryptocurrency craze. On one hand, it must take steps to disrupt illicit digital transactions, but on the other hand, it must also be mindful of the potential benefits that blockchain technology and digital assets can bring, and not unduly stifle innovation in these areas.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has ordered to distribute over $17 million in restitution to 800 victims of the BitConnect fraud.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as some relief for victims, although the $2.4 billion fraud impacted thousands more.</p>
Some Respite For Victims
<p>A small group of victims of the BitConnect Investment Scheme will see some respite after a US court ordered that $17 million in restitution be distributed among them. The announcement means that around 800 victims from 40 countries will receive a part of the $17 million restitution. The United States District Court ordered the restitution for the Southern District of California on the 12th of January, 2023, according to a press release by the US Department of Justice (DOJ).</p>
A Ponzi Scheme
<p>According to the DOJ statement, BitConnect described itself as a crypto lending platform that utilized proprietary technology such as the &ldquo;BitConnect Trading Bot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Volatility Software,&rdquo; which it claimed would guarantee returns to investors. The platform also promised users an average daily compounding interest of 1% or 3700% annually. Investors could trade their BTC and receive BitConnect Coin (BCC) tokens in return, which users could lend out and receive varying interest rates.</p>
<p>However, the platform turned out to be a run-of-the-mill Ponzi scheme, with early investors being paid by funds collected from new investors, a cycle that kept repeating itself. Those associated with the platform were charged and found guilty of several offenses. The platform&rsquo;s founder, Satish Kumbhani, was indicted in February 2022, and its US promoter, Glen Arcaro, pleaded guilty in September 2021. Both Kumbhani and Arcaro were also sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the DOJ, Arcaro and other BitConnect executives used 15% of investor funds to create a slush fund used to benefit its founder and other promoters.</p>
Whereabouts Of Founder Unknown
<p>BitConnect launched in 2016 but collapsed in 2018 after stealing around $2.4 billion from over 4000 users based in 95 countries. While the DOJ charged Kumbhani, he is also the subject of a police investigation in India. However, his current whereabouts are unknown. While authorities from a number of countries took action against BitConnect and its operations, the platform&rsquo;s decentralized nature and lack of centralized leadership made it difficult to stop. This also meant that some developments around the platform continued even after regulators stepped in to restrict operations.</p>
A Long Wait
<p>Due to its founder&rsquo;s unknown whereabouts, victims of the fraud have had to endure a long wait for compensation. In November 2021, the Department of Justice seized $56 million worth of cryptocurrency. The Department of Justice intended to sell the seized assets and distribute the funds to the scam victims as restitution. The seized funds would be worth $17 million in the current market, although the DOJ did not specify when the seized crypto assets were sold for cash.</p>
<p>However, the restitution set to be returned will be given to only a few of the impacted victims, with thousands affected by the scam. Furthermore, it accounts for only a small fraction of BitConnect&rsquo;s value, with the platform managing to swindle $2.4 billion from investors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you are a photographer - amateur or professional. In that case, you know that after many hours of work and editing, it is frustrating to see how hard it is to get the impact you imagined after posting your artwork. Well, reaching an optimal audience also involves using the right platform, not only having quality photos.</p>
<p>NFT photography platforms are an excellent option for photographers who want to take their work to the next level. And that's because NFTs provide an easy and secure way to store and display your photos and offer a chance to monetize your work.</p>
<p>By placing your photos on the NFT platform, you can give your work the international exposure it deserves and get the recognition you deserve for your hard work. Moreover, NFTs are a great way to track and manage your digital asset portfolio so that you can keep track of all your photos and artwork over time.</p>
How do NFT photography platforms work?
<p>NFT photography platforms combine blockchain technology and digital photography to create a platform for users to buy, sell, and trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing unique digital artworks. Non-fungible tokens are individual digital assets that cannot be copied or replicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These tokens are stored on the blockchain and are used to represent a digital asset or artwork. NFT photography platforms use smart contracts to enable users to trade digital artworks or photographs securely and quickly.</p>
<p>Smart contracts are also used to ensure that the NFT is unique and valid. Buying, selling, and trading NFTs on the platform is relatively straightforward. Users can first search for NFTs that they are interested in purchasing. Once they find an NFT that they want to buy, they can make a purchase using a cryptocurrency such as Ethereum or Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFT is then securely transferred to the user's wallet, where it can be stored safely and securely. The user can then trade the NFT with other users on the platform. The platform tracks all transactions and ensures that all users are accountable for their actions. This ensures a secure and fair trading environment for all users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, users can use the platform to showcase their digital artwork or photographs. They can upload their artwork to the platform and set a price. This allows other users to purchase the artwork or photo, and the artist receives payment in the form of cryptocurrency.</p>
What photos are shared on NFT photography platforms?
<p>NFT photography platforms typically feature various photography genres, including landscapes, streets, documentaries, and fine art. There are also many different types of NFTs, such as single-edition prints, limited-edition prints, and digital collectibles. Photographers who use NFT photography platforms can share their photos in diverse ways, including through auctions, raffles, and direct sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can also create galleries to showcase their work. The platforms also provide the ability to create and manage digital portfolios, so photographers can easily showcase their work to potential buyers. NFT photography platforms provide photographers with an innovative way to own, trade, and monetize their work, and they can also use auctions and raffles to generate revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photographers can turn their photography into a lucrative business by choosing a suitable platform. For example, SEED.PHOTO is an all-inclusive platform that accepts and supports all forms of photography. This platform will allow buyers and sellers to interact with and purchase the artwork and also benefit from security and crypto payments.</p>
Ending note
<p>NFT photography platforms are a relatively new phenomenon in the world of photography, and they are quickly gaining traction. With the ability to create and manage digital portfolios, photographers can easily showcase their work to potential buyers and use auctions and raffles to generate revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you also want to use such platforms, we recommend you plan ahead, look for the platform that suits you best, and consider that you can turn your photography passion into a prosperous business with the right platform.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday charged cryptocurrency firms Genesis and Gemini for allegedly selling unregistered securities. The charges relate directly to &lsquo;Earn&rsquo;- a high-yield product offered to depositors that the two firms offered in partnership. </p>
SEC Claims &lsquo;Earn&rsquo; is a Securities Offering
<p>In February 2021, Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2015 by Silicon Valley brothers Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss, and Genesis, a crypto lender, and a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), partnered on a Gemini product called Earn, which promised customers yields of up to 8%. According to reports by CNBC, the SEC claims that Genesis loaned Gemini users&rsquo; cryptocurrencies and sent a portion of the profits back to Gemini, which then deducted an agent fee, sometimes over 4%, and returned the remaining profits to its users. The SEC&rsquo;s filing is an attempt to hold the respective companies accountable and may generate damages that could repay investors. In its complaints filed in Manhattan federal court, SEC officials said Genesis should have registered Earn as a securities offering.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We @SECGov charged Genesis &amp; Gemini for the unregistered offer &amp; sale of crypto asset securities through Gemini Earn.Crypto intermediaries need to comply with our securities laws. This protects investors. It promotes trust in markets. It&rsquo;s not optional. It&rsquo;s the law.</p>
&mdash; Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) January 12, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>The SEC issued a statement in which chairman Gary Gensler said:</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws.</p>

<p>The SEC alleges that Gemini&rsquo;s Earn program, supported by Genesis&rsquo; lending activities met the SEC&rsquo;s definition of security by including both an investment contract and a note. The SEC assesses a product or offering as a security through this two-part definition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In its filing, the SEC takes aims at Gemini Earn which promised high-interest returns to customers and has brought the same charges against Genesis.</p>
<p>When announcing the charges, Gensler said, &ldquo;We allege that Genesis and Gemini offered unregistered securities to the public, bypassing disclosure requirements designed to protect investors.&rdquo; He added that registering is:</p>

<p>Not optional. It&rsquo;s the law.</p>

Gemini and Genesis Netted Billions in Crypto Assets
<p>The SEC maintains that the Eran program netted the companies billions of dollars in crypto assets. In its filing, the regulator is &ldquo;seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgements, and civil penalties against both Genesis and Gemini,&rdquo; per CNBC. The agency further noted that &ldquo;investigations into other securities law violations and into other entities and persons relating to the alleged misconduct are ongoing.&rdquo;</p>
Gemini and Genesis are Involved in a Massive Battle
<p>The two firms already find themselves in deep waters and are involved in a high-profile battle over $900 million in customer assets that Gemini entrusted to Genesis as part of the Earn program. Gemini Earn was forced to halt withdrawals after the collapse of FTX and remains unavailable for users and million are reportedly stuck on Genesis. The SEC complaint reads:</p>

<p>The U.S. retail investors who participated in the Gemini Earn program have suffered significant harm.</p>

<p>More than 340,000 investors are said to have been affected by the freeze.</p>
<p>The SEC further alleges that in the first three months of 2022, Gemini made somewhere in the region of $2.7 million in agent fees off Earn. The agency also said that Genesis would use Gemini users&rsquo; assets for institutional lending or as &ldquo;collateral for Genesis&rsquo; own borrowing.</p>
<p>Neither representatives from Gemini nor Genesis's parent company DCG have commented on the charges.</p>
<p>The prospects do not look promising as Genesis&rsquo; institutional borrowers include bankrupt firms Three Arrows Capital, and Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s Alameda Research.</p>
<p>Gemini, while in a very difficult position, may well survive the enforcement action. Genesis&rsquo; future however is more uncertain. Genesis is heavily focused on lending out customer crypto and is part of crypto conglomerate DCG, which is controlled by Barry Silbert. DCG is reportedly under investigation by the Department of Justice and the SEC for matters specifically relating to internal transfers from DCG to Genesis.</p>
<p>Co-founder of Gemini, Cameron Winkelvoss, recently called out Barry Silbert, claiming that the DCG CEO was unfit to run the company.</p>
Tyler Winkelvoss Slams the SEC
<p>In response to the SEC charging Gemini, Tyler Winkelvoss hit back at the regulator calling the charges &ldquo;totally counterproductive.&rdquo; In a series of Tweets, Winkelvoss called the allegations &ldquo;super lame&rdquo; and a &ldquo;manufactured parking ticket.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1/ It&rsquo;s disappointing that the @SECGov chose to file an action today as @Gemini and other creditors are working hard together to recover funds. This action does nothing to further our efforts and help Earn users get their assets back. Their behavior is totally counterproductive.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto lender Nexo has found itself in the crosshairs of a large-scale investigation as Bulgarian authorities probe into allegations of money laundering, computer fraud, tax offenses, and other crimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to reports, authorities claim they have evidence a Nexo user has been declared a terrorist financier.&nbsp;</p>
Bulgarian Authorities Investigate Nexo&nbsp;
<p>Bulgarian authorities have launched an investigation into crypto lender Nexo. Authorities are investigating possible crimes related to money laundering, computer fraud, tax offenses, and a host of other offenses. Authorities have so far raided over 15 different sites in the country&rsquo;s capital, Sofia, with over 300 personnel involved in the entire operation. A statement by the Bulgarian prosecutor&rsquo;s office stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Active investigation actions are underway in the capital to neutralize illegal criminal activity of the Nexo crypto bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The announcement of the investigation came after Nexo stated in December that it would be phasing out its US services and products after repeated clashes with regulators. A spokeswoman for the prosecutors&rsquo; office, Siyka Mileva, while speaking with reporters stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Sofia, active steps are being carried out as part of a pre-trial investigation aimed at neutralizing an illegal criminal activity of crypto lender Nexo. It has been established that the main organizers of the international platform are Bulgarian citizens and the main activities are from Bulgarian territory.&rdquo;</p>

Evidence Of Illegal Activities&nbsp;
<p>Bulgarian prosecutors have claimed that around $94 billion have gone through the Nexo platform over the past five years. They also claim to have evidence that at least one of the platform&rsquo;s users has been declared a financier of illegal and terrorist activities. However, the authorities have not elaborated further on their allegation as yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The main organizers of the scheme are Bulgarian citizens, and the activity was carried out mainly from the territory of Bulgaria. Evidence has been collected that a person who used the platform and transferred cryptocurrencies has been officially declared a terrorist financing person.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Nexo Cooperating With Authorities&nbsp;
<p>Nexo, on its part, stated that it was cooperating with regulators and relevant authorities and helping with the investigation. The company reiterated that it has always taken the extra step to ensure that it is in compliance with all regulatory standards. In a Twitter thread, Nexo stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the years, we have turned down a lot of business because Nexo never makes compromises with regard to our very stringent anti-money laundering and know-your-customer policies. But we have always known that this is how you build a sustainable business. Since day 1, we have gone the extra mile to implement cutting-edge solutions to ensure adherence to the highest regulatory standards and simultaneously provide a smooth customer onboarding journey.&rdquo;</p>

Being Unfairly Targeted&nbsp;
<p>Nexo also alleged that it is being targeted unfairly by the authorities and that regulators have adopted a &ldquo;kick first, ask questions later&rdquo; approach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, with the recent regulatory crackdown on crypto, some regulators have recently adopted the kick first, ask questions later approach. In corrupt countries, it is bordering with racketeering, but that too shall pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Antoni Trenchev, the co-founder of Nexo, stated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are authorities at one of Nexo&rsquo;s offices in Bulgaria, which is, as you know, the most corrupt country in the EU. They are making AML and tax-related inquiries about a Bulgarian entity of the group that is not customer-facing but only has back-office functions - payroll, customer support, and compliance. We are one of the most stringent entities with regards to KYC/AML.&rdquo;</p>

Evidence Of Illegal Activities&nbsp;
<p>Bulgarian prosecutors have claimed that around $94 billion have gone through the Nexo platform over the past five years. They also claim to have evidence that at least one of the platform&rsquo;s users has been declared a financier of illegal and terrorist activities. However, the authorities have not elaborated further on their allegation as yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The main organizers of the scheme are Bulgarian citizens, and the activity was carried out mainly from the territory of Bulgaria. Evidence has been collected that a person who used the platform and transferred cryptocurrencies has been officially declared a terrorist financing person.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Nexo Cooperating With Authorities&nbsp;
<p>Nexo, on its part, stated that it was cooperating with regulators and relevant authorities and helping with the investigation. The company reiterated that it has always taken the extra step to ensure that it is in compliance with all regulatory standards. In a Twitter thread, Nexo stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the years, we have turned down a lot of business because Nexo never makes compromises with regard to our very stringent anti-money laundering and know-your-customer policies. But we have always known that this is how you build a sustainable business. Since day 1, we have gone the extra mile to implement cutting-edge solutions to ensure adherence to the highest regulatory standards and simultaneously provide a smooth customer onboarding journey.&rdquo;</p>

Being Unfairly Targeted&nbsp;
<p>Nexo also alleged that it is being targeted unfairly by the authorities and that regulators have adopted a &ldquo;kick first, ask questions later&rdquo; approach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, with the recent regulatory crackdown on crypto, some regulators have recently adopted the kick first, ask questions later approach. In corrupt countries, it is bordering with racketeering, but that too shall pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Antoni Trenchev, the co-founder of Nexo, stated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are authorities at one of Nexo&rsquo;s offices in Bulgaria, which is, as you know, the most corrupt country in the EU. They are making AML and tax-related inquiries about a Bulgarian entity of the group that is not customer-facing but only has back-office functions - payroll, customer support, and compliance. We are one of the most stringent entities with regards to KYC/AML.&rdquo;</p>
