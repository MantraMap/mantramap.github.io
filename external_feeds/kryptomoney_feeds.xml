<ul>
<li>At the time of this Analysis, LINK was up 2.45% in the last 24 hours at $7.36</li>
<li>The Chainlink network has surpassed $7 trillion in &#8220;transaction value enabled&#8221; (TVE)</li>
<li>Chainlink&#8217;s social volume blasted off to all-time highs</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the major cryptocurrencies by market capitalization continued to hold on to where they stood earlier. Flat prices, however, signal that bullish and bearish investors are both actively expressing their market views. At the time of this analysis, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/link-price-analysis-how-will-link-price-react-after-chainlink-staking-v0-1-early-access-goes-live/">LINK</a> was up 2.45% in the last 24 hours to $7.31. In a recent tweet, the decentralized blockchain oracle network Chainlink celebrated a new milestone. According to it, the Chainlink network has surpassed $7 trillion in &#8220;transaction value enabled&#8221; (TVE)—a measure of the aggregate USD value of on-chain transactions facilitated by Chainlink oracles across 12 blockchains since 2022. Chainlink&#8217;s social volume blasted off to all-time highs, according to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, after it put out a tweet on its proof-of-reserve advantages. The increased crowd interest may have a positive price impact, Santiment predicts.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $9.50, $8.00, $7.50<br />Support Levels: $7.00, $6.00, $5.00</p>
<h4><br />LINK/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>

The LINK price is currently above the MA 200 barrier at $7.00. The LINK price might rise to the $8.00 level before the next barrier at $9.50, with a successful effort above its immediate support at $7.00.<br /><br />The barrier at $8.00 could stymie bullish moves above this region. However, a move upward would enable LINK&#8217;s price to surpass the $9.50 level. However, selling interest below current levels may find support around the $8.50 level. The RSI indicator has risen above the neutral 50 level, which points to potential consolidation.</p>
<h4>LINK/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-64154 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LINKUSD-4-Hour-Chart-Jan-27.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LINKUSD-4-Hour-Chart-Jan-27.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LINKUSD-4-Hour-Chart-Jan-27-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LINKUSD-4-Hour-Chart-Jan-27-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LINKUSD-4-Hour-Chart-Jan-27-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LINKUSD-4-Hour-Chart-Jan-27-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LINKUSD-4-Hour-Chart-Jan-27-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">LINK/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, LINK is maintaining its position above $7.00, well above the rising MA 50 after reaching a high of $7.50 earlier today. Looking at the technical indicators, the RSI is getting close to the 80 level, indicating a bullish advantage. Stronger upward trends may encounter the $8.00. Above this, the $9.50 resistance level, which comes before the highs of $8.0, maybe a critical one for the bulls.<br /><br />If not, a decline below the MA 50 ($6.90) might first strike the $6.50 support before tumbling to the $6.00 level. The bullish mood may come into play as a result of additional positive pressures, with support at the $7.00 level. LINK/USD is attempting to consolidate at its upper price boundary.</p>

Motivated by the values of self-sovereignty, open exploration, and transparency, this dynamic creative environment has grown significantly and presently has more than 1.3 million NFTs issued.<br /><br />Frontier Wallet has expanded an integration that began to take shape in mid-2020 and introduced support for MultiversX NFTs in its Android app. The most recent iteration of its iOS software is still awaiting approval from the App Store.</p>
<h2>11 Million Businesses in Brazil Accept Tether USDT Through SWAPIX</h2>
<p>According to a recent announcement on Twitter, 11 million businesses in Brazil now accept Tether USDT through SWAPiX. <br /><br />SWAPiX is a solution from SmartPay that enables users to quickly convert BRL into USDt via PiX, a payment infrastructure in Brazil. Bitfinex customers can convert USDt within SWAPiX and send BRL through Pix directly to the local banking app.<br /><br />“SWAPiX is popular in Brazil, and we are delighted to provide our customers in the country with easy access to this fiat on and off-ramp service,” said Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Tether and Bitfinex.<br /><br />SmartPay’s SWAPiX fiat on and off-ramp service is executed using just a smartphone device and without the need for a bank account, a critical consideration in a country where an estimated 34 million people (almost 1 in 5 adults) still lack access to traditional financial services.<br /><br />In October 2022, Bitfinex crypto exchange announced it had provided customers in Brazil with a connection to SWAPiX by Smartpay, offering an easy and convenient on-and-off ramp between the Brazilian Real (BRL) and Tether tokens (USDt). <br /><br />The initiative forms part of Bitfinex’s mission to enhance financial inclusion and promote financial freedom in Brazil and across Latin America.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the year, APT, the token driving the layer-1 blockchain Aptos, has been on a tear, increasing in value by as much as 150% just in the past week. In the past 30 days, the token has increased by 407%.<br /><br />This is true even if APT&#8217;s price has dropped by 8.5% in the last day, from its record high of $19.92 on Thursday to its current level of $18.21, according to statistics from CoinGecko.<br /><br />Aptos, which debuted in October 2022 amidst much fanfare and criticism, has a market capitalization of about $2.92 billion, ranking it as the 28th most valuable network in the cryptocurrency sector.<br /><br />After the well-known decentralized exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap held a community vote to continue its deployment on Aptos, A price increase was initiated. <br /><br />The recent inclusion into Atomic Wallet, a non-custodial multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet, as well as the rising interest in Aptos-based NFT collections, have had a beneficial effect on the price of the APT token.<br /><br />According to Chinese crypto journalist, Collin Wu: ‘’The recent surge of APT may be related to the crazy buying in the Korean community. The 24-hour trading volume of Korean APT/KRW on Upbit, South Korea’s largest exchange, exceeded the sum of Binance’s multiple trading pairs, reaching $566 million, he stated.<br /><br />Wu further added, ’’Pumping up altcoins is also one of the traditions in the Korean community. Aptos officials attach great importance to the Korean community. It released a Korean language white paper, which is the only language other than English. It plans to launch a global hackathon and the first is in Seoul. Korean companies Hashed, Hive and YG are investors in Aptos. ’’</p>
<h2>Aave Protocol V3 Now Live on the Ethereum Market</h2>
<p>In a recent announcement, Aave Protocol V3 is now live on the Ethereum market. ”The most exciting aspect of V3 is its flexible design, which enables a variety of new risk mitigation features, and its improved capital efficiency &amp; decentralized liquidity – all while reducing gas costs.” <br /><br />Stani Kulechov, AAVE CEO stated. With the deployment of V3 on Ethereum mainnet, Aave’s first and largest market, new technical features and benefits have been unlocked including: <br /><strong>High-Efficiency Mode:</strong> This allows users to increase their capital efficiency when supplying and borrowing correlated assets like stablecoins and liquid staking derivates (LSDs).<br /><br /><strong>Isolation Mode:</strong> enables more assets to be listed on Aave as collateral while maintaining the security of the protocol. Liquidity risks can be siloed by listing assets in isolation mode.<br /><br />And lastly, Gas Optimization reduces gas costs associated with all the functions across the board by almost 20-25%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since January 1, bitcoin has increased by about 40%, putting it on pace for its best year-to-date start since it soared 51% in 2013. <br /><br />The leading cryptocurrency is off to its best start since 2013. As the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen this month, the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has increased by 40%. The majority of U.S. buyers, according to analysts, have driven the rally.<br /><br /><em>&#8220;Bitcoin has increased by 40% so far this year, with 35% of those gains coming during American market hours. &#8220;That&#8217;s an 85% participation of the rally linked with US-based investors,&#8221;</em> says Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at cryptocurrency services provider Matrixport.<br /><br />Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, trade continuously, unlike equities, making it possible for observers to watch order flows across time zones and determine the source of purchasing or selling pressure.<br /><br />The renewed premium in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange further demonstrates institutions&#8217; bullish positioning.<br /><br />Similar findings were made earlier this month by Deutsche Digital Assets, which cited the rise in the Coinbase premium as proof of high buying interest among seasoned U.S.-based investors as opposed to retail investors.<br /><br />David Guong, the head of research at Coinbase Institutional, stated in a weekly market analysis released on January 20 that &#8220;conventional and crypto-focused hedge funds, corporates, and traditional asset managers have been buying.&#8221;<br /><br />Since institutions are driving the bullish turnaround in Bitcoin, it may be a positive indicator for the U.S. equity market.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2023/34-96751.pdf">rejected</a> an application from Ark Investment Management and 21Shares to list a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the Cboe BZX Exchange, a decision that comes as little surprise to those familiar with the regulatory landscape surrounding the nascent crypto industry.<br /><br />The idea has now been rejected by the dreaded regulator twice; the first time was in April, when a similar effort was also thwarted. Undaunted, the pair submitted a new application in May of last year, but the organization once again cited fraud and manipulation concerns as the main factors in making its decision. The SEC emphasized that <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/defi-platform-bzx-loses-8-million-in-third-hack-in-2020/">BZX</a> had not shown that their plan complied with the rules governing the avoidance of dishonest practices.<br /><br />The agency&#8217;s choice is supported by its conviction that the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-market-sees-heavy-collapse-as-price-corrects-below-48000/"> Bitcoin market</a> is still vulnerable to fraud and manipulation and that, to identify and discourage such behavior, a thorough surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of scale is required. <br /><br />According to the SEC, BZX neglected to address risk considerations unique to Bitcoin. It is unknown if Ark and 21Shares will attempt to list a spot bitcoin ETF again, but given the regulatory environment at the moment, it appears unlikely that the SEC would change its position very soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/amazon-partners-with-avalanche-avax-price-up-17-in-barely-an-hour/">Amazon</a> is advancing its efforts to establish a presence in the cryptocurrency market. A non-fungible token (NFT) proposal would reportedly be introduced by the firm sometime in the spring of 2023.<br /><br />Six people with knowledge of the situation are cited in the report. It states that to assist its NFT strategy, Amazon has collaborated with more than ten cryptocurrency initiatives. Following a fall in the NFT market from its peak in 2021, the initiative might reinforce and resuscitate the industry.<br /><br />The e-commerce giant would reportedly concentrate on several sectors and dabble in NFT gaming. Players who use the platform will receive special NFT rewards.<br /><br />Amazon already provides access to a videogame platform to customers of its Prime service. Members of this service have access to the platform&#8217;s library and are given prizes each month that can be used to buy AAA games. By providing additional incentives and drawing in new customers, the new NFT project could strengthen the service.<br /><br />According to news reports, the NFT platform is currently under development and may operate directly on Amazon rather than through Amazon Web Services (AWS). There is no formal announcement from Amazon or its management, although the firm may disclose further details in April 2023.<br /><br />To reach a<em> “much bigger audience” </em>the e-commerce site aims to reach a <em> “truly worldwide platform.” </em>Amazon might be working toward such goals.<br /><br />The business garnered interest in the cryptocurrency sector two weeks ago when it disclosed cooperation with Ava Labs, the organization in charge of the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/avalanche-raises-42m-from-token-sale-in-4-5-hours/">Avalanche blockchain</a>. To grant access to this network to thousands of businesses, the cryptocurrency company teamed up with AWS.</p>

The St. Maarten government on the island of the Eastern Caribbean may soon formally adopt Tron. The head of the United People&#8217;s Party and second vice chairman of St. Maarten&#8217;s parliament, Member of Parliament (MP) Rolando Brison, has long been vocal about the advantages of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies for his country&#8217;s citizens and economy. The Tron protocol has now been proposed as the nation&#8217;s blockchain infrastructure, and TRX, a cryptocurrency built on the Tron platform, has been declared legal tender for everyday use. Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, tweeted about the milestone: &#8220;Another milestone for TRON! St. Maarten to adopt TRON as legal tender marks another achievement for our push on worldwide blockchain adoption.&#8221; The Commonwealth of Dominica declared seven cryptocurrencies based on Tron to be legal tender and designated Tron as its national blockchain in an official announcement made in October 2022.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.850, $0.750, $0.650<br />Support Levels: $0.600, $0.550, $0.500</p>

<p>TRX dipped slightly on Thursday but stayed within the previous two days&#8217; range. The technical indicators continue to suggest some market caution, with the RSI flattening in buying territory. If sellers push the TRX below the consolidation floor at $0.600, another negative barrier at $0.55 may appear.<br /><br />Alternatively, if buyers find support off the MA 200 at $0.610, significant resistance may form around the horizontal barrier at $0.650. Overcoming this, the price may reach $0.720 before reaching the $0.750 high. If the rally continues, the bulls could test the $0.800 level before attempting to retrace.</p>

<p>Above $0.600, TRX is firmly entrenched within a consolidation zone around the 4-hour MA 50. The immediate hurdle at $0.650 might limit the upside. A downward leg might encounter the $0.600 support zone before dragging the bears farther below the $0.55 level in the event of a decline.<br /><br />Alternatively, a significant barrier at $0.65 might limit the upside, with a break here and a nearby $0.70 barrier required to provide a stronger bullish signal for a possible continuation of the recovery. Above these levels, the $1.00 level may come into focus. In summary, the prediction is neutral to positive as prices continue to move around the moving averages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The CEO of the world&#8217;s largest credit card firm told shareholders that <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/stablecoins-might-soon-be-officially-categorized-as-securities/">stablecoins</a> and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will play a<em> &#8220;meaningful role&#8221;</em> in the payments market in the future.<br /><br />In addition, the firm released its 2022 annual report, in which it discussed its complementary and competitive relationship with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Visa already has <em>&#8220;multiple initiatives&#8221;</em> in the blockchain field, according to CEO Alfred Kelly on a <a href="https://annualreport.visa.com/annual-meeting/default.aspx">conference call</a>, and has invested in various crypto funds and companies.<br /><br /><em>“It’s very early days, but we continue to believe that stablecoins and central bank digital currencies have the potential to play a meaningful role in the payments space,”</em> said Kelly.<br /><br />Stablecoins combine the peer-to-peer nature of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin with the relative price stability of another currency or asset—frequently the U.S. dollar. This solves the price instability problem that critics, including central banks, claim prevents Bitcoin from being a legitimate currency. <br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tethers-usdt-topples-xrp-market-cap/">Tether (USDT)</a>, which is the largest stablecoin by market cap, has a higher daily transaction volume than any other crypto.<br /><br />CBDCs, on the other hand, are government-issued digital currencies built on blockchain rails. Lael Brainard, vice chair of the Federal Reserve, has expressed support for the establishment of a CBDC in the United States by offering a<em> “safe central bank liability in the digital financial ecosystem.” </em>Visa partnered with ConsenSys last year to connect CBDCs to current payment networks.<br /><br /><em>“Technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, blockchain technology and digital currencies,”</em> the company stated, adding that crypto payment platforms <em>“can be both a partner and a competitor to Visa.”</em></p>

<p>The official Twitter account of the commission-free trading software Robinhood has been <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1618292308902051843">compromised</a> to promote a fraudulent coin called $RBH on the BNB Chain.<br /><br />Earlier on Wednesday, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/robinhood-suspends-purchase-of-gamestop-stock-amid-unusual-rally/">Robinhood</a>&#8216;s Twitter account was hacked and used to advertise the phony cryptocurrency project. The hackers announced the release of the new coin named $RBH, which they said could be purchased for $0.0005 on the Binance Smart Chain.<br /><br />According to the hacker&#8217;s update, the cryptocurrency was offered for $0.0005 per unit. Of course, the BNB chain-based token is a honeypot fraud, which means that RBH token owners cannot sell or transfer them after purchasing them.<br /><br />Before the link was removed, about 25 people bought the hoax token, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1618295142234091520">Blockchain Explorer</a> data. All in all, less than $8,000 was spent on the purchases.<br /><br />Some Twitter users discovered that transactions had been routed to the fake account via Binance Hot Wallets after the attack was discovered.<em>&#8220;our security team also noticed that and have locked the account pending further investigations,&#8221; </em>said Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, the CEO of Binance, in reaction to the attack.<br /><br />According to a<a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-Crypto-Crime-Report.html"> chainanalysis</a> assessment, crypto attacks increased quickly in 2022, totaling $3 billion in total assets loss for the year.</p>

<li>A new generation of digital creators can now be added to the SWOOSH platform</li>
<li>Nike&#8217;s premier Web3 project, SWOOSH, launches on January 25</li>
<li>At the time of writing, Polygon (MATIC) is down 5.09% in the last 24 hours at $0.953</li>
</ul>
<p>After numerous testing months, a new generation of digital creators can now be added to the <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoSavingExpert/nikes-web3-platform-swoosh-set-to-launch-on-january-25-15c77b6f1005">SWOOSH platform.</a> Its inaugural collection is inspired by Nike&#8217;s legendary Air Force 1 sneaker collection. Nike&#8217;s premier Web3 project, SWOOSH, launches on January 25, based on a remark made by Nike&#8217;s senior product manager, Jasmine Gao. This Wednesday, January 25, 2023, SWOOSH, a community-driven platform for Web3 digital art, launches. Since the middle of November 2022, the platform has been in development and beta testing. Its supporters agreed that the first works of digital art to be made available would be sneakers with AF1 design elements. Polygon Cofounder, Sandeep Nailwal tweeted about the launch: <em>&#8220;This is gonna explode and bring millions of users to Web3.&#8221;</em> Polygon announced partnerships with leading luxury brands Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Bulgari in Q1 2022. At the time of writing, Polygon (MATIC) is down 5.09% in the last 24 hours and trading at $0.953.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $1.300, $1.150, $1.000<br />Support Levels: $0.900, $0.800, $0.700</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-64112 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-Daily-jan-25-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-matic-surpasses-key-barrier-on-positive-mastercard-news-polygon-sets-new-record-in-staking/">MATIC/USD</a> moved higher from the session low of $0.932 reaching a high of $0.972 as the pair seeks to break out from the $1.00 psychological zone. The $0.950 support level might hold back the sellers in the event the price returns lower. While the price seeks entry into the bullish zone, the RSI is moving south in the positive range.<br /><br />The next horizontal level at $0.90 is the closest support that might arrest even deeper drops if the upward momentum is broken and prices shift lower. If it is broken, the focus may shift to the downside, and prices may decline toward the direction of the rising trendline support near the $0.800 level.</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-64113 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Jan-25-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>MATIC/USD fell to $0.932 before returning past the $0.950 level. This week&#8217;s initial bias is still neutral. A breach of $0.900 support, on the other hand, would shift intraday bias downward and cause a retest of the $0.750 low region. In contrast, a break above $1.00 may aim for the resistance level between the $1.150 to $1.300 levels.<br /><br />Consolidation around the $1.00, on the other hand, might restart the upward movement from a lower zone of $0.900 level. If the pair encounters more sellers beneath the moving average (MA 50) on the 4-hour chart, MATIC&#8217;s price might continue to decline under the $0.850 level.</p>
