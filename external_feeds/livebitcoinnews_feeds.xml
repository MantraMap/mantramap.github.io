										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several strategists at JPMorgan are quite <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/31/jpmorgan-reveals-900-billion-gold-based-implied-bitcoin-price-alongside-an-ethereum-upgrade-prediction-warning/?sh=49753f002010">bullish on bitcoin even</a> though their boss – JP Dimon – hasn’t always been kind towards the asset.</p>
<h2>JPMorgan Document Suggests Gold-BTC Correlation</h2>
<p>In the past, Dimon has said some <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/jamie-dimon-is-clearly-not-a-btc-fan/">rather disparaging things</a> about the world’s leading crypto asset. However, this hasn’t stopped JPMorgan from cashing in on the digital currency and publishing regular reports about its price upheavals and volatility. In a recent document, the strategists made the claim that bitcoin will strengthen its ties to gold.</p>
<p>They also believe that the latter is going to surge beyond the $2K mark, and this will lead to BTC reaching $45,000. They stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the gold price rising above $2,000, the value of gold held for investment purposes outside central banks is currently valued at around [$3 trillion]. In turn, this implies a $45,000 price for bitcoin under the assumption that bitcoin equalizes gold in private investors&#8217; portfolios in risk capital or [volume]-adjusted terms.</p></blockquote>
<p>They were also quick to discuss the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-next-btc-halving-is-a-year-away-whats-going-to-happen/">upcoming halving</a>, which is set to occur in April of next year. Halvings have constantly been good for bitcoin in that the asset becomes rarer following such an event. Block rewards are literally cut in half for miners who solve equations that ultimately add BTC units onto the blockchain and place them in circulation.</p>
<p>The JPMorgan strategists were quick to say that this upcoming halving will present similar circumstances for bitcoin, and that the asset could potentially jump much higher. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is because bitcoin&#8217;s production cost has historically acted as an effective lower bound. Indeed, the previous halving events of 2016 and 2020 were accompanied by a bullish trajectory for bitcoin prices that had accelerated post the halving event.</p></blockquote>
<p>In contrast to bitcoin’s incoming success, the strategists mentioned that they foresaw Ethereum facing horrible selling pressure over the next few months thanks to April’s Shanghai upgrade. This, they think, will lead to short-term price losses for the world’s second largest digital currency. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We thus expect Ethereum to somewhat underperform bitcoin over the near term.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Lot of Things in Play</h2>
<p>Matteo Greco – research analyst at crypto investment firm Fineqia International – believes there are several macroeconomic circumstances in play that could greatly affect the crypto arena in the coming months. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The past few days have shown strong volatility as bitcoin dropped to the lowest trading price of about $25,800 on Wednesday [last week] due to investors&#8217; fear concerning the U.S. reaching the debt ceiling. The increase of the debt ceiling means that the U.S. government is expected to issue between $800 billion and $1 trillion in the next six months. This means that, in the mid-term, money is removed from more risky assets to buy government bonds. The consequence could be an additional slowdown in volumes and liquidity.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin experienced its first monthly loss of 2023 in <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-is-on-track-for-its-first-monthly-drop-of-the-year-stalling-2023s-huge-rally-as-macro-uncertainty-builds/ar-AA1bWK4e">May following</a> several solid months of growth due to macroeconomic uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Had Its Worst Month of 2023 in May</h2>
<p>The world’s leading digital currency by market capitalization was about two percent lower at the end of May given that many central banks were continuing to support stronger rate hikes as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/inflation/">inflation</a> has still not died down in leading countries such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Thus far, the Fed has hiked borrowing costs about ten consecutive times since March of last year.</p>
<p>Sadly, the patterns are not expected to stop, and many believe 2023 will be a year of continued, steady rate hikes. Birgham Santos – COO of blockchain financial services provider Lama – explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>When there is fear sentiment in the market, investors tend to flock to safer assets, such as gold and government bonds. This can lead to a sell-off in riskier assets, including bitcoin. In addition, central bank tightening can also lead to a decline in bitcoin prices. This could work as a domino effect by generating higher interest rates, which can make it harder to borrow money to invest back [into] bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>The interesting thing is that bitcoin appears to be unique at the time of this writing… Unique in that it’s one of the only main cryptocurrencies out there affected by the news of the allegedly incoming (and continued) rate hikes. While altcoins like Solana have also taken dives, Ethereum, by contrast, ended May at about two percent higher than where it was during the previous month, thus showing inflation worries aren’t being felt across the board.</p>
<p>Ben Caselin – vice president and chief strategy officer at crypto exchange Mask EX – mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s no doubt that bitcoin&#8217;s price, as well as wider crypto market movements, are directly impacted by the US Federal Reserve and central bank policies. It is, after all, in response to central banking that bitcoin was created in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Still Up from 2022</h2>
<p>While the news regarding bitcoin may not be the best, things are still looking up for the currency given it’s about 65 percent higher than where it stood at the end of 2022. Santos continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whilst there are multiple external factors that can stall the crypto market, such as regulation, monetary policies, and geopolitical events creating uncertainty and fear in the behavior of institutional investors, there is also a massive adoption in the market. This means more users, more use cases, more innovation, and more value creation… Mid and long-term signals are looking good as mass adoption is increasing, and this is what ultimately defines the price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin is presently trading in the high $27K range, and it’s believed the asset will gain traction during the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ashley Crossland is a man who made his bones working as a graphic designer, but while it’s been a solid career, the money he’s made in this field is <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/cryptocurrency-digital-artist-nets-hundreds-075352492.html">nothing compared to the</a> big bucks he’s rung in developing non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>
<h2>NFTs Are Bigger Than Ever</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/nfts/">NFTs</a> are a new breed of digital currency. While they cannot be used as methods of payment, they are getting big in that the space is growing like crazy, and you now have people putting their NFTs up as collateral should they ever wish to take out crypto or stable asset loans. The lender observes their tokens to see if their value is substantial. If they feel the worth is there, the money is issued.</p>
<p>Not long ago, some of the NFTs developed by Crossland sold for more than 500,000 pounds in his native Wales. He has thus far produced over 7,000 unique art-based tokens. He stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>I never thought it would be this successful. As I&#8217;ve always liked art and technology, I was drawn to the NFT space because it creates the possibility of digital collectability, something that wasn&#8217;t as easy before. I started posting sketches of humanoid deer in communities online, and before I knew it, the project had gathered a lot of interest and quickly became a massive success.</p></blockquote>
<p>Crossland is just one of many artists that have found their niche in the digital currency market developing NFTs. Carol Breen – an artist and lecturer in graphic communication design at Cardiff Metropolitan University – has also stepped into NFT territory, though she says many of her constituents don’t believe in the arena the way she does. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Really, all it is, is a way of managing ownership in a digital space. I think it gained popularity because a lot of people thought there was a lot of potential to sell art in [a] way that was more democratic, so that it would become available to people who don&#8217;t have the platform of a gallery. You can assign a piece of digital certification to a piece of art that&#8217;s online. That, in some ways, is good for an artist because you can copyright it as well. I&#8217;m sure a lot of artists have found new audiences through NFTs, and a lot of artists that I admire have played around with NFTs, but then a lot of artists that I admire are quite skeptical of them.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Giving the Tokens Their Stories</h2>
<p>She continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some have said this is just another way that big conglomerates can entice people onto these new types of art markets. [Actually], they are quite closed off to everyday people or everyday artists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jameel Sandham is not a designer, but he’s now working as a writer for a new NFT series and creating the backstories of the featured characters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite lessening activity in the arena of decentralized finance (defi), some companies – like Giddy – are remaining afloat and <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2023/05/17/interview-a-defi-startup-amid-crypto-winter/">establishing solid records</a> for themselves.</p>
<h2>How Giddy is Holding Its Ground</h2>
<p>Giddy is described as a self-custody smart wallet. Run by its CEO and co-founder Eric Parker, the company seeks to make wallet experiences easy for everyone following a very bearish year in 2022. In a recent interview, Parker – when asked how Giddy makes money – answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>Same way MetaMask, Coinbase, Beefy, Uniswap, and Infura do. Fiat ramps, defi transactions, gas payments, and crypto trading, except we’ve built solutions to these tech stacks ourselves which means we can charge the customer less per service, saving our users time and money all while making crypto and defi much easier.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the past 1.5 years, the total value locked in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/defi/">defi</a> has fallen to about $47 billion from $165 billion. Discussing how he continues to attract customers, Parker said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s important to note that unsustainable defi yields have fallen, while the fundamentally sound projects remain strong. One million percent annual yield was never sustainable, which is why the smartest defi users today are seeking real yield. In other words, sustainable business models built on the blockchain. Users can still earn incredible yields on the blockchain while maintaining exposure to the best assets such as USDC, Ethereum, Matic, and bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was also asked why he thinks so many people have had serious wallet issues and what he’s doing to make their experiences easier. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re still so, so early. It’s like having to program your own modem to connect to the internet in the early 80’s, then moving to services like AOL, then Netscape, and so on. I think today in the crypto space, we’re just starting to move into more user-friendly technology abstractions, and it’s only going to get better from here. Giddy was created specifically to tackle this issue, and we’ve developed new technology to do so. We already hinted at our private key tech, which is fundamentally a better experience for users, but there’s also our one-tap staking into defi earning protocols, plus the ability to pay for gas with USDC or our Giddy token. Quality of life improvements such as these mean people don’t have to worry about losing their seed phrase, don’t have to worry about running out of gas, and don’t have to worry about signing a malicious smart contract or leaving infinite approvals open on the blockchain, and that’s just the start.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Few Tricks Up Its Sleeve?</h2>
<p>Regarding how Giddy makes a name for itself when there are so many competitors, Parker said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a noisy space, but we’ve got some unique advantages… Nobody else is integrating directly with defi protocols, making defi yield as easy as a single tap.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tether – one of the largest and most popular stable currencies around – has announced plans to open a huge bitcoin mining facility in the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/stablecoin-giant-tether-to-mine-bitcoin-in-uruguay-using-renewables.html">South American region</a> of Uruguay. The clincher? The company is going to operate the facility only using renewable energy.</p>
<h2>Tether to Mine Bitcoin in South America</h2>
<p>This is a big deal in that bitcoin and crypto mining operations have gotten a bad rap over the last several years on account of the high number of reports that have been produced alleging they use too much energy and are putting the planet in harm’s way. It’s alleged in these documents, for example, that many third-world or developing nations do not use the energy that bitcoin and crypto mining firms use.</p>
<p>This attitude has made its way into the minds of top investors like Kevin O’Leary of “Shark Tank” fame, who said a few years <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-mining-may-require-more-energy-than-180-countries/">back that he would no</a> longer be buying any more crypto mined in China given the nation’s track record with green energy wasn’t the best.</p>
<p>In addition, men like Elon Musk – the South African billionaire and entrepreneur behind companies such as SpaceX and Tesla – have also taken issue with the present mining arena. Not long ago, Musk said he would allow Tesla buyers to engage in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-permits-bitcoin-payments-for-tesla-vehicles/">vehicle transactions using</a> bitcoin.</p>
<p>However, his decision was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-has-taken-a-nasty-stumble-many-are-blaming-elon-musk/">quickly rescinded given</a> he was concerned about the energy use of bitcoin mining, and he wasn’t willing to change his mind unless miners became more transparent about their sources.</p>
<p>For this reason alone, it’s likely Tether is going to make a big mark in the industry and inspire a lot of people. Paolo Ardoino – the CTO of Tether – explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>By harnessing the power of bitcoin and Uruguay’s renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible bitcoin mining. Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the bitcoin network.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Getting Its Hands on BTC</h2>
<p>It appears Tether is trying to diversify itself a bit by adding more bitcoin units to its growing reserves. Not long ago, the stable asset company purchased more <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stable-coin-tether-buys-over-200-million-worth-of-btc/">than $200 million worth</a> of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Ardoino was quick to chime in regarding this maneuver as well, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The decision to invest in bitcoin, the world&#8217;s first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset. Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uruguay presently garners more than 90 percent of its electricity from renewable sources like hydro stations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Australian division of Binance, the world’s largest and most popular digital currency exchange, caused analysts and observers to raise eyebrows in the latter half of May <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/18-bitcoin-discount-emerges-binance-091924045.html">when the</a> firm began selling bitcoin at a huge discount.</p>
<h2>Binance Australia was Practically Giving Away BTC</h2>
<p>During that time, bitcoin was trading between $27,000 and $28,000 on most platforms, though the Australia division of Binance caught everyone off guard when it began selling units for about 20 percent less. Thus, people could go onto the exchange and purchase a unit of bitcoin for just over $23,000.</p>
<p>A Binance spokesperson explained the matter as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Due to the recent removal of fiat on-ramp services by our payment processor’s banking partner, some Australian users have been withdrawing their AUD holdings from the platform in advance of the off-ramp closure on 1 June.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Australian dollar’s removal from the exchange went into effect on May 18 of this year. From there, it was announced that all remaining units of the fiat currency would be turned into Tether, a popular stable currency. Binance put out the following tweet further clarifying the situation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fellow Binancians, we regret to inform you that with immediate effect, we are unable to facilitate Pay ID AUD deposits for Binance users due to a decision made by our third-party payment service provider.</p></blockquote>
<p>The spokesperson continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a result, AUD pairs have experienced less liquidity which has impacted their pricing. We will be delisting [the] remaining AUD pairs in line with the closure of fiat off-ramp services. We remain focused on securing additional fiat relationships to service our users.</p></blockquote>
<p>At first glance, the situation appeared hopeful to the untrained eye. It seemed as if the company was just seeking to sell bitcoin at lower costs, thus giving traders something to be grateful for. However, things have certainly come with their fair share of problems.</p>
<p>For example, the platforms allegedly stopped accepting Australian dollar deposits with little notice. Also, several cryptocurrencies that were later exchanged for Australian dollars on the exchange came with heavy premiums, thus raising prices for traders across the board. Lastly, plans have been announced for the delisting of several trading pairs to the displeasure and surprise of investors.</p>
<p>Binance has said this isn’t going to be set in motion permanently, and the company is looking for a separate provider that could potentially reinstate the firm’s abilities to accept and trade in AUD.</p>
<h2>Problems with the CFTC</h2>
<p>At press time, the company is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cftc-sues-binance-alleging-financial-violations/">being sued by the</a> Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The agency alleges that Binance repeatedly violated the Commodity Exchange Act. CFTC chair Rostin Behnam claimed in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>For years, Binance knew they were violating CFTC rules, working actively to both keep the money flowing and avoid compliance.</p></blockquote>

<li>Bitcoin cash is eyeing a fresh increase above the $300 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading near the $275 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $285 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair must clear $285 and $300 to start a fresh increase in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is consolidating gains above $265 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-restart-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $285 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price started a downside correction after it failed to clear the $330 zone. BCH formed a high near $329 before there was a bearish move.</p>
<p>The price declined below the $310 and $300 levels. There was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $186 swing low to the $329 high. However, the bulls are protecting more losses below the $250 support zone.</p>
<p>Bitcoin cash is now trading near the $275 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-fresh-rally-possible-to-330/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $285 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $285 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near $300, above which the price may perhaps start a strong increase. The next major resistance is near the $330 level. Any more gains above $330 could set the pace for a move toward the $350 level.</p>
<p>If not, the price might continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $255 level. The first major support sits near the $240 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $186 swing low to the $329 high. The next major support is near $220, below which the bears might aim for $200.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state of Texas is looking to be one of the first in the American <a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/politics/texas-legislature/texas-cryptocurrency-regulation-hb1666/269-5543d20a-cabf-4e0e-aa9d-11c5f6d20a05">union to regulate cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<h2>Texas Looks to Create New Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Not long ago, House Bill 1666 made its way onto the desk of Greg Abbott, the state’s governor. The bill is a nod to the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/">FTX debacle</a> of last year and will seek to ensure proper and safe trading environments for all residents of Texas that hold or trade digital currencies.</p>
<p>The goal is to make sure everybody’s money steers clear of fraud and other issues known to arise out of the crypto arena. Each year, all virtual currency companies that do business with citizens of Texas will be required to adhere to certain rules like ensuring all customers can withdraw funds whenever they wish.</p>
<p>Also, companies will need to provide proof of reserves to show that if there are ever any problems, executives can stay afloat and provide compensation and recompense to affected traders. Customers will also be able to garner information about the companies’ standing debts and see who they owe money to and how much.</p>
<p>Lastly, the firms in question would not be allowed to commingle funds (in other words, no mixing of company money with customer money), and they would be subjected to annual audits.</p>
<p>State representative Giovanni Capriglione, a republican, commented that he would like Texas to set an example to larger institutions like the federal government, and he hopes the regulation his region sets in place can provide rules and laws for surrounding areas as well. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>You will be comfortable knowing that when you invest online, when you&#8217;re buying cryptos, when you&#8217;re trading it, when you&#8217;re selling, those assets are being watched, that they are being managed, and that there&#8217;s an audit trail that protects those assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Texas is widely considered a very crypto-friendly state. The region <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/texas-is-still-a-crypto-mining-king/">opened itself to an influx</a> of miners from China after their native country declared that the practice was fully illegal in the summer of 2021. Seeing the opportunities for growth, jobs, innovation, and a rising economy, Texas leaders said, “Come on in” and have built one of the biggest mining arenas of the last ten years.</p>
<h2>Energy Issues Have Popped Up</h2>
<p>However, while this attitude has resulted in a strong economy and powerful job prospects, it has created problems for the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-texas-is-suffering-from-too-much-btc-mining/">state’s energy grid</a>. A new report by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prospective crypto mining businesses have requested to put approximately 33,000 more megawatts in the ERCOT interconnection queue over the next few years (enough to power the whole state of Florida)… A single bitcoin transaction used nearly 1,452 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, equal to the power consumption of an average U.S. household for nearly 50 days.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As both sides of the political spectrum have waged war on America’s debt ceiling and worked hard to formulate a deal, there’s growing concern that the Treasury is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/29/crypto-now-braced-for-a-11-trillion-fed-panic-after-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-surge/?sh=34ddec114c08">going to issue more</a> than $1 trillion in new bills. Many analysts are worried about this as they say such a move could have atrocious effects on the market.</p>
<h2>The Treasury May Hurt BTC</h2>
<p>Alex Lennard – investment director at global asset manager Ruffer – explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our concern is that if liquidity starts leaving the system, for whatever reason, this creates an environment where markets are crash prone.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was seconded by Mike Wilson, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. He claimed that while the Treasury is more than likely trying to refill “empty coffers,” the market may lose a heavy amount of liquidity should it move forward with its present plan, and thus a major correction could be heading our way.</p>
<p>There is also concern that the Fed could potentially seek to hike rates further in the coming weeks given inflation has not died down over the past few months the way financial analysts had initially hoped for. Yuga Hasegawa – crypto market analyst at Bit Bank in Tokyo – mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The debt ceiling issue could soon be a thing of the past, but the future trajectory of the Fed funds rate will continue to weigh on the market sentiment, and bitcoin’s weekend rally could be hindered depending on the series of economic data slated for this week, such as ISM’s manufacturing PMI and May’s jobs report.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, there is some good news in that economists anticipate a whopping 180,000 jobs to be added to the market in the coming future. However, this doesn’t change the fact that unemployment is expected to move up to close to four percent, and that 180K figure is nothing compared to the 250,000 jobs that were added as recently as April. Hasegawa explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economic data in the last month have indicated the resilience of the U.S. economy. Most of all, core indexes for CPI and PCE, as well as trimmed, mean PCE inflation rate for April did not show any significant improvements. The Fed Funds futures market now prices in [a] roughly 65% chance of another rate hike… and if the number keeps going up, it will likely be a headwind for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Could There Be Price Dips?</h2>
<p>The Treasury and its department head Janet Yellen have made it <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-crypto-fans-may-want-to-wait-on-their-calls-for-regulation/">clear that crypto and other</a> assets are not their main priorities.</p>
<p>Thus, it would be a huge pity if they went ahead with the move anticipated above and it sucked further liquidity out of the market given how far tokens like bitcoin have come this year after enduring some of their most bearish conditions in 2022.</p>
