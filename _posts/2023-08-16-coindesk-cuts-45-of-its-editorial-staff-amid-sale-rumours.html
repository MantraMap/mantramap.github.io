<p>Crypto media outlet CoinDesk has cut its editorial staff by 45% as its parent company DCG prepares to introduce strategic investors. </p>
<p>Rumours that DCG is negotiating a sale of its crypto media outlet CoinDesk have been circulating for a while. Reports by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) claim that the crypto conglomerate was reportedly finalizing a $125 million deal to sell a portion of the company. DCG would reportedly retain a stake in the company.</p>
CoinDesk Announced Staff Cuts
<p>Reports by crypto news outlet The Block claim that CoinDesk let go of 45% of its editorial staff as its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), prepares for a partial sale of the company. DCG purchased CoinDesk in 2016 for $500,000. The company was established in 2013.</p>
<p>In an internal memo viewed by The Block, the firm was soon to have an &ldquo;all-hands&rdquo; meeting to discuss the layoffs.</p>
<p>In an email, Kevin Worth, CoinDesk CEO, told staff:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The purpose of the meeting is to inform everyone that today several roles, predominantly in our media team, were impacted by a reduction in force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an incredibly difficult message to send to everyone over email and yet I also wanted everyone at CoinDesk to know as soon as possible what is happening today. This was a required step to ensure a financially sound business moving forward and to set us on the path to close the deal to sell CoinDesk Inc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to The Block&rsquo;s report, which cites someone familiar with the matter, CoinDesk would let go of 45% of its editorial team or 20 people.</p>
DCG Will Retain a Stake in CoinDesk
<p>CoinDesk recently appointed financial advisers to &ldquo;help bring on new institutional and strategic investors&rdquo; alongside its parent company. DCG has faced severe pressure from crypto exchange Gemini over a dispute involving the &ldquo;Earn&rdquo; program. In July, Gemini announced that it had filed a lawsuit against DCG.</p>
<p>The reports from the WSJ indicated CoinDesk was in the final stages of a partial sale of the company to a crypto syndicate led by crypto investor Matthew Roszak of Tally Capital. As part of the $125 million deal, DCG would retain a share of CoinDesk.</p>
