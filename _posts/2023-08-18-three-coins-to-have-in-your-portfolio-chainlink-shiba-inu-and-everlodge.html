Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Solution
<p>Chainlink (LINK) has solidified its position as a cornerstone in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As a bridge between smart contracts and real-world data, Chainlink's decentralized oracle network ensures blockchain applications access to accurate information.</p>
<p>In recent Chainlink news, it announced that it merged with Coinbase's Base. As a result, the Chainlink crypto interest rose. In fact, its value jumped by 6.3% over the past month alone. </p>
<p>Currently, Chainlink is trading hands at $7.28 with a market cap of $3.9B. However, due to its technical indicators showing green, market analysts remain bullish about it. Therefore, they forecast a $9.12 price for Chainlink by the end of 2023. </p>
Shiba Inu (SHIB): Expected To Soar 
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the scene as a community-driven experiment inspired by the success of meme coins like Dogecoin. While often associated with its meme status, Shiba Inu aims to create a decentralized ecosystem that includes tokens like BONE. </p>
<p>The Shiba Inu price has increased 13.2% over the previous week, ranking among the top 20 altcoins by total market capitalization. Not only that, Shiba Inu is one of the best-performing currencies overall. The Shiba Inu crypto has a value of $0.00001036 with a market cap of $6.1B. </p>
<p>Most importantly, the Shiba Inu technical analysis shows bullish signs. To clarify, all its moving averages and technical indicators are showing strong buy signals. As a result, experts in the field predict Shiba Inu surging to $0.00001078 soon..</p>
Everlodge (ELDG): Brings Something Unique to the Real Estate Market
<p>Everlodge (ELDG) aims to democratize real estate investment by tokenizing properties and offering fractional ownership through blockchain technology. This approach allows investors to purchase fractions of high-value properties, such as luxury villas, vacation homes, and hotels, for $100. Therefore, Everlodge enables more individuals to participate in real estate investment.</p>
<p>One of the most innovative aspects of Everlodge is its integration of NFTs into the real estate market. Each property is minted as an NFT, representing ownership, and stored securely on the blockchain. This provides several benefits, including increased transparency, immutability of ownership records, and removing the need for intermediaries.</p>
<p>At the core of this platform lies the ELDG native token. ELDG holders are rewarded with discounts on property purchases, reduced trading fees, and even free nightly stays in the properties within the Everlodge ecosystem. This rewards program incentivizes participation and fosters a vibrant and engaged community of investors.</p>
<p>One ELDG token costs only $0.01. But keep in mind that it is in Stage 1 of its presale. In other words, it will rise as it advances. And with Stage 2 coming this month, a 20% surge will also occur. Everlodge stands out from Chainlink and Shiba Inu thanks to its low market cap, which means it will surge faster. Consequently, experts foresee a 30x growth for it on launch day. </p>
