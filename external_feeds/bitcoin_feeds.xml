<h2>UBS Sees 3 Key Reasons to Buy Gold Now</h2>
<p>UBS, a global investment bank based in Switzerland, has presented three reasons to consider buying gold now. In a note titled &#8220;Three Reasons to Buy Gold Now,&#8221; published Thursday, by UBS Chief Investment Office, the firm&#8217;s strategists outlined their expectations that gold is poised to surpass its all-time high this year.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that the price of gold has retreated from its recent high, the strategists wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The yellow metal remains 8.2% higher since the start of this year, and we think it’s likely to break its all-time high later this year with multiple mid- to longer-term drivers.</p></blockquote>
<p>One key factor driving the UBS strategists&#8217; bullish outlook on gold is their expectation that central banks&#8217; demand for gold will &#8220;remain robust.&#8221; They explained that global central banks purchased a record amount of gold last year, marking the 13th consecutive year of net gold purchases and “the highest level of annual demand on record dating back to 1950.”</p>
<p>Citing the 1Q23 data from the World Gold Council indicating that &#8220;central banks are on track to buy around 700 metric tons of gold this year, much higher than the average since 2010 of below 500 metric tons,&#8221; the UBS strategists detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We think this trend of central bank buying is likely to continue amid heightened geopolitical risks and elevated inflation. In fact, the U.S. decision to freeze Russian foreign exchange reserves in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine may have led to a long-term impact on the behavior of central banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second factor that UBS expects to boost the price of gold concerns &#8220;Broad U.S. dollar weakness.&#8221; The strategists described: “The direction of a weakening dollar is clear, with the U.S. Fed having signaled a pause in its current tightening cycle after 500 basis points of rate hikes over the past 14 months. Other major central banks, meanwhile, remain on track to do more to fight inflation.” They affirmed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe the reduction in U.S. yield carry will continue to weigh on the greenback. Gold has historically performed well when the U.S. dollar softens due to their strong negative correlation, and we see another round of dollar weakness over the next 6–12 months.</p></blockquote>

<p>The UBS strategists named rising U.S. recession risks as the third reason to buy gold now. They believe that investors will flock to gold as a safe haven asset in the event of a recession.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, recent data coming out of the U.S. showed the country’s growth is slowing,&#8221; they detailed, citing weaker-than-expected 1Q GDP, six consecutive months of contracting manufacturing activity, the weakest consumer sentiment since November, and tighter credit conditions as factors &#8220;likely to weigh on growth and corporate profits.&#8221; They emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on data since 1980, gold’s relative performance versus the S&amp;P 500 improved significantly during U.S. recessions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noting that gold is expected to hit $2,100/oz by year-end and $2,200/oz by March 2024, the UBS strategists said they retain their &#8220;most-preferred rating on gold&#8221; alongside their &#8220;positive stance on broad commodities.&#8221; They concluded: &#8220;We think gold should remain a hedge within a portfolio context.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Biden on Budget Negotiations: I&#8217;ve Done My Part</h2>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden provided an update on the U.S. debt crisis and budget negotiations during a press conference Sunday following a Group of Seven (G7) meeting in Hiroshima, Japan. He emphasized that he met with all four Congressional leaders before he left to attend the G7 meeting, and they agreed that the only viable path forward is through a bipartisan agreement.</p>
<p>“I’ve done my part. We put forward a proposal that cuts spending by more than a trillion dollars, and on top of the nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction that I previously proposed through the combination of spending cuts and new revenues,” Biden detailed. “Now it’s time for the other side to move from their extreme positions, because much of what they’ve already proposed is simply, quite frankly, unacceptable.”</p>
<p>The U.S. president listed several things he will not agree to. &#8220;I’m not going to agree to a deal that protects, for example, a $30 billion tax break for the oil industry, which made $200 billion last year &#8230; while putting healthcare of 21 million Americans at risk by going after Medicaid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I’m not going to agree to a deal that protects $200 billion in excess payments for pharmaceutical industries and refusing to count that while cutting over 100,000 schoolteachers and — and assistants’ jobs, 30,000 law enforcement officers’ jobs cut across the — the entire United States of America.&#8221; In addition, Biden stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m not going to agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistance at risk for nearly a hundred — excuse me — nearly 1 million Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people took to social media to react to Biden&#8217;s statement about crypto. Some criticized the president for lumping crypto traders and tax cheats in the same category while others reminded him of all the money printing and spending under the Biden administration.</p>

<h2>Biden Insists America Will Not Default on Debt</h2>
<p>Biden proceeded to address widespread concerns about the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that the Treasury may not be able to pay all of the government&#8217;s bills as early as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">June 1</a> “if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.” The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) similarly estimated that a U.S. debt default could occur in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-faces-significant-risk-of-default-in-june-congressional-budget-office-warns/">first two weeks of June</a>.</p>
<p>The U.S. president stated that all four congressional leaders agree with him that &#8220;default is not an option,&#8221; emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>America has never defaulted &#8230; on our debt — and it never will.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people have warned of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-warns-of-very-serious-repercussions-if-us-defaults-on-debt-obligations/">serious repercussions</a> if the U.S. defaults on its debt obligations, including a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/harvard-economics-professor-us-default-could-spark-global-financial-crisis/">global financial crisis</a>. Top executives of 146 major companies in the U.S. have urged Biden and congressional leaders to act swiftly to prevent a U.S. default, warning of &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/146-top-executives-urge-biden-to-prevent-us-default-warns-of-disastrous-consequences/">disastrous consequences</a>.&#8221; Moreover, some believe that a U.S. default would risk the dollar&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lawmaker-warns-us-default-risks-dollars-reserve-currency-status-exploitation-by-china-and-russia/">reserve currency status</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former President and 2024 presidential candidate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/donald-trump-urges-republicans-to-let-us-default-on-debt-if-democrats-dont-agree-to-spending-cuts/">Donald Trump</a> has urged Republican lawmakers to let the U.S. default on its debt obligations if the Democrats do not agree to spending cuts. &#8220;It’s better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Ordinal Inscriptions and BRC20 Tokens Are Still Gaining Momentum</h2>
<p>In a span of just five days, Bitcoin.com News delivered a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/okx-introduces-new-ordinals-marketplace-amid-bitcoin-inscription-and-brc20-buzz/">report</a> stating the presence of slightly over seven million Ordinal inscriptions. However, as of the time of writing this article, an increase has occurred, bringing the total count to approximately <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/8f4f137d3867e0d926f516218f1cacad588f689c6c74c6bf2ba864d0d1e99c58i0">8,376,936 inscriptions</a>. Within this short period, 1.3 million additional inscriptions have been added, signifying an ongoing trend. Recent <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">statistics</a> from Dune Analytics, recorded on May 21, reveal that bitcoin miners have seized the opportunity presented by these inscriptions, earning 1,448.84 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The total value of these inscription-associated fees has reached roughly $39.14 million.</p>

<p>Of the vast number of inscriptions, approximately 90% consist of plain text, while a count of over 500,000 comprises JPEG and PNG files. Interestingly, there are nearly 10,000 inscriptions that house video files, while a small fraction of applications, and audio files, add a multimedia dimension to the 8.3 million minted inscriptions. These Ordinal inscriptions have not only provided a means for creative expression but have also paved the way for the creation of fungible tokens through the BRC20 standard.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://archive.ph/XBEZF#selection-203.18-203.22">archived data</a> from BRC-20.io, as of May 21, there are currently 24,677 BRC20 tokens actively traded with tangible real-world value. Moreover, these BRC20 tokens have accumulated an impressive total of <a href="https://dune.com/cryptokoryo/brc20">6,895,176 transactions</a> on the blockchain network to date. The BRC20 market has witnessed an impressive surge, with all 24,677 BRC20 tokens accumulating a valuation of $483.67 million. The token economy has also seen $207.48 million in 24-hour global trade volume.</p>

<h2>Okx Lists the Top BRC20 Token Ordi Amid Bitcoin-Token Demand</h2>
<p>Among the top contenders in the BRC20 market today, we have the tokens ordi, $B20, vmpx, piza, and pepe, capturing the attention of BRC20 investors and traders. Particularly noteworthy is the leading position of ordis, boasting the largest market capitalization with a valuation of $255 million on Sunday. Adding to the momentum, the crypto exchange <a href="https://www.okx.com">Okx</a> recently made an announcement, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/okx-introduces-new-ordinals-marketplace-amid-bitcoin-inscription-and-brc20-buzz/">declaring its support</a> for both BRC20 tokens and Ordinal inscriptions within the Okx Wallet. To further solidify their commitment, Okx exchange revealed that they would be <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/20/2672867/0/en/OKX-Becomes-One-of-the-First-Exchanges-to-List-Ordi-BRC-20-Token.html">listing</a> the prominent BRC20 token ordis (ORDI).</p>

<p>The crypto exchange stated that it holds an advantage over decentralized exchange (dex) marketplaces thanks to Okx&#x2019;s market order book. &#x201C;BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin present a distinctive challenge, and we&#x2019;re thrilled to be among the pioneers in providing users with a smooth trading, deposit, and withdrawal experience,&#x201D; said Jason Lau, Okx&#x2019;s chief innovation officer, in a statement on May 20. Additionally, Ordinal inscriptions and BRC20s <a href="https://dune.com/channingmao2/ordinal-marketplace">can be found</a> on Ordinals Market, Ordswap, Ordinals Wallet, Open Ordex, Gamma, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/magic-eden-launches-bitcoin-ordinal-inscription-market-partners-with-hiro-xverse-to-bolster-support/">Magic Eden</a>.</p>

Moscow’s top diplomat is convinced that Russia’s position on the matter is shared by many other countries while the West is undermining the role of the U.S. currency. </strong></p>
<h2>Russia’s Sergey Lavrov Announces Beginning of De-dollarization of Global Economy</h2>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov believes that the de-dollarization of the world economy is already in motion, backed by a number of nations. Speaking during the latest assembly of Russia’s Council on Foreign and Defense Policy think tank on Saturday, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>De-dollarization has begun, both in practice and in conceptual speeches.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lavrov highlighted Brazil’s suggestion that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS">BRICS</a> summit in August should consider protecting financial transactions within the organization representing the leading emerging economies and safeguarding its New Development Bank from “abuse” stemming from the “dollar’s persistent role.”</p>
<p>“We are putting forward many other initiatives concerning this issue,” the diplomat remarked, quoted by the Tass and RIA Novosti news agencies. He also emphasized that the Russian Federation’s position in that regard is shared by many allies and like-minded friends.</p>

<p>Russia has been the target of unprecedented <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-expands-unprecedented-global-sanctions-on-russia-with-over-300-new-targets/">sanctions</a> over its invasion of Ukraine, including financial restrictions that have limited its access to global finances and markets. Lavrov noted that the West is now sending emissaries to other countries, demanding that they sever most, if not all, of their trade, economic and investment ties with Russia.</p>

<p>“They [Western nations] know well how to play on the difficulties they themselves create for other countries. And they will probably have a certain result, a certain benefit in the short term,” Sergey Lavrov elaborated.</p>
<p>“But in the long term, they, and first and foremost the Americans, are hewing down the bough on which they are sitting … including the roles of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the role of the dollar in the world’s economy,” he concluded.</p>

Initially, it was Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who vocalized his stance on cryptocurrencies. However, not long after Kennedy&#x2019;s announcement, Republican presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy followed suit by declaring that his campaign is now embracing bitcoin as well.</strong></p>
<h2>Biden and Trump&#x2019;s Animosity Towards Bitcoin</h2>
<p>In just over a year, the American populace will cast their votes for the next leader of the United States on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. As the nation awaits this occasion, it has become apparent that a familiar rivalry may once again take center stage. Both the current U.S. president, Joe Biden, and the former 45th president, Donald Trump, have thrown their hats into the political ring, sparking widespread curiosity and skepticism among the public. The question on everyone&#x2019;s lips is: What has propelled these two figures to lock horns once more in the pursuit of power?</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no way the next election will actually boil down to Biden vs. Trump is there? I mean&#x2026;seriously?&#x201D; John Lennon&#x2019;s son Sean Ono Lennon <a href="https://twitter.com/seanonolennon/status/1651711909928771586?s=20">tweeted</a> at the end of April.</p>

<p>Crypto enthusiasts are well aware of where both Biden and Trump stand when it comes to the world of digital currencies. These two politicians have made their disdain for bitcoin and decentralized crypto ventures abundantly clear. The incumbent president, Biden, has been vocal about his intentions to impose taxes on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-budget-proposal-targets-crypto-investors-using-like-kind-exchange-provision-plan-aims-to-tax-crypto-miners-30/">crypto traders and miners</a>, as evidenced by the comprehensive guidance published by the White House on the matter. In January, Biden&#x2019;s administration <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-publishes-roadmap-to-mitigate-cryptocurrency-risks/">unveiled</a> a detailed &#x201C;roadmap to mitigate cryptocurrencies&#x2019; risks,&#x201D; advocating for enhanced regulatory measures. Moreover, during this year&#x2019;s G7 Summit, President Biden addressed concerns surrounding the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-us-will-default-on-its-debt-raising-debt-ceiling-will-make-problem-worse/">debt ceiling</a>, highlighting the involvement of crypto traders.</p>
<p>In a video published by Sky News, Biden&#x2019;s resolute stance is showcased as he adamantly expresses his refusal to negotiate certain agreements with Republicans when he <a href="https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1660225824262434816?cxt=HHwWgMC94eilp4ouAAAA">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#x2019;m not going to agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistants at risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin has found itself on the <a href="https://archive.is/4SbVR">receiving end</a> of Donald Trump&#x2019;s scorn as well, with the former president openly expressing his skepticism, even going so far as to label it a potential &#x201C;scam.&#x201D; In June 2021, Trump further <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/donald-trump-bitcoin-btc-scam-heavy-crypto-regulation/">articulated</a> his disapproval, highlighting his concern about bitcoin emerging as a formidable competitor to the U.S. dollar. He made his stance unequivocally clear, stating his unwavering desire for the dollar to retain its status as the global currency. However, despite his reservations about cryptocurrencies, Trump has shown a pragmatic side by leveraging blockchain technology to his advantage. Notably, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/donald-trump-trading-card-nfts-skyrocket-in-value-despite-being-mocked-for-his-major-announcement/">successfully</a> sold <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-launches-second-nft-card-collection/">two sets</a> of non-fungible token (NFT) collections minted on the Polygon network.</p>
<h2>2 U.S. Presidential Candidates Who Support Bitcoin</h2>
<p>In a recent development, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-warns-of-mega-economic-crisis-says-its-not-just-the-banks/">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, a Democratic candidate vying to succeed Joe Biden, made headlines by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-to-accept-btc-for-campaign-contributions-says-bitcoin-is-an-exercise-in-democracy/">declaring</a> his campaign&#x2019;s acceptance of bitcoin donations. Kennedy stands apart from many of his Democratic peers, as he champions the notion of <a href="https://twitter.com/TheChiefNerd/status/1651985310203490310?s=20">utilizing the free market</a> to tackle climate change and has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-government-could-ban-seize-bitcoin-cbdcs-could-lead-to-financial-slavery-political-tyranny/">expressed his opposition</a> to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>

<p>During the Bitcoin 2023 event held last week, Kennedy boldly asserted, &#x201C;As president, I will make sure that your right to hold and use bitcoin is inviolable.&#x201D; Notably, Kennedy&#x2019;s decision to embrace bitcoin for campaign contributions was swiftly followed by another presidential contender.</p>

<p>In an update on Saturday, Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican candidate took to Twitter to reveal an announcement from his campaign. Ramaswamy <a href="https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1660016950632652801?s=20">declared</a>, &#x201C;Just announced we&#x2019;re officially accepting bitcoin donations. Give $1. Let&#x2019;s make the 2024 election a referendum on fiat currency.&#x201D; Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old entrepreneur and author, launched his bid for the presidency on February 21, 2023, as a Republican contender. Hailing from Birmingham, Alabama, his campaign resonates with the slogan, &#x201C;A New American Dream.&#x201D;</p>
<p>During an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-presidential-candidate-vivek-ramaswamy-bets-big-on-bitcoin-in-2024-race/">exclusive interview</a> with CBS News, Ramaswamy stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The thriving Bitcoin universe should actually better empower me to do what I want to do as the U.S. president, which is to stabilize the U.S. dollar as a unit of measurement and put the Federal Reserve back in its place with that as its single mandate.</p></blockquote>
<p>In stark contrast to Biden and Trump, Ramaswamy sets himself apart with a <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/meet-vivek-ramaswamy-republican-presidential-candidate">distinct vision</a> of reducing government influence and addressing the longstanding issue of national debt. This past Saturday, as he unveiled his campaign&#x2019;s pivotal decision, Ramaswamy provided supporters with two avenues for contributing: a <a href="https://support.vivek2024.com/bitpay/">dedicated donation page</a> powered by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitpay-ceases-prepaid-mastercard-program-promises-enhanced-card-service-in-the-future/">Bitpay</a>, welcoming bitcoin contributions, and <a href="https://checkout.opennode.com/p/94e79ad8-b784-4169-a10a-23624f026fbe">another page</a> hosted on opennode.com. It&#x2019;s worth noting that all the prominent aforementioned political figures &#x2013; Biden, Trump, Kennedy, and Ramaswamy &#x2013; have officially thrown their hats into the presidential race. However, they won&#x2019;t be the only contenders seeking the coveted office in 2024.</p>
<p>Joining the fray is Nikki Haley, a Republican candidate whose stance on <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> remains unknown. Although Marianne Williamson, a Democrat, is also in the running for the presidency, her performance during the 2020 Democratic nomination was lackluster. On the other hand, governor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ron-desantis-vows-to-prohibit-cbdc-woke-politics-and-financial-surveillance-in-florida/">Ron DeSantis</a> of Florida, while yet to formally announce his intentions for the 2024 race, is widely suspected to throw his hat into the ring as a contender for Biden&#x2019;s seat.</p>
<p>DeSantis has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-says-state-is-figuring-out-ways-to-allow-businesses-to-pay-taxes-in-bitcoin/">garnered attention</a> for his favorable remarks about bitcoin, highlighting the current administration&#x2019;s aversion to cryptocurrencies due to their inherent resistance to control. Showcasing his commitment, DeSantis <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-prohibiting-use-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-in-florida/">spearheaded legislation</a> that resulted in Florida becoming the pioneering state to ban central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), setting an influential precedent that other Republican-led states are eagerly attempting to emulate.</p>

However, amidst this growth, the stablecoin economy experienced a substantial loss of $7.3 billion within a span of 140 days.</strong></p>
<h2>Stablecoins Experience a Significant Shift</h2>
<p>As per the latest data, the stablecoin economy has witnessed a $7.3 billion decline in value in 2023. Archived records indicate that on January 6, the stablecoin economy stood at a valuation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230106003026/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">$138.12 billion</a>, but as of today, it has dwindled to <a href="https://archive.ph/6HJum#selection-1639.0-1639.16">$130.79 billion</a>. Notably, numerous stablecoin projects experienced substantial redemptions in the past four months, with USDC alone shedding over $14 billion. Similarly, BUSD suffered redemptions exceeding $11 billion since the first week of January, while DAI faced redemptions amounting to $361 million.</p>

<p>While USDC and BUSD experienced redemptions exceeding $7.3 billion in 2023, a few other stablecoin projects managed to counterbalance these losses with growth. Take TUSD, for instance, which started the year with a market capitalization of approximately $846.57 million. Today, this stablecoin boasts a market valuation of $2.04 billion, indicating a growth rate of 140.97%.</p>
<p>Similarly, tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) witnessed a substantial increase in its market cap. Back in the first week of January, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> stood at $66.29 billion, but it has since surged by over 25%, reaching $82.95 billion. Back on January 6, 2023, the stablecoin economy recorded $27.11 billion in 24-hour trade volume. However, fast forward to May 21, 2023, and the volume of the dollar-pegged token market has dipped considerably, settling at a comparatively modest $10.77 billion.</p>

<p>Although the current volume may appear smaller, the $10.77 billion worth of stablecoin trades still represents a significant portion, accounting for 57.9% of the total 24-hour trading volume within the entire crypto economy. On the other hand, when the dollar-pegged token volume reached $27.11 billion, it accounted for 81.36% of the day&#x2019;s global trade volume (on Jan. 6, 2023) across the 12,775 listed crypto assets on coingecko.com at that time.</p>

<h2 class="sc-cVVGlL doIhiE">South African Currency Plunges to New Low Versus the Dollar a Day After the US Accused Country of Secretly Supplying Ammunition to Russia</h2>
<p>The South African currency’s exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar plunged to a new all-time low of ZAR19.51:US$1 on May 12. The rand’s latest fall came a day after the U.S. ambassador to South Africa accused the country of secretly supplying weapons to Russia. Banking giant JP Morgan said it now projects South Africa’s gross domestic product to contract by 0.2%, down from the earlier positive projection of 0.3%.</p>

Jia has said it will use the funds raised to bolster its Kenyan and Philippines operations. Later, Jia will also use the capital raised to fund the exploration of new markets. </strong></p>
<h2>Affordable Financing for Small Businesses</h2>
<p>Jia, an Africa and Asia-focused blockchain fintech, recently raised $4.3 million in seed funding plus an additional $1 million for onchain liquidity. According to a Techcrunch report, TCG Crypto, an early-stage consumer crypto fund, led the round.</p>
<p>Also participating in the round were Blocktower, Hashed Emergent, Saison Capital and Global Coin Research. Angel investors that participated in the round include Packy McCormick, Anand Iyer, Jared Hecht and Rory Eakin.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/jia-a-blockchain-based-lender-of-small-businesses-in-emerging-markets-raises-4-3-million-seed/">report</a>, Jia is planning to bolster its operations in Kenya and the Philippines with the capital raised. Afterwards, the startup is expected to explore new markets in West Africa, Latin America, and Asia. In his remarks following the successful capital raise, Zach Marks, CEO and co-founder of Jia, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea is to provide affordable financing for micro-businesses, and when they repay, they become owners by getting token rewards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the report suggested that Jia is attempting to create a financing model that is similar to community finance or table-banking groups which are popular in Kenya. In such groups, members are both borrowers and shareholders, which entitles them to an income. According to Marks, the fintech startup typically provides loans of up to $5,000 for small businesses. The interest charged on such loans is about a third of what is levied by a consumer fintech lender.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>In addition to availing credit to small businesses, Jia according to Marks is also providing &#8220;a path to economic resilience and this opportunity to build wealth in a new way that hasn’t been done before.&#8221;</p>

According to statements from Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Overchuk, these topics are inscribed in broader deglobalization talks, and the Russian government is invested in developing these issues with Islamic countries.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia Talks De-Dollarization With Islamic Nations</h2>
<p>Russia is veering to the east in order to build a less polarized world and is currently involved in talks about de-dollarization and the construction of a new financial system away from the dominance of the traditional hegemonies. According to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Overchuk, the Russian Federation is currently in broad talks with the Islamic world that include these subjects and other related topics.</p>
<p>During the international economic forum Russia-Islamic World: KazanForum, Overchuk <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1620245" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our relations with the countries of the Islamic world cannot but be influenced by the global shifts that are taking place and the global trends. We are talking about processes of de-dollarization and the creation of an independent financial system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sense, Russia has been recently seeking the construction of an alternative financial system to let them transact with other countries without relying on SWIFT, the global banking linking system, and the U.S. dollar, as the Group of the Seven (G7) <a href="https://tass.com/world/1619663" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intends</a> to further restrict Russian access to the financial system.</p>

<h2>Deglobalization on the Table</h2>
<p>However, these talks are not limited to the previously mentioned topics but are merely inscribed into more comprehensive subjects that include deglobalization and how to deal with the changing trends in how investments are moving in the countries in the current geopolitical context.</p>
<p>Overchuk explained he was positive about the outcome of these talks, remarking on the common problems that Russia and these countries are facing. Overchuk declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This broader agenda and how it affects countries and relationships enables us to see that relations between Russia and the Islamic states have a very large and very positive future. The government is doing a lot to ensure further development along these lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Russia has recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-and-iran-phasing-out-us-dollar-in-bilateral-trade-settlements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowed</a> its relations with Iran, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-putin-irans-raisi-oversee-railway-deal-signing-2023-05-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> the construction of the Rasht-Astara railway, a route prompted as a rival to the Suez Canal that would connect India, Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, and other countries part of the Islamic world with 162 km of railway.</p>

This Fidenza #725 NFT commanded an auction price of over $1 million during Sotheby&#8217;s Contemporary Day Sale.</strong></p>
<h2>Sotheby&#8217;s Brings in $2.5 Million From 3AC&#8217;s NFT Collection</h2>
<p>On May 19, 2023, Sotheby&#8217;s auction unveiled the sales figures for the NFT collection of Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a now-bankrupt Singaporean crypto hedge fund, with a total of $2.5 million. Sotheby&#8217;s took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to <a href="https://twitter.com/Sothebysverse/status/1659694250215485440?s=20">announce</a> that Tyler Hobbs&#8217; Fidenza #725 NFT fetched $1,016,000, nearly five times the high estimate. The 3AC NFT auction, known as the &#8220;Grails&#8221; NFT collection, was first <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sothebys-to-auction-3acs-nft-collection-including-larva-labs-zombie-punk-and-dmitri-cherniaks-golden-goose/">revealed</a> by Sotheby&#8217;s in April.</p>
<p>During the auction, Larva Labs&#8217; NFT Autoglyph #187 secured the second-highest bid, amassing $571,500. Additionally, Larva Labs&#8217; Crypto Punk #1326 found a buyer at $165,000, while Ringers #194 fetched $152,400. Dmitri Cherniak&#8217;s Ringer #879, affectionately known as the &#8220;Golden Goose&#8221; or simply the &#8220;Goose,&#8221; is <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelbouhanna/status/1659900837231992833?s=20">scheduled</a> for a live auction on June 15 in New York. Sotheby&#8217;s, on Friday, also <a href="https://twitter.com/Sothebysverse/status/1659695022957268993?s=20">revealed</a> that the onchain artwork crafted by <a href="https://twitter.com/0xDEAFBEEF">@0xdeafbeef</a> achieved a price of &#8220;$241,300 in the Contemporary Day Sale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kyle Davies, the co-founder of 3AC, took to Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleLDavies/status/1659793575289266176">exclaim</a>, &#8220;NFT grails mooning on Sothebys.&#8221; However, given 3AC&#8217;s alleged misconduct in mismanaging investor funds, Davies&#8217; tweet faced ridicule and criticism. One individual <a href="https://twitter.com/HodlMagoo/status/1659828191135952896?s=20">responded</a> sharply to Davies&#8217; statement, urging him to prioritize returning money to the affected individuals. Notably, Davies and 3AC co-founder Su Zhu recently unveiled <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/three-arrows-capital-co-founder-announces-new-crypto-venture-open-exchange-amid-bankruptcy-controversy/">OPNX</a>, a newly launched exchange facilitating the exchange of claims from bankrupt crypto firms.</p>
