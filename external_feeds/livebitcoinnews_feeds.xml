										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>December 28, 2022, Tallinn, Estonia: </strong>Vulcan Blockchain has just announced that its’ novel auto-rebasing Layer 1 protocol will launch in Q1 of 2023. The protocol, which has been under development for some time aims to balance supply side issues affecting market stability. In this vein, the primary key feature of the Vulcan Blockchain is its Auto-Rebasing mechanism, which adjusts the circulating supply of $VUL (the native coin) every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Vulcan, named after the god of fire and forge, features unique never before seen blockchain technology. Auto-Rebasing is a unique feature that allows a blockchain to automatically adjust its supply of circulating coins. This can be an important tool for maintaining the stability and value of the native coin over time, as well as providing a more predictable and transparent monetary policy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://vulcanblockchain.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Vulcan Blockchain</a> is also Auto-Compounding, which means that as a holder of $VUL, your ownership of coins increases with each epoch.</p>
<p><em>“In addition to providing stability, an Auto-Rebasing blockchain can also help to provide greater transparency and predictability,” </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">said <strong>Jason Matthison, COO of Vulcan</strong>.</p>
<p><em>“By clearly outlining the rules and conditions under which the supply of tokens will be adjusted, an auto-rebasing blockchain can give users and investors a better understanding of the monetary policy of the network. This can help to increase confidence in the network, making it more attractive to users and investors,”</em> he added.</p>
<p>To add to its Auto-Rebasing, Auto-Compounding capabilities, the Vulcan Blockchain also has a unique burn mechanism, known as the &#8220;Fire Pit” (a null address). 80% of all transaction fees on the network are automatically sent to the Fire Pit, which is totally inaccessible and burns the coins from the circulating supply forever. This feature allows $VUL to become hyper deflationary and a trusted store of value cryptocurrency over time.</p>
<p>The combination of these features, along with the commitment to decentralization, makes the Vulcan Blockchain the ideal platform for DeFi applications. Whether you are a user, developer, or investor, the invitation exists to join the <a href="https://vulcanblockchain.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Vulcan Network</a> on this exciting journey and be a part of the future of DeFi.</p>
<h4>About Vulcan Blockchain</h4>
<p>Vulcan Blockchain is the first blockchain with a built-in Auto-Rebasing mechanism, which adjusts the circulating supply of $VUL (the native coin) every 15 minutes. The Vulcan Blockchain is also Auto-Compounding, which means that as a holder of $VUL, your ownership of coins increases with each epoch. The combination of these features, along with the commitment to decentralization, makes the Vulcan Blockchain the ideal platform for DeFi applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two men in the eastern European nation of Estonia have <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/us-authorities-2-estonians-arrested-in-24575m-crypto-scam/ar-AA14q8Gp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">been arrested after they</a> defrauded crypto investors of more than $575 million in digital funds.</p>
<h2>Two Men in Estonia Charged with Crypto Crimes</h2>
<p>The arrests were issued by federal agents based in the United States. Both Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin – each is 37 years of age – have been charged with crimes like wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. It is also believed that there were four other accomplices helping the crime duo commit their illicit actions, though these individuals have not been identified at the time of writing. However, it is believed that they are living in either Estonia, Switzerland, or Belarus.</p>
<p>Prosecutors claim the men defrauded hundreds of thousands of people between 2015 and 2019. All potential investors were persuaded to purchase contracts for a crypto mining service known as Hash Flare. They were also lured into investing in an alleged virtual currency banking portal called Polybius Bank. Sadly, both firms operated as classic pyramid schemes, meaning the money that was given to the men was never put towards valid investments.</p>
<p>It is believed that the men utilized the funds to purchase real estate, luxury vehicles, and other items on themselves. Both men are in custody in Estonia and awaiting extradition to the United States for their trials and potential sentencing per a ruling from the Justice Department (DOJ).</p>
<p>In a statement, Seattle U.S. Attorney Nick Brown explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>These defendants capitalized on both the allure of cryptocurrency, and the mystery surrounding cryptocurrency mining, to commit an enormous Ponzi scheme. They lured investors with false representations and then paid early investors off with money from those who invested later. They tried to hide their ill-gotten gain in Estonian properties, luxury cars, bank accounts, and virtual currency wallets around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, both <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/estonia/" data-wpel-link="internal">Estonia</a> and the United States are working hand in hand to confiscate all the properties and other luxury items the pair accumulated for themselves. They are also striving to enter their bank accounts and confiscate all the funds they’ve gathered over the years. It is unclear if the men have found legal representation at this time, and the trial is set to occur in Seattle as several of their victims live in the state of Washington.</p>
<h2>Setting Things Straight</h2>
<p>Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division said:</p>
<blockquote><p>New technology has made it easier for bad actors to take advantage of innocent victims – both in the U.S. and abroad – in increasingly complex scams. The department is committed to preventing the public from losing more of their hard-earned money to these scams and will not allow these defendants, or others like them, to keep the fruits of their crimes.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/11/22/headed-for-oblivion-800-billion-crypto-price-shock-sparks-fears-of-catastrophic-end-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum/?sh=779c62771caa" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">confident bitcoin and</a> Ethereum, the world’s two biggest digital currencies by market cap, aren’t going to last much longer and are headed for points of no return.</p>
<h2>Paul Krugman Thinks BTC Is Done</h2>
<p>A lot has happened in the crypto arena in just the last few months. For one thing, the fall of crypto exchange FTX has sent ripples throughout the space that have seemingly caused a lot of other exchanges and blockchain-based companies to feel the heat. Aside from this, the prices of many digital currencies are struggling to maintain their present levels, with assets like BTC now falling into the low $16K range at the time of writing.</p>
<p>This is the lowest the asset has been in over two years, and many analysts think the currency could fall to 2019 levels. Paul Krugman is going a step further and claiming that bitcoin and many of its altcoin cousins are “headed for oblivion.”</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Krugman stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s hard to see what advantage these firms would have over ordinary banks. Even if the value of bitcoin doesn&#8217;t go to zero (which it still might), there&#8217;s a strong case that the crypto industry, which loomed so large just a few months ago, is headed for oblivion.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FTX disaster is likely going to go down as one of the biggest digital currency embarrassments in history. The enterprise, first beginning in the year 2019, was long considered one of the big golden players in the industry, having accumulated billions of dollars in user funds over the course of three years and eventually rising to the top of the exchange ladder.</p>
<p>It’s founder and head executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, was considered a genius by many, and prior to the company’s fall, his net worth was estimated to be above $16 billion, though that’s all changed now that the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">company has had</a> to file bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried has resigned from his post.</p>
<p>For a while, it looked like larger competitor Binance was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">going to buy the</a> smaller firm out, but this wasn’t meant to be. Now, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/congress-wants-to-really-regulate-crypto-after-ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">regulators everywhere are renewing</a> calls for high-end regulation to ensure that what happened with FTX never happens again.</p>
<h2>Regulation Needs to Come in</h2>
<p>Anna Becker – chief executive of crypto trading firm Endo Tech – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If crypto is to survive, we will need to see an agreed form of regulation that comes from within the industry and is overseen by regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to ensure proposed standards are maintained. Heightened regulation is a matter of urgency and needs to be established immediately. For retail investors who aren’t as well versed in risk as professional investment firms, they deserve trustworthy oversight, guidance, and risk disclosure.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">fall of FTX</a> and so many other issues plaguing the digital currency world, many are wondering what the fate of the Digital Currency Group (DCG) in Connecticut will be. The organization is arguably one of the largest in the space, and its partner – <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/11/20/in-huge-trouble-10-billion-earthquake-could-be-about-to-cause-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-chaos/?sh=3f4d98a22dd2" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">crypto lending platform Genesis</a> – has recently been hit with rumors that bankruptcy is on the horizon after halting all activity.</p>
<h2>DCG Says It&#8217;s Doing Fine</h2>
<p>Despite this, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Crypto-conglomerate-Digital-Currency-Group-17592745.php" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">regulators and economists in Connecticut</a> remain confident in the organization’s abilities to stay afloat and get things done. David Lehman – commissioner of the state Department of Economic and Community Development – explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p> They don’t live in isolation, and they’re trying to navigate a more challenging market environment as markets ebb and flow, and that clearly is going on now, especially with the recent news around FTX.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like so many other companies in the crypto arena, DCG has had to make a few changes. It recently laid off about ten separate employees, bringing its staff numbers down from about 76 to 66 at the time of writing. However, this hasn’t stopped it from making new hires, suggesting that the initial layoffs were not because the company was suffering but because changes were in order.</p>
<p>DCG recently explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We recently made a series of internal changes to position DCG for its next phase of growth, including a streamlining of our departments alongside several promotions on our leadership team. DCG is fully committed to Stamford and Connecticut.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, the company moved from Manhattan to the Connecticut town of Stamford. Barry Silbert – the founder and CEO of DCG – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re excited about building something special here in Stamford. We believe Stamford has the infrastructure, resources, and talent to create a hub for the next generation of fintech and crypto companies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The firm has hinted it’s looking to create as many as 300 full-time jobs. Doing so could garner it a state-based grant of about $5 million, which would certainly help executives maintain all operations. Lehman continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Connecticut taxpayers are not at risk for the business risk of DCG. If the jobs don&#8217;t transpire or they&#8217;re less (than expected), then ultimately the benefit is going to be less.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Getting Ready for the Future</h2>
<p>Right now, no money has been given to the company, though the enterprise is still working on signing the right paperwork with city officials and doing what it needs to do to establish the right job waves. Amanda Cowie – a spokesperson for DCG – explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have proceeded in good faith, submitting signed documents as recently as the summer of this year. We have a signed LOI and a financial plan with DECD, and a good working relationship with our business partners there.</p></blockquote>

<li>The price is now trading below $0.88 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.880 the 4-hours chart of the EOS/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to decline if it stays below the $0.88 and $0.900 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is struggling below $0.90 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-drop-to-new-2022-lows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. The price might attempt to recover if there is a clear move above $0.90.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, EOS price saw a major drop below the $1.00 zone against the US Dollar. The price traded below the $0.945 and $0.912 levels to enter a bearish zone.</p>
<p>The pair accelerated lower below the $0.90 support zone and settled well below the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-bearish-turn-below-0-9-support-nearby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. It traded as low as $0.8306 and recently started a consolidation phase. There was a minor increase above the $0.845 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price even spiked above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the main decline from the $1.067 swing high to $0.8306 low. However, the price is still facing hurdles near $0.90 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
<p>On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $0.88 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.880 the 4-hours chart of the EOS/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $0.90 level, above which the price might test the $0.950 level.</p>
<p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the main decline from the $1.067 swing high to $0.8306 low is also near $0.95. Any more gains might send the price towards the $1.00 level.</p>
<p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $0.850. The next key support is near the $0.835 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.835 support, the price could test the $0.80 support in the near term.</p>

<li>Litecoin started a fresh decline below the $75 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>LTC price is now trading below $72 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There is a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $68.20 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could struggle to clear the $68 and $70 resistance levels in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Litecoin price is struggling below $72 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-drop-to-new-2022-lows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. LTC price could continue to decline if it stays below the $72 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few sessions, there was a fresh decline in bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-could-attempt-fresh-increase-above-1240/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-bulls-struggle-below-0-36/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ripple</a>, and litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC started a short term upside correction from the $61 support zone.</p>
<p>The price was able to climb above the $62 and $65 resistance levels. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $79.83 swing high to $61.01 low. The price even climbed above the $70 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
<p>However, the bears were active near the $72 zone. They protected the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $79.83 swing high to $61.01 low.</p>
<p>The price is now trading below $72 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). There is also a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $68.20 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $68.00 zone. The next major resistance sits near the $70 level. The main resistance is near the $72 level. A clear move above the $72 level could pump the price towards the $75 level or even $80. The next major resistance could be $85.</p>
<p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $65.00 level. The next key support is near the $62.00 level. If there is a downside break below the $62.00 support, the price could accelerate lower towards the $58 level in the near term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grayscale – one of the largest bitcoin trusts in the world – says <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/grayscale-refuses-to-share-proof-of-reserves-due-to-security-concerns-as-shares-trade-at-a-45-discount-to-bitcoin/ar-AA14mNVa" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">it’s not going to be sharing</a> its proof of reserves with customers, causing a lot of heads to turn, eyebrows to hike, and fear to surge.</p>
<h2>Why Won&#8217;t Grayscale Spill the Beans?</h2>
<p>The concern amongst digital currency enthusiasts and analysts is that Grayscale is somehow not too far off the mark from where FTX stood. FTX is a failed digital currency exchange that was at one time considered the golden player of the arena. Many thought the company could do no wrong, though things really hit a bad spot in mid-November of this year after it was announced that the company was suffering from a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">liquidity crunch</a> and needed assistance.</p>
<p>It was originally looking like Binance was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">going to step</a> in and purchase the smaller, ailing firm. However, this didn’t happen, as Binance took one <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">look at all the problems</a> the company was facing and resoundingly stated, “no thanks.” From there, FTX <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed bankruptcy</a> and the man behind it, Sam Bankman-Fried, was forced to step down.</p>
<p>The company has since been thrown into a swirling pool of criminality and speculation, and many are worried about what could be hiding behind the doors of many of crypto’s biggest names, one of which is Grayscale. The company explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Due to security concerns, we do not make such on-chain wallet information and confirmation data publicly available through a cryptographic proof of reserve or other advanced cryptographic accounting procedure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, this is causing Grayscale customers to worry. Does the company not have enough money in the bank? Is it lying about its finances? What is it trying to hide? Why not just share the information at hand and let all its customers’ minds be at ease once and for all?</p>
<p>Grayscale wrote on social media that it’s expected to take some flak for the maneuver. It’s fully aware of what’s going on with FTX, but it says that the ensuing panic isn’t a good enough reason for it to reveal what it refers to as sensitive financial information. The company said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Panic sparked by others is not a good enough reason to circumvent complex security arrangements.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a separate tweet, Grayscale mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Laws, regulations, and documents that define Grayscale&#8217;s digital asset products prohibit the digital assets underlying the products from being lent, borrowed, or otherwise encumbered.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Keeping Companies Transparent</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Vitalik Buterin – the man behind famed digital currency network Ethereum – introduced a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/vitalik-buterin-wants-all-crypto-exchanges-to-be-transparent-about-their-financials/" data-wpel-link="internal">new set of protocols</a> that could be utilized by crypto exchanges and related businesses to show all their customers proof of their reserves.</p>
<p>The protocols were released in response to the FTX debacle. Buterin said this would calm a lot of the nerves people were feeling and give companies more legitimacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nikolai Mushegian – a young <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto</a> pioneer – was <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/09/drowning-death-of-crypto-visionary-fuels-conspiracy-theories/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">recently found dead</a> on a beach in Puerto Rico after claiming on social media that intelligence agencies were trying to kill him.</p>
<h2>Nikolai Mushegian Dead in Puerto Rico</h2>
<p>Leaving his $6 million condo on the morning of October 28, Mushegian was found by a surfer only hours later. His body was discovered in the waves, and he still had his wallet on him. He had said just hours earlier that the CIA and several other agencies around the world were involved in a criminal ring and were looking to frame him for crimes he didn’t commit. He also stated that his girlfriend was a spy of some sort and that he was going to be tortured “to death” if caught.</p>
<p>At only 29 years of age, Mushegian was considered one of the youngest – and most brilliant – crypto entrepreneurs and innovators out there. His death has given rise to several theories online about what could have happened. One came from Ameen Soleimani, the CEO of Spank Chain, who stated in a series of tweets:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, Nikolai is still F–KING DEAD. My money is on him being murdered. He was found drowned four hours after his riskiest tweet ever. He had all year to drown randomly or be mugged, so it seems unlikely that his death was unrelated to his tweet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mushegian was an earlier developer of Maker DAO, a large and decentralized crypto trading platform. He was also one of the world’s biggest developers of stable coin networks.</p>
<p>An unnamed source is claiming that he suffered from extreme bouts of paranoia, thus shedding doubt on the ideas shared in the tweets prior to his death. At the same time, the source was also quick to point out that there was reason for at least some of the paranoia to be there. The source said:</p>
<blockquote><p>He had mental problems. He saw a psychiatrist at times. He smoked a lot of pot. A tremendous amount. Some of his paranoia was based on fact. He’d discover things. He knew things. Nikolai got bored a lot with the mundane of life. He’d go after things, constantly putting himself in weird positions. It wasn’t for the money. He was interested in why things were the way they were and the corruption behind it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Trying to Protect Himself</h2>
<p>The source continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>He was a very quirky guy. He and I spent a lot of time together and I knew everything about him. He came across as cocky and arrogant, but that was just his autism. He was a big nerd, but he wouldn’t let anyone bully him. He had a collection of guns — long guns, handguns, rifles. He liked guns and he knew he wanted to protect himself.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two new cases of crypto fraud <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/2-men-indicted-for-money-laundering-2-4-million-through-cryptocurrency/ar-AA14hVtL" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">are in the books</a>.</p>
<h2>Crypto Fraud Is Getting Too Big</h2>
<p>The first involved two bad actors. One is Randall V. Rule, age 71, of Reno, Nevada. His partner in crime was Gregory C. Nysewander, age 64, of Irmo, South Carolina. Both have been charged with money laundering conspiracy, money laundering, and conspiracy to violate the Bank Secrecy Act. The pair sought to hide illicitly garnered funds through crypto portals.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney’s office said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The defendants and their co-conspirators made false representations and concealed material facts to avoid discovery of the fraudulent nature of deposits, wires, and transfers, such as providing instructions to co-conspirators and victims to label wire transfers as ‘loan repayments’ and ‘advertising.’</p></blockquote>
<p>The second <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/ohio-man-charged-with-2410m-cryptocurrency-fraud-scheme/ar-AA14jScU" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">case of crypto fraud</a> involves a single party. This one was an Ohio man named Rathnakishore Giri, who by contrast to the initial pair, is quite young at only 27 years of age. He has been charged with defrauding investors in a crypto scam that saw customers lose more than $10 million in total. According to the Justice Department (DOJ), Giri has a history of investment fraud, and this was likely just another scheme in his eyes.</p>
<p>It is alleged that Giri promised all his investors specific returns, though he had no means of guaranteeing anything. He also “fraudulently” promoted himself as a crypto expert, purporting that he knew all there was to know about digital currencies and that he could engage in successful trades across the board.</p>
<p>Court documents state:</p>
<blockquote><p>As defendant Giri knew, he had a history of failing to fulfill such promises to investors. Among other things, defendant Giri repeatedly failed to repay investors&#8217; principal investments, having taken no steps to protect such principal.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was also able to lure people in by bragging about his own luxurious lifestyle and personal wealth. This caught many people by surprise and caused them to figure there was truth to his words, enticing them to jump aboard. It is believed he drove several luxury vehicles including a Tesla, two Lamborghinis, and an Audi R8.</p>
<p>The documents further claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of using all investor funds for cryptocurrency investments as promised, defendant Giri diverted certain investor funds to other purposes such as payment of his own personal expenses or repayment of principal or interest on earlier investments in a manner consistent with a Ponzi scheme.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Potentially Long Prison Sentence</h2>
<p>Aside from the vehicles, Giri also wore watches that were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. He flew on private jets and rented luxury homes. He has been charged with five counts of wire <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal">fraud</a>.</p>
<p>If convicted, he could spend the next 100 years in jail given that each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years behind bars.</p>
