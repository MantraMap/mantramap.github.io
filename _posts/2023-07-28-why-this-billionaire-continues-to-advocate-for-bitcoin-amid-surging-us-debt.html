Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to occupy center stage, drawing varied reactions from different financial pundits. One of these voices is billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, who has yet again reiterated his support for the top cryptocurrency despite the unsettling dynamics in the United States economy. The Growing Concern: Skyrocketing Interest Payments The US is currently experiencing an unprecedented increase in debts as its interest payments reach $970 billion. This figure represents a leap of $41 billion in the second quarter alone. Observers anticipate that the rising trajectory could soon see the country&#8217;s debts surge resulting in the interest payments hitting the $1 trillion milestone, which has set off alarm bells in financial circles.

To clarify, interest payments are the actual payments that the borrower makes to the lender, typically on a regular schedule, to repay the interest on a loan or debt. The amount of each payment is determined by the interest rate and the terms of the loan. As such, the sustained upsurge of interest payments in the US economy has triggered growing unease among financial experts. Tax receipts are currently failing to keep pace with the ballooning sovereign debt. Consequently, the issuance of more debt to fund interest payments is becoming an increasingly common occurrence. This scenario has created a vicious cycle, causing concern about the potential repercussions on the nation&#8217;s fiscal health. In light of this, Mike Novogratz has once again expressed his firm support for Bitcoin. His latest advocacy came to the forefront recently when he urged investors to buy Bitcoin as the US national debt spiked by $1 trillion between June and July.

He envisions that the cryptocurrency is on the cusp of another growth cycle, following a consolidation phase oscillating between the $28,000 to $32,000 range. However, Novogratz maintains that a significant shift in policy by the Federal Reserve, specifically a reduction in interest rates, is key for this expected surge to come to fruition.

The Federal Reserve&#8217;s current stance seems to diverge from the conditions that Novogratz believes are necessary for a Bitcoin rally. Despite this, the experienced investor continues to champion Bitcoin, viewing it as a potential safe haven amid economic uncertainties. In the meantime, Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation is still persistently working to rise above the recent downward trend. The digital asset experienced a slight dip of 1% in the last day and now has a market cap of $567.5 billion. BTC&#8217;s market price currently stands at $29,309, at the time of writing. This price action follows the asset&#8217;s unsuccessful endeavor to reclaim the $30,000 mark earlier this week.  Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView
