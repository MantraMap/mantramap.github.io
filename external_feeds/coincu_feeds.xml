					<description><![CDATA[A measure to extend some tax breaks available to Israel's high-tech enterprises to the country's crypto industry received preliminary approval in the Knesset.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Israel&#8217;s parliament approves tax breaks for the crypto industry, mirroring those enjoyed by high-tech enterprises.</em></li>



<li><em>The measure aims to halve the tax on cryptocurrency options and attract international investment to Israel.</em></li>



<li><em>The country is taking steps to regulate the digital asset market and promote clarity through proposed tax payment systems.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Wednesday, a <a href="https://main.knesset.gov.il/activity/legislation/laws/pages/lawbill.aspx?t=lawsuggestionssearch&amp;lawitemid=2202412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">measure</a> to extend some tax breaks available to Israel&#8217;s high-tech enterprises to the country&#8217;s crypto industry received preliminary approval in the Knesset, the country&#8217;s parliament.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-333.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-333-1024x576.png" alt="Israel&#039;s Crypto Industry Can Breakthrough With Revolutionary Tax Breaks" class="wp-image-200420" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-333-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-333-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-333-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-333-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-333-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-333-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-333.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Israel&#039;s Crypto Industry Can Breakthrough With Revolutionary Tax Breaks 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The plan, which aims to change Israel&#8217;s Income Tax Code, also proposes halving the 50% tax on workers&#8217; cryptocurrency options. In this sense, the objective is to extend the tax break enjoyed by employees in the conventional high-tech sector to the digital asset company.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-335-1024x536.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-335-1024x536.png" alt="Israel&#039;s Crypto Industry Can Breakthrough With Revolutionary Tax Breaks" class="wp-image-200422" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-335-1024x536.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-335-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-335-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-335-750x393.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-335-1140x597.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-335.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Israel&#039;s Crypto Industry Can Breakthrough With Revolutionary Tax Breaks 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>Dan Illou, a lawmaker from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#8217;s Likud party, said in a statement that the measure had the support of Netanyahu&#8217;s coalition administration. The law also fits with the current administration&#8217;s goals to entice international investment to <a href="https://coincu.com/170775-israel-a-web3-technology-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel</a>, according to <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/05/israeli-lawmakers-support-axing-crypto-capital-gains-tax-for-foreigners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a></em>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Up until now, workers in the crypto industry had to pay double the tax on their options compared to workers in the traditional high-tech industry. Moreover, foreign investors in the blockchain industry were not entitled to the same benefits as those entitled to investors in the traditional high-tech industry,” said Illouz.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The most recent development comes as Israel attempts to control the expanding digital asset company. Shira Greenberg, Chief Economist at Israel&#8217;s Ministry of Finance, proposed ideas for regulating the country&#8217;s digital asset market in November, including the creation of systems for tax payment on digital asset operations to eliminate impediments and promote clarity.</p>

<p>Early this year, the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) <a href="https://coincu.com/157938-israel-securities-authority-digital-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began</a> to develop a new regulatory framework for digital assets that primarily come under its control, which might bring more clarity to the industry. The amendments would add digital assets to the current category of “financial instruments” in Israeli securities law and define them as digital representations of value that are utilized for financial investment, and that can be exchanged using a distributed ledger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitwage, a cryptocurrency payroll company, will no longer accept USD Coin (USDC) payments from US citizens due to increased regulatory scrutiny.</em></li>



<li><em>Customers must withdraw USDC from their wallets by July 13 or risk their accounts being reset, requiring them to re-register their wallets and bank accounts.</em></li>



<li><em>Bitwage will continue to support other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoin alternatives for US citizens, while the new policy has no impact on non-US residents.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitwage, a cryptocurrency payroll company, just informed in an email to its clients on July 5 that it would no longer accept USD Coin (USDC) payments from US citizens.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-331-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-331-1024x576.png" alt="Bitwage Now Stops USDC Payments For US Residents" class="wp-image-200403" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-331-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-331-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-331-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-331-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-331-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-331.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitwage Now Stops USDC Payments For US Residents 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>The move follows heightened regulatory scrutiny of the crypto market in the United States. Financial authorities in the United States have increased regulatory measures against key cryptocurrency companies, including <a href="https://coincu.com/199795-binance-drops-spot-volume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/200332-regulatory-pressures-plague-coinbase-causing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>, in the last month. Crypto firms are concerned about compliance and regulatory obligations as a result of their measures.</p>



<p>Bitwage has notified its customers that if they do not withdraw USDC from their wallets by July 13, their accounts will be reset. This implies that customers will have to re-register their wallets and bank accounts before receiving their next salary.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“If it is reset, you will have to set up your wallets and bank accounts again before we can deposit your next paycheck,” according to the announcement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonetheless, the company said that US citizens might continue to receive payments in other cryptocurrencies, such as <a href="https://coincu.com/199813-bitcoin-pushes-to-31000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, and stablecoin alternatives, such as CUSD (Celo), Tether&#8217;s USDT, and DAI. According to Bitwage, the new policy has no effect on non-US residents.</p>



<p>Bitwage&#8217;s move comes just days after the firm announced a collaboration with Vibrant, with the goal of providing smooth and zero-fee USD stablecoin payments to remote employees globally.</p>

<p>According to the company&#8217;s website, Bitwage has handled more than $200 million in payroll payments and has over 50,000 employees enrolled on its platform. Bitwage is headquartered in San Francisco and provides payroll services in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and Asia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Blur, the popular NFT marketplace, has just launched its highly anticipated Blur v2 update, bringing exciting new features and improvements to its platform.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Blur v2 launches with 50% lower gas costs and trait bidding.</em></li>



<li><em>Users can now bid on specific NFT traits for select collections.</em></li>



<li><em>Blur prioritizes user experience with Season 2 updates and emphasizes loyalty for maximum rewards.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://coincu.com/186706-blur-launch-bidding-anti-cheater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blur</a>, the popular NFT marketplace, has just <a href="https://twitter.com/blur_io/status/1676634716303417345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> its highly anticipated Blur v2 update, bringing exciting new features and improvements to its platform.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blur-scaled-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blur-scaled-1-1024x512.jpg" alt="Exciting: NFT Marketplace Blur V2 Is Now Live" class="wp-image-200389" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blur-scaled-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blur-scaled-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blur-scaled-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blur-scaled-1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blur-scaled-1-2048x1024.jpg 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blur-scaled-1-360x180.jpg 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blur-scaled-1-750x375.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blur-scaled-1-1140x570.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Exciting: NFT Marketplace Blur V2 Is Now Live 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The latest version introduces significant gas optimizations, reducing transaction costs by 50% for trades. This means users can now buy NFTs on Blur v2 while enjoying substantial savings in gas fees, amounting to approximately $16 per NFT purchase at current gas prices.</p>



<p>In addition to gas optimizations, Blur v2 unveils the much-anticipated trait bidding functionality. Previously, users could only place collection bids, but now they have the flexibility to bid on specific traits such as mids, rares, or any desired attribute. While trait bidding is supported on all collections, it&#8217;s important to note that only select collections will earn trait bidding points.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-324-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-324-1024x576.png" alt="Exciting: NFT Marketplace Blur V2 Is Now Live" class="wp-image-200390" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-324-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-324-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-324-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-324-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-324-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-324-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-324.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Exciting: NFT Marketplace Blur V2 Is Now Live 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>Earning trait bidding points adds an extra layer of excitement to the bidding process. Popular collections like Punks, Degods, <a href="https://coincu.com/190882-ordinals-market-and-bitcoin-miladys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milady</a>, and nine others offer the opportunity to earn more points based on the margin by which a trait bid surpasses the top collection bid. This incentivizes users to engage in strategic bidding and enhances the competitive nature of the marketplace.</p>



<p>With Blur v2, the platform continues to prioritize user experience and infrastructure development for NFT enthusiasts. During Season 1, Blur successfully introduced various marketplace protocols, bid pools, and essential tools for monitoring and trading NFTs. Season 2 has already seen several notable enhancements, including lending and BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) options powered by <a href="https://coincu.com/190078-blend-third-largest-of-fat-penguin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blend</a>, full mobile support, notifications, and now, the gas-optimized v2 marketplace.</p>



<p>While three key developments are still in progress for Season 2, Blur encourages users to maximize their rewards by listing their NFTs exclusively on Blur and maintaining maximum loyalty.

<p>Huobi, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, appears to be facing significant challenges. The exchange has been experiencing a decline in collateral since 2020, and its Bitcoin balance has dropped from 410,000 BTC in 2022 to only 26,000 BTC at present, reported by Willy Woo. Additionally, its ETH and USDT balances have been flatlining. </p>

<p>Web traffic to Huobi has also taken a hit, falling from 30.2 million to 7.2 million in May 2023. The exchange has been forced to shut down in many jurisdictions due to non-compliance. Despite its top web traffic coming from Russia, India, Korea, and Ukraine, the exchange&#8217;s future looks uncertain. </p>

<p>Previously, the exchange has reportedly been facing some other obstacles. According to the <a href="https://coincu.com/199356-huobi-exchange-had-leaked-otc-transaction-info/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/199356-huobi-exchange-had-leaked-otc-transaction-info/" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, the exchange suffered a major data leak that included OTC transaction information, user information, VIP user information, and technical infrastructure data. The leaked data is believed to have occurred between 2017 and 2021.</p>



<p>In addition to the data leak, X-Spot Co., Ltd., operated by Lin, <a href="https://coincu.com/196862-huobi-founder-li-lin-sued-huobi-global/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/196862-huobi-founder-li-lin-sued-huobi-global/" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed </a>a trademark infringement lawsuit against Huobi Global Ltd in the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The indictment alleged that X-Spot Limited has exclusive rights to the “火币 ” trademark, which Huobi Global Limited has been using without X-Spot’s authorization. The two parties&#8217; equity transfer and asset delivery agreement stipulates that the buyer is prohibited from using the “火币 ” trademark and brand.</p>



<p>These issues have raised concerns about Huobi&#8217;s future. Whether Huobi can turn things around and regain its position as a leading cryptocurrency exchange remains to be seen.</p>

<li><em>Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad proposes the establishment of a self-regulatory organization (SRO) for balanced crypto regulation.</em></li>



<li><em>Massad emphasizes the need for investor protection measures to prevent potential calamities in the crypto industry.</em></li>



<li><em>The SRO would operate under the supervision of both the SEC and CFTC, creating standardized investor protection standards for crypto intermediaries and digital assets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent interview with <em><a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/05/crypto-regulation-quagmire-cftc-sro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortune</a></em>, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Timothy Massad presented his perspective on crypto regulation, advocating for a balanced approach that addresses investor protection concerns.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-316.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="525" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-316-1024x525.png" alt="Former CFTC Chair Proposes Self-Regulatory Organization For Balanced Crypto Regulation" class="wp-image-200366" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-316-1024x525.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-316-300x154.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-316-768x394.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-316-1536x788.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-316-750x385.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-316-1140x585.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-316.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Former CFTC Chair Proposes Self-Regulatory Organization For Balanced Crypto Regulation 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Former CFTC chair Timothy Massad</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Massad, who chaired the CFTC from 2014 to 2017, emphasized the need for responsible regulation in the crypto industry to prevent potential calamities.</p>



<p>Unlike some proponents of crypto legislation, Massad does not believe that regulation is solely necessary to keep technology within the United States. Instead, he highlights the importance of implementing proper investor protection measures to mitigate risks and enhance transparency in the sector.</p>



<p>While acknowledging the role of enforcement cases in upholding the law, Massad argued that existing regulations are insufficient. He stressed that many stakeholders struggle to comprehend the nuances surrounding securities and commodities laws. Massad was the first to classify Bitcoin as a commodity and emphasized that financial instruments subject to futures or swap contracts can be classified as commodities, securities, or both.</p>



<p>To circumvent the ongoing debate on whether specific crypto tokens are securities or commodities, Massad proposed the establishment of a self-regulatory organization (SRO). This SRO would operate under the supervision of both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the <a href="https://coincu.com/197421-cftc-charges-california-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFTC</a>, creating a standardized framework of investor protection standards for crypto intermediaries and the digital assets traded on their platforms.</p>

<p>While gaining the support of SEC Chair <a href="https://coincu.com/199551-sec-chairman-gary-gensler-resigned-is-it-true/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Gensler</a> may pose a challenge, Massad remains optimistic that collaboration between the <a href="https://coincu.com/198794-coinbase-responds-to-sec-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> and CFTC is possible. He drew parallels to the past cooperation between the agencies when implementing swaps regulation after the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act. Massad also dismissed concerns about other jurisdictions surpassing the United States in crypto regulation, asserting that the implementation of new laws, such as the European Union&#8217;s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regime, would face similar complexities.</p>

<p>As the crypto industry continues to evolve, Massad&#8217;s proposal for a self-regulatory organization aims to strike a balance between safeguarding investors and fostering innovation. The conversation surrounding responsible digital asset regulation remains ongoing, with stakeholders seeking clarity and effective frameworks to navigate the rapidly expanding crypto landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Valkyrie Investments files an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the SEC, choosing Coinbase as its Self-Supporting Account counterpart.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC now faces pressure to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF as multiple asset managers, including BlackRock, have submitted similar filings.</em></li>



<li><em>If approved, the ETF could attract substantial investment, but the impact on Bitcoin&#8217;s market remains uncertain until the SEC decides.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Valkyrie Investments, a crypto-focused asset management firm, has filed an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin spot ETF, and this time, the leading US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase was chosen as its Self-Supporting Account (SSA) counterpart in the filing.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-312.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="488" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-312-1024x488.png" alt="BREAKING: Valkyrie Investments In Bold Move To Re-file Bitcoin Spot ETF Application" class="wp-image-200356" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-312-1024x488.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-312-300x143.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-312-768x366.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-312-750x357.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-312.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BREAKING: Valkyrie Investments In Bold Move To Re-file Bitcoin Spot ETF Application 17"></a></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://coincu.com/197020-valkyrie-apply-to-open-a-spot-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valkyrie</a> has also filed a fresh request for clearance for its Bitcoin Spot ETF, following in the footsteps of BlackRock and numerous other managers. The request parallels that of BlackRock since it is contained in the provisions of the market surveillance that would include <a href="https://coincu.com/199820-nasdaq-named-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASDAQ</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/199344-coinbase-support-valkyrie-bitwise-btc-spot-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>.</p>



<p>Valkyrie&#8217;s proposal is almost comparable to that of the investment giant, which should have a fair chance of acceptance, at least rationally and legally, in a world of Bitcoin Spot ETFs that have not found a hotel solely in the United States.</p>



<p>The SEC received the latest submission on July 3, and the agency now has to comment on an additional product as pressure increases for one of these vehicles to be authorized in the United States as well.</p>



<p>The United States is at a standstill in terms of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, which have been consistently denied by the agency run by Gary Gensler over the previous decade, even when the directors were deemed more open to the BTC sector.</p>



<p>Now the ball is in SEC&#8217;s court, which must express itself on a variety of applications, some of which include industry titans like <a href="https://coincu.com/195477-blackrock-to-expand-more-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>, WisdomTree, and, specifically, Valkyrie. The strain is rising on the agency, which was also fulfilled in terms of requests this time.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-314.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="880" height="400" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-314.png" alt="BREAKING: Valkyrie Investments In Bold Move To Re-file Bitcoin Spot ETF Application" class="wp-image-200358" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-314.png 880w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-314-300x136.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-314-768x349.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-314-750x341.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" title="BREAKING: Valkyrie Investments In Bold Move To Re-file Bitcoin Spot ETF Application 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>In reality, at the end of June, the SEC urged BlackRock and Fidelity to integrate the paperwork since it was lacking in reference to the agreement made by Coinbase with NASDAQ, which the SEC regarded necessary. These agreements have now been made clear, even in the Valkyrie application, and there should be a high possibility that everything will be accepted.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-315.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="948" height="533" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-315.png" alt="BREAKING: Valkyrie Investments In Bold Move To Re-file Bitcoin Spot ETF Application" class="wp-image-200359" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-315.png 948w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-315-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-315-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-315-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 948px) 100vw, 948px" title="BREAKING: Valkyrie Investments In Bold Move To Re-file Bitcoin Spot ETF Application 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>If approved, a considerable influx of cash is predicted for a product that, at least for some types of investors, will continue to be a superior vehicle to direct investment.</p>



<p>Yet, making estimations is now challenging. We will have to wait for any approvals before determining the effect on Bitcoin. Many people have high hopes for BlackRock, which has filed for 576 ETFs and has only been refused once.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Malicious actors drained $313 million from decentralized finance (DeFi) in the second quarter of 2023, according to a report by security firm CertiK.</em></li>



<li><em>The report highlights a surge in exit scams, commonly known as &#8220;rug pulls,&#8221; doubling the losses to investors.</em></li>



<li><em>However, the decline in flash loan and oracle manipulation exploits suggests that the DeFi industry is making progress in protecting investors and their assets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Malicious actors drained $313M from DeFi in Q2 2023; CertiK report shows decline in some attacks, but surge in exit scams.</strong></h5>



<p>According to a recent report by security firm CertiK, malicious actors drained $313 million from decentralized finance (DeFi) in the second quarter of 2023. While this figure is similar to the losses incurred in the previous quarter, it reflects a 58% decline from the massive $745 million lost in the same period last year. The CertiK report also revealed a surge in exit scams, commonly known as &#8220;rug pulls,&#8221; doubling the losses to investors. However, other types of attacks, such as flash loan and oracle manipulation exploits, experienced a decline.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-307.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="688" height="609" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-307.png" alt="Surge In DeFi Exit Scams: CertiK Report Reveals Losses Of $313 Million In Q2 2023" class="wp-image-200344" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-307.png 688w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-307-300x266.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" title="Surge In DeFi Exit Scams: CertiK Report Reveals Losses Of $313 Million In Q2 2023 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>DeFi protocols have implemented stronger security measures, such as decentralized oracles and built-in protections, to mitigate flash loan and oracle exploits, potentially decreasing the success rate of these attacks. As these attacks become harder to succeed at, digital thugs turn to other strategies, such as rug pulls. Different blockchains experienced varying degrees of security incidents, with the BNB Chain suffering the most losses.</p>



<p>It is important to note that CertiK&#8217;s report sheds light on 212 distinct security incidents identified in the second quarter of 2023, with an average loss of about $1.5 million per incident. April saw 75 incidents resulting in a total loss of approximately $103.8 million. May saw 63 incidents and losses of around $74.6 million, while June had 74 incidents with losses amounting to approximately $135.2 million.</p>



<p>While rug pulls led to a loss of about $70 million for unsuspecting investors, a dramatic jump from the $31 million lost through rug pulls in the first quarter, security researchers noted a decline in flash loan and oracle manipulation exploits. CertiK’s report finds that attackers only managed to net about $24 million through 54 such attacks in the second quarter, a notable drop from the previous quarter’s 52 oracle manipulation attacks, which amounted to $222 million.</p>

<p>Coinbase has been facing regulatory pressures that have resulted in its shares dropping. The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused the company of illegally operating an unregistered securities exchange, and this has created a lot of uncertainty around the company&#8217;s future. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/coinbase-downgraded-as-analyst-says-crypto-limbo-dims-revenue-outlook?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/coinbase-downgraded-as-analyst-says-crypto-limbo-dims-revenue-outlook?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley has downgraded his recommendation on the company to neutral from overweight. He believes that it is too difficult to forecast how much revenue the company could earn given the impending courtroom tussle with the SEC and the continued lack of clarity around cryptocurrency regulation in the US.</p>



<p>Berenberg, a German investment bank, has also warned that the stock&#8217;s rally in June could be short-lived. Investors followed BlackRock Inc.&#8217;s application for a spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, naming Coinbase as a custodian. The lack of regulatory clarity around cryptocurrency could make it difficult for Coinbase to meet its revenue projections. Moley expects second-quarter trading volumes and monthly transacting user totals to be the lowest in over two years.</p>

<p>Despite the regulatory pressures, Coinbase&#8217;s shares have soared 55% since June 6, when the SEC accused the company of illegally operating an unregistered securities exchange. Piper Sandler has held an overweight rating on the exchange since May 2021, a month after the company went public. Moley sees Coinbase as positioned to be a &#8220;major player&#8221; in the crypto space once regulatory clarity is achieved, but he would &#8220;like to see more progress on the regulatory front and a convincing turnaround in the underlying fundamentals&#8221; before turning more positive.</p>



<p>Coinbase&#8217;s stock had fallen 69% since the initiation as of the close on Monday. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/coinbase-downgraded-as-analyst-says-crypto-limbo-dims-revenue-outlook?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/coinbase-downgraded-as-analyst-says-crypto-limbo-dims-revenue-outlook?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter#xj4y7vzkg" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg </a>reported that 11 recommend buying Coinbase stock while 13 rate it a hold and eight say sell.
