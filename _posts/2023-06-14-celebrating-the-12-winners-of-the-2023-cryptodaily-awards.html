<p>CryptoDaily&trade;&nbsp;is thrilled to announce the winners of our annual international award for daring Web3 builders and popularizers. Between May 22nd and June 5th, the expert jury reviewed dozens of stars that were shining in the industry throughout the past year, recognizing honorees across 4 categories: Entrepreneurship, Development, Design, and Marketing &amp; PR.</p>
<p>Driven by the genuine belief that the community should acknowledge its heroes, we established&nbsp;CryptoDaily&trade; Awards in 2022 to reward the most outstanding talents based on their merits. They all contributed to the Web3 ecosystem in many ways, from significantly improving its infrastructure and user experience to amplifying the Web3 business sector and promoting decentralized applications to the mass population.</p>
<p>While the main goal of CryptoDaily&trade; Awards remained the same, we brought a couple of novelties to the evaluation process. So, before we proceed with disclosing this year&rsquo;s results, let us first introduce you to the changes made. &nbsp;</p>
Panel of Judges
<p>To highlight the Web3&rsquo;s best and brightest minds of 2023, we invited the Fantastic Four team of subject matter judges, each contributing to the long-term trends in their own focus area throughout a year. We have thoughtfully chosen the jury members among 20 candidates for each category, paying special attention to their in-depth knowledge of the industry, multi-faceted activity, and remarkable individual achievements.</p>
<p>Some of them have promoted dozens of new millionaire businesses for the Web3 and blockchain era. Others have traversed the severe crypto market turmoil of 2022 with honor, and still others have proved that they were rightly praised by the previous&nbsp;CryptoDaily&trade; Awards.</p>
So let us dive straight into the list without further ado.
<p></p>

Renewed Methodology
<p>This year, the focus of the award was slightly shifted towards showcasing Web3's famous personalities and rising superstars who stood out with brilliant results and dynamic development. Our jury leveraged their professional outlook to make decisions, following a numerical and quantitative methodology with specific weighting given to:</p>
<ul class="lst-kix_i1vygxemccds-0 start">
<li>Evidence of leading the development and delivery of cutting-edge Web3 projects;</li>
<li>Evidence of engagement with the business to drive Web3 adoption;</li>
<li>Evidence of skill set growth and personal accomplishments;</li>
<li>Evidence of exceptional leadership and excellence in the field;</li>
<li>Evidence of results implemented because of the honoree's work;</li>
<li>Demonstrable enthusiasm for and creativity in Web3.</li>
</ul>
<p>All judges had two weeks to carefully evaluate more than 50 most ambitious Web3 innovators in their respective categories. Adhering strongly to the award&rsquo;s criteria, each jury member finally came up with two winners, presenting them as:</p>
<ul class="lst-kix_vwxb9fh82j84-0 start">
<li>Jury&rsquo;s choice&nbsp;&ndash; unrivaled gainers whose individual performance is the most worthy by all criteria;</li>
<li>Jury&rsquo;s runner-up pick&nbsp;&ndash; those who were one step away from the Jury&rsquo;s choice but couldn't outperform the winners. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to prolong the pleasure, CryptoDaily&trade; decided not to depart from participation in the assessment of nominees. The judges had final say, but we gave an opportunity to enjoy the celebration to our 4 personal favorites, rewarding them with a very special honorable mention&nbsp;&ndash; the prestiges title from CryptoDaily&trade; editorial board.</p>

<p>And now, when all the formalities are met, it&rsquo;s time to pull back the curtain &ndash; we are ready to reveal the official results of the 2023 from CryptoDaily&trade; editorial board.</p>
