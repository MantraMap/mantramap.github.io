					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price climbed higher towards $18,400 before there was a bearish reaction. BTC is now trading near a major support at $17,550 and might bounce back. Bitcoin broke the $18,000 resistance zone before there was a downside correction. The price is trading above $17,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $17,580 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase unless it trades below the 100 hourly SMA. Bitcoin Price Remains Supported Bitcoin price extended its increase above the $17,800 resistance zone. BTC even climbed above the $18,000 resistance zone and settled well above the 100 hourly simple moving average. The price traded as high as $18,387 before there was a bearish reaction. The Fed increased interest rates by 0.5%, sparking sharp moves in the market. BTC price reacted the downside and traded below the $18,000 support zone. There was a clear move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,880 low to $18,387 high. However, bitcoin price is trading above $17,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It is holding the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,880 low to $18,387 high. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $17,580 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $17,900 level. The first major resistance is near the $18,000 zone, above which the price may perhaps revisit the $18,400 zone. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near $18,500, above which the price might gain pace and rise towards the $19,200 zone in the near term. Downside Break in BTC? If bitcoin fails to clear the $18,000 resistance, there could be more downsides. An immediate support on the downside is near the $17,580 level and the trend line support. The next major support is near the $17,400 zone and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A downside break below the $17,400 support might call more losses. In the stated case, the price could decline towards the $16,800 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $17,580, followed by $17,400. Major Resistance Levels – $17,900, $18,000 and $18,500.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price touched a high of nearly $18,400 in anticipation of today’s Federal Reserve meeting, where the US central bank was expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points.

Here’s what you need to know about the last Fed meeting of the year.  No Pivot: Fed Hikes Rates 50 Basis Points All eyes were on today’s Fed meeting and if Fed Chair Jerome Powell would follow through and soften interest rate hikes from the previously aggressive 75-basis points, to a more tolerable 50-basis points increase.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: What Elliott Wave Theory Suggests Is Next For BTC Although Powell’s speech was the most dovish in nearly twelve months of meetings, the end result was still an increase in rates, with no true pivot in sight.  What this means for risk assets like crypto or the stock market, remains to be seen.  Explosive volatility struck BTC ahead of the Fed meeting &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Pulls Back Promptly As FOMC Meeting Begins November CPI data came in lower than expected yesterday, prompting Bitcoin to front run today’s Fed meeting slightly.  In the hours leading up to the meeting.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum saw an increase in its price on Tuesday along with the rest of the crypto market following the positive CPI data release. The jump in price saw Ethereum finally beat the $1,300 price point after hovering around $1,200 coming out of the weekend. However, the digital asset had met significant resistance at the $1,350 price level, which could end up being a bearish development for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Aim Big After Recent Breakout Above $1,300 Ethereum Trades Are Wary Currently, Ethereum traders are still very on edge regarding the cryptocurrency. Even the Tuesday recovery has not done much to actually instill faith in buyers, especially given the Fed’s announcement that is expected to happen on Wednesday. Expectations remain narrow because even though inflation saw a slowdown, it still remains high at 7.1%. Given this, traders are still being conservative in their positions and are not placing too much emphasis on ETH at this time. This is expected to continue through much of the midweek trading day until Powell’s announcement is live. There are also expectations to follow depending on what stance the Fed takes this time around. Over the last couple of months, the Fed had been hawkish due to the rising inflation in the country. But given that inflation had actually come out lower this time around, it could see the Fed soften its stance. If not, then a continuous hawkish stance from the Fed would no doubt see a retracement in the crypto market, which could see Ethereum lose all of its gains from Tuesday. Binance FUD Affects ETH Over the last couple of days, the Binance crypto exchange had been the target to crypto users’ ire as questions about its reserves were raised. As a result, there was massive withdrawals from the exchange, with Binance Ethereum withdrawals accounting for the majority of ETH withdrawals from centralized exchanges over the past week. As it is now, there are still rumors that the exchange may be insolvent and some are beginning to prepare for another FTX-level event if Binance were to fall.  Naturally, this has led to caution among investors who expect a downtrend if such a thing were to happen.

					<description><![CDATA[Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, has been the target of massive FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt, for the uninitiated) over the last couple of days. After FTX collapsed, users in the space began to question if exchanges actually held enough in their reserves to honor all customers. Given what happened to FTX, is it possible for Binance to come out of this unscathed? Related Reading: Why Goldman Sachs Expects This Asset Class To Outperform Bitcoin Binance Withdrawals Intensify As the FUD spread across social media platforms, Binance users had taken to withdrawing their deposits from the exchange en masse. Data aggregator platform reported on Tuesday that Binance’s withdrawals had crossed $1.9 billion, and by the end of the day, reports were that the withdrawals were eventually higher than $3 billion in a single day. According to the data released, the withdrawals were one of the highest single-day volume for the crypto exchange, which understandably had users at the edge of their seats. However, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had come out to quell fears, explaining that it was nowhere near the highest single-day withdrawals the exchange had processed. Zhao explained that Binance had seen higher volumes when the LUNA cryptocurrency had collapsed, as well as during the FTX implosion. Most of the FUD had stemmed from the ‘audit’ report from Mazars which had drawn criticism from some experts in the industry. The multiple tweets saying that the Mazars report did not qualify as an audit had gained traction, leading to the current situation. Can The Crypto Exchange Survive? So far, Binance has been able to wade through the enormous FUD without much of a problem. Reports on social media say that despite the large withdrawal volumes, the crypto exchange continues to honor all of them in a timely manner. Also, data on Nansen show that deposits into the crypto exchange has been high during this time, offsetting the outflows to a significant degree. This tweet retweeted by “CZ” includes a screenshot of Nansen’s dashboard that showed Binance inflows were almost as high as outflows, resulting in negative net flows of only $378 million for the 24-hour period. CEO Zhao has referred to the current FUD as a “stress test” that “helps to build the credibility for exchanges that passes the test.” Haters: Omg omg!! #binance saw over 6 bn in withdrawals yesterday!!But these fudders did not tell that it got more deposits (6.56B) than withdrawals. The overall volume 12.6B $!! Many exchanges cannot even handle 100 M volume!!@cz_binance we support #Binance unconditionally!! pic.twitter.com/tIazDsLN0H &#8212; Spidey_ElonFan (@spideycyp_155) December 14, 2022 Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Climbs 2.58% In 24 Hours, Can It Reach $0.1 Before The Week Runs Out?

Can The Crypto Exchange Survive?
<p>So far, Binance has been able to wade through the enormous FUD without much of a problem. Reports on social media say that despite the large withdrawal volumes, the crypto exchange continues to honor all of them in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Also, data on Nansen show that deposits into the crypto exchange has been high during this time, offsetting the outflows to a significant degree. This <a href="https://twitter.com/spideycyp_155/status/1602962197009010690?s=20&amp;t=xJKinDsncVmhoflgZxzQAA" rel="nofollow">tweet</a> retweeted by “CZ” includes a screenshot of Nansen’s dashboard that showed Binance inflows were almost as high as outflows, resulting in negative net flows of only $378 million for the 24-hour period. CEO Zhao has referred to the current FUD as a “stress test” that “helps to build the credibility for exchanges that passes the test.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Haters: Omg omg!! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#binance</a> saw over 6 bn in withdrawals yesterday!!But these fudders did not tell that it got more deposits (6.56B) than withdrawals. The overall volume 12.6B $!! Many exchanges cannot even handle 100 M volume!!<a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@cz_binance</a> we support <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Binance</a> unconditionally!! <a href="https://t.co/tIazDsLN0H" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/tIazDsLN0H</a></p>

<p></p>

<p>At this time, there have been no obvious signs of struggle for the crypto exchange. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, also took to Twitter to publicly state that there are no “shady on-chain activities” on the part of the exchange.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Toincoin is trading at $2.30, gaining 10.61% in 24 hours. The price change in this period is 0.3172. The 24-hour low is $2.05, while the 24-hour high is $2.37. Despite the recent events in the crypto space, TON has enjoyed a positive price surge today, recording gains in a volatile crypto market. Related Reading: SEC Charges SBF Of Allegedly Conducting Fraud Schemes The trading volume is up by 40% at $66,552,790. According to CoinMarketCap, its market capitalization stands at $2,808,494,330. TON is currently ranked number 22 on the crypto market list showing massive investor attention. Its affiliation with Telegram has also helped the project to soar in popularity even if it has been rebranded. Although the TON coin is still some way off its all-time high value of $5.84, it has enjoyed a positive week and might close 2022 on a high note. What Is Behind Toncoin’s Price Gains? Toncoin is a decentralized blockchain (layer-1) built by the developers of the popular social messaging app Telegram. Toncoin utilizes a proof-of-stake mechanism which has increased its adoption time. This mechanism encourages investors to profit by staking their tokens for rewards rather than going through the rigors of mining. Toncoin price has seemingly surged due to investors rekindling their interest in the project. The Network uses sharding to operate its blockchains and is efficient and scalable. While the crypto winter has persisted and with the dip in bitcoin, investors are looking to diversify. Also, the general crypto market has seen little gains in the last two weeks despite investors&#8217; fears. TON Likely To Sustain Its Rally  TON&#8217;s support levels of 1.123 and 1.572 have been held. TON has broken through the resistance level of 1.835 with 2.998, the next level it will likely surpass. Overtaking the next resistance level will launch Toncoin into a full bull run. TON is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day SMA. This shows that the assets&#8217; short-term and long-term price movements are positive. The formation of long green candles on the chart&#8217;s right side indicates the bullish pressure. The RSI reading is firmly in the overbought region at 72.48, meaning the asset is giving off a strong buy signal for investors.  The MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) is above its signal line and displays the positive price movement on the chart. TON will likely sustain this pressure and finish the year strong if the bulls don&#8217;t back out or a major market capitulation. Most crypto assets have fluctuated in the past weeks but are slowly beginning to show signs of life.

					<description><![CDATA[A research note from Goldman Sachs published on Monday has painted a bull case for gold over the price of bitcoin. The bank’s research note comes at a time when the entirety of the crypto market is facing adversity and the price of bitcoin is down more than 70% from its all-time high price at current levels. According to Goldman Sachs, gold actually presents the opportunity that investors seem to be looking for in bitcoin. Gold Is A Better Inflation Hedge In the research note, Goldman Sachs says it expects gold to perform better than bitcoin in the long run given its already established use cases. For one, gold remains a hedge against inflation and dollar debasement, as well as being a better portfolio diversifier compared to bitcoin. Related Reading: Why The GBTC Discount Could Lead To A Bitcoin Sell-Off Additionally, Goldman Sachs explained that gold is not as affected by tighter liquidity as BTC. Since there is more demand for gold, it tends to do better in situations such as these whereas digital assets such as bitcoin tend to succumb to such liquidity crunches.  The research note also compares bitcoin to a &#8220;risk-on high-growth tech company stock.&#8221; As well as the digital asset’s value is based on future use cases instead of established use cases like in the case of gold. It explained that since bitcoin is &#8220;a solution looking for a problem,&#8221; it is more prone to volatility and is a more speculative asset compared to gold.

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen some positive movement in the last day despite the market onslaught. The meme coin was able to see more than 2.5% gains at a time when the majority of the crypto market was struggling price-wise. Currently, DOGE is still standing at a good short-term level but $0.1 remains the level to beat for the digital asset. Dogecoin Gains Momentum The last 24 hours have seen Dogecoin establish some much-needed momentum in the market. It saw an increase in its price in the early hours of Tuesday, which pushed the digital asset right above the $0.099 price level. DOGE has now continued to trend along this line for the better part of the morning, although the increased momentum shows that it may be able to maintain it for much longer. During this time, the trading volume of Dogecoin had also risen to a peak above $600 million for the 24-hour period. This showed where the uptick in price had been generated from as well. It represented a 48% increase in trading volume, which was largely driven by whale transactions. Related Reading: Cardano Community Expects ADA To Jump 50% By End Of Year, Is This Possible? Accumulation has also been persistent for the digital asset as the market eagerly awaits more developments from Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter. Likewise, the market cap of the meme coin was pushed towards $12 billion, enabling it to hold on to its spot as the 8th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. DOGE price at $0.089 &#124; Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com Can DOGE Claim $0.1? With the bear market, the price outlook for cryptocurrencies including Dogecoin has been adjusted. Instead, the level to beat for DOGE has now been moved to $0.1 where the bears continue to mount significant resistance. This makes DOGE’s recovery above $0.09 all the more important since it puts it one step closer to testing this critical level. If DOGE were to successfully break above $0.1, it would put it comfortably above its 50-day moving average. Naturally, this would mark a bullish trend for the digital asset, even if just for the short term, and the next critical level would lie above $0.12. Related Reading: Why The GBTC Discount Could Lead To A Bitcoin Sell-Off DOGE’s most recent recovery has also turned indicators toward buy, especially in the short term. This means there is now support for the cryptocurrency at 0.08, which is expected to hold through the end of the week. If it doesn’t, then the next critical support lies at $0.075, a treacherous point for the digital asset given its previous performances. DOGE is trading at $0.089 at the time of this writing. Although it is in the green on the daily chart, the meme coin is still down more than 10% in the last seven days.]]></description>
