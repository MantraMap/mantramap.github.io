The crypto winter is a drawn-out one exacerbated by the collapse of large players such as Terra and the FTX crypto exchange. As crypto businesses continue to feel the effects of the current bear market, another major player, Kraken, has been affected to the point that it has, once again, put a pause on operations in Japan. Kraken Consolidating For Crypto The Bear Market Crypto exchange Kraken plans to stop operations in the Japanese market. The exchange said this in a government publication in the country which states that it will deregister from the Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) on Jan. 31, 2023.

The decision comes just a month after Kraken revealed that it was laying off about 30% of its workforce. Given the size of the company and the amount of labor it employs, this came out to about 1,100 employees who lost their jobs at the crypto exchange.

Users are advised to withdraw all of their fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies being held on Kraken Japan before the Jan. 31 date. Kraken says it has enough funds to enable all users to withdraw assets.

The crypto exchange agreed to settle for this figure with an additional $100,000 committed to implementing sanctions compliance controls.
