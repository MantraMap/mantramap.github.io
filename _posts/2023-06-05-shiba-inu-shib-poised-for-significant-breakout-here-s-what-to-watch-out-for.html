Shiba Inu (SHIB) has faced challenges in maintaining the level of liquidity it once enjoyed. In recent weeks, the coin has exhibited minimal volatility, leaving many investors wondering about its future direction.  However, despite the apparent inactivity, various indicators hint at the possibility of a substantial price movement in the near future. As the path ahead for SHIB seems somewhat restricted, it raises the question of where the coin may head next and what potential opportunities or hurdles lie ahead.

As a result, ShibaSwap, the decentralized exchange associated with SHIB, experienced a surge in Total Value Locked (TVL), reaching an impressive $1.75 billion. However, the previously soaring TVL has taken a massive hit, plummeting to just $25.16 million, according to DefiLlama. At first glance, this dramatic decline in TVL may raise concerns about a potential liquidity crisis. Yet, a closer examination suggests that this situation may be temporary rather than a long-term predicament.  Recent data indicates a notable increase in SHIB purchases across various time intervals, and a closer look at wallet data reveals a mixed picture, with some ranges displaying an increase in holdings while others demonstrate a decrease.
