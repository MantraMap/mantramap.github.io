<p>Though new, Sparklo (SPRK) is ambitious and has proven to be committed to its course. The token is working to secure its place on the list of 'Top 100 cryptocurrencies.'&nbsp; As old cryptocurrencies on the list continue to plummet, they make this ambition more attainable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aptos (APT) Plummets After Unlock&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Crypto.com data, Aptos (APT) fell -6.91% in the last 24 hours to $10.23 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The impending unlock of 4.5 million APT tokens, which analysts said would boost the selling pressure on the asset, was a major factor in the value decrease. The unlock is estimated to be worth roughly $50 million based on current values, according to DeFillama statistics.</p>
<p>According to data from CryptoSlate, the unlock would bring APT's circulating supply up by 0.5% to 186 million tokens. Between the first three months of the year, the blockchain network has already experienced three unlocks in tranches of 4.5 million each.</p>
<p>Things are not looking well for the layer-1 blockchain network coin right now, and could get worse when the entire unlock is released.&nbsp;</p>
