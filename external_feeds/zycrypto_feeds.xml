<p>The U.S. SEC could rule on ARK Invest’s spot Bitcoin ETF filing in less than a week. The ruling has been highly anticipated by cryptocurrency investors and traders alike, especially as market players are convinced that the ruling could have a significant impact on the entire cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>As the SEC stated in a Federal Register filed on the 15th of June, August 13th has been set <em>“as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change.”</em></p>



<p>Alternatively, the SEC could push the deadline up by 240 days and go as far as delaying its final response until January 10th, 2024, for Ark’s ETF application.</p>



<p>However, as the market awaits a response from the regulatory body, sentiments from cryptocurrency investors and prominent finance figures have remained mixed.</p>



<p>Notably, James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, two Research Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence, are convinced that there is a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-just-shot-up-according-to-bloomberg/">65% chance that the SEC will green-light a Bitcoin Spot ETF</a>. </p>



<p>They, however, went on to state that some external bodies can influence the ETF approval process. <em>“Finally, pressure from BlackRock and possibly Democrats could make denying the ETFs politically untenable for Gensler.” </em>They wrote in a tweet.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Edelman, the co-founder of Edelman Financial Engines, is uncertain about the future. However, he remains convinced that a spot Bitcoin ETF is essential for crypto investors in the market. “We would love a bitcoin ETF,” he asserted.</p>



<p>He went on to assert that a spot Bitcoin ETF is the simplest, cheapest, most liquid affordable way to invest in Bitcoin. Edelman also recognizes that there has been consistent pushback from the SEC, as the regulator has rejected every spot Bitcoin ETF application filed for the past 10 years.</p>



<p>Edelman also raised concerns about the SEC&#8217;s refusal to make its rules and regulations transparent and understandable. </p>



<p>“<em>The SEC is refusing to say what we’re allowed to do, but then when we go do things, they’re filing lawsuits saying we shouldn’t have done it’s a lousy way to run commerce and business in America.”</em> He said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the recently filed ETFs, Edelman has taken the same stance as many other crypto investors who have remained critical of Gary Gensler’s inconsistencies.</p>



<p>For a spot Bitcoin ETF to be approved, Edelman notes that comprehensive crypto legislation has to be passed and remains critical of the SEC, Congress, and CFTCs&#8217; failure to pass the much-needed legislation. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ric Edelman, the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP), maintains that the market will not “see a spot bitcoin ETF any time soon.”</p>

<p>An anonymous individual using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) pseudonym &#8220;nd4.eth&#8221; recently sent a substantial 2,500 ETH, equating to roughly $4.5 million, to a burn address. This incident, which transpired on July 26, has captivated the cryptocurrency community, prompting many to ponder the rationale behind this significant burn.</p>



<p>The occurrence came to light on August 6 when “degeneratewisdom”, a blockchain analyst, <a href="https://twitter.com/degenwisdom69/status/1688216196683034624">tweeted</a> the query: <em>&#8220;Can anyone on here explain this tx to me Looks like nd4.eth sent 2500 ETH to a dead address. Doesn&#8217;t look like a noob error either. Thoughts?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>This tweet thrust nd4.eth&#8217;s substantial 2500 ETH transfer to an inactive address into the spotlight, prompting speculation within the crypto community about the underlying intention behind this deliberate and seemingly calculated move.</p>



<p>The concept of &#8220;burning&#8221; tokens entails sending tokens to an address where they are rendered permanently unspendable, thereby diminishing the overall supply of the specific cryptocurrency. However, the reasoning behind nd4.eth&#8217;s decision to annihilate such a sizable sum of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-run-towards-0-001-shib-price-in-play-as-ethereum-to-shibarium-bridge-goes-live-in-beta/">Ethereum</a> remains veiled in obscurity.</p>



<p>Laurence Day, the innovator behind the Wildcat Protocol, infused an element of humour into the situation, tweeting, &#8220;<em>If you didn&#8217;t arise this morning and express gratitude to nd4.eth for contributing to the ultrasound money narrative, I urge you to engage in profound introspection regarding your objectives.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Delving deeper into the incident, analysts from the on-chain analysis company Lookonchain disclosed additional particulars about the persona behind nd4.eth.</p>



<p><em>“The guy who transferred 2,500 $ETH($4.58M) to a dead address on July 26th is a whale with 34,287 $GMX($1.84M) and 311,003 $GNS($1.43M). He spent 5,330 $DAI to buy $GMX and $GNS on July 29 and also transferred 34.9 $GMX ($1,989) and 600 $GNX ($2,733) to the dead address,</em>” Lookonchain wrote on Monday.</p>



<p>While the exact motives of the address owner are still unknown, accidentally sending crypto or NFTs to a burn address has occurred before, albeit occasionally. Last March, an NFT collector called Brandon Riley accidentally sent his CryptoPunk #685, purchased for 77 ETH ($129,437), to a burn address while attempting to wrap it for trading on NFTfi. The irreversible error wiped out a third of Riley&#8217;s net worth. Although unrecoverable, Riley&#8217;s CryptoPunk was &#8220;resurrected&#8221; as a Bitcoin ordinal on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Last September, cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin accidentally sent a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH), valued at tens of millions of dollars, to the Ethereum burn address. This unexpected move, spanning over three days and involving more than 3,500 USDT and ETH transactions, left the cryptocurrency community puzzled with the exact motive behind this burn remaining unknown.</p>

<p>Global payments behemoth PayPal is bolstering its crypto game with the launch of its native dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD, in conjunction with Paxos.</p>



<p>According to the August 7 announcement, the Ethereum-based token will be “gradually” made available to PayPal users in the United States. PayPal USD is expected to become &#8220;a part of the overall payments infrastructure,&#8221; PayPal CEO Dan Schulman reportedly told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/paypal-launches-us-dollar-stablecoin-pyusd-for-payments-transfers"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paypal-dives-deeper-into-crypto-payments-with-pyusd-launch"><strong>PayPal Dives Deeper Into Crypto Payments With PYUSD Launch</strong></h2>



<p>PayPal has made a huge move into the stablecoin sector with the launch of its very own digital asset.</p>



<p>PayPal USD (PYUSD) is fully backed by short-term Treasuries, U.S. dollar deposits, and cash equivalents, as per the company’s <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-08-07-PayPal-Launches-U-S-Dollar-Stablecoin">press release</a>. The token will be issued by New York-headquartered crypto financial services firm Paxos Trust on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token.</p>



<p>The stablecoin allows users to conduct transfers within the platform and with supported external wallets. The dollar-denominated token can also be used for purchases and swap for other assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash on the PayPal platform.</p>



<p>PayPal introducing a stablecoin could spur its efforts to become a crypto payment giant, an endeavor the company <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-clocks-fresh-2020-high-after-paypal-reveals-plans-to-allow-customers-buy-sell-and-hold-crypto/">began </a>in 2020 after making way for cryptocurrency payments on the platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,&#8221; PayPal president and CEO Dan Schulman posited in the statement. &#8220;Our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stablecoin further offers compatibility with a wide range of developers, wallets, and Web3 applications:</p>



<p>“Most of the current volume of stablecoins is used in web3-specific environments — PayPal USD will be compatible with that ecosystem from day one and will soon be available on Venmo.”</p>



<p>While there are numerous stablecoins available in the cryptocurrency market, PayPal USD will be the first launched by a major U.S. financial institution. PayPal indicated that though services and availability of PYUSD begin today, the rollout is expected to continue in the coming weeks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paxos-to-publish-monthly-reserve-reports-for-paypal-usd"><strong>Paxos To Publish Monthly Reserve Reports For PayPal USD</strong></h2>



<p>On the transparency front, Paxos will be publishing public monthly reserve reports for PayPal USD defining the instruments comprising the stablecoin’s reserves starting September 2023.</p>



<p>Moreover, Paxos will be required to publish public third-party attestations of the value of the stablecoin’s reserve assets. This attestation will be provided by an independent third-party accounting company and executed per attestation criteria developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).</p>



<p>The news of PayPal’s stablecoin launch comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/stablecoin-issuer-paxos-ceases-busd-issuance-after-sec-reportedly-threatens-lawsuit/">planned </a>to launch a lawsuit against its crypto partner Paxos for breaking investor protection laws.</p>

<p>Adam Back, the CEO of the blockchain technology company, Blockstream, has placed a high-stakes bet on the future price of Bitcoin. </p>



<p>Taking to Twitter on Saturday, Back confidently stated that Bitcoin will reach and potentially surpass the $100,000 mark by the next halving event, scheduled for March 31st, 2024.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Another Bet is ON! I predict that Bitcoin will reach or surpass $100k by the next halving on March 31st, 2024.&#8221;</em> He <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1687867034158440448">wrote</a>.</p>



<p>The tweet didn&#8217;t just stand as a proclamation, it quickly escalated into a friendly wager. Another prominent figure in the crypto space, “Vikingo”, took the bait and engaged in the bet. If Adam Back&#8217;s prediction proves accurate and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/michael-saylors-plan-to-sell-additional-equity-for-bitcoin-investment-proves-ultra-bullish-for-btc/">Bitcoin</a> indeed soars to $100,000 or beyond by the next halving, Vikingo will owe Back one million satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Currently, the said satoshis have a market value of around $291. However, if Back&#8217;s prediction falls short, the CEO will owe Vikingo the same amount.</p>



<p>During a Twitter space discussion, Vikingo later expressed doubt about Bitcoin&#8217;s ability to exceed the $50,000 mark by year-end. </p>



<p>“<em>I don’t think we are going back to $12,000. I think we might see another chance at the bottom, so it&#8217;s $ 15,800 around there. I still believe we can shoot up now going into Christmas. We can get to like $50,000-$55,000 but we are not going higher than that and were going to go back,”</em> he said.</p>



<p>The bet generated considerable buzz on social media, with supporters and sceptics weighing in on the prospects of Bitcoin&#8217;s future value. Many were intrigued by the timing of Back&#8217;s prediction, aligning it with the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-primed-for-gargantuan-rally-ahead-of-2024-halving-says-market-analyst/">halving event</a>, which occurs approximately every four years and has historically led to significant price movements in the cryptocurrency markets.</p>



<p> The halving process reduces the reward miners receive for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. This mechanism controls the supply of new Bitcoins, theoretically contributing to price appreciation over time.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Back has made such bold predictions for Bitcoin. Back in February, the pundit <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1624844122363244544">explored</a> the &#8220;bitcoin 2x&#8217;s per year on average,&#8221; claim revealing that over the decade spanning January 2013 to December 2022, Bitcoin witnessed an annual growth of 2.036 times (a staggering 1200x increase in a decade).</p>



<p>In his view, if this trajectory persists, projections indicate that Bitcoin could surpass the remarkable milestones of $10 million per BTC and a $200 trillion market capitalization within the next two halvings, approximately over the course of nine years.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to trade sideways in recent weeks, reflecting a persistent struggle to break free from established bounds.</p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s repeated failures to surmount the $30,000-$31,000 resistance range since mid-July has now painted a picture of mounting tension between buyers and sellers as experts offer divergent predictions about the trajectory of Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>According to Michaël van de Poppe, the CEO of Amsterdam-based MN Trading Group, most bears are currently targeting a potential crash to $12,000 while bulls are debating the possibilities of a pre-halving peak reminiscent of 2019 or even new all-time highs.</p>



<p>Sharing his perspective in a Thursday tweet, Poppe dismissed the idea of a dip to $12,000, citing the current landscape and altcoin trends. According to the pundit, altcoin investors have faced a prolonged period of downward movement, with the bear market spanning over two years, making it the longest-lasting bear cycle for cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>“<em>Bitcoin pairs are on cycle lows, sentiment is on the ground, but that doesn’t mean that we’ll need to continue moving downwards from here. Bitcoin’s price is slowly crawling upwards from Bitcoin at $15K, after a period of severe attacks on the markets,</em>” wrote Poppe.</p>



<p>He further noted that the current market cycle phase could be likened to the &#8220;second stage of capitulation&#8221;, a period characterized by a seeming lack of action and potential disillusionment. According to Poppe, investors need to stay patient while this stage might appear uneventful. Just as the market once anticipated Bitcoin&#8217;s drop to $2,000 in 2019, that similar scepticism paved the way for a mega bull run.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/o8jHNp_tF88yyOZ-v_VkVN5SG-Ghqq3Ev4SjorquROFlPXDoQD5Fcu_0DA7eGFgVUEkzQxtJXTNxGGY6LzeLB-HnnKgamdemIDBUsoGgPfeYKVHlsbm1ykpEne6cOJ9Sr87xYGza9IfFn3i0BWbkwA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>While acknowledging that certain recent market challenges can be traced back to blockchain ecosystem attacks and regulatory pressures in 2022, Poppe also pointed out a noteworthy development: the concurrent involvement of established financial players such as BlackRock, Valkyrie, and Invesco. These entities have been actively venturing into the cryptocurrency realm through <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-just-shot-up-according-to-bloomberg/">proposals for ETFs</a> and creating proprietary exchanges. This concerted entry by traditional finance is anticipated to exert upward pressure on prices.</p>



<p><em>“The big institutions are jumping in, and the wisest thing you can do is to follow them</em>,” he advised.</p>



<p>BitQuant, another analyst, echoed the sentiment of a market divided between bears and bulls. According to him, while bears envision a dramatic drop to $12,000, bulls are split into two camps. One group anticipates a pre-halving peak similar to the 2019 pattern, while the other envisions new record highs for Bitcoin.</p>



<p><em>“If one (group) aligns with the notion of a 2019-like peak, it might be prudent to await a rise to $60K before persuading others to sell. This approach may not be ideal, but it would be rationale,”</em> he wrote.</p>



<p>At press time, BTC was trading just under $29,040, with its position remaining relatively unchanged in the last 24 hours and its movement confined within a narrow range of $500 for about two weeks.</p>

<p>Late Tuesday, software developer MicroStrategy filed a prospectus supplement stating intentions to sell up to $750 million worth of stock with the intention to buy more Bitcoin, among other things.</p>



<p><em>“We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and working capital, and, subject to market conditions” the filing on the SEC site read, and that MicroStrategy had “not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically for any of these purposes.”</em></p>



<p>Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, has been a very vocal proponent of Bitcoin, steadily <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-to-acquire-more-bitcoin-using-750m-stock-sale-proceeds/">increasing the company’s Bitcoin holdings</a> regardless of market conditions. Saylor firmly believes as more and more people understand the promise of BTC, the price is set to skyrocket. He has made claims in the past of Bitcoin reaching 1 million US dollars per Bitcoin. He believes that all financial value worldwide would be eventually stored in Bitcoin.</p>



<p>MicroStrategy released its Q.2 report on the same day as the filing, revealing significant developments in its Bitcoin holdings. During the quarter, the company acquired 12,800 bitcoins at an average price of $28,233 per bitcoin, totalling $361.4 million. As of July 31, 2023, their total bitcoin holdings reached 152,800 bitcoins, acquired for a total cost of $4.53 billion, with an average price of $29,672 per bitcoin.</p>



<p>Despite a 1% year-over-year decrease in Total Revenues, which amounted to $120.4 million, the company saw positive growth in some areas. Software Licenses Revenues experienced a 4% increase year-over-year, amounting to $35.4 million, while Subscription Services Revenues surged by 42% year-over-year, totalling $19.9 million.</p>



<p>In the second quarter, MicroStrategy also reported an impairment charge of $24.1 million on its bitcoin holdings, reflecting a decline in bitcoin prices compared to the price at which the bitcoins were acquired. This charge is significantly lower than the impairment charges of $917.8 million in the year-ago quarter and $18.9 million in Q1.</p>



<p>Michael Saylor, who once called Bitcoin a “bank in cyberspace”, has amassed so much of it that MicroStrategy is now one of the largest holders of the number one cryptocurrency, among other big holders like the Winklevoss twins and enigmatic Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>



<p>Bitcoin had seemingly reacted to the filing and was inching close to the $30,000 mark, touching $29,987 before retracting to $29,095 at the time of writing, according to data from CoinMarketCap, still an impressive gain of 2.3% in 24 hours.</p>

<p>The Republic of Palau and Ripple have taken a significant step toward the future of digital currency with the launch of their limited stablecoin pilot. The partnership began in 2021 and aimed to explore potential use cases for the Palau Stablecoin (PSC), linked to the U.S. Dollar, on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The XRPL is a carbon-neutral variant of a blockchain using the so-called decentralized ledger technology known for its secure and private transactions, making it an ideal platform for settling and providing liquidity to tokenized assets.</p>



<p>As per Businesswire reporting, the pilot program, which will be implemented gradually, will involve the participation of roughly 200 government workers and local business owners. Palau will use the Ripple CBDC Platform, an end-to-end solution created to assist central banks in issuing their digital currencies, as part of this regulated stablecoin trial. Thanks to the platform, Palau will also be able to control and tailor all aspects of the stablecoin&#8217;s life cycle, including distribution and transactions.</p>



<p>A stablecoin is a digital asset pegged to a commodity or currency, maintaining a stable price; in the case of PSC, it will be issued on the XRPL with a 1:1 reserve in USD. The Republic of Palau&#8217;s Ministry of Finance (MOF) will oversee the trial, closely monitor it around the clock, and remain responsible for issuing and redeeming stablecoin units.</p>



<p>Surangel S. Whipps, Jr., president of the Republic of Palau, declared his support for digitizing the local currency. He said that it would enhance financial transactions and give residents more authority.</p>



<p>He said, “We trust in Ripple’s long-standing expertise in CBDCs and blockchain technology, as well as the carbon-neutral XRP Ledger to help create our national digital currency that will offer our citizens greater financial success.”</p>



<p>The staff of the Palauan government who volunteer for the project will get an allocation of PSC for usage during the pilot during the program&#8217;s first stage. The Palau Stablecoin is expected to bring numerous benefits to citizens, merchants, and the government alike. These advantages include greater financial inclusion, reduced transaction fees for citizens, and decreased currency costs, ultimately resulting in faster transactions.</p>



<p>The controlled pilot&#8217;s Phase One must satisfy specific requirements for the PSC to succeed and win the people&#8217;s trust of Palau. The MOF must be able to create, distribute, handle incoming redemptions, and eliminate PSC while retaining complete control over its total circulation at all times on a real-time basis, 24/7. Government employees should be able to make purchases using PSC at select retailers, and these retailers should be able to safely receive, verify payments made with PSC, and convert them into funds in their local bank accounts.</p>



<p>Ripple also highlights other benefits to the trial, going beyond financial inclusion and the cost of currency and fast transactions.</p>



<p>“Palau is a Pacific Island nation comprising over 200 volcanic and coral islands, filled with unique wildlife and vegetation. Launching the Palau Stablecoin will help the island reduce their carbon footprint and vulnerability to climate change&#8217;s impacts.” James Wallis, VP of Central Bank Engagements for Ripple, said in a statement.</p>



<p>The successful implementation of Phase One will pave the way for subsequent phases of the Palau Stablecoin, which are planned to be rolled out later this year. The introduction of the PSC represents a significant advancement for Palau as it embraces the potential of blockchain technology and digital currencies, positioning itself as a pioneer in the blockchain frontier while preserving its unique natural beauty and culture as an island paradise.</p>

<p>Shannon Thorp, a renowned Wells Fargo Analyst, recently shared a bold forecast for XRP, the native digital asset of the Ripple network, on Twitter.</p>



<p>Drawing on her meticulous calculations and considering various factors, Thorp presented a conservative short-term price <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-price-to-10-by-september-market-watchers-outline-bullish-trajectory-amid-ripples-big-win/">prediction for XRP</a>, suggesting that its value could range between $100 and $500 in the near short term (the next four to seven months).</p>



<p>To arrive at this prediction, Thorp considered several key variables that could influence XRP&#8217;s future, including an analysis of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s circulation and adoption by banks, liquidity providers, and governments. By evaluating these aspects, she projected the potential liquidity strength (LS) of XRP, suggesting it could reach trillions of dollars if widely utilized across various financial institutions.</p>



<p>The pundit also took into account the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-verdict-ripple-chief-legal-officer-confident-in-another-win-should-sec-choose-to-appeal/">recent ruling</a> in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, the recent FedNow announcement, and the proposed crypto regulation bill currently under Senate consideration, which according to her, are a step in the right direction for XRP and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, she emphasized the importance of XRP&#8217;s application in messaging and settling as crucial in determining its trajectory.</p>



<p>Thorp&#8217;s prediction wasn&#8217;t solely based on charts and technical analysis; she underscored the significance of considering XRP&#8217;s potential utility and widespread adoption. According to Thorp, XRP&#8217;s rapid settlement times and low transaction fees make it a promising candidate for cross-border transactions and various other financial applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-addressing-divisions-within-the-xrp-community"><strong>Addressing Divisions within the XRP Community</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, despite the bold price prediction, Thorp expressed concerns about the XRP community’s differing approaches to predicting its future.</p>



<p><em>“In my opinion, now more than ever I see a divided XRPArmy! One side looking at only charts, taking cues from the past and trends that follow Bitcoin to draw short term price predictions. Whilst others cling to utility, believing that partnerships and the replacement of antiquated systems will drive price,”</em> she wrote. </p>



<p><em>“XRP, for those not in the know is NOT a security! Why would we continue to pretend it is and make price predictions based on “Securities” in the crypto space? This logic seems counter intuitive and holds back what the team Ripple set off to do so many years ago.”</em></p>



<p>Thorp then challenged both approaches, asserting that neither has proven fully accurate and encouraged a broader perspective to unlock the true potential of XRP.</p>



<p>That said, Thorp&#8217;s positive forecast for XRP&#8217;s future underscores the rising significance of XRP in the global financial landscape. The increasing demand for XRP from banks using it for wire transfers, coupled with the limited supply of around 50 billion out of 100 billion, is expected to drive a substantial price increase. Moreover, developments like Ripple&#8217;s recent creation of a mortgage branch on the XRP ledger add further impetus to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s upward trajectory.</p>

<p>In a bold move, Coinbase has requested the court to throw out a lawsuit lodged against it in June by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The San Francisco-based digital asset exchange said in an August 4 court filing that the SEC’s “claims must be dismissed” because “the subject matter falls outside the agency’s delegated authority.” Coinbase noted that Judge Analisa Torres’ recent decision with Ripple bolsters their argument.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-violated-due-process"><strong>“SEC Violated Due Process”</strong></h2>



<p>Lawyers representing Coinbase have filed a motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuit. They accused the SEC of exceeding its regulatory authority and engaging in regulatory overreach.</p>



<p>The regulator in June <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">slapped </a>America’s largest crypto exchange with a suit, alleging that it operated for years as an unlicensed securities exchange. The SEC even went ahead to name 13 tokens as examples of coins it believed qualified as securities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase is now arguing that none of the digital assets and services it offers are securities.“Because as a matter of law none of them [crypto assets] are, the claims must be dismissed,” reads the filing.</p>



<p>&#8220;The transactions over Coinbase’s platform and Prime are not, and do not involve, contractual undertakings to deliver future value reflecting the income, profits, or assets of a business. They are commodity sales, with the obligations on both sides discharged entirely the moment the digital token is delivered in exchange for payment,&#8221; the filing added.</p>



<p>Coinbase further said the SEC had “violated due process, abused its discretion, and abandoned its own earlier interpretations of the securities laws” in claiming certain regulatory control over the exchange. According to the crypto company, the SEC’s challenges to its staking program “fail as a matter of law.” Coinbase has asked the court to dismiss the case, arguing the SEC’s enforcement action was “punitive” and characterized an overreach in its statutory authority granted by Congress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-similarity-to-xrp-lawsuit"><strong>Similarity To XRP Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase’s motion to dismiss additionally cited last month’s verdict in the Ripple vs SEC case, indicating that the underlying facts were &#8220;substantially identical to those alleged here.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judge Torres determined that Ripple&#8217;s sales of XRP on exchanges weren&#8217;t securities transactions, but the firm’s direct sales to institutional customers were.</p>



<p>The SEC this year has amplified its crackdown on the crypto sector. This is largely due to its chairperson Gary Gensler&#8217;s assertions that most crypto platforms are selling unregistered securities to clients. Besides Coinbase, the regulator has also taken legal action against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-crackdown-on-krakens-staking-program-puts-other-players-on-notice/">Kraken</a>, and Genesis. The SEC has also gone after Tron’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/trons-trx-plummets-11-after-u-s-sec-sues-justin-sun-for-securities-violations/">Justin Sun</a>, Terraform Labs’ <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-alleging-securities-fraud/">Do Kwon</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-continues-its-regulation-by-enforcement-spree-charges-richard-heart-of-hex-with-1-billion-securities-fraud/">Richard Heart</a> under Gensler’s watch.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has announced plans to mint the remaining BONE tokens and renounce the BONE contract before the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-run-towards-0-001-shib-price-in-play-as-ethereum-to-shibarium-bridge-goes-live-in-beta/">Shibarium launch</a>.</p>



<p>The announcement, which was made in a Thursday blog, said, “<em>With the incoming launch of Shibarium, our own Layer 2 blockchain, and much more, in the next few days you will notice that we will&nbsp;mint the remaining supply of BONE and renounce the bone contract&nbsp;so that no further minting will be possible.”</em></p>



<p>Kusama further shed light on the significance of the decision, emphasising that it is necessary to kickstart the blockchain, as a substantial portion of BONE will be allocated to validators in the upcoming layer two protocol. Additionally, he noted that BONE would play a crucial role as the token delegators use to claim rewards, as the gas token for Shibarium, and for technology governance within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>As <em>ZyCrypto</em> <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">reported</a>, the highly anticipated Shibarium is set to go live after a Toronto conference in August. The platform aims to address scalability and data bottlenecks by bundling off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, thereby reducing fees and data load. Since last week, developers have been actively testing the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-primed-for-huge-price-outburst-after-shibarium-beta-bridge-goes-live-for-public-testing/">Ethereum Bridge</a>, a crucial part of the project.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s journey to decentralization has been remarkable, as the cryptocurrency rapidly rose to a top 15 position in the market, driven by the power of its community. With Shibarium&#8217;s launch, the ecosystem is poised for further growth, especially in the metaverse and gaming applications, focusing on the thriving NFT sector.</p>



<p>The testnet for Shibarium has already seen significant activity, with millions of transactions from numerous wallets, indicating high demand for the network. Further, to support projects on the new platform, the developers recently announced plans to introduce DoggyDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization governed by token holders.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu, which began as a meme coin, has transformed into a serious project with its blockchain network and DApp ecosystem. The launch of Shibarium is expected to strengthen the fundamentals of the SHIB token, adding to its appeal in the crypto market.</p>



<p>As the crypto world awaits the Shibarium launch, SHIB ecosystem tokens have shown mixed movements, reflecting excitement and uncertainty. Nonetheless, Shiba Inu&#8217;s dedication to decentralization has garnered worldwide attention and support from enthusiasts. Today, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1686152761505685504">tweet</a> how in July, a massive 3.30 trillion SHIB were withdrawn from established exchanges, amounting to about $28 million, which shows increased incentive to hold the cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>With the countdown to Shibarium&#8217;s launch underway, the Shiba Inu community has expressed high hopes that the event will significantly boost the ecosystem&#8217;s token price to $0.001.</p>

<p>According to a report by Semafor on Thursday, the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, is looking to partner with a financial data provider to create a trading hub within its app. Major financial service providers have received calls for proposals from the corporation, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. The company specifically requested suggestions relating to financial content, real-time stock data, and other valuable features.</p>



<p>The report stated that prospective bidders were requested to specify how much money they would be willing to invest in the project. However, it&#8217;s unclear if any companies have submitted any offers at this time.</p>



<p>In a post on X&#8217;s platform, its owner Elon Musk stated that he is unaware of any ongoing efforts in this particular area. While Musk himself denied claims that X is working on this, the more significant question is whether an app like this can succeed in Western countries.</p>



<p>Previous attempts by companies like Meta and Alphabet to build such apps have failed, despite having more substantial financial resources than Musk. According to Foreignpolicy, WeChat, often hailed by Musk as a blueprint for an &#8216;Everything App&#8217; for the West, is inherently Chinese, and trying to copy and force it in a different environment may prove futile.</p>



<p><em>“Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Musk said prior to buying Twitter as it was then called.</em></p>



<p>China is the largest market worldwide for mobile payments and has many otherwise unbanked people, contrary to countries like the USA, UK or Europe, where most people have bank accounts and credit cards. Another challenge for X as a payment app could be the American love for credit cards and the fierce competition among financial services providers, creating a significant obstacle.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether X is seeking outside help with the &#8216;Everything App,&#8217; Musk has long been clear about his vision for it. He said he wanted to give X users &#8220;the ability to conduct your entire financial world&#8221; with X. In this context, he changed the Twitter name to X, adding, &#8220;so we must bid adieu to the bird.&#8221;</p>



<p>And then there is the other question on the mind of many in the crypto industry, will X include crypto payments? As Real-Vision CEO Raoul Pal mentioned earlier in July that &#8220;(Elon) will use crypto to be able to make global payments for creators etc. My guess is he uses Doge.”</p>



<p>Elon Musk has been openly fond of what he refers to as the &#8220;people&#8217;s crypto&#8221; and has, on previous occasions, triggered surges in Dogecoin&#8217;s price. Since the transformation of Twitter into X, Dogecoin has experienced an impressive rally but failed to reach 1 cent. It remains to be seen if X will integrate Dogecoin or other cryptocurrencies into its new payment system.</p>

<p>Ripple, the San Francisco-based fintech company, used to publish a quarterly report called the ‘XRP Markets Report,&#8217; wherein it voluntarily disclosed its sales of XRP, among other things. However, after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">achieving a partial win</a> in the legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over whether XRP qualifies as a security, Ripple has decided to make some changes. The company accused the SEC of using the reports as weapons against them in the lawsuit.</p>



<p>In its<a href="https://ripple.com/insights/q2-2023-xrp-markets-report/"> current report</a>, presented in a different format, Ripple referred to the SEC&#8217;s approach as “Ironic for an agency that touts transparency and disclosure. Accordingly, Ripple is re-evaluating the role and contents of this report going forward […]”</p>



<p>Rather than discussing crypto sentiments and XRP sales, the current report focused on clarifying some misunderstandings about the ruling.</p>



<p>Before delving into the misconceptions, it&#8217;s essential to understand what the ruling stated, according to Ripple. XRP is not considered a security in its inherent nature. The sales of XRP by Ripple on exchanges, as well as the sales made by its executives, are also not considered securities. Additionally, other distributions of Ripple&#8217;s XRP, such as those to developers, charities, and employees, are not classified as securities. However, it should be noted that certain sales conducted by Ripple under written contracts were deemed to be investment contracts and thus fall under the category of securities.</p>



<p>Here are the 6 Misconceptions About the XRP Ruling:</p>



<p><strong>No. 1 – A split decision?</strong></p>



<p>Regarding the question of whether the decision by Judge Torres is a split decision, Ripple affirms that it has always maintained that XRP is not a security, and the Court reaffirmed this clearly. The Court&#8217;s position, according to Ripple, is that tokens themselves, as they are, are not securities, which is fundamentally a victory for the industry, not only Ripple.</p>



<p><strong>No. 2 – Is XRP a security in some situations?</strong></p>



<p>Ripple explains that the court has stated that XRP, being a digital token, does not qualify as an investment contract and, thus is not a security. However, under certain circumstances, like when combined with promises, it can be sold as an investment contract.</p>



<p>But in such cases, the fundamental nature of XRP (or any asset, like an orange grove or a gold bar) does not change to become a security. Whether something is an investment contract depends on the specific transaction, where an investment of money is made in a common enterprise, with the expectation of profits based on the efforts of the seller or a third party. The same asset can be sold in a simple buy/sell transaction or as part of an investment contract, but the distinction is crucial, and the SEC&#8217;s contrary claims have no legal basis.</p>



<p><strong>No. 3 – Because a share of a stock is always a security, XRP, too, must be one?</strong></p>



<p>This is determined case by case by looking at the actual transaction and depends on whether there is an investment contract, which is different from a share of stock, which is always a security. This is an important differentiation because the company behind the share has a fiduciary duty to the holder of the share.</p>



<p><strong>No. 4 – Does the decision only protect sophisticated investors but not retail?</strong></p>



<p>Ripple emphasizes that all investors deserve protection; the court does not deny this. It merely said that the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction ends where no security is involved. According to Ripple, investor protection is a matter of policy and must be addressed by legislators with a mandate to do so. Ripple also states that the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions have been wrong and hurt retail investors.</p>



<p><strong>No. 5 – Does the decision hurt Ripple’s business?</strong></p>



<p>This is certainly not the case, as most of Ripple’s current customers are overseas in jurisdictions that have clarified that XRP is not a security, such as Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, the UAE, and the UK.</p>



<p><strong>No. 6 – Did the court reject Ripple’s fair notice defense?</strong></p>



<p>This is only the case for Ripple’s institutional sales; fair notice defense for other transactions is still open, as the Court stated, <em>“The SEC’s theories as to the other sales in this case are potentially inconsistent with its enforcement in prior digital asset cases.”</em></p>



<p>Finally, Ripple sheds light on XRP it holds in two categories: XRP available in Ripple’s wallets and XRP locked in escrow. Between March 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023, Ripple&#8217;s XRP holdings increased from 5,506,585,918 to 5,551,119,094. Meanwhile, the total XRP subject to on-ledger escrow decreased from 42.8 billion to 41.9 billion.</p>

<p>Binance has announced the appointment of a new Deputy Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and Global Money Laundering Reporting Officer (GMLRO) at a time when the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange grapples with regulatory challenges from several law enforcement officers worldwide over compliance issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-beefs-up-compliance-team"><strong>Binance Beefs Up Compliance Team</strong></h2>



<p>Binance has named a new compliance-focused officer, Kristen Hecht.</p>



<p>Hecht, who previously held the position of Global Head of Corporate Compliance, will be deputy chief compliance and global money laundering reporting officer at Binance after joining the exchange eight months ago.</p>



<p>Hecht brings 17 years of experience in financial crime compliance. Earlier in her career, Hecht was the Senior Policy Advisor for the U.S. Department of the Treasury. She went on to become the Chief Compliance Officer at Meta’s crypto wallet project, Novi Financial.</p>



<p>“With her seasoned background, she understands the importance of collaborating with governments and international organizations that are critical to making sustainable advancements and fighting financial crime,” Binance Chief Compliance Officer Noah Perlman stated.</p>



<p>Hecht’s appointment comes after a string of top legal and compliance executives <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binances-cz-shrugs-off-news-of-senior-executive-personnel-resigning-as-attempts-to-spread-fud/">quit Binance</a> allegedly due to the strain of dealing with numerous probes into the exchange’s practices. Binance has firmly rejected these claims.</p>



<p>Now, as the Deputy CCO at Binance, Hecht will work closely with Perlman to improve the exchange&#8217;s compliance strategy.  And in the role of GMLRO, she will supervise money laundering units, helping them to identify and mitigate financial crime. Hecht intends to &#8220;proactively engage&#8221; with regulators, intergovernmental organizations, and industry bodies to help devise compliance programs. </p>



<p><em>“As an organization that is obsessed with its users and has come a long way toward building a best-in-class compliance program comparable to global financial institutions, I hope to raise further awareness with regulatory and industry partners about the crypto industry to build trust and collaborate in this fast-developing space.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-s-regulatory-issues"><strong>Binance’s Regulatory Issues</strong></h2>



<p>The Hecht appointment comes as Binance continues to be in hot waters with regulators globally, including in the United States, France, Germany, and the Netherlands.</p>



<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-ether-slump-as-cftc-sues-binance-and-cz-over-willful-violation-of-u-s-laws/">sued </a>Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao in March on allegations the company deliberately offered unregistered crypto derivatives products to U.S. investors against federal laws. Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">struck </a>the exchange and Zhao with 13 charges.</p>



<p>The United States Department of Justice is also reportedly <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/02/2023/us-prosecutors-worry-binance-charges-could-cause-run-on-exchange">contemplating charging Binance with fraud</a> but hesitating due to concerns about a potential indictment triggering a bank run on the exchange similar to what happened with Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX back in November 2022.</p>



<p>In Europe, France’s financial judicial investigation service is investigating Binance for &#8220;acts of aggravated money laundering”. The exchange has withdrawn its request for German regulatory approval and <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/notice-on-changes-of-services-in-the-netherlands-b5a647be31cf469b87fc3337fd461ced">ceased</a> its crypto operations in the Netherlands after failing to secure a regulatory nod. </p>

<p>Ripple President Monica Long has announced the company’s plans to seek market opportunities in the United States. This development follows the historic court ruling clarifying that the payment network’s token XRP does not qualify as an unregistered security in the US.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-planning-to-expand-engagement-in-u-s"><strong>Ripple Planning To Expand Engagement In U.S</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple has seemingly walked out on the threat to leave the US. Previously, the company had<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-will-leave-the-us-for-friendlier-crypto-jurisdictions-abroad-says-exec-chris-larsen/"> threatened to move away from the U.S.</a> due to the lack of clarity from regulators about XRP’s legal status.</p>



<p>Ripple might not move after all.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRQM1BSxTmk&amp;ab_channel=CNBCInternationalTV">interview </a>with <em>CNBC</em>, Ripple’s Monica Long voiced enthusiasm for the clarity the recent court ruling offers and described how it will shape Ripple&#8217;s operational strategy from now on.</p>



<p>“It’s been a couple of weeks now since the judge’s ruling in our case, providing clarity that XRP is not a security. We’re very happy about it because we now have clarity in terms of how Ripple will operate its business going forward. And we are re-engaging with the US market.”</p>



<p>In December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">slapped </a>Ripple with a $1.3 billion lawsuit, alleging that the company misled investors and was selling unregistered securities in the form of XRP.</p>



<p>But on July 13, federal district judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District Court of New York <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">declared </a>that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors did not qualify as securities.</p>



<p>Long told <em>CNBC </em>on August 2 that Ripple’s operative strategy is not solely focused on the U.S. The company has experienced considerable growth in international markets, particularly where there is clear regulatory guidance regarding digital assets.</p>



<p><em>“I think that is reflective where there is regulatory clarity, places like the UK, Europe, Singapore, Dubai, and the Middle East. That’s where we see a lot of growth potential for our business around payments,” Long posited.</em></p>



<p>In particular, Ripple’s expansion in the UK has been outstanding, with the firm mulling further investments. The size of their regional office in London has more than doubled, suggesting marked growth.</p>



<p>The Ripple President further noted that the Silicon Valley decacorn operates other pivotal offices in Singapore, Dubai, and Sao Paulo, representing their extensive customer base and global reach.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the SEC has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-verdict-ripple-chief-legal-officer-confident-in-another-win-should-sec-choose-to-appeal/">suggested </a>an appeal of Ripple&#8217;s recent courtroom victory could be coming soon.&nbsp;</p>
