<p>Lens released a beta version of its blockchain scaling solution, Bonsai, to address the concerning issue of scalability for decentralized social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>
Scaling Solutions For Web3 Social
<p>Lens Protocol, a Web3 social graph, has announced the launch of Bonsai, a new scaling solution designed to improve the user experience and facilitate mass adoption. Aave, the development firm responsible for the Lens Protocol, addressed the need to provide a seamless social media experience for its users by increasing scalability and reducing transaction costs.</p>
<p>Since shared blockchain networks can only process up to 200 transactions per second (TPS) and a major social media platform like Twitter often reaches 25,000 TPS during peak hours, it was necessary to launch a scalability solution that would help blockchain networks to up the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonsai is an Optimistic Layer-3 (or a Polygon Layer-2) scaling solution that will process transactions at hyperscale and is designed to support the next generation of social media users. The solution also enables the processing of transactions at a much lower cost, making the platform more accessible to users with different financial capabilities.</p>
First Momoka, Then Bonsai
<p>The Bonsai solution comes just days after the release of Lens Protocol's previous scaling solution, Momoka, which enabled faster and cheaper transactions on the blockchain. Momoka was the first Layer 2 scaling solution for the platform and was designed to help Lens Protocol cope with its growing user base. The follow-up release of Bonsai indicates the company's commitment to continually improving its blockchain infrastructure to meet the needs of its users.</p>
<p>According to Aave CEO and the founder of Lens Protocol, Stani Kulechov,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To be competitive with web2, decentralized social platforms must scale. With the ability to support mass consumer adoption, we'll see continued web3 innovation &mdash; new, exciting and compelling features and business models that will spur web3 adoption. Bonsai provides hyperscalability that supports blockchain's core values and guarantees, delivering secure, fast and cost-effective scalability."</p>

Aave&rsquo;s Bid For Scalability
<p>Blockchain-based social media platforms are gaining rapid popularity as they are a preferable alternative to centralized social media platforms for many users. The latter has come under scrutiny in recent years due to their subpar standards of data privacy and overall impact on society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These blockchain-based social media platforms need scalability solutions to achieve censorship resistance and unlock content monetization schemes. Bonsai can store and process transactions off-chain to optimize cost and improve scalability while also keeping the data easily accessible and verifiable. It is, therefore, a prime time for Lens Protocol and its scalability solutions to become a leading player in the blockchain-based social media space.&nbsp;</p>
