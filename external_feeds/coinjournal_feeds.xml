<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> briefly crashed to below $30k within minutes on Friday as the US Securities and Exchnage Commission (SEC) reportedly told Nasdaq and the Cboe that recently filed spot Bicoin ETFs by BlackRock, Fidelity and other Wall Street giants were &ldquo;not clear and comprehensive.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Bitcoin Cash has skyrocketed to a 14-month high above $320, hitting highs of $326 on Coinbase.</li>
<li>BCH upside momentum has increased since Wall Street-backed EDX listed the coin alongside BTC, ETH and LTC.</li>
<li>A spike in volume on South Korea exchange Upbit helped push CBH price higher on Friday.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin-cash/">Bitcoin Cash</a> rallied to its highest price in 14 months on Friday morning, trading at highs of $326 on US-based crypto exchange Coinbase.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why is BCH price rallying today?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin Cash had stagnated below $165 since dipping below the level in June last year. However, with Bitcoin rallying to above $31k amid bullish sentiment buoyed by BlackRock&rsquo;s spot ETF filing, BCH roared to a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-cash-price-hits-1-year-high-as-bch-soars-72-this-week/">one-year high</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bulls have been relentless since, with price crossing the psychological $300 mark today with more than 30% gains in 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has rallied nearly 200% over the past two weeks, and is now in the green by 110% over the past year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is notable that the price of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bch/">BCH</a> had raced to a new year high last week after EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street companies including Fidelity and Charles Schwab, listed Bitcoin Cash. EDX only lists three other coins &ndash; BTC, ETH and LTC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Enthusiasm across the BCH community from this listing has added to the upside momentum. On Friday, the positive outlook on the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s potential saw volume spike on a leading South Korea-based crypto platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As crypto markets bid to hold onto the positive sentiment, Bitcoin Cash appears to be getting some extra leg from South Korea. Over the past 24 hours, the BCH/KRW pair on crypto exchange Upbit rose to $557 million, more than thrice the volume of BTC/KRW and nearly 6x greater than BCH/USD.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Data from CoinGecko shows daily trading volume across all exchanges has increased 165% in the past 24 hours to over $2.4 billion. As IntoTheBlock <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1674432186660057092">points out</a>, BCH volume rose to above $750 million on Thursday, a one-year high.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/2 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) soars 70% in a week, riding high on its recent inclusion on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EDX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EDX</a>, the Citadel Securities-Backed Crypto Exchange.

<li>Solana rallied in 2023 but failed to break above the horizontal resistance</li>
<li>A bullish case remains valid unless the price moves below the 2022 lows</li>
<li>If it breaks above horizontal resistance, Solana may trade above $40</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Cryptocurrency investors must be thrilled with the 2023 price action. After all, Bitcoin bounced from last year&rsquo;s lows, triggering a similar move in other major cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Solana followed suit.</p>
<p>The price more than doubled this year, rising from $10 to over $25 in what appeared to be a clear bullish breakout.</p>
<p>However, after trading above $26 in January, the market failed to build on the bullish trend. Instead, a consolidation started, bringing doubts to bullish traders.</p>
<p>The best way to clear such doubts is to look at the bigger picture. As the chart below shows, it is difficult to build a bullish case while the market holds below horizontal resistance.</p>
<p>However, the 2022 lows remain in place, so one can build a bullish scenario as long as the market does not dip below those lows.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/05/30/1688128168792-a49e9d0f-ca7e-491c-b8fb-341615b6e752.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="487"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Solana chart by TradingView</a></p>
<h2>A break above horizontal resistance should trigger more gains</h2>
<p>Solana&rsquo;s price remains bearish while below horizontal resistance. However, a break above it implies more strength ahead.</p>
<p>That is especially true if the US dollar&rsquo;s weakness resumes. So far in 2023, the dollar traded with a mixed tone.</p>
<p>But as the Fed is on pause, renewed weakness will bode well for cryptocurrencies and for Solana.</p>
<p>A daily close above horizontal resistance opens the gates for a move above $40. If the Fed believes that the US inflation data follows the right path, the dollar should weaken in the year&rsquo;s second half.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul class="decimal_type">
<li>Ripple builds energy to break higher</li>
<li>A series of higher lows points to more upside</li>
<li>The bullish case is valid as long as the price holds above $0.3</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Ripple is one of the major cryptocurrencies that rallied in 2023. It opened the trading year at $0.3 and rallied all the way to $0.55.</p>
<p>But traders now wonder if the inability to move above $0.55 is a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>It may well be.</p>
<p>However, if Ripple holds above $0.33, a technical trader can build a bullish case for it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/05/30/1688125686653-40c677ee-6985-40bb-8063-ff3546997ede.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="490"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ripple chart by TradingView</a></p>
<h2>Ripple tries to break above the $0.55 resistance level</h2>
<p>Ripple tried to break above the $0.55 resistance level three times in a row. It failed every time.</p>
<p>But each rejection brought nothing but new buyers buying the dip. Moreover, the series of higher lows holds intact, suggesting that the market builds energy to break above horizontal resistance.</p>
<p>Providing the price action holds above $0.3, which proved to be horizontal support part of a possible double bottom pattern, one can build a bullish case for Ripple.</p>
<p>First, the double bottom pattern does suggest that more upside should follow a break above $0.55.</p>
<p>Second, the market built a series of higher lows, a typical structure in bullish markets.</p>
<p>Therefore, bulls may want to wait for Ripple to close above $0.55 until establishing long positions. Ripple should find little or no resistance until the $0.75 level on such a move.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer raises $421.4k in two weeks</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The token&rsquo;s P2P model in betting is attracting investors</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s value to increase in the subsequent presale phases and upon listing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Blockchain is revolutionising traditional sectors in good ways, with the latest being betting. Chancer has been the key project in this shift, focusing on new ways investors can participate in betting and earn. The primary innovative feature of Chancer is its peer-to-peer betting that allows investors to predict in markets created by themselves. Investors have shown enthusiasm for the project, buying more than $421.4k worth of Chancer tokens in the first phase of a&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=investment_opportunity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presale</u></a> that opened two weeks ago. The successful presale underlines the growing uptake of crypto, with Mastercard considering a multi-token network (MTN).</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Mastercard to make digital transactions secure and interoperable with MTN.</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Payments giant Mastercard wants to enhance digital transactions&rsquo; security, interoperability, and scalability with a Multi-Token Network (MTN) product. The company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2023/blockchain-and-digital-assets-putting-trust-at-the-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>says</u></a> MTN will enable efficient and cost-effective payments by using digital assets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MTN is also expected to enhance identity management and permissions through blockchain networks, thus building trusted business interactions. Using digital identities will also help counter fraud common in card-related transactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new product by Mastercard underlines that big players are getting into the sector, building needed trust. For a global payment network like Mastercard, it means the project will increase digital asset visibility and allow new ones to succeed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Peer-to-peer betting by Chancer. What is it?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">As the name suggests, peer-to-peer (P2P) is a betting model permitting user relations with each other. Chancer is pioneering a P2P betting where users can build their betting markets via a secure decentralised system. Users can determine what instruments, events, or situations they want to bet on and invite others (peers) into that betting market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer has the edge over the traditional betting markets in that investors are not restricted to the odds and rules common in betting platforms. They play by their rules and odds betting through Chancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the ability to create a betting market from almost anything, Chancer brings fun to betting and allows flexibility to investors. It also expands the earning opportunities for investors as they can create limitless betting markets via the P2P model.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What is the value proposition of Chancer?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer carries value in letting investors create betting markets and earn rewards on successful outcomes against peers. Investors can bet on events from football to politics and elections. But of course, Chancer is built with an investment focus rather than betting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the ways to unlock value through Chancer is by creating predictive markets. Investors get rewarded for market-making activities. It means investors are rewarded for their interests and expertise by participating in the Chancer project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The second way is through staking $CHANCER. Investors can stake the tokens for yields, thus unlocking liquidity and facilitating the platform&rsquo;s growth. Other ways to earn include token rewards for promoting Chancer to others.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Is Chancer an ideal investment?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer could be an ideal investment if you are looking for a project with huge growth potential. Betting markets are fast-growing, and the entry of Chancer offers a leeway for investors to do it differently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alongside the ability to earn through P2P betting, investors who feel locked out of the traditional markets can find Chancer ideal.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The growth of the Chancer platform could fuel an increase in the value of the token and generate enormous returns for investors. For a token of a novel project like betting, price increases for $CHANCER can be up to 1,000%.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Does buying $CHANCER on presale make sense?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Any token that is newly listed is best bought at the presale. The price level is low, and there is a potential to earn big when it is listed on exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s presale will occur in 12 stages, each with a higher price than the previous one. As such, the price is the lowest in the first phase and the most attractive.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>New York, New York, June 30th, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p>Memecoin Mooky is gearing up for its final presale phase, having raised $900,000 to date. More than just a novel crypto token, Mooky aims to support the environment through a major tree-planting campaign.</p>
<p>Mooky will be a community-driven platform whose governance lies in the hands of its token holders. While the MOOKY token draws its cues from other successful memecoins, the project has a more ambitious mandate. Mooky was conceived to increase awareness of global environmental challenges and to provide real-world solutions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://coinjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_1688110387jD2jn6a98F.jpg"></p>
<p>The project aims to raise enough funds to sustain an extensive reforestation initiative in key locations around the world. As part of its commitment to nature, Mooky has earmarked donations to charities working on sustainable environmental causes.</p>
<p>From a crypto-economic perspective, the MOOKY token features zero tax and low slippage, providing ample incentives for traders to get involved. Underpinning the project is a deep lore that aligns with Mooky&rsquo;s core goals.</p>
<p>Mooky is based on the concept of a mythical land called Pygmy. This fantastical realm has stunning landscapes, abundant vegetation, and wildlife. As settlers came to the island, they destroyed the vegetation and polluted the air. The monkeys of Pygmy decide to fight back peacefully, teaching the settlers how to respect nature and live harmoniously. Under the leadership of Mooky, they become united and restore nature.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IiPyd5VoQIg"></iframe></p>
<p>To support the project&rsquo;s development while providing greater opportunities for community participation, Mooky has created a collection of 1,000 NFTs. Each NFT is linked to a tree planted in the real world. Holders can access the Ventures Club, which grants access to exclusive rewards and events.</p>
<p>With five days left in the <a href="blank" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">$MOOKY token presale</a>, there is still ample opportunity for crypto holders to get involved and capture the upside to a project that combines memes and nature to great effect.</p>
<h3>About MOOKY</h3>
<p>MOOKY is a community-driven initiative launched in 2023 that embraces the spirit of digital innovation to make a positive impact on the environment. More than just a meme token, MOOKY represents a global community united by a common goal: to inspire change and contribute to global tree-planting efforts.</p>
<p>MOOKY also stands as a symbol of creativity in the digital space, offering unique 3D NFTs that are each linked to real-world tree-planting initiatives. These NFTs serve not only as digital collectibles but also as an entry ticket to the exclusive Mooky Ventures Club, a vibrant community of environmentally conscious enthusiasts.</p>
<p>MOOKY is more than a digital token; it&rsquo;s a movement aiming to better our environment while fostering a unique and engaging digital ecosystem. Join MOOKY in its journey to make a difference and follow the community on various social channels to stay updated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Marketing strategies play a crucial role in the success of any business, including crypto casinos. With the rising popularity of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a> and online gambling, crypto casinos face fierce competition in attracting and retaining customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To stand out in this highly competitive market, <a href="https://bet999.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin casinos</a> need to adopt effective marketing strategies. That&rsquo;s why this article will explore five marketing strategies for crypto casinos that have proven to be successful.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>1. Social media marketing</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/social-media/">Social media platforms</a> have become powerful tools for marketing in recent years. Crypto casinos can leverage the vast reach and engagement potential of platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to promote their services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, Bitcoin casinos can attract and retain a loyal following by creating engaging content, such as posts, images, and videos, and sharing relevant updates about games, promotions, and bonuses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is important to use concise and catchy captions to grab users&rsquo; attention and encourage them to take action, such as visiting the casino&rsquo;s website or signing up for an account.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, selecting the appropriate social media platforms is essential to reach the target audience effectively. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn are popular choices for promoting crypto casinos.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that each platform has its own unique features and user demographics, so it&rsquo;s essential to research and understand where the target audience is most active.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">2. Influencer partnerships</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Influencer marketing has become a dominant force in the digital realm. <a href="https://blog.bet999.io/anonymous-bitcoin-casinos/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Casinos accepting Bitcoin</a> can collaborate with popular influencers and content creators who have a substantial following in the gambling or cryptocurrency niche.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These influencers can endorse the casino&rsquo;s services through sponsored posts, videos, or live streams, reaching a wider audience and generating interest in the platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Short, punchy messages from influencers can create a sense of trust and credibility among their followers, leading to increased brand awareness and potential conversions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is crucial to find influencers with a significant following in the cryptocurrency, blockchain, or online gambling niches.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Look for influencers whose audience aligns with the target market of the crypto casino. Research their engagement rates, audience demographics, and the overall quality of their content to ensure they are a good fit for the brand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Influencer marketing works best when the partnership appears authentic and genuine. It&rsquo;s important to choose influencers genuinely interested in cryptocurrencies or online gambling with a history of providing valuable content to their followers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This helps establish trust and credibility among their audience, making them more receptive to the endorsement of the crypto casino.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">3. Referral programs</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Word-of-mouth marketing remains one of the most powerful and cost-effective strategies for businesses. By implementing referral programs, crypto casinos can encourage existing customers to refer their friends and family to the platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By keeping the referral process simple and rewarding, crypto casinos can tap into the power of social networks as satisfied customers spread the word about their positive experiences. Short and clear instructions regarding the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-referral-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">referral process</a> can increase participation and make it easier for users to take action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To encourage users to refer their friends and family to the crypto casino, it is essential to offer attractive incentives. Consider offering rewards such as bonus funds, free spins, or exclusive promotions to both the referrer and the referred individual.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These incentives provide a tangible benefit that motivates users to participate in the referral program.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">4. Email marketing</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the rise of social media, email marketing continues to be a valuable tool for engaging with customers. Crypto casinos can build an email list by offering incentives, such as exclusive promotions or freebies, to visitors who subscribe to their newsletters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once they have a list of subscribers, casinos can send regular emails with updates on new games, upcoming events, and special offers. Using short and impactful subject lines can grab recipients&rsquo; attention and entice them to open the emails.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, personalization and segmentation techniques can be employed to tailor the content to the interests and preferences of each subscriber.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Start by building an email list of interested subscribers. Offer incentives, such as exclusive promotions, free spins, or bonus funds, to encourage visitors to sign up for the casino&rsquo;s newsletter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Place subscription forms prominently on the website and landing pages, and communicate the value subscribers will receive by joining the list. Keep the signup process simple and straightforward, asking for only essential information like name and email address.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">5. Content marketing</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Creating and sharing valuable content is an effective way to establish a crypto casino as an authority in the industry and attract organic traffic. By publishing informative blog posts, guides, or videos related to cryptocurrencies, online gambling strategies, and casino reviews, crypto casinos can provide value to their target audience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Short, concise paragraphs and bullet points can make the content easy to read and digest. By optimizing the content for search engines, using relevant keywords, and promoting it on social media platforms and forums, crypto casinos can increase their visibility and drive traffic to their website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before creating content, it&rsquo;s essential to understand your target audience&rsquo;s preferences, interests, and pain points. Research the demographics, behaviors, and motivations of your ideal players. This knowledge will help you create content that resonates with them and addresses their needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can also optimize your content for search engines to improve its visibility and reach. Conduct keyword research to identify relevant terms and phrases your target audience searches for.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Incorporate these <a href="https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/keywords" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keywords</a> into your content, including titles, headings, and meta descriptions. Short and compelling meta descriptions can entice users to click on your content in search engine results.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Use social media in your favor</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In conclusion, the success of a crypto casino heavily relies on effective marketing strategies. By leveraging the power of social media marketing, influencer partnerships, referral programs, email marketing, and content marketing, crypto casinos can attract and retain customers in a highly competitive market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you keep your sentences short and impactful, these strategies are more likely to effectively convey the key messages and entice users to take action. This will ultimately lead to the growth and success of the crypto casino.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">CHANCER presale has hit $421k days after launch to demonstrate the huge demand among investors.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The predictive markets platform is expected to go live later this year, with experts noting its potential to change the global betting industry.</li>
<li dir="ltr">For investors, buying $CHANCER at the current price of $0.01 offers could be a great opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">With the broader <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/category/markets/">crypto market</a> looking for a foothold amid predictions of a bullish flip, Chancer&rsquo;s presale has notched past the $420k mark to highlight the overall market sentiment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More aptly, the blockchain-based predictive markets platform has seen over 42.1 million of its $CHANCER tokens sold out just days into its recently launched presale event. Could Chancer offer that new opportunity that investors are hunting for ahead of the next bull cycle? &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Early birds can find out more<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal">&nbsp;<u>here</u></a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bear markets are for building &ndash; and investing</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> price staying above the $30k level and looking likely to target the next resistance at $34k is a great encouragement for bulls. The same can be said of Ethereum, which has moved closer to regaining the $2k level in recent weeks amid the spot ETF-driven bullish momentum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the broader acknowledgement is that the market hasn&rsquo;t completely turned the corner from the 2022 bear cycle. Yet this in itself is an opportunity for projects and to a larger extent investors, with bear markets seen as the time to build, or BUIDL as compared to the common <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/the-power-of-hodl/">HODL</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Projects that build during market downturns often have the ample time to focus on product development, taking into account roadmap goals to deliver. And for investors, the bear market often accords the opportunity to buy low and position oneself for potential windfall when the bulls come charging.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Could Chancer be one of the projects? Highly likely as the team leverages the pre-bull market phase to bring to market a potentially industry-disruptive platform.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Chancer?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer</u></a> is a blockchain-based predictive markets platform that aims to become the global destination for decentralised betting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leveraging the blockchain technology and a crypto token will bring the benefits of a truly decentralised market, with holders of the native $CHANCER participating in future developments via a governance structure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As for how Chancer works, the key is in its removal of the power of the bookmaker. Instead of the centralised control that sees bookmakers decide which markets and odds to offer to bettors, Chancer takes that power and hands it to $CHANCER holders.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Chancer you don&rsquo;t suffer the restrictions of traditional betting platforms &ndash; its &ldquo;your game, your rules, your odds.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In short, participants create their own prediction events, set the odds and rules. As a peer-to-peer (P2P) betting platform, you can invite family and friends. What&rsquo;s more there is a feature that allows users to broadcast their markets to more participants across the world, increasing the predictions and prizes.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why would investing in Chancer today be worth it?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The global betting industry is a massive market, with<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/sports-betting-market-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>estimates</u></a> for the next five years projecting a 10% compound annual growth rate. The adoption of blockchain technology across the sector is rising, with Chancer offering the most revolutionary platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While it would be unreasonable to predict $CHANCER to the moon now, the anticipation building around the project is massive. And with the token price currently only $0.01, buying now might be the best opportunity to maximise on the potential gains if fresh market demand catapults it to $1 or higher in 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As noted, the wider sentiment is that a bull market is slowly gathering pace. If Chancer rolls into the market via the scheduled exchange listings after the presale, and the platform launch happens as expected, then a pop to new highs in 2025 would be highly likely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you bought $CHANCER today, 100% gains would be locked in when the token jumps to $0.021 at the end of the presale later in the quarter.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Can you earn passive income with Chancer?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">An opportunity to earn passive income on the investment is one of the key features investors will fancy $CHANCER for. &nbsp;Other than the anticipated gains on the value of the token as future demand pushes prices higher, holders can also earn passively through staking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One can run validator nodes to support the network transaction processing and security and earn a reward from it. Node operators will earn 50% of the reward while those staking with the particular node will get the other 50%. Other than staking $CHANCER, users can earn from the Share2Earn program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You can learn more about Chancer on their <a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">North Carolina seeks to add BTC to treasury</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The &ldquo;<em>State Precious Metals Depository Study</em>&rdquo; bill outlines the custody, insurance and liquidation of crypto assets held by the state. It passed 75-38 with bipartisan support and will now be debated in the Senate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If passed, it will open the path for BTC and gold to be considered as assets that can be added to North Carolina&rsquo;s funds. Specifically, the house&rsquo;s approval puts North Carolina one step towards adding Bitcoin to the state&rsquo;s holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>This is a very important step to a more formal acknowledgement of #bitcoin in North Carolina. Lots of behind the scenes work</em>,&rdquo; said Dan Spuller, Head of Industry Affairs at Blockchain Association.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spuller noted that the passage of <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/H721" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HB721</a> marks the second time a bill pushed by the North Carolina Blockchain Initiative has received bipartisan support in the General Assembly in 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In early May, the house unanimously passed HB690, a bill that banned the use of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/cbdcs/">central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)</a> in payments in the state. The bill also bans North Carolina from participating in any testing of CBDC.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The state of CBDCs globally</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A recent survey<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/study-shows-130-countries-exploring-central-bank-digital-currencies-2023-06-28/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>showed</u></a> that 130 countries around the world were in various stages of development towards a central bank issued digital currency.
