<p>A California-based cannabis seed bank has turned to blockchain technology and smart contracts to verify the efficacy of its medicinal plants. </p>
<p>Mendocino Clone Company (MCC), a cannabis nursery, has turned to blockchain technology and smart contracts to verify the authenticity of the therapeutic plants they sell. Through blockchain, the company will be able to certify all baby plants, also referred to as clones, with a batch certificate. Mendocino entered a partnership with the EMTRI project, a decentralised cannabis supply chain community, and technology firm Global Compliance Applications to make the project possible.</p>
<p>Cannabis nurseries, or seed banks, are organizations that focus on plant genetics and produce clones, baby plants, and seeds for wholesale distribution. According to a blog post by Global Compliance:</p>

<p>This innovative move allows the nursery to document the beginning stages of a cannabis plant's journey to becoming a premium product for consumers based on the gram weight it flowers.</p>

<p>Jed Davis, CEO of MCC said:</p>

<p>At Mendocino Clone Company, we are always looking for ways to innovate and improve the quality of our products. We believe that by joining the EMTRI decentralized community, we can provide an additional level of transparency and trust for our customers.</p>

<p>The batch certificate is a self-generated smart contract for clone batch and provides each baby plant with its own &ldquo;unique identity block,&rdquo; which is created by the nursery and linked to its Ethereum-based blockchain according to reports by Cointelegraph. The nursery&rsquo;s clients which include commercial farms and retail dispensaries can then use the batch certificates to verify the authenticity of their clones and their genetic lineage.</p>
