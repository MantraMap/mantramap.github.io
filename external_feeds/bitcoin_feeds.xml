<h2>G20 Nations Discuss Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>The G20 finance and central bank deputies met for the first time under India&#8217;s presidency on Dec. 13-15 in Bengaluru.</p>
<p>Ajay Seth, India&#8217;s economic affairs secretary, said at a news conference Wednesday that the G20 nations aim to build a policy consensus on crypto assets for better global regulation. Noting that the implications of crypto assets for the economy, monetary policy, and the banking sector should be studied for the creation of the consensus, Seth was quoted by Reuters as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The regulation should flow from the policy view taken. In fact, one of the priorities which have been put on the table is to help countries build a consensus for policy approach to crypto assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The collapse of crypto exchange FTX has led to calls for better oversight of the crypto market. FTX filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. on Nov. 11 and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">arrested</a> this week. The U.S. government and regulators have brought several <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">fraud charges</a> against FTX and Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>The members of the Group of 20 (G20) are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the U.K., the U.S., and the European Union. The group represents around 85% of the world&#8217;s GDP.</p>

<h2>IMF&#8217;s Gita Gopinath on Globally Agreed Crypto Standards</h2>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF)&#8217;s deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, said Thursday that the G20 under India&#8217;s presidency can make progress in three areas: debt management, crypto regulation, and climate finance. Gopinath is currently in India to attend G20 meetings.</p>
<p>She explained that globally agreed norms are needed for crypto regulations, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>After the crypto meltdown which we have seen recently, it is clear that we need internationally agreed standards on regulation. Progress on that front being able to accomplish that by 2023 would be a concrete outcome.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seth also said Wednesday that one of the key agendas that the G20 will discuss is the global usage of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). India&#8217;s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has started both <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-central-bank-rbi-begins-first-digital-rupee-pilot-today/">wholesale</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rbi-begins-first-retail-digital-rupee-pilot-in-13-indian-cities-with-8-banks/">retail</a> digital rupee pilots.</p>

<h2>Jim Cramer Slams Binance</h2>
<p>The host of CNBC&#x2019;s Mad Money show, Jim Cramer, cast doubt on the trustworthiness of cryptocurrency exchange Binance in a series of tweets this week. Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who co-founded Thestreet.com, a financial news and literacy website. He tweeted Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why are there no strategists who say that most crypto are worthless so sell them? Why can&#x2019;t people in charge just admit that Binance has no real legitimacy after what happened to FTX?</p></blockquote>
<p>The crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 11, and an estimated one million customers and investors lost billions of dollars from its collapse. Bankman-Fried has been arrested in the Bahamas and the U.S. government and several regulators have brought fraud charges against SBF and the crypto exchange.</p>
<p>The Mad Money host also compared Binance to the fantasy sports betting platform Draftkings, which is banned as illegal gambling in <a href="https://help.draftkings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405224384147-What-countries-permit-entries-into-paid-DraftKings-Daily-Fantasy-Sports-contests-">many countries</a> and <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/draftkings-legal-states">U.S. states</a>. Cramer tweeted:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would trust my money more in Draftkings than I would Binance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Only two days prior, Cramer cryptically asked his Twitter followers: &#x201C;Do you feel as reassured by Binance as I do?&#x201D; Many users on the social media platform responded to the Mad Money host, taunting that whatever company Cramer is against is likely to be a good buy.</p>
<p>Bitcoin developer and podcaster Matt Odell commented on Cramer&#x2019;s Draftkings comparison: &#x201C;I do not have to trust either company. Unlike you, I hold my wealth myself without trust. It is called bitcoin. Binance. Draftkings. Chase Bank. All require trust. As trust erodes throughout our institutions, the value prop of trust minimized money will become obvious to many.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Cramer said on CNBC Thursday: &#x201C;I think you should be negative on crypto. I&#x2019;m negative on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, and DOGE because I haven&#x2019;t been able to find anyone that takes them &#x2026; It&#x2019;s like $80 billion worth of non-Bitcoin that&#x2019;s destined to be wiped out.&#x201D; Last week, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-moneys-jim-cramer-advises-investors-to-get-out-of-crypto-says-its-never-too-late-to-sell/">advised</a> investors to get out of crypto, emphasizing that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s never to too late to sell an awful position.&#x201D; Following the FTX meltdown, Cramer <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jim-cramer-calls-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried-a-pathological-liar-conman-and-clueless-idiot/">called</a> Bankman-Fried a pathological liar, a conman, and a clueless idiot.</p>
<p>The Mad Money host <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-money-jim-cramer-buys-bitcoin-strategy-to-increase-holdings/" target="_self" rel="noopener">used to invest</a> in bitcoin, ether, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jim-cramer-dumps-bitcoin-china-mining-crackdown-ransomware/" target="_self" rel="noopener">sold</a> all his crypto holdings last year. &#x201C;I told you I sold my bitcoin and ethereum a long time ago &#x2026; and used the proceeds to buy a very nice farm,&#x201D; he recently shared. Cramer has been advising investors to avoid <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-moneys-jim-cramer-recommends-avoiding-crypto-other-speculative-investments/" target="_self" rel="noopener">investing in speculative assets</a>, including crypto, while the Federal Reserve continues to tighten the economy.</p>

<h2>Separating Illegal Actions From &#8216;Perfectly Lawful and Innovative Cryptocurrencies&#8217;</h2>
<p>U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) explained in his opening statement at the Senate Banking Committee hearing Wednesday that the collapse of crypto exchange FTX is not an indictment against cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was unauthorized lending of customer assets to an affiliated entity, and there were fraudulent promises to investors and customers about FTX&#8217;s operations. These are outrageous and completely unacceptable,&#8221; the senator described, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to underscore a bigger issue here: The wrongful behavior that occurred here is not specific to the underlying asset. What appears to have happened here is a complete breakdown in the handling of those assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In our discussion of FTX today, I hope we are able to separate potentially illegal actions from perfectly lawful and innovative cryptocurrencies,&#8221; he told the Senate committee.</p>
<p>Noting that cryptocurrencies &#8220;are actually software,&#8221; Senator Toomey explained: &#8220;What we should all understand here is one simple thing: The code committed no crime. FTX and cryptocurrencies are not the same thing. FTX was opaque, centralized, and dishonest. Cryptocurrencies are open-source, decentralized, and transparent.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Should the FTX Fallout Justify Banning or &#8216;Pausing&#8217; Crypto?</h2>
<p>The senator from Pennsylvania proceeded to address suggestions that crypto should be banned following the FTX meltdown.</p>
<p>&#8220;To those who think that this episode justifies banning crypto, I&#8217;d ask you to think about several examples,&#8221; he began. &#8220;The 2008 financial crisis involved the misuse of products related to mortgages. Did we decide to ban mortgages? Of course not. A commodity brokerage firm run by former New Jersey Senator John Corzine collapsed after customer funds — including U.S. dollars — were misappropriated to fill a shortfall from the firm&#8217;s trading losses. Nobody suggested that the problem was the U.S. dollar and that we should ban it.&#8221; Senator Toomey stressed: &#8220;With FTX, the problem is not the instruments that were used. The problem was the misuse of customer funds, gross mismanagement, and likely illegal behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawmaker continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of my colleagues have suggested pausing cryptocurrencies before we can address it. This is profoundly misguided, not to mention impossible. Short of enacting draconian, authoritarian policies, cryptocurrency cannot be stopped. If we tried, the technology would simply migrate offshore.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Are we going to decide to pause our Constitution to stop crypto? This is exactly the kind of mindset that has driven this activity to the dark and less regulated parts of the world,&#8221; he further opined.</p>

<h2>Should Congress Refrain From Regulating Crypto?</h2>
<p>Moreover, the lawmaker said: &#8220;Others have suggested we refrain from addressing cryptocurrency at all, so as to not legitimize its use. This is not only misguided, it&#8217;s irresponsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The senator detailed: &#8220;Individuals can also be tremendously empowered when they use cryptocurrencies. They can protect against inflation when governments irresponsibly manage their own currencies. They can provide useful services without the need for a company or middleman. And they can let individuals preserve the freedom to transact privately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toomey also tweeted Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The collapse of FTX is not an indictment of crypto. It&#8217;s an indictment of those who misused customer assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As I&#8217;ve said for months, Congress needs to give regulatory clarity so business flows to prudent, sensible, well-regulated American crypto exchanges,&#8221; he added.</p>

Bankman-Fried has spent close to five days in the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services (BDOCS) jail Fox Hill, an overcrowded prison known for being filthy and one that has been accused of prison maltreatment.</strong></p>
<h2>Reuters Source Says SBF Won&#8217;t Fight U.S. Extradition Request on Monday</h2>
<p>On Dec. 17, 2022, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/sam-bankman-fried-reverse-decision-contesting-extradition-source-2022-12-17/">reported</a> that “a person familiar with the matter said on Saturday” that Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) plans to be more accepting of being extradited to the United States. The source noted that SBF will “reverse his decision to contest extradition” when he appears in court on Monday. The former FTX CEO was supposed to remain at Fox Hill until Feb. 8, 2023, after judge Ferguson-Pratt denied SBF’s request to be released on bail.</p>
<p>The news concerning SBF follows the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamas-corrections-commissioner-says-ftx-co-founder-bankman-fried-is-in-good-spirits-in-the-prison-sick-bay/">stories</a> that noted the former FTX executive was residing in Fox Hill’s sick bay dormitory style with five other inmates. The acting commissioner of The Bahamas Corrections, Doan Cleare, said that SBF was getting his meds and that he was in “good spirits.” Reports had shown that Fox Hill’s reputation for being clean and orderly is quite <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-bankman-fried-bahamian-prison-harsh-conditions-2022-12?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com">subpar,</a> according to a <a href="http://understaff/">myriad</a> of human rights <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/es/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/amr140042003en.pdf">reports</a>.</p>
<p>Reuters further detailed that SBF made a “new bail application before The Bahamas Supreme Court on Thursday,” according to another source familiar with the matter. SBF was arrested on Dec. 12, 2022, and he was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-co-founder-indicted-by-federal-grand-jury-in-manhattan-bahamian-magistrate-denies-sbfs-bail/">charged</a> with a number of financial fraud and conspiracy charges by the Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutor Damian Williams. SBF is also being <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-follows-sec-by-filing-a-lawsuit-against-disgraced-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried/">sued</a> by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and he was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">charged</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for fraud as well.</p>
<p>The Bahamas attorney general, Ryan Pinder, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">told the press</a> after SBF was arrested that the country was cooperating with the U.S. and that SBF would likely be extradited. SBF’s parents are reportedly staying in the Bahamas, and they have allegedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/14/sam-bankman-frieds-ex-caroline-ellison-likely-works-with-feds/">tried</a> to get their son vegan foods. The day SBF’s parents attended the first hearing a report claimed SBF’s mother allegedly laughed out loud every time her son was called a “fugitive.” If SBF is to be extradited, there’s a good chance he could go to a prison located in New York and would likely be kept in PC (protective custody).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, no other FTX executives have been charged and the world is wondering where FTX co-founder Gary Wang is located or the ex-Alameda Research CEO <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-suggest-caroline-ellison-is-working-with-feds-and-snitching-on-ftx-co-founder-bankman-fried/">Caroline Ellison</a>. Two days ago, it was discovered that FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/court-documents-say-ftx-boss-ryan-salame-snitched-on-sbf-2-days-before-the-bankruptcy-filing/">reportedly snitched</a> on SBF a couple of days before the company filed for bankruptcy protection. The <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/kxfZltq/unsealed-indictment-in-us-v-bankman-fried-22-cr-673-abrams-as-sam-bankman-fried-of-ftx-heads-to-sdny-echoes-of-onecoin-and-un-bribery-cases-pdf">unsealed indictment</a> only names Sam Bankman-Fried and his nickname SBF, while it also mentions others known and unknown who knowingly devised a scheme to defraud people.</p>

The integration allows Metamask wallet users to purchase ethereum via Paypal from within the Web3 wallet application.</strong></p>
<h2>Consensys Teams up With Payments Giant Paypal</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://consensys.net">Consensys</a>, Metamask users can now purchase ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) using the payment provider Paypal. The financial technology company Paypal started <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypals-venmo-launches-crypto-trading-70-million-users-buy-sell-cryptocurrencies/">offering</a> cryptocurrency services in 2021 and the company&#x2019;s CEO <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-ceo-demand-for-cryptocurrencies-multiple-fold-initial-expectations/">detailed</a> that demand for crypto outstripped initial expectations.</p>
<p>The Ethereum software firm Consensys <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/consensys-teams-with-paypal-for-a-new-way-to-buy-crypto-in-metamask/">explained</a> Wednesday it has teamed up with Paypal, and the team further detailed that &#x201C;Metamask will be the first Web3 wallet to leverage PayPal to drive more successful on-ramp transactions.&#x201D; Essentially, the partnership will allow users to utilize their Paypal account to purchase ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) after the Metamask owner logs into the Paypal platform via the wallet.</p>
<p>Consensys&#x2019; blog post adds that the Paypal integration with Metamask is just one of the &#x201C;series of announcements&#x201D; that will be associated with the Metamask mobile wallet. &#x201C;This integration with Paypal will allow our U.S. users to not just buy crypto seamlessly through Metamask, but also to easily explore the Web3 ecosystem,&#x201D; the product manager for Metamask, Lorenzo Santos said.</p>

<p>The partnership announcement follows the controversial Consensys <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereum-software-company-consensys-collects-user-data-privacy-policy-discloses/">privacy policy news</a> that details the company collects specific data from Metamask users. Paypal has also been dealing with controversy in recent times after the company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-paypal-policy-lets-firm-fine-users-2500-for-spreading-misinformation-tos-condemned-and-called-an-abomination/">erroneously published</a> a terms of service (ToS) document that said people who spread disinformation would be fined $2,500. However, Paypal claimed the ToS &#x201C;notice recently went out in error that included incorrect information.&#x201D;</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-564534 size-full" title="TVL in Defi Slides Under $40 Billion, Tapping a Low Not Seen Since February 2021" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/llama.jpg" alt="TVL in Defi Slides Under $40 Billion, Tapping a Low Not Seen Since February 2021" width="1280" height="500" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/llama-300x117.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/llama-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/llama-768x300.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/llama.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>With the aggregate locked in defi today at $39.53 billion, statistics show that Makerdao commands the largest TVL this weekend and dominates by 14.91%. Makerdao&#x2019;s TVL is around $5.89 billion and during the last week, it has shed 6.88% in value. In terms of value-locked data, Makerdao&#x2019;s TVL is followed by Lido, Curve, Aave, and Uniswap respectively.</p>
<p>Most of the value locked today is held on Ethereum as there&#x2019;s $23.06 billion in value locked in ETH-based defi apps, which represents 58.33% of the aggregate locked. Ethereum&#x2019;s TVL is followed by Tron, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Fantome, Cronos, and Solana.</p>

<p>The entire lot of smart contract protocol tokens today has lost 7.5% in value against the U.S. dollar, equating to a total of $240 billion. Out of the top ten smart contract protocol tokens, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> saw the largest weekly decline as it has lost 17.6% during the past seven days. Ethereum Classic (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETC" target="_blank">ETC</a>) suffered a loss of 16.3% during the past week and Tron suffered the least with a 2.2% loss over the last seven days.</p>

While reports disclosed that Gemini&#x2019;s leak was approximately &#x201C;5,701,649 lines of information pertaining to Gemini customers,&#x201D; Gemini did not disclose how many customers were affected by the breach. Moreover, according to Bleeping Computer&#x2019;s cybersecurity author, Ionut Ilascu, data from Gemini&#x2019;s customer info leak has been advertised for sale on hacker forums as early as Sept. 2022. </strong></p>
<h2>Gemini Customer Data Leak Discovered on Multiple Hacker Forums</h2>
<p>Three days ago, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-crypto-exchange-gemini-suffers-from-data-breach-5-7-million-emails-allegedly-leaked/">reported</a> on the crypto exchange Gemini after it was discovered that a database that contains phone numbers and email addresses of 5.7 million Gemini users was leaked. The crypto reporter Zhiyuan Sun detailed that he witnessed documentation that had shown &#x201C;5,701,649 lines of information pertaining to Gemini customers.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Gemini <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-from-phishing-campaigns">addressed</a> the issue on Dec. 14, 2022, in a blog post and it explained that the breach likely derived from a third-party vendor. The exchange did not explain how many customer accounts were affected and Gemini did not detail which third-party vendor was responsible for the data breach. The following day, after Gemini&#x2019;s blog post published, Bleeping Computer&#x2019;s cybersecurity author, Ionut Ilascu, published an article that explained Gemini&#x2019;s leaked database has been advertised for sale since Sept. 2022.</p>

<p>Ilascu says there were &#x201C;multiple posts on a hacker forum&#x201D; that had shown the leak was for sale, with one discovered by the cybercrime intelligence platform <a href="https://ke-la.com/products/">Kela</a>. One user attempted to sell the leak for 30 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or roughly $500K using today&#x2019;s bitcoin exchange rates. Ilascu further disclosed that the data leak also showed up on hacker forums in Oct. 2022, when the seller leveraged &#x201C;a different alias.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Another person shared the info in mid-November on a hacker site and this particular post said that not only did the leak contain Gemini data, but allegedly other exchanges were included. The post published on Breachforums also offered the database for free before the account was banned from the forum. The now-banned user also told forum users that three digits from the sets of customer phone numbers were missing from the database leak.</p>

The move saw the token drop for a third straight session, as a red wave swept through cryptocurrency markets. Binance coin also moved lower, dropping for a seventh consecutive day.</strong></p>
<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>) moved to a fresh all-time low to start the weekend, as prices dropped for a third straight session.</p>
<p>Following a high of $0.3011 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD moved to a low of $0.2603 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move saw the token plunge by nearly 13% earlier in the day, hitting a new all-time low in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the drop comes as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>This signals a shift in price momentum, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) fell deeper into oversold territory.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 24.13, which is its weakest point since October 21.</p>

<h2>Binance Coin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>)</h2>
<p>Binance coin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>) was another notable token to fall today, with prices dropping for a seventh straight session.</p>
<p>Recent declines have come as financial firm Mazars halted its audit of Binance&#x2019;s reserves.</p>
<p>As a result of this, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>/USD fell to a low of $221.00, which comes a day after hitting a high of $264.25.</p>

<p>Overall, the token is now down by nearly 20% in the last week, and is down 10.88% as of writing.</p>
<p>Similar to cardano, the RSI on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> is currently trading near the 24.00 mark, which is deep in oversold territory.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> is currently trading at its lowest point since July 13.</p>

This decline comes as market sentiment remained bearish following a big week of economic data. Bitcoin also extended recent declines, as traders remained nervous following news that financial auditor Mazars paused all work for crypto clients.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) extended recent declines on Saturday, as markets continued to be nervous following recent uncertainty surrounding Binance&#x2019;s proof-of-reserves audit.</p>
<p>The auditor in charge of the diligence, Mazars, opted to pause all of its work with crypto clients earlier this week, leading to a resurgence of bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>As a result of this news, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell for a third straight session, hitting a low of $16,584.70 to start the weekend.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> fell below a key support point of $16,700, hitting its lowest point since November 30 in the process.</p>
<p>Prices have since rebounded, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) bounced from a floor of 42.20, and is currently tracking at 43.52.</p>
<p>The index now seems to be moving towards a ceiling of 45.00, which if hit, could see bitcoin reenter the $17,000 mark.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also remained in the red during today&#x2019;s trading session, as prices moved below the $1,200 mark.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,278.16 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD fell to an intraday low of $1,162.18 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, today&#x2019;s decline sees <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> continue to trade close to a five-week low ($1,150), with the RSI also tracking near a multi-week bottom.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, the index has bounced from a floor of 40.20, and is currently at the 41.11 level.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the 10-day (red) moving average is now nearing a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Should this crossover take shape, we could see ethereum fall to a long-term floor of $1,085.</p>

Inamedinova, a Web3 marketing expert, has said. Besides just trying to convince backers and investors, Inamedinova said Web3 players have the more formidable task of convincing regulators.</strong></p>
<h2>Security and Reliability Issues Resurface</h2>
<p>After initially starting the year focused on community management and the public’s perception, the fallout from FTX’s collapse caused many Web3 brands and projects to switch to arguing for their legitimacy and reputation, Web3 marketing agency founder Laura K. Inamedinova has said. She added that even in cases where there is no direct connection with FTX, Web3 entrepreneurs now feel compelled to address concerns about the security and reliability of their projects.</p>
<p>In addition to their attempts to assuage the fears of nervous investors and backers, Inamedinova, the Founder &amp; CEO of <a href="https://lkiconsulting.io/">LKI Consulting</a>, said Web3 players have an even more formidable task of convincing regulators. She added that this also applies to projects backed by traditional brands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even for perfectly legitimate businesses and projects, this has been a huge blow to their reputation. Following the FTX fallout, we can expect a new round of global regulations and more attention to security and projects’ credibility than ever before,&#8221; Inamedinova said.</p>
<p>For large corporations like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/starbucks-leverages-polygon-for-web3-push-coffeehouse-chain-to-issue-nft-stamps/">Starbucks</a> or <a href="https://www.complex.com/sneakers/nike-dot-swoosh-metaverse-nft">Nike</a>, which only recently kickstarted their metaverse projects, the collapse of FTX has rekindled trust issues that took years to overcome. According to Inamedinova, events in the past few months mean it will likely require more time and resources &#8220;to prove to mass audiences that blockchain can be trusted.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>The Disastrous Handling of FTX&#8217;s Collapse</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, when asked about Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and others’ roles in handling the crisis from a public relations perspective, Inamedinova told Bitcoin.com News that the whole episode has been a disaster, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>From the initial crash to his series of badly phrased tweets to everything after, it was a disaster from beginning to end.</p></blockquote>
<p>Concerning SBF’s trial and the court outcome’s likely long-term impact on the crypto and blockchain industry, the PR expert suggested that a lot will likely &#8220;depend on how the actual prosecution is going to play out and appear in the media.&#8221; She said if the process is carried out properly the &#8220;verdict will be fair.&#8221; However, there is a possibility that the process &#8220;will be dragged out.&#8221;</p>
<p>To traditional brands trying to navigate away from the crisis, Inamedinova said they should implement &#8220;maximum transparency in their Web3 projects.&#8221; Doing this is especially important now when the lack of oversight and regulation can result in losses that run into billions of dollars, Inamedinova added.</p>
