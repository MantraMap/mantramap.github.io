<p>The landscape of crypto exchanges was anything but calm, as revealed by TokenInsight's Q2 2023 Crypto Exchange Report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, kept its cool around the $30,000 mark, the world of crypto exchanges was buzzing like a beehive.&nbsp;</p>
Big four exchanges still dominate
<p>The Q2 2023 Crypto Exchange Report from TokenInsight gives a peek into this hive. The top 10 exchanges saw a trading volume of $8.3 trillion in Q2, which is a 23% slide down the hill from the previous quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite this downhill ride, the big four - Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Bitget - held their ground, accounting for a hefty 85% of the total market. Even with a 3% dip in market share, Binance still holds sway with over 50% of the total trading volume.&nbsp;</p>
Binance still commands the market
<p>The report also highlighted shifts in market share. Binance saw a slight decrease in its dominance, but it still held a commanding lead with over half the market share. Meanwhile, exchanges like OKX, Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, and Huobi saw their market shares rise. On the flip side, Upbit and Coinbase saw a slight dip.&nbsp;</p>
Spot trading

Binance continued its dominance of the spot market, with a 55.33% market share. Bitget and Bybit made significant strides, increasing their market shares, while Upbit took a hit due to regulatory changes in South Korea.&nbsp;</p>
Derivatives
<p>The derivatives market held up a bit better, with a 14.6% decrease from Q1 and a 50.7% decrease from Q2 2022. Binance kept hold of a large part of the derivatives niche with a 54% market share, followed by OKX with 18%.&nbsp;</p>
