<li>Celsius could return &nbsp;customer assets by the end of the year after parties resollved two key bankruptcy issues.</li>
<li>CEL price rose more than 12% to $0.18 before paring gains.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The price of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/celsius/">Celsius Network</a> token CEL was up by more than 12% on Saturday afternoon to rank among the top gainers on the day as Bitcoin continued to range near $30k.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CEL traded to $0.18 as news that Celsius had reached two key settlements related to its bankruptcy proceedings and potential reimbursement of customer assets encouraged traders. While the gains are modest compared to those seen on June 29 and July 1, they represent decent recovery from recent lows of $0.13.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why is Celsius Network price up today?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174907212380000000456.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">court documents</a> filed on July 20, Celsius has reached settlement with the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors over a class claim in which account holders accused the crypto platform&rsquo;s former management of fraud and misrepresentation and other actions that allegedly harmed them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also important is the resolution that could see customers with interest-bearing Earn accounts receive a percentage of their money in crypto assets. They would also be eligible for shares of the new company after bankruptcy ends.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The court document reads in part:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>This settlement, including the increased claim amounts described below, fully resolves all issues between the mediation parties relating to the Plan, will lead to the withdrawal of the adversary proceedings filed by the mediation parties, and will pave the way towards confirmation of the Plan in October and distributions to account holders by the end of this year</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As noted in the filing, about 30,000 account holders lodged total claims of $78.2 billion against the collapsed crypto lender.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The management team has agreed to a settlement with the class, opting to increase customer&rsquo;s reimbursements by 5%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Any eligible Account Holder who does not opt out of the Settlement will receive a claim in the amount of 105% of their scheduled claim, which will supersede and extinguish any related Proofs of Claim filed by such Account Holder</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While account holders have the option of not taking this deal, the alternative could see delayed distribution and potentially reduced recoveries due to the huge expenses associated with the proceedings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Resolving the more than $70 billion of non-contract claims outside of the Settlement would be extraordinarily time-consuming and expensive. &nbsp;The resolution process would significantly harm creditors through delayed distributions and ultimately lower distributions as a result of increased administrative expenses incurred in connection with adjudicating such claims</em>,&rdquo; the filing states.</p>
<p dir="ltr">US Judge Martin Glenn will examine the resolutions on August 10.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/"><u>Cryptocurrencies</u></a> and stocks had a mixed performance this week as the corporate earnings season continued. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index dropped after the relatively weak guidance by companies like Netflix and Nvidia. At the same time, the value-focused Dow Jones index rose after strong bank earnings.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a>, on the other hand, remained under intense pressure as the crypto fear and greed index remained at 52. It moved slightly below the important support at $30k, signaling that bears are overwhelming the bulls. Ethereum dropped to $1,800 while coins like Tron and Chainlink surged during the week.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Chancer token sale nears target</h2>
<p dir="ltr">An important market event is that Chancer continued its token sale during the week. The developers have sold over 9.3 million tokens valued at over $927k. Their goal is to get to 12.6 million tokens in the first phase of the sale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s token sale gained steam after the developers introduced new options for buying the tokens. They introduced additional cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, and Binance USD.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For starters, Chancer is a platform that is seeing to introduce a new way for people to bet across various events like sports, political campaigns, and economic data among others. In addition to these products, people will be able to create their own markets and live stream to the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer will be significantly different from existing betting and prediction marketplaces like Fanduel and BetMGM. For one, in the future, the network will be highly decentralized, with all token holders having a chance to make crucial decisions in the platform. For example, they will decide on new features and pricing. Also, they will also share profits that the company makes. You can buy the Chancer token&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Chancer prediction: What is the future of Chancer?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is a highly ambitious project that is aiming to disrupt an established industry that has unlimited resources. For example, the five biggest companies in the US and UK have a market cap of over $100 billion. These companies can spend billions of dollars in marketing and development.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This explains why Chancer is focused on raising capital through a token sale. These resources will help it to build the platform and market it to key markets around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer has some important features that will help it compete with the incumbents. For one, it will be a decentralized platform that will give token holders more saying about how it is run. In addition to placing bets in the platform, Chancer will let people create their markets and make money when users place the bets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer will be a highly transparent platform with more features like mobile applications, and blockchain technology integration.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is Chancer a good investment?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is holding its token sale at an important time. Inflation has dropped, which will likely see the Fed end its tightening. At the same time, it comes at a time when demand for cryptocurrencies is still high as evidenced by the performance of Pepe and other new meme coins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, there is a likelihood that Chancer&rsquo;s token will do well when the developers list it in decentralised and centralised exchanges like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Binance. In most periods, new tokens tend to do well shortly after listing.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">They then perform well after the developers make several announcements. In this case, Chancer will likely rise ahead of the mainnet launch and as the developers unveil several partnerships.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Still, it is always risky to invest in presale tokens. As a result, you need to use proper risk management strategies when buying the token. For example, you should only allocate a small portion of your funds to these tokens.</p>

<li>Ripple delivered triple-digit returns so far in the trading year</li>
<li>Bitcoin consolidates around the $30k level</li>
<li>Ethereum is up more than 50% YTD</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>During the summer months, trading slows as financial markets usually enter consolidation. The cryptocurrency market is no different &ndash; look at Bitcoin, and its inability to convincingly hold above $30k tells everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, this is the best time to look back and see which cryptocurrencies have outperformed the US dollar in the first seven months of the year?</p>
<p>The chart below shows some dispersed performances. While some cryptocurrencies have rallied, others remained flat. In other words, the crypto market is no different than the stock or the FX market from this perspective, as it is equally important to find the right asset to invest in.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/22/1690015931029-dc1be00a-5189-4e46-a57e-42223b28bec4.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="470"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin chart by TradingView</a></p>
<h2>Ripple leads the pack</h2>
<p>Ripple is the single major cryptocurrency to have delivered triple-digit returns YTD. Sure enough, the bulk of the gains came from the reaction to a recent ruling saying that Ripple is a security when sold to institutional investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news, though, is that the spike higher was not retraced. Instead, the market consolidated at those higher levels, telling us that this is more than just a short squeeze.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&rsquo;s YTD performance exceeds 80%</h2>
<p>For most of the time in 2023, Bitcoin delivered the biggest return. It rallied right from the start of the year, but the rally stalled recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin has a hard time breaking and holding above $30k. Its performance this year is closely related to the US dollar&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, despite the Fed hiking the funds rate several times this year, the EUR/USD trades close to its highest levels for the year. Hence, the dollar&rsquo;s weakness transpired in other markets, including cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>Ethereum delivered more than 50% return to its investors</h2>
<p>Ethereum is in third place, with a return of more than 50% since the start of the year. After initially rallying with Bitcoin, it gave up more of its gains during consolidation.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">XRP price has been trading around $0.80 for the past week, having retreated before hitting the $1 level.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Ripple&rsquo;s win against the SEC remains a huge catalyst and several indicators suggest a new leg is likely.</li>
<li dir="ltr">If price breaks out amid new upside catalysts, it could be a big move for XRP.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/">XRP</a>&rsquo;s explosive gain on the day Ripple scored a big one against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did not help bulls cross the psychologically important $1 level. And with ranged trading amid a flip in the Fear &amp; Greed Index this week, the struggle beneath $0.80 has hinted at a slight frustration across the XRP market.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What&rsquo;s the XRP outlook?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable" style="width: 700px"><span class="fr-img-wrap"></span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/21/1689966383667-0fc5b34b-f6bc-4b58-b59a-1e3345a993d0.png" style="width: 700px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="700" height="320"><span class="fr-inner">A weekly chart showing XRP/USD price performance. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wCrv9RG2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TradingView</a></span></p>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">XRP&rsquo;s pullback below $0.80 (XRP/USD traded to highs above $0.93 last week) has come even as <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open interest</a> in futures contracts continued to hover at its highest level since November 2021. According to OI data from Coinglass, that metric soared to $1.19 billion on Thursday July 20.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Rising open interest is indicative of inflows into the XRP futures contracts and typically confirms the recent trend&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The XRP market has also been on a tear in terms of the global spot trading volumes. On-chain data showed XRP volumes, buoyed by massive interest in South Korea, topped that of Bitcoin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the largest volume on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$XRP</a> measured in the last 1,5 years.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Positive sentiment has also been infused into the XRP market by recent developments around adoption of Ripple technology. After the partial win against the SEC, reports emerged that the US-based blockchain company was looking to recapture the interest of major financial players in its cross-border payments and remittances technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ripple also made a major splash this week, committing to a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ripple-invests-in-54m-round-for-ai-metaverse-firm-futureverse/">$54 million investment</a> in Futureverse, an artificial intelligence and metaverse-focused project. With more upside catalysts across the crypto market, it is possible XRP price could cap a great month with a burst above the key resistance level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, while a move higher is a more likely scenario given the highlighted factors, a negative flip in sentiment with prices still near current levels could risk a bearish retest. The primary support level below $0.70 is around $0.50.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The DOJ has filed a court complaint accusing former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried of leaking Caroline Ellison&rsquo;s diary.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bankman-Fried is alleged to have met a New York Times reporter and handed out the information.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The government sees this as an attempt by SBF to discredit Ellison who is a key witness.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The US Department of Justice (DOJ) says Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>, leaked the contents of a private diary belonging to Caroline Ellison to a <em>New York Times</em> reporter.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">DOJ says Bankman-Fried wanted to &ldquo;discredit&rdquo; Ellison</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Ellison is a former colleague of Bankman-Fried, and headed Alameda Research, a sister company of the collapsed crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">She was also charged for her role in the implosion that befell the companies. However, Ellison agreed to cooperate with the prosecution and is seen as a key witness in the DOJ&rsquo;s case against the former FTX chief.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The government&rsquo;s complaint against SBF relates to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article</a> in the NYT that feature information leaked from Ellison&rsquo;s private diary. In its <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.176.0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filing</a>, the DOJ says that the former FTX CEO is behind the leak and that his action &ldquo;<em>sought to publicly discredit a government witness</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>The defendant&rsquo;s purpose in sharing these materials is plain. &nbsp;Ellison has pleaded guilty to a cooperation agreement and is expected to testify at trial that she agreed with the defendant to defraud FTX&rsquo;s customers and investors, and Alameda&rsquo;s lenders. &nbsp;By selectively sharing certain private documents with the New York Times, the defendant is attempting to discredit a witness, cast Ellison in a poor light, and advance his defense through the press and outside the constraints of the courtroom and rules of evidence: that Ellison was a jilted lover who perpetrated these crimes alone</em>,&rdquo; reads part of the DOJ&rsquo;s complaint.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the government sees this as an extrajudicial move by the defendant, and which could interfere not only with the jury but also with witnesses lined up to testify against him. It&rsquo;s not the first complaint the DOJ has filed against Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>The effect, if not the intent, of the defendant&rsquo;s conduct is not only to harass Ellison, but also to deter other potential trial witnesses from testifying</em>,&rdquo; the DOJ wrote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In January, the prosecution <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/doj-says-bankman-fried-attempted-to-influence-witness/">said</a> he had tried to influence an FTX.US official.The government has therefore requested the court to issue orders limiting extrajudicial statements that could interfere with the jury and witnesses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SBF, once lauded as a crypto prodigy and a darling around the Capitol, is under house arrest and faces a long prison sentence if convicted. His trial is set to begin in October.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">XRP, XLM and LINK added more than 20% to their values over the past seven days, outperforming Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu has now raised more than $1 million in its presale.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">XRP, XLM and LINK have been the best performers amongst the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap over the past few days.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Their performance has seen Bitcoin&rsquo;s dominance drop below the 50% mark. Investors are now speculating whether the altcoins season is here, with altcoins outperforming Bitcoin since the start of the month.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">XLM, XRP, and LINK lead the altcoins rally</h2>
<p dir="ltr">XRP, the native coin of the Ripple ecosystem, has been the biggest winner so far this month. XRP added more than 70% to its value since the start of the month, thanks to a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ripple-wins-sec-case-xrp-not-a-security/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>favourable ruling</u></a> in the Ripple vs. SEC case.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stellar Lumen&rsquo;s XLM also rallied by more than 50% this month, thanks to XRP&rsquo;s positive performance. With XRP not considered a security, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/xlm-price-soars-as-stellar-rides-ripples-xrp-wave/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>XLM became bullish</u></a> as it is XRP&rsquo;s major competitor in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">LINK, the native coin of the Chainlink blockchain, also rallied by more than 20% this week. The rally was fueled by <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/3-reasons-why-chainlink-link-price-just-surged/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chainlink&rsquo;s release of its CCIP protocol</u></a> as it expanded its base within the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With altcoins outperforming Bitcoin in recent weeks, market participants could be wondering whether the altcoins season is finally here.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale also continues to set new records. The team has now raised more than $1 million, with only 36,406,652 tokens left in this presale round.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is a meme coin project that seeks to differ from the current crop of meme coins found in the cryptocurrency space by offering more value to users.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the project is still in its presale stage, its promised utility has seen investors grab more than $1 million worth of its native SHMU token.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to their whitepaper, Shiba Memu is a cryptocurrency that combines AI and blockchain technology to develop an unstoppable, entirely self-sufficient marketing powerhouse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team revealed that Shiba Memu has the capacity to execute the work of 100 marketing agencies. Furthermore, Shiba Memu is an active AI-based platform, providing users with the transparency of blockchain technology and the efficiency of AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If deployed, the Shiba Memu platform actively engages to find the best work going on in creative advertising, consumes the work and churns out far better results.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Shiba Memu team decided to leverage the recent popularity of meme coins. Meme coins have become an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The total meme coin market cap grew from practically $0 to reach the $20 billion mark in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> team revealed the platform has self-sufficient marketing capabilities powered by AI technology. When deployed, Shiba Memu will develop its own marketing strategies, write its own PR, and promote itself in relevant forums and various social media platforms. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the moment, Shiba Memu operates on Ethereum and BNB Chain, the two leading DeFi and smart contract blockchains.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale tops $1 million</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the current market conditions, Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale event has been going excellently. Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale investment has increased by more than $200k over the past few days, with more than $1 million raised so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu has been attracting interest from investors thanks to the latest rally by altcoins.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team revealed that the funds generated from the presale would be used to develop some of their products. They have allocated most of the funds to the development of the Shiba Memum AI technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a> to find out more about Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale event.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in Shiba Memu today?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin&rsquo;s dominance in the market has decreased in recent days, with altcoins like XRP, XLM and LINK experiencing massive surges in prices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With more interest in altcoins, investors could be looking for new exciting projects in the cryptocurrency space. Shiba Memu could be one of the projects investors look to.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By combining the power of blockchain technology and AI, <a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shiba Memu</a> promises to be a unique project. The platform will look to ease marketing strategies for companies and organisations.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the project gets the right level of adoption, its SHMU token could rally higher in the coming months and years.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">Gateway is a Cosmos-powered appchain.</li>
<li dir="ltr">It is designed to allow for access to unified liquidity in the Cosmos ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Decentralized messaging protocol Wormhole has released its application-specific blockchain dubbed Wormhole Gateway. The appchain is powered by the Cosmos SDK, and aims at broadening access and liquidity with the blockchain platform&rsquo;s ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wormhole Foundation, which announced Gateway on Friday, said the appchain is &ldquo;compatible and complementary to IBC.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Wormhole to connect 23 blockchains in Cosmos</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to details shared in a <a href="https://wormhole.com/wormhole-gateway-the-gateway-to-the-cosmos-ecosystem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Gateway allows Wormhole to connect 23+ blockchains, including Osmosis, Evmos and Neutron, across six runtimes to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cosmos/">Cosmos</a>. This is achieved through a liquidity router that allows users to bridge funds to any appchain within the Cosmos ecosystem at no extra bridging fees, the protocol noted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing &#10024;&#10024;Wormhole Gateway&#10024;&#10024; &ndash; an application-specific blockchain, powered by the <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cosmos</a> SDK.</p>
<p>Gateway&rsquo;s purpose is to help broaden access (and bring liquidity) to the Cosmos ecosystem while also improving Wormhole&rsquo;s security and sovereignty. <a href="https://t.co/qG1kyvcnoY">pic.twitter.com/qG1kyvcnoY</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Wormhole&#127786; (@wormholecrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/wormholecrypto/status/1682337664379531266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Gateway is also designed to improve Wormhole&rsquo;s security and sovereignty. Security is key to the protocol given the impact of a February 2022 hack on the Wormhole bridge that saw a hacker 120,000 wETH worth $325 million. The exploit on the Solana-Ethereum bridge saw the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/solana-price-drops-by-9-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-wormhole-bridge-hack/">price of SOL declined sharply</a> amid community reaction to the news.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As part of enhancing security across the Cosmos ecosystem, Wormhole introduced Governor, a module designed to limit cross-chain contagion in the event of a hack.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In June, Wormhole <a href="https://twitter.com/wormholecrypto/status/1680997071132950528" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced</a> Automatic Relayers, a decentralised network of relayers that allows for cross-chain messaging that developers can tap into without having to develop, run or manage an off-chain component. With this developers can deploy a fully-functional cross-chain dApp via a single solidity contract.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>[PARIS] &ndash; July 17, 2023 &ndash;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> During ETHCC23,</span><a href="https://neonevm.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> <b>Neon EVM</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> launched on the Solana Mainnet to help close the gap between the different programming, computing, and memory models of Ethereum and Solana, bringing a low-friction solution to allow EVM dApps to settle to Solana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Neon EVM program is a smart contract on the Solana blockchain. It accepts wrapped Ethereum-like transactions and processes them on Solana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Previously, when EVM dApps wanted to leverage low-cost solutions, they had to use a rollup or sidechain. By using Solana as the settlement layer, an EVM is well-placed to outcompete such L2 solutions. The average transaction fee for sending ETH on the Ethereum network is ~$2. The L2s offer between</span><a href="https://l2fees.info/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400">$0.5&ndash;$0.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, a saving of 4&ndash;20 times. In comparison, Solana&rsquo;s average transaction fees are ~0.00001 SOL ($0.0002) per transaction, 10,000 times saving. Initial tests of Neon EVM in Devnet demonstrate that the protocol</span><a href="https://medium.com/neon-labs/neon-synthetic-load-test-report-d53212711556" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400">translates these optimizations in practice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&ldquo;We are very excited to see Neon EVM live on Solana Mainnet,&rdquo; says </span><b>Marina Guryeva, Director of Neon Foundation</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. &ldquo;Once we repeat these tests in production, we will present the figures based on real-world data.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the launch of Neon EVM on the Solana Mainnet, the Neon DAO is activated to begin participating in, and influencing the future development of, Neon EVM.</span></p>
