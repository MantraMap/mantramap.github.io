			            <description><![CDATA[The study determined that just 5.3% of Salvadorans disagree with Nayib Bukele's political regime. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recent survey conducted by TResearch estimated that nearly 93% of Salvadorans approve of the leadership of President Nayib Bukele. This has been the highest level of support for the political leader who stepped into his role in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bukele is a well-known figure across the cryptocurrency community, mainly due to his pro-Bitcoin stance. Under his rule, El Salvador became the first country to adopt the primary digital asset as a legal tender. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Salvadorans are Satisfied With Bukele</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.tresearch.mx/post/sv-aprobacion-gobierno" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">research</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, only 5.3% are not happy with the work carried out by Bukele&#8217;s administration, whereas 92.3% approve of its policies and actions. Some of the best achievements of the President&#8217;s cabinet include handling the COVID-19 pandemic, building new roads and upgrading highway infrastructure, and implementing reforms in the education sector.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For broad society, though, Bukele is known as the man who waged war on local criminal gangs and opened the nation&#8217;s doors to Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">El Salvador became the first country to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/three-months-later-bitcoin-now-officially-a-legal-tender-in-el-salvador/" data-wpel-link="internal">declare</a> BTC as legal tender inside its borders in 2021. Bukele&#8217;s government did not stop there, introducing multiple initiatives involving the asset in the following years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It purchased BTC on a macroeconomic level and used the profits to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/el-salvadors-bitcoin-fueled-vet-hospital-opens-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">build</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a massive veterinary hospital. It also revealed intentions to create a futuristic </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/el-salvadors-bitcoin-city-wins-an-international-design-award-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Bitcoin City&#8221;</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that will be located in the southeast region of the Latin American nation.</span></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the future metropolis will adopt BTC as its currency, while its urban area will be designed in such a way that it could represent the logo of the digital asset when looked at from above.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bukele has recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/president-bukele-explains-how-el-salvador-benefited-from-legalizing-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">explained</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that embracing Bitcoin has increased El Salvador&#8217;s tourism by nearly 100%, fixed its legacy, and made the country highly popular for investors and entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Second Term for the Leader?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite El Salvador&#8217;s constitution that prohibits Presidents from having consecutive mandates, Bukele said he will compete in the elections in 2024.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I&#8217;m announcing to the Salvadoran people that I&#8217;ve decided to run as a candidate for President of the Republic,&#8221; the 41-year-old </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/el-salvadors-pro-bitcoin-president-will-seek-re-election-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in September. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, it seems like the controversial decision will not cause any backlash among locals since 93% would like him to remain their leader after the vote next year. 6.8% would be happier to see another person serving as President.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an attempt to improve user experience and introduce major lifestyle upgrades, RBX network is launching a suite of on-chain security features called RBX Reserve Accounts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The push comes as part of its most recent Spartan Wallet Update.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s aimed at providing users with on-chain recovery, as well as callback features, in a bid to take self-sovereignty and self-custody to new heights.</li>
<li>According to the press release shared with CryptoPotato, users will be able to enjoy the security of cold storage in a hot wallet.</li>
<li>There will be an added ability to recover funds that have been compromised within 24 hours of any potential event.</li>
<li>This will become possible by entering their own personally-generated password and recovery code. The assets will be recovered to a new address, which is only known by the user.</li>
<li>Moreover, according to the release:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RBX Spartan Wallet update has improved file upload speeds by enhancing the Beacon System and enabled peer-to-peer NFT sales without the need for an auction house. It also provides the ability to create verification signatures for proof of asset ownership. This release also includes several wallet quality-of-life improvements and new API methods for querying. Web wallets are expected to incorporate Reserve Accounts in the coming weeks.</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Chairman Powell believes the Federal Reserve should play a role in governing the stablecoin market. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stablecoins are a “form of money” over which the central bank ought to have some level of authority, said Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell before Congress on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chairman also confirmed that the Fed does not intend to directly issue a Central Bank Digitial Currency (CBDC) in the United States. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">During a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmddoaBAXXk&amp;t=3222s&amp;ab_channel=GOPFinancialServices" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> related to monetary policy, Powell acknowledged that the crypto industry has some “staying power” – but also how its market cap has retraced massively since last year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the past, Powell has </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agOrZsyhA7o&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Bitcoin and other cryptos as failed forms of money. Stablecoins, however, have been a point of greater focus, for which he’s </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-us-has-no-intentions-to-ban-bitcoin-said-fed-chair-powell/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">advocated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> careful regulation. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We do see payments stablecoins as a form of money,&#8221; Powell said on Wednesday. The chairman added that central banks remain the ultimate source of credibility on money and that there should be a robust federal role it has to play in the industry. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Allowing a lot of private money creation at the state level would be a mistake” he added.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Though a CBDC is still on the table for the Federal Reserve, Powell said it wouldn’t consider creating one issued directly by the central bank. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“We would not support accounts at the Federal Reserve by individuals,” he said, citing privacy concerns. “At some point in the future, a CBDC would be one that was intermediated through the banking system and not directly at the Fed.”  </span></li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hackers who targeted Atomic Wallet earlier this month are laundering large sums of stolen XRP through centralized exchanges, on-chain data shows.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/xrpforensics/status/1671404282753548291" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">xrpforensics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Twitter, the hackers began “heavily laundering funds,” on Monday, spawning new blockchain addresses to avoid blocklists established by crypto exchanges. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re monitoring and working closely with exchanges to try and seize as much as possible,” said the team. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 280,000 XRP were sent to Binance, with over 200,000 additional units sent to KuCoin, WhiteBit, OKEx, and Huobi Global. The forensics team also suspects that some funds are moving through MEXC. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the account </span><a href="https://twitter.com/xrpforensics/status/1671565831329677327" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how funds were “leaking” through the decentralized bridge, Orbit, through which another 3 million XRP were quickly laundered.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain forensics experts at Elliptic </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/atomic-wallet-hacker-funnels-stolen-crypto-to-north-korea-tied-coin-mixer-elliptic/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suspect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the North Korean Lazarus group may have been connected to the Atomic Wallet hack, which stole $35 million from users earlier this month. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lazarus has a history of using blockchain bridges to launder their stolen funds. On Tuesday, crypto tracking platform MistTrack </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/atomic-wallet-hackers-take-advantage-of-thorchain-to-hide-35m/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the hackers moved hundreds of stolen Ether (ETH) through the cross-chain liquidity protocol THORChain, converting their assets into Bitcoin (BTC). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hackers also appear to have </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/atomic-wallet-hackers-used-ofac-sanctioned-garantex-to-launder-stolen-35m-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Russian crypto exchange Garantex to liquidate their assets – a platform sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). </span></li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin(BTC) has risen back above $30,000 for the first time since April amid optimism that a Bitcoin spot ETF product could soon be approved in the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The asset appears to be outperforming other cryptos, sending Bitcoin dominance to another two-year high above 51%. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin traded for roughly $28,300 early on Wednesday, before surging to $30,650 by 16:38 UTC. At press time, the asset trades for $30,250, according to TradingView.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The pump puts Bitcoin up 7.00% since the stock market opened, outperforming Ether’s 4.69% rise over the same period. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin has been </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-soars-12-weekly-bch-charts-25-increase-in-a-day-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> since late yesterday when the coin surged from under $27,000 to over $29,000.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin’s volatility has triggered $265 Million in liquidations across the crypto market, according to </span><a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">CoinGlass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. That includes over 64,000 traders, the largest of whom was liquidated for $9.3 million. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The excitement around Bitcoin appears to be growing after BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager – </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin spot ETF product last week. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Invesco and WisdomTree later </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/after-blackrock-two-more-asset-managers-file-to-launch-a-btc-etf-in-the-us/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">resubmitted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> filings for similar products after previously being turned down by the commission. Though the SEC has shown resistance to such a product, BlackRock has an incredibly strong </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrocks-etf-success-rate-with-the-sec-is-575-to-1-what-about-its-bitcoin-application/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">success rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for seeing its products approved.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and BNB are suffering after being explicitly named as securities in the SEC’s lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance earlier this month. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor predicted last week that Bitcoin would likely benefit from the U.S. regulatory crackdown against alternative cryptos.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin dominance now stands at 51.74% – its highest level since late April 2021. </span></li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market is displaying a strong bullish surge, with the global cap expanding by 6% over the last 24 hours. While Bitcoin’s institutional and mainstream adoption is driving the rally &#8211; thanks in part to BlackRock’s application for a Bitcoin ETF &#8211; altcoins and meme coins are also seeing explosive surges.</p>
<p>Pepe has emerged as one of the top performers, with the token surging close to 15%. Investors remain encouraged that it will re-hit the $1 billion market cap.</p>
<p>Another meme coin making waves is <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/en" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes</a>, which is close to raising $9 million in its presale. The token’s strong start and community strength are already drawing comparisons with Pepe.</p>
<h2><strong>Pepe Sees Bullish Resurgence &#8211; How Long Will The Rally Last?</strong></h2>
<p>Global meme coin phenomenon Pepe is pumping once again on the back of a market-wide crypto recovery. It surged over 14.8% in the last 24 hours, bringing its weekly gains to over 15%.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-16.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256341" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-16.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="902" height="538" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-16.jpg 902w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-16-300x179.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-16-768x458.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-16-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></a></p>
<p>The token is currently the top trending cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, with a 130% increase in its 24-hour trading volume.</p>
<p>Pepe’s success can be attributed to a strong bounce back in the crypto market, led by Bitcoin’s bullish strength. The top cryptocurrency is seeing historic institutional adoption, with some experts envisioning a $40k price level for BTC soon.</p>
<p>Investment giant BlackRock’s application for spot Bitcoin ETF broke the barriers, with Deutsche Bank applying for a digital asset licence soon after. Fidelity, Citadel and Charles Schwab have since launched a crypto exchange, offering trading in four crypto assets including Bitcoin.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-20.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256342" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-20.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="260" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-20.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-20-300x130.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-20-50x22.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>WisdomTree, another investment management firm, has followed BlackRock and filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF trading option.</p>
<p>BTC has surged past the $29k mark after skyrocketing 8% over the past 24 hours. Experts believe that with Bitcoin halving approaching, altcoins will also see a bullish price movement.</p>
<p>The positive sentiment surrounding the crypto market is good news for Pepe, which has closely tracked the BTC price over the past few weeks. However, investors would hope that the token can generate sustainable gains during the bear market as well, a feat it has failed to achieve so far. A report by Santiment revealed that Pepe was unable to secure retail investors, even at its all-time high.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256343" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-17.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="471" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-17-300x235.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-17-50x39.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Michael van de Poppe, the founder of MN Trading, believes that while <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1671201494182375432?cxt=HHwWkMC9jfK5prEuAAAA" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pepe has seen a strong bounce</a>, there is no clear continuation for the token yet.</p>
<h2><strong>Which Other Meme Tokens Are Traders Backing?</strong></h2>
<p>Pepe isn’t the only meme token surging right now, with Shiba Inu another coin that’s seeing bullish momentum.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes is also attracting attention throughout its presale, which is nearing $10m and has been <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636924379086077954" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">noticed by Elon Musk</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Wall Street Memes Token Raises $9 Million, Is It The Next Pepe?</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes token</a> has emerged as one of the most popular buys in the meme coin market in recent weeks. The token has raised a staggering $9 million in the presale in just over three weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-14.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256344" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-14.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="301" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-14.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-14-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-14-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>With the meme coin mania still raging, many are backing the $WSM token to be the next global meme coin phenomenon.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes movement was born out of the ground-breaking GameStop short squeeze in 2021 when a small army of internet traders took on the big-money institutions and won. Since then, it has built a global brand value by disrupting the traditional financial landscape through the power of community and memes. It draws over 40 million monthly social media impressions, with even Elon Musk a fan of its Twitter account.</p>
<p>The group has established a strong customer base in the Web3 space as well. It sold out its Wall St Bulls NFT collection in 32 minutes, netting a cool $2.5 million. Inspired by the success, it also recently launched its own Bitcoin Ordinal NFTs.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes group now looks to tokenize the same community spirit and dominate the demand for the next popular meme coin.</p>
<p>Despite its enormous popularity, the Wall Street Memes token has adopted community-driven tokenomics. The entire 2 billion $WSM token supply is available for the public, with no private cuts for the team or any private sale.</p>
<p>50% of the tokens are available during the presale itself, enabling investors to take advantage of the early presale prices while 30% of the $WSM tokens have been reserved for rewarding the community. 5 lucky degens will also receive $10k worth of $WSM tokens through a generous airdrop.</p>
<p>The token is currently priced at $0.0298 but is quickly selling out in the presale. Investors have limited opportunity to purchase the token through bank cards or by swapping ETH or USDT tokens.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Huobi founder Li Lin has accused the crypto exchange of using the Huobi trademark, an action that supposedly goes against the agreement in the original acquisition contract.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">According to Chinese crypto reporter Colin Wu, X-Spot Co. Limited, controlled by Li Lin, has <a href="https://www.wu-talk.com/index.php?m=content&amp;c=index&amp;a=show&amp;catid=7&amp;id=15428" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed</a> a lawsuit in the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region against crypto exchange Huobi Global for trademark Infringement.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Huobi founder Li Lin formally sued Huobi Global in Hong Kong for using its Chinese trademark 火币 that was not allowed to continue to be used in the original acquisition contract. Huobi was acquired by Justin Sun for over $1 billion last year. Sun froze Li Lin’s brother’s account…</p>
<p>— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1671451026950623232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The lawsuit claimed that the crypto firm resumed the use of the &#8220;Huobi&#8221; trademark without permission from X-Spot, with Li Lin&#8217;s company maintaining exclusive rights to the trademark.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Following the transfer of Houbi&#8217;s shares to About Capital Management, it was agreed that the original shareholders will retain rights to the company&#8217;s trademark, which will not be transferred to the buyer of Huobi. Also, the claim pointed to the fact that the agreement in the equity transfer stated that the buyer was prohibited from using the Huobi brand and trademark.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Furthermore, the lawsuit also stated that the crypto exchange started reusing the trademark after Tron Founder Justin Sun accused Li Lin&#8217;s brother of dumping large amounts of Huobi&#8217;s native token (HT).</li>
<li dir="ltr">Meanwhile, there has been no official statement from Huobi Global or Justin Sun regarding the lawsuit. Malaysian authorities recently ordered Huobi to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/malaysian-regulator-orders-huobi-to-halt-its-illegal-operations-in-the-country-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">cease</a> operations in the country, claiming that the firm was operating illegally</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Invesco and WisdomTree resubmitted their filings for the release of a BTC Spot ETF in America nearly a week after BlackRock's example. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Invesco &#8211; an American investment company with over $1.4 trillion of assets under management &#8211; reactivated its attempts to launch a Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. WisdomTree &#8211; another US finance giant &#8211; submitted a similar application to the SEC.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest efforts come a few days after the world&#8217;s largest asset manager filed with the securities regulator to introduce a BTC Spot ETF in the States. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Invesco Rejoins the Race</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Eric Balchunas &#8211; analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1671303690420985857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1671303690420985857%7Ctwgr%5E0b7c58695c8820a27c971aef5a24d6e9bafcc1e2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fblackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-new-sec-filings-wisdomtree-invesco" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> on his Twitter account that Invesco has renewed its ambitions to launch a BTC Sport ETF in the United States. The company&#8217;s initial filing came in 2021 when it collaborated with Galaxy Digital. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Invesco was also interested in releasing a Bitcoin Futures ETF. Nonetheless, it </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/invesco-reportedly-abandons-plans-to-launch-bitcoin-futures-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">abandoned</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> these intentions at the end of 2021 to focus on a product that allows customers to invest in the primary cryptocurrency based on its actual market price.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although the investment company is still waiting for a positive nod from the US SEC, it has already </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/invesco-launches-bitcoin-spot-etp-with-german-stock-market-operator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">introduced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a product in Europe. The &#8220;Invesco Physical Bitcoin&#8221; ETN (ticker: BTIC) came into existence after a collaboration with Deutsche Borse and provides &#8220;physically secured access&#8221; to Bitcoin&#8217;s performance, albeit a derivative.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">WisdomTree&#8217;s Efforts</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The New York-based entity also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/wisdomtree-files-to-start-a-us-spot-bitcoin-etf-on-the-heels-of-blackrock-s-application-1.1935782" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">sought</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> permission from the SEC to launch a BTC Spot ETF. Should it obtain regulatory approval, the fund will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker BTCW. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The watchdog has previously rejected WisdomTree&#8217;s attempt to release a BTC ETF, citing possible risks for consumers, such as fraud and market manipulation. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart (another analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence), <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">BlackRock&#8217;s filing</a> from last week &#8220;has restored hope in approval thanks to the company&#8217;s size, stature, and reputation.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Everyone who had a filing is going to resubmit, and those who had been considering will also want to be filing soon as well,&#8221; Dave Abner &#8211; principal at the crypto advisory firm Dabner Capital Partners &#8211; predicted. </span></p></blockquote>
