<p>Deutsche Telekom, the technology giant, has joined the Polygon blockchain as a validator node, signalling its ambitions to become an infrastructure provider in the web3 space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dirk R&ouml;der, the head of the Blockchain Solutions Center at Deutsche Telekom, was quoted by DL News as saying that &ldquo;supporting the Polygon network as a validator is a big milestone in this objective&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
Polygon not a layer 2?
<p>Deutsche Telekom has decided to support the Ethereum ecosystem and its scalability solutions, and Polygon, known as the leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling platform, aligns with that focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Polygon was initially marketed as an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, it has since discontinued that terminology due to concerns about misrepresentation. Polygon is a sidechain, independent from Ethereum for its security, although it commits its transaction history to Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company's assets are secured by a multi-signature wallet controlled by a small group of individuals or entities. Deutsche Telekom also runs validators for other major and minor blockchains, including Ethereum, Q, Celo, Flow, and Energy Web.&nbsp;</p>
Trad telecom company branches into cool new tech
<p>The company's strategy for running validators remains unclear, with R&ouml;der highlighting that blockchain technology presents a valid business case and Deutsche Telekom receives percentages of the rewards.</p>
<p>However, another representative clarified that the company does not stake its own crypto assets but relies on others to do so while taking a cut of their rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While some might speculate that Deutsche Telekom's involvement with blockchains could be a marketing strategy to appeal to a younger user base, overall, Deutsche Telekom's foray into node validation demonstrates its commitment to web3 infrastructure and its interest in the Ethereum ecosystem's scalability solutions.</p>
