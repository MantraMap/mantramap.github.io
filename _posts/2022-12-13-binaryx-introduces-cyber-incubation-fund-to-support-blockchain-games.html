<p>Rudy, Head of Growth at BinaryX, said:&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;BinaryX is committed to accelerating the adoption of Web3 technologies in gaming. The fund is not limited to supporting blockchain games already in the space, but also traditional developer teams who want to experiment with blockchain in their games or NFTs. We believe in the overall growth and adoption of blockchain within the gaming ecosystem, and we will strive to support any project that is promising to that effect.&rdquo;
<p>Since launching the incubation arm mid-2022, BinaryX has invested in and incubated 2 GameFi projects. Its portfolio includes SHIT games, and Rh!noX NFT collection, with several exciting projects underway.&nbsp;</p>

The Incubation Fund is open to receive applications and all year round, providing iterative support to any project at any stage of development.&nbsp;</p>

We are entirely focused on our games, and we have been communicating our upcoming plans transparently.&rsquo; The team has just arranged a DAO vote to decide on the buy back plan for BNX, and are working to execute it alongside other strategic plans for long-term growth, including the development of their latest game, CyberLand.&nbsp;</p>
