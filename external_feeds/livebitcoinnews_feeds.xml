										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andy Yen is the CEO and co-founder of Proton, a privacy-centered organization that seeks to provide a whole new (autonomous) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2022/12/27/andy-yen-ceo-of-proton-on-the-tech-giants-that-dominate-the-internet-the-webs-future-and-bitcoin/?sh=2ba9e2d34075" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">version of the Internet</a>.</p>
<h2>Yen Wants to See Change in the Crypto Space</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, he gave his thoughts on <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>, crypto, and what traders can expect in terms of legislation and what the space will hold.</p>
<p>In the past, Yen has gone on record about being a bitcoin and crypto supporter. Right now, bitcoin is only accepted as a form of payment amongst limited agencies and enterprises, and given the circumstances surrounding bitcoin, Yen himself is not entirely sure about what will happen. He’s not sure if he’ll continue to hold it or not, nor is he sure if Proton will accept payments via the Bitcoin Lightning Network. In the interview, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay, so you know, it&#8217;s kind of an interesting topic given the meltdown in the financial markets. Proton has always kept some of our reserves in bitcoin, and this is something that&#8217;s already known out in the world. There’s an internal debate; I don&#8217;t have the answer to that yet. I&#8217;m not sure if we continue to hold bitcoin or not hold bitcoin. Again, I&#8217;m not, let&#8217;s say a bitcoin industry insider, but I&#8217;m happy to share some of my perspectives. I think there&#8217;s just too much fraud and abuse and other objectionable things, incredulous things, especially when you look at things like NFTs and some of the other things that happened at the tail end of let&#8217;s say, the recent bubble, right? There&#8217;s just too much fraud and too much icky stuff in the space.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Regulation Could Possibly Work</h2>
<p>He continued with his thoughts on regulation and appears to be in favor of it. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, this might not be a popular opinion, but I do believe the crypto community is well served by taking a stronger stance on regulation, and I don&#8217;t mean by having lawmakers come in and set rules and laws on what you can and cannot do because they don&#8217;t understand the space, but I think a lot of players within the space. We ought to have some moderation and maybe you know, self-regulation, if that&#8217;s even possible, right? I think it&#8217;s important to do that or else we have a continuous cycle of spikes and crashes and spikes and crashes, and that&#8217;s not good in the long term. People are not going to have faith and confidence and trust in an asset class if it’s frequently having 80 percent crash cycles. We need the crash cycles to be less and less severe over time, and that&#8217;s just not happening. This crash cycle is just as bad as the last one, and that shows me that we haven&#8217;t really learned our lesson here, so maybe a controversial view, but that&#8217;s my personal view on this.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It appears <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> is taking another beating, only this time, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/stocks-and-bitcoin-may-be-down-but-gold-prices-just-hit-a-six-month-high-above-1-800/ar-AA15IhIB" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">it’s from its rival gold</a>. The precious metal has long been considered a solid commodity and a hedge against a wide array of economic problems and similar troubles, but it looks like the asset has recently hit a new six-month high and is now trading for more than $1,800.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Keeps Suffering While Gold Is Jumping</h2>
<p>This is not necessarily good for bitcoin because it’s done nothing but taken serious plummets over the time that it’s taken for gold to surge. The world’s number one digital currency has fallen by about 70 percent since hitting its all-time high of about $68,000 in November of 2021. Since then, it’s fallen into the high $16,000 range, and many people who were once believers are turning their backs on the asset and flocking to other potential investing tools, the precious metal being a big one.</p>
<p>Mobeen Tahir – an investment strategist at Wisdom Tree – says bitcoin has fallen drastically mainly because banks all over the world are hiking interest rates as a means of fighting inflation. This gave the asset the perfect opportunity to jump in price and put other assets to shame. In an interview, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>What should have been smooth sailing for gold became the perfect storm. A rising U.S. dollar and rising treasury yields became headwinds for gold… These are sort of goldilocks conditions for gold; perfect conditions for gold.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s also believed that gold is on the rise because the stability and strength of the U.S. dollar is fading drastically. Many analysts claim that gold is also going to see a massive rise in popularity in countries like China, which currently stands as the biggest haven for precious metals. These boosts to the price of gold are slated to last well into 2023.</p>
<p>Lastly, they say that if the Federal Reserve decides to either slow down rate hikes or pause them altogether, things could potentially get even stronger for gold, and the precious metal is going to jump like nobody’s ever anticipated. In the World Gold Council’s 2023 Gold Outlook, the analysts wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lower inflation should mean potentially diminished interest in gold from an inflation hedging perspective… Although higher bond yields are associated with lower gold returns and might now be deemed attractive by some investors, current yield levels are historically not a hindrance to gold doing well, particularly when accounting for a weaker U.S. dollar… We may see a lot of investors express their bullish view on gold via silver next year.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Silver Is Also Up</h2>
<p>As the report shows, gold is not the only precious metal up at press time. Silver has also experienced a jump of about 1.5 percent over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>In the last few months, silver has experienced price hikes exceeding 15 percent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two men in Nigeria have been arrested for <a href="https://leadership.ng/police-arrest-2-suspects-over-alleged-cryptocurrency-fraud/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">allegedly taking part in crypto</a> fraud. The pair obtained quite a bit of money by cheating investors and lying to them about their potential returns.</p>
<h2>Two Arrests for Crypto Fraud in Nigeria</h2>
<p>Force PRO – which is the national cybercrime force in Nigeria – said that the duo admitted to being part of a larger syndicate that specialized in defrauding people of their hard-earned funds. The syndicate is reported to attack investors in foreign countries by assuming false identities and making romantic promises to those they seek to victimize.</p>
<p>In a statement, the police force stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the extant case, a report on their activities was received from Incheon Metropolitan Police Agency in Korea through the Interpol National Central Bureau that in May 2021, the suspects approached the victim, one Baek Seong-hee, a Korean national, via Kakaotalk, a mobile messaging application used majorly in South Korea, in the guise of being a member of the US Armed Forces stationed in Yemen. The suspects used the pretext of a romantic relationship and defrauded the victims of 259,637,941 Korean Won (KRW) worth of cryptocurrency equivalent to about 91 million Nigerian Naira.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">Romance scams</a> have been rather prominent in the crypto space as of late. The process occurs when a potential cyberthief takes on an entirely separate identity and pretends to be someone seeking the love and companionship of another. They either pursue others themselves or answer the calls of those looking to find lasting partners.</p>
<p>When they’ve locked onto a victim, things start out normally with courting and wooing and all the other standard elements of a loving relationship. It doesn’t take long, however, for things to take a drastic and technical turn. They begin persuading the person to invest in an alleged crypto platform that they say will give them lots of money and high returns.</p>
<p>Eventually, the person gives in and begins to put their money into the platform, not knowing that it’s controlled by the scammer and his or her associates. When they see that their funds are expanding and they’re potentially making money, they seek to make a small withdrawal. However, they usually can’t unless it’s a specific amount or they’re willing to put more money into the platform.</p>
<p>Most often, those who invest their money via romance scams never see their funds again, and the problem has been persisting for some time.</p>
<h2>Who Are the Suspects?</h2>
<p>The suspects in Nigeria are Odia Theophilus, age 24, and Ebo Junior Success, age 25. Their hideout was in Benin City in Edo State.</p>
<p>The state of crypto fraud has only grown over the past few years. Aside from romance scams, other major forms of fraud – such as what happened with <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">fallen crypto exchange FTX</a> – have also taken place.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-upside-break-could-trigger-more-gains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ethereum saw a strong increase</a> above the $1,350 level against the US Dollar.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite several bullish predictions for 2023, Brian Armstrong – the CEO of Coinbase – believes it will be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/12/24/cryptopocalypse-coinbase-ceo-issues-serious-contagion-warning-after-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-crash/?sh=58a54be1a07f" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">some time before the crypto</a> space relieves itself of the drama caused by FTX, and he doesn’t think 2023 will offer the improvement over 2022 that so many analysts are either predicting or hoping for.</p>
<h2>Brian Armstrong Doesn&#8217;t Think 2023 Will Offer Much Improvement</h2>
<p>FTX will likely go down as one of the biggest blunders of the crypto world. Once considered one of the largest and most popular digital currency trading platforms in the world, FTX took only three years to rise to fruition, and its head executive – a young man named Sam Bankman-Fried – was lauded as a genius, a reputation he would only hold temporarily.</p>
<p>In mid-November, he complained on <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">social media of a liquidity crunch</a>, and said that the exchange was in desperate need of fast cash. However, things didn’t quite go according to plan. Initially, he sought the aid of Binance, his largest rival. The idea was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">that the big exchange</a> would buy out the smaller one, thus giving it the support and money that it needed to stay afloat.</p>
<p>But Binance <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">eventually backed away</a> from the deal, claiming that the problems FTX was facing were far too big for it to handle. From there, the company had <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">to file bankruptcy</a> and SBF resigned from his post. This was to be the least of his problems as he would later be arrested in the Bahamas for allegedly tampering with people’s money. From there, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/sbf-ftx-extradition.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">would be extradited</a> to the United States, and he is currently awaiting his trial while living at his parents’ California home.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Armstrong explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think there could be a little more contagion from FTX, but my hope is that [everything moves] through the system in the next couple of months or quarters at most. After 18 months, people moved on and nobody asked me about it after that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many exchanges such as Armstrong’s Coinbase have been dealing with the aftermath of the FTX debacle. Coinbase has fallen into oblivion and its stock shares have plummeted from the near $300 unit prices they were enjoying when the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-spikes-following-public-debut-of-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">company first went public</a> in April of 2021.</p>
<p>It appears there are many exchanges out there that have fallen under a light of distrust. Nobody really sees exchanges as the powerhouses they once were anymore, and they are rushing to get their money out and into cold wallets or decentralized platforms.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Wants to Do Things the Right Way</h2>
<p>Armstrong continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The bull case for Coinbase is we&#8217;re the leader in the market from a trust point of view and the largest [exchange] in the U.S. The market is giving us very clear feedback that they want to work with trusted companies if they’re going to be centralized actors.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s happened again, folks. Another crypto hack is in the books. This time, the victim is alleged to be BTC.com, one of <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/btccom-lost-3-million-worth-of-cryptocurrency-in-cyberattack/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">the biggest crypto mining</a> pools in the world.</p>
<h2>BTC.com Hacked; A Lot of Money Gone</h2>
<p>The mining pool is believed to have lost as much as $3 million at the time of writing, which on paper, doesn’t appear as big as some of the other major hacks and scams that have occurred within the confines of the crypto space in recent years. However, it’s still another clear message that the digital currency arena is not where it needs to be. That safety measures aren’t as strong as we believe, and that the time has come for companies to step up and make sure all their users’ funds are safe and sound.</p>
<p>The money that was stolen belonged to both the company and its customers. BTC.com is reportedly the seventh largest crypto mining pool in the world and accounts for close to three percent of the bitcoin network’s total hash rate.</p>
<p>Approximately $700,000 in crypto was taken from the customers of the company, while just over $2 million belonged to BTC.com itself. The company explained in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the cyberattack, certain digital assets were stolen, including approximately US$700,000 in asset value owned by BTC.com&#8217;s clients, and approximately US$2.3 million in asset value owned by the company. On December 23rd, 2022, the authorities had launched an investigation, began collecting evidence, and had requested assistance from and coordination with relevant agencies. The company will devote considerable efforts to recover the stolen digital assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The event has been reported to Chinese law enforcement agencies, and it is alleged that some of the stolen funds have been recovered at press time, though just how much is presently unclear. The company continued its statement by claiming it is now implementing new security protocols designed to keep its customers’ funds safer in the future and that operations are continuing as normal. It said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the wake of discovering this cyberattack, the company has implemented technology to better block and intercept hackers. BTC.com is currently operating its business as usual, and apart from its digital asset services, its client fund services are unaffected.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Small Compared to Past Cases</h2>
<p>As bad as it all sounds, this is small beans when compared with major hacking incidents such as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/mt-gox/" data-wpel-link="internal">Mt. Gox</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coincheck/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coincheck</a>. Both took place in Japan approximately four years apart from each other, with Mt. Gox happening in February of 2014 and Coincheck in January of 2018, respectively.</p>
<p>Together, the companies lost more than $1 billion in crypto funds, with roughly $400 million in BTC taken from Mt. Gox and over half a billion in crypto stolen from Coincheck. The latter incident led to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/japans-cryptocurrency-association-to-vote-on-new-regulations-this-month/" data-wpel-link="internal">Japanese financial agencies</a> getting involved in crypto regulation and safety protocols.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, a Manhattan federal judge, will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/27/judge-trump-prince-andrew-trials-sbf-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">oversee the trial of</a> Sam Bankman-Fried. SBF is presently facing several charges in connection with the collapse of FTX. It is alleged that Bankman-Fried likely utilized customer funds to engage in Ponzi-like behavior and purchase luxury items such as Bahamas-based condominiums for himself and fellow FTX employees.</p>
<h2>Lewis Kaplan Will Decide SBF&#8217;s Fate</h2>
<p>Kaplan was a second-choice judge. The first one – who is unnamed at the time of writing – excused herself from the case given that her husband was employed by a law firm that did work with FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried. Thus, to avoid conflicts of interest, another judge has been given the case.</p>
<p>Kaplan has a “no-nonsense” attitude according to platforms like <em>The Guardian</em>. First nominated to the bench in 1994 by then-president Bill Clinton, Kaplan is 78 years of age and will be presiding over a case this coming April between President Donald Trump and <em>Elle</em> magazine advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, who alleges that Trump assaulted her in either 1995 or 1996. Trump has denied the accusation.</p>
<p>Kaplan also presided over a sex abuse claims case involving two women against Prince Andrew of England. Kaplan has garnered a reputation over the years for being short-tempered and very quick with his decisions, which can be a strength or a weakness depending on the circumstances of a case. In the one involving SBF, for example, several high-ranking members of society – including several members of Congress and politicians – were involved with Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-gave-a-lot-of-money-to-democrats-what-will-they-do-with-it/" data-wpel-link="internal">and even accepted donations</a> from his end of the table.</p>
<p>It will be in Kaplan’s interest to really observe all the facts and hear every point of both sides before deciding what is to come next. Given the size and the gravity of what happened, time will be necessary for understanding what really occurred and how such a large and proficient business could come crashing down so suddenly.</p>
<p>His purported tendency to become irritable with lawyers could wind up playing against him if he is not careful. In 1997, he presided over an immigration and asylum case that allegedly took too long. He snapped at the attorneys:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is about as expedited as a glacier going uphill… The INS has in the three years I’ve been on the bench acquitted itself in disastrous fashion more than once, but this one takes the cake, and I’m not going to stand for it much longer.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Long Legal History</h2>
<p>In 2000, he ruled in favor of the entertainment industry and said that it had a right to protect all DVDs from being burned or copied on computers. He explained during that case:</p>
<blockquote><p>Computer code is not purely expressive any more than the assassination of a political figure is purely a political statement.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>After forming a base above the $0.075 level, stellar lumen price started a fresh increase against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair broke the $0.080 resistance zone to move into a positive zone.</p>
<p>The price even broke the $0.0850 resistance and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-regains-traction-what-could-be-the-target/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. The price is now trading comfortably above the $0.084 level. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.0912 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.0950 level.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $0.0950 level might send the price towards the $0.100 level. Any more gains could lead the price towards the $0.0920 level or even $0.1000 in the coming days. An initial support on the downside is near the $0.0880 level.</p>
<p>It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0791 swing high to $0.0906 low. The next major support sits near the $0.0845 level. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.086 on the 4-hours chart.</p>
<p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0791 swing high to $0.0906 low. The main support is near the $0.080 zone. Any more losses could lead the price towards the $0.075 level in the near term, below which the price might even retest $0.0680.</p>
