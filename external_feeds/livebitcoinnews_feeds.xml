										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kevin O’Leary of “Shark Tank” fame is worried about how the U.S. <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/cryptocurrency/stablecoins/bitcoin-miami-kevin-oleary-are-stablecoins-the-future-of-investment-funds" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">government is dealing with</a> crypto regulation. He says the federal government is less concerned about policy and more concerned with taking fast action, and this is coming back to hurt innovation.</p>
<h2>Kevin O&#8217;Leary: All the U.S. Needs is Policy</h2>
<p>Right now, he says policy is all the U.S. needs when it comes to crypto. He commented that the government doesn’t need to do anything fancy or special. It just needs to implement the right rules to ensure the industry is safe and sound for all. O’Leary stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not looking for the federal government to provide innovation. I&#8217;m looking for them to provide policy. We don&#8217;t need them to develop anything. What we&#8217;ll do is license multiple stable coins, all backed by the U.S. dollar, and let them compete in the market.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said he thinks it’s very important that more action be taken to ensure all crypto companies are running on clean energy. This is an attitude he’s held for quite some time, going so far as to say a few years back that he would cease <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-mining-may-require-more-energy-than-180-countries/" data-wpel-link="internal">buying any crypto mined</a> in China given the country’s poor history with renewable energy (this was long before the country <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-crypto-mining-clampdown-in-china-is-not-over/" data-wpel-link="internal">outlawed crypto and</a> mining activity).</p>
<p>O’Leary was adamant that if crypto companies continued to walk the path that they’ve been walking over the past several years, the planet is going to suffer heavily. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have to listen to these people and realize we can&#8217;t mine coins using carbon offsets. We&#8217;ve got to go hydro; we&#8217;ve got to go nuclear. I am so glad I had to sell every share I had in a company that uses carbon offsets, because I see the writing on the wall and it&#8217;s not pretty.</p></blockquote>
<p>O’Leary isn’t the only person that has this attitude. Over the years, several reports have been written and published suggesting that crypto mining now utilizes more energy than most third-world or developing countries. In addition, big names like Elon Musk – the billionaire and South African entrepreneur behind companies like SpaceX and Tesla – have chimed in about crypto’s energy usage.</p>
<h2>Musk&#8217;s Attitude Towards Mining</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Musk made it clear he <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-permits-bitcoin-payments-for-tesla-vehicles/" data-wpel-link="internal">wanted Tesla customers to be able</a> to buy vehicles with bitcoin. This caused the price of the asset to shoot up, and everyone thought BTC was going to reach a new level of mainstream legitimacy.</p>
<p>However, it was not to be, as just a few weeks after that, Musk <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-has-taken-a-nasty-stumble-many-are-blaming-elon-musk/" data-wpel-link="internal">rescinded the decision</a>, claiming he was concerned about how much energy was being used to extract BTC from the blockchain and that he would only allow bitcoin-based purchases if miners were more transparent about their sources and used cleaner energy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A survey suggests that should the United States ever default, the public <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-would-be-more-trusted-than-the-dollar-as-a-safe-haven-if-the-us-defaults-survey-says/ar-AA1bdA1A" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sees bitcoin as more</a> of a “safe haven” than the U.S. dollar.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is a Bigger Safe Haven Than USD, Survey Says</h2>
<p>Things aren’t as strong as one would assume considering bitcoin only placed third on the list. The first “safe haven” viewed by participants was gold, meaning that if the U.S. defaults, most of these people would want to allocate their portfolios and wealth to gold. After that came Treasurys, and bitcoin placed third, meaning it’s still got a way to go in terms of earning general trust.</p>
<p>However, the news is good in that it means many people now feel safer towards bitcoin than they do fiat currency, and the asset has come a long way in a relatively short period. Bitcoin, as we all remember, has only been around since 2009. That’s about 14 years at this stage, so the fact that people can now see it in a stronger light than they do USD is a good sign that the industry is doing something right.</p>
<p>The survey in question was the Markets Live Pulse survey conducted by <em>Bloomberg</em>. The results suggest that about eight percent (or slightly less) see bitcoin as a stronger “safe haven” when compared to USD. This isn’t much, but it’s a step forward.</p>
<p>There are likely many reasons for this, the first one being that banks throughout the U.S. and Europe are crashing and burning like nobody’s business. Right now, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">institutions such as</a> First Republic, Signature, and Silicon Valley have all fallen into heaps of failure and are no longer in operation throughout America. Thus, the institutions that once came off as totally safe, sound, and secure are taking on the shape of unstable firms that can lose your coins or dollar bills the minute something troublesome happens.</p>
<p>The other reason could be that we have so many incapable people running the financial scene in the U.S. People like Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary, who <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-crypto-fans-may-want-to-wait-on-their-calls-for-regulation/" data-wpel-link="internal">in the past</a>, has commented that she felt inflation was a problem that would resolve itself. Also, there’s Jerome Powell, who despite all the trouble that he’s caused, still only resorts <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-fed-bitcoins-worst-enemy-right-now/" data-wpel-link="internal">to hiking interest rates</a> as a means of combating inflation.</p>
<h2>Treasurys Shouldn&#8217;t Be This High</h2>
<p>The interest rate hikes have done nothing but cause people to be shut out of the American dream. They can no longer afford cars, homes, or other large (yet necessary) items due to their inability to pay high interest. In addition, these interest rate hikes caused crypto prices to crash and burn throughout 2022.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, however, it’s a little shocking (and scary) to think people still trust Treasurys more than they do bitcoin given they placed second on the survey.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is climbing above $300 against the US Dollar, outperforming <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-in-control-above-29500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $325 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price formed a decent support base above the $180 level. BCH started a decent increase and was able to clear the $225 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the $250 and $280 resistance levels. It even spiked above $300 and traded as high as $326.42. It is now trading above the $280 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-rally-seems-unstoppable-above-130/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. The current price action is positive, suggesting high chances of more gains.</p>
<p>There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $270.00 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $320 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $325 level, above which the price may perhaps rise toward the $350 level. Any more gains above $350 could set the pace for a move toward the $400 level.</p>
<p>Immediate support on the downside is near the $300 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $220 swing low to the $326 high. The first major support sits near the $270 level and the trend line region.</p>
<p>The trend line is also near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $220 swing low to the $326 high. The next support is near the $245 zone, below which the bears might aim for $225. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $200 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is investing in crypto equivalent to gambling? That’s how the United Kingdom sees it, and leaders are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/17/cryptocurrency-trading-in-uk-should-be-regulated-as-form-of-gambling-say-mps?ref=dessenter.ghost.io" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">suggesting that crypto be regulated</a> in the same way the U.K. oversees gambling activities.</p>
<h2>The United Kingdom Sees Crypto Investing as Gambling</h2>
<p>To an extent, one can argue that investing in crypto is sort of a gamble. Whenever you buy bitcoin, Ethereum, or some other digital asset, you’re taking a chance… A chance that it could go down or up. You don’t know where it will be.</p>
<p>The same idea applies to sitting down at a blackjack table. You could win big, or you could lose it all in a matter of minutes. In that sense, crypto and gambling are one and the same, and this is the idea that’s making its way into the financial operations of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>U.K. authorities believe that like gambling, investing in crypto can be quite addictive, and thus traders won’t always know when to stop. Thus, necessary rules must be put in place to protect people from themselves. Conservative MP and Treasury committee chair Harriett Baldwin explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Effective regulation is clearly needed to protect consumers from harm, as well as to support productive innovation in the U.K.’s financial services industry. However, with no intrinsic value, huge price volatility, and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service and should be regulated as such. By betting on these unbacked ‘tokens,’ consumers should be aware that all their money could be lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, nothing is set in stone, and laws and rules are merely being suggested to the U.K. Parliament. However, should these rules pass, many analysts believe they will eventually influence future crypto regulations in the United Kingdom. Some even believe they will implement themselves <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/european-union-passes-heavy-string-of-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">into the MiCA</a> regulations recently passed by the European Union (EU).</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy about what’s going on. For example, a special committee under the Treasury has released a report claiming that crypto and blockchain are part of financial innovations that cannot – and should not – be governed under the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is where crypto regulation would occur in the U.K. The report said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not the government’s role to promote particular technological innovations for their own sake.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Some People Have Lost Everything</h2>
<p>Like gambling, there have been many people out that have ultimately gone nuts whenever a bull market has hit. They put all their money into something, expecting and believing with all their might that they will strike it rich within a set period.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t always the case. Crypto is often very volatile, and in years such as 2018 and 2022, there have been many instances of crypto traders losing all they have.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you run a cryptocurrency company in America and you’re getting tired of the regulatory confusion surrounding your industry? Are you sick of Gary Gensler and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) breathing down the back of your neck? If that’s the case, <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2023/05/17/france-welcomes-cryptocurrency-firms-fleeing-u-s-regulatory-uncertainty/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">you may want to give</a> France a try!</p>
<h2>France Wants American Crypto Firms</h2>
<p>France has commented that it will welcome all companies and enterprises in America devoted to blockchain and crypto as it’s aiming to build up its digital infrastructure and offerings. Regulators are currently working to establish a new framework that will make it so that the U.S. can benefit from its growing crypto environment. The goal is to also appeal to more crypto companies in the United States and appear more inviting – potentially inspiring some of them to move 4,000 miles across the Atlantic and set up stations within the country’s borders.</p>
<p>The United States has long talked about crypto regulation, and these calls for implementing it have only gotten stronger since last November’s <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX collapse</a>. Once one of the top digital currency exchanges, FTX fell into a heaping pile of bankruptcy and fraud, and it really scared American leaders and convinced them that the crypto industry was nothing but a bunch of criminals and fraudsters working together to gain access to the funds of innocent investors.</p>
<p>However, while the U.S. may be all about implementing crypto regulation, its methods for doing so have been questionable. The integration of regulation has fallen primarily on the shoulders of Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, and it’s become clear he’s not playing fair or clean. In fact, it appears persecution is the only tactic the old geezer is willing to try. Thus far, several big names in crypto – like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">Kraken</a> – have fallen victim to his antics, and many analysts are worried about what Gensler is doing to innovation and growth when it comes to crypto in the U.S.</p>
<h2>Trying to Create the Right Rules</h2>
<p>France has clearly taken notice of what’s going on in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and it wants to give entrepreneurs in the blockchain space a little leeway. For the most part, the European Union (EU) appears to be way ahead of the game when it comes to crypto regulation in that it recently implemented the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/european-union-passes-heavy-string-of-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">new MiCA rules</a>. France, being part of the EU, stands to gain a lot of traction in the coming weeks when it comes to crypto, though some things remain up in the air.</p>
<p>For example, right now, France is working on the types of crypto influences that can promote crypto business, as specific laws haven’t been set in stone, though this will likely be established firmly before we know it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jia is a blockchain-based fintech organization <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/jia-blockchain-based-lender-small-090101365.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">that offers small businesses and</a> emerging markets the loans they need to operate and stay afloat. In recent news, the company announced that it had secured more than $4 million in seed funding, while another $1 million (for a total of $5 million) was delivered to assist its commitment to on-chain liquidity.</p>
<h2>What Will Jia Do with the Money?</h2>
<p>The funding round featured the participation of well-known <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> and crypto firms including Block Tower, TCG Crypto, Hashed Emergent, Saison Capital, and Global Coin Research. In addition to the companies, several individual angel investors – including Packy McCormick, the founder of Not Boring, and Anand Lyer of Canonical Crypto – also donated funds to help the company move forward.</p>
<p>Jia says it will use the money to boost its operations in many up-and-coming or third-world nations like Kenya and the Philippines. It will also explore a wide array of new markets in regions such as Asia, Latin America, and West Africa. The idea is that many of these areas have seen their standard financial arenas suffer in recent years, and blockchain can assist them greatly.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Zach Marks, Ivan Orone, Yuting Wang, and Cheng Cheng. All previously worked at a firm called Tala and got to know each other in their previous positions. The company works to garner decentralized finance loans, which are then sent to borrowers.</p>
<p>Granted they repay the loans within certain timeframes they’re rewarded with special token offerings. These tokens can then be redeemed at rates based on Jia’s profits. CEO and co-founder Marks said in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea is to provide affordable financing for micro-businesses, and when they repay, they become owners by getting token rewards… The loans range in size from $200 up to $5,000… They are competitively priced. We charge about a third the interest rate of the typical consumer fintech lender.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How It Gets Customers</h2>
<p>The way Jia finds partners and customers is by utilizing their local apps. Among the many customers the firm currently serves is Ilara Health, a medical inventory company that works with over 2,000 small clinics. Marks said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ilara’s focus is on helping clinics grow by selling medicine [and] low-cost diagnostic devices. They don&#8217;t want to deal with credit risk[s] on their balance sheet, so we stepped in to finance an inventory financing program for them. We get access to proprietary data on these clinics, which helps us underwrite in a way that banks and other lenders can&#8217;t… What is exciting in what we&#8217;re doing is opening the world&#8217;s capital to MSMEs so they can receive affordable financing. Jia is not just providing financing. We are providing a path to economic resilience and this opportunity to build wealth in a new way that hasn&#8217;t been done before.</p></blockquote>

<li>The price is now trading below $0.720 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $0.718 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to decline if it stays below the $0.720 and $0.750 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is struggling below $0.75 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-in-control-above-29500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. The price might attempt to recover if there is a clear move above $0.720.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, EOS price saw a major decline from the $0.900 resistance against the US Dollar. The price traded below the $0.85 and $0.80 levels to move into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>Recently, there was a minor correction from the $0.600 zone. However, upsides were limited above the $0.770 level. A high is formed near $0.7731 and the price is again moving lower. There was a move below the $0.720 support.</p>
<p>It traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6030 swing low to the $0.7731 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $0.718 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair.</p>
<p>EOS is trading well below $0.75 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-bulls-sight-recovery-to-0-78/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.720 level.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $0.75 level. A clear move above the $0.75 level could start a steady increase toward the $0.78 level. The next major resistance might be $0.80. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.850 level.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near $0.642. The next key support is near the $0.620 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.620 support, the price could test the $0.603 support in the near term.</p>

<li>The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $86.50 resistance.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Litecoin price is correcting gains from $94 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-in-control-above-29500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. LTC price could resume its increase if it remains well supported above the $82.50 level.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, there was a decent increase in Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-eyes-more-gains-above-1920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a>, Ripple, and Litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC formed a base above the $75 level and started a fresh increase.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the $8 and $88 resistance levels. The price even climbed above the $90 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). However, the bears were active near the $94 zone. The recent high was formed near $93.82 and the price started a downside correction.</p>
<p>There was a move below the $90 level. The price traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $71.09 swing low to the $93.82 high.</p>
<p>It is now trading below $88 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $86 level. The next major resistance sits near the $88 level. A clear move above the $88 level could pump the price toward the $94 level. Any more gains might call for a test of $100.</p>
<p>Immediate support is near the $82.50 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $71.09 swing low to the $93.82 high.</p>
<p>There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $82.50 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair. The next major support is near the $79.20 zone. A downside break below the $79.20 support might start a strong decline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Executives behind the stable currency Tether – which is not only popular, but also somewhat controversial – have <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/tether-buys-222-million-worth-of-bitcoin-to-back-its-usdt-stablecoin/ar-AA1bj6a1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced they just bought</a> more than $200 million worth of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> as a means of backing their digital currency.</p>
<h2>Tether and Bitcoin&#8230; Together Again</h2>
<p>A stable currency is a digital currency that’s not subjected to the same volatility and speculative nature that one often sees with more mainstream cryptos, such as bitcoin and Ethereum. What makes them stable is that they are often supported by various forms of collateral, whether they be gold (or other precious metals) or fiat currencies like USD, the yen, or the yuan. Thus, they tend to retain their dollar pegs and don’t go crashing into oblivion like so many other assets have done in the past. One unit of a stable currency is often worth $1.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of stable coins out there, and Tether is arguably one of the biggest and most well-known. The goal amongst company members is to “diversify” reserves backing the token. The currency has been on a serious bull run since the early portion of the year, accumulating a net profit of close to $1.5 billion last March. It is also said that Tether reserves are near $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The decision to invest in bitcoin, the world&#8217;s first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset. Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would all be fine and dandy except back in 2019, Texas professor John Griffin <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195066" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">unveiled a report that</a> explained the full bull run of 2017 and the subsequent bear run in 2018 that occurred for the crypto industry. The report alleges that many Tether holders used their units to purchase BTC, thus tying the stable currency to the asset and keeping it afloat. This is what ultimately helped BTC reach $20K (it’s then all-time high) in the year 2017, though it also contributed greatly to the crash that followed the next year.</p>
<h2>Could This Be Problematic?</h2>
<p>While the circumstances are somewhat different this time around, the situation is virtually the same in that Tether and bitcoin are being tied together. Last time, Tether was supporting bitcoin. This time, bitcoin is supporting Tether. Could the reversal of the roles inherently cause bitcoin to fall again like it did five years ago? It’s a scary thought for many.</p>
<p>Previously, Tether held many of its reserves in commercial paper, which wasn’t considered safe, though it wound down its holdings to zero last February.</p>
