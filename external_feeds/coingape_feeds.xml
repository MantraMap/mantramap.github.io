With fear spreading across the States and beyond, it may soon become the third major bank to fail this year. This new development comes after the lender disclosed today that it had lost close to $100 billion in deposits during last month&#8217;s banking crisis.</p>
<h2>First Republic Bank Fears Collapse</h2>
<p>According to recent statements released by the financial institution, First Republic is attempting to unload between $50 billion and $100 billion in debt instruments as part of its &#8220;strategic options&#8221; to resolve the massive capital outflow. However, the White House is still concerned whether it has the bandwidth to find a way out from insolvency, as reports by Financial Times note that officials from the Biden Administration, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Federal Reserve</a>, and the Treasury Department met with the bank&#8217;s top executives in the past few days.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Binance Hits Snag As New China-Link Emerges; Are US Customers In Trouble?" href="https://coingape.com/binance-news-workforce-shanghai-china-trouble/" rel="bookmark">Binance Hits Snag As New China-Link Emerges; Are US Customers In Trouble?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Moreover, according to reputed Fox journalist <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino" rel="nofollow">Charles Gasparino</a>, bankers working at First Republic Bank claim that the government would take over the failing bank through &#8220;receivership&#8221; &#8212; similar to bankruptcy in the private sector &#8212; after the bank has exhausted all alternatives including asset sales and finding a buyer, all of which appear to be challenging at the moment. &#8220;Officials at the big banks believed the Feds were poised last week to take over FRC just before its earnings announcement crushed shares&#8221;, he further added.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">SCOOP (1/2): Bankers working w <a href="https://twitter.com/firstrepublic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@firstrepublic</a> bank say they expect eventual govt receivership for the ailing bank after it exhausts private sector solutions such as asset sales and finding a buyer, both of which appear difficult.

<p>&mdash; Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) <a href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1650944355316772865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>FRC Stock Drops While Bitcoin&#8217;s Price Rise</h2>
<p>In light of this news, the shares of First Republic plummeted to an all-time low in Tuesday&#8217;s trading session. Over 49% of the stock price was wiped off, bringing the total loss for the year to over 90%. The price per share hit an all-time low of $8.10 as the markets closed.</p>
<p>This has given rise to concerns regarding the volatility of the stock market as well as the cryptocurrency market. While the U.S. stock market exerted a mixed reaction to the news, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, on the other hand, rose by about 1.60%. Given Bitcoin&#8217;s meteoric price rise during the last American banking crisis, market participants and the larger crypto community expect a similar trend in the event of the banking giant&#8217;s failure.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">price of Bitcoin</a> has been on a downward spiral for the past few days, falling from $30,000 all the way down to $26,000. But with the news of another banking collapse, it could reignite the key principle of Bitcoin being a worthy alternative to the banking industry. In fact, this did play a role in Bitcoin&#8217;s early runup when Silvergate and Signature Bank &#8212; two crypto-friendly institutions &#8212; failed horribly last month.</p>
<p>As things currently stand, Bitcoin’s price is exchanging hands at $28,012.54 which represents a gain of 1.61% over the past one hour in comparison to a loss of 7.63% recorded over the past seven days.</p>

The aforementioned support associated with the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> creates a strong footing for buyers to recuperate bullish momentum. Thus, the reversal signs observed at this support give additional confirmation for potential price recovery. Here’s how you may trade amid the increasing negative sentiment in the market.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ongoing correction in the XRP price will continue until the resistance trendline is intact</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple technical levels accumulated near the $0.44 created high concentrated support zone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.05 Billion, indicating a 16.9% loss.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/Uc0O9ZQ7.png" alt="XRP Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the aggressive sell-off last week, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a> turned sideways above the $0.44 support. Moreover, the lateral movement shows a few lower price rejection candles indicating the buyers are actively defending this level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, a correction phase to the 50% retracement level is considered healthy and the price holds a strong possibility to resume prior recovery. The aforementioned rejection candles show an early sign of reversal that may bolster the XRP price to rise 5% and hit the $0.484 barrier.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-280-mln-xrp-on-the-move-whales-await-price-surge/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">280 Mln XRP On The Move; Whales Await XRP Price Surge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the technical chart shows a new resistance trendline trying to undermine the bullish momentum and prolong an ongoing correction. Thus, a potential reversal may gain an additional confirmation for recovery once the price breaches the overhead trendline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This possible breakout assists buyers to drive the XRP price back to $0.585 high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown below 50% retracement will gradually weaken the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a significant correction, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and the signal(orange) line moving above the midline reflects the overall market trend is bullish</span></p>
<p><b>EMAs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 100-and-200-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a> wavering near the $0.44 mark increases the support strength of this level.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.46</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.48 and $0.5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.44 and $0.4</span></li>

According to the reorganization plan that was accepted by the court, Voyager Digital will instead provide clients the ability to choose between receiving cash or <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> in the form of a &#8220;toggle option&#8221; on the Voyager platform.</p>
<h2>Binance Ends $1B Voyager Deal</h2>
<p>A U.S. bankruptcy judge gave the go-ahead for the sale to Binance.US just one month ago and according to the previous plan, customers&#8217; funds would have been recovered to the extent of 73%. However, this amount could have been reduced to 48% in the event that claims from the defunct cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> and its subsidiary <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a> were successful. There was a resounding 97% yes vote among the 6% of creditors who voted on the proposed Voyager plan.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today we received a letter from <a href="https://t.co/yG7Airmib5">https://t.co/yG7Airmib5</a> terminating the asset purchase agreement. While this development is disappointing, our chapter 11 plan allows for direct distribution of cash and crypto to customers (a “toggle option”) via the Voyager platform.</p>
<p>&mdash; Voyager (@investvoyager) <a href="https://twitter.com/investvoyager/status/1650921887512272917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The scheme, which would have allowed Voyager customers to switch over to Binance.US, was met with intense governmental investigation, leading the Securities and Exchange Commission to assert that Binance.US was operating an unregistered securities exchange in the United States. This may be one plausible reason why the US-based crypto exchange <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175304252380000000171.pdf" rel="nofollow">notified</a> Voyager of its termination earlier today.</p>

<h2>Voyager&#8217;s Next Steps</h2>
<p>In a tweet, the committee of unsecured creditors expressed extreme displeasure with the decision and indicated that it was looking into the possibility of bringing legal action against <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/binance-exchange-review/">Binance exchange</a>. In the meantime, the Committee and Voyager are focused on quickly utilizing the &#8220;toggle option that is outlined in the plan to move forward immediately with a self-liquidation&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Around 2 hours ago, <a href="https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW">https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW</a> purported to terminate the asset purchase agreement with Voyager. The Committee is incredibly disappointed with this decision and is investigating potential claims against <a href="https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW">https://t.co/5sjac1H4CW</a>.</p>

<p>In light of this news, the exchange’s native cryptocurrency BNB, witnessed a drop of roughly 0.22% in the past one hour. As things currently stand, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/binance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price of BNB</a> is exchanging hands at $329.46 and boasts a market cap of roughly $52 billion.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/crypto/21shares-cathie-wood-revive-bitcoin-etf-bid-after-price-rebound">report</a>, a previously filed ETF called &#8220;ARK 21Shares Bitcoin&#8221; (ARKB) that mirrors <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin">Bitcoin&#8217;s price</a> as determined by the S&amp;P Bitcoin Index is being brought back to life by 21Shares. The application comes at a time when there is widespread opposition to such funds from the US regulatory community. Both of 21Shares&#8217; applications for the product, the first one in 2021 and the second one in May of this year, were among the dozens of applications that were denied by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

<p>According to Hany Rashwan, the chief executive officer &amp; co-founder of 21Shares, the distinctive selling point of their <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bitcoin-etf/">Bitcoin ETF</a> is of the utmost importance given to &#8220;investor protection through and through.&#8221; While speaking about the new partnership and its recent Bitcoin ETF launch, Rashwan was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>American investors have been hurt by crypto scams that are primarily international and especially because there aren’t available, easy, regulated options at home.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We have seen greater demand from American investors for American-built products, especially over the past few months with bank failures and especially over the last year with international crypto blowups”, Rashwan further added.</p>
<h2>Fighting SEC&#8217;s Anti-Crypto Stance</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that regulators in the United States and elsewhere are beginning to pay closer attention to the digital assets industry, the filing arrives at a time when <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a> have witnessed a significant uptick after recovering from a gruesome 2022. Additionally, some market participants allege that virtual currencies can act as a safe haven to store money instead of having it with traditional banks.</p>
<p>In other news, Grayscale Investments is considering turning its Bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund. Following oral arguments in the case, reports have surfaced that the business&#8217;s chances of conversion have increased, which is part of the reason why the corporation <a href="https://coingape.com/grayscale-slams-the-sec-over-the-discriminatory-behaviour-in-the-lawsuit/">sued the SEC</a> a few months back in order to get court approval.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the price of Bitcoin dipped below $27,000 for a short period of time as the broader <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> continued its decline for five consecutive days. In light of this crypto news, Bitcoin’s price is currently exchanging hands at $27,356.83 which represents a gain of 0.10% over the past 24 hours in comparison to a loss of 9.39% recorded over the past seven days.</p>

As </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.animocabrands.com/animoca-brands-subsidiary-tinytap-raises-usd8500000-to-disrupt-education-with-web3"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by the parent company, TinyTap scored support from top investors in the space including Sequoia China, Liberty City Ventures, Kingsway Capital, Shima Capital, Polygon, and GameFi Ventures among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rate of funding in the Web3.0 ecosystem has slowed in recent times as the fall of FTX and other mainstream crypto entities generally dampened investor’s sentiments. The embrace of TinyTap by these high profile investors is a testament to its revolutionary technology to use the ethos of Web3.0 to educate users across the board.</span></p>
<h2><b>The TinyTap Concept</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">TinyTap employs a model whereby different publishers can create innovative games to educate the platform’s users. Since its inception in 2012, the startup has on boarded top brands including Sesame Street and Oxford University Press. At the moment, TinyTap boasts of more than 100,000 creators, all serving as many as 9.2 million families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The startup will utilize the newly raised funding to support its business expansion while also accelerating the growth of the EdTech space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since acquiring TinyTap in 2022, the education platform has launched its Web3.0 platform where it introduced the concept of Publisher NFTs. This innovation permits content creators to revenue in a rather sustainable way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Our Publisher NFTs genesis auctions demonstrated that the Web3 community is well suited and willing to support educators and educational content via this new powerful and equitable incentive system,” Yogev Shelly, CEO of TinyTap said in a statement, “By pairing educational content creators with interested promoters, we are able to benefit all parties fairly and take a significant step in our goal to put the power of learning back in the hands of educators, students, and the community.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><b>Animoca Brands is Supporting Diverse Innovations</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many believe that the eventual growth and adoption of the Web3.0 ecosystem as well as its attendant innovation will only come when there is a channel for the Real World application of the technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is what Animoca Brands is </span><a href="https://coingape.com/nft-defi-platform-vera-raises-3m-seed-round-led-by-animoca-brands/"><span style="font-weight: 400">known for</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as it has a rich history of raising funds to support all of the crucial aspects of blockchain including the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/animoca-brands-announces-2-billion-metaverse-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400">metaverse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-animoca-brands-to-launch-football-nft-marketplace/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Non-Fungible Tokens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (NFTs) and gaming amongst others. </span></p>

In the last ten days, the ETH price lost 15% as it plunged from a $2138 high to the current price of 1822. With no major sign of price reversal, this altcoin is likely to prolong its downfall to a lower level this week </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price correction to 50% FIB level will still be considered a healthy and higher probability for buyers to resume the prior uptrend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 100-and-200-day EMAs wavering near 50% FIB at $1700 create a strong accumulation zone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $8.1 Billion, indicating a 1.58% gain.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A V-top reversal in Ethereum’s daily time frame chart indicates aggressive selling pressure in the market. Amid this correction, the coin price also breached 26.3% Fibonacci retracement indicating a high possibility of downtrend continuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sustained selling, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">ETH price</a> may tumble another 8% and plunge to the combined support of $1700-$1675, 38.2% FIB level, and 200-day. Interested buyers should keep a close watch at the aforementioned level as its support strength could undermine the current selling pressure and resume the bullish recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown below $1675 will invalidate the bullish these and prolong the ongoing correction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning the current price of Ethereum, the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) on-chain metric indicates that 65.9% of DOGE addresses are in the money or realizing profits, whereas 31.85% are out of the money addresses witnessing losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the major portion of the holding addresses is in profits, decreasing the possibility for investors to sell the holding anytime soon.</span></p>

<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With today’s price drop, the Ethereum price plunged below the 50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> after six weeks offering an additional edge for short-sellers.</span></p>

Earlier in March 2023, crypto exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, have been <a href="https://coingape.com/us-cftc-sues-binance-cz-sued-for-regulatory-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> by the CFTC over regulatory violation. The lawsuit was registered for allegedly breaking trading and derivatives rules in the United States. This meant one of the biggest enforcement actions against a <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> business considering Binance is by far the largest crypto exchange.</p>

The exchange&#8217;s rulemaking petition demanded that the SEC write regulations explaining how securities laws are applicable to digital assets.</p>
<h2>CFTC Binance Lawsuit Settlement</h2>
<p>Kristin Johnson, CFTC commissioner, revealed that the agency has been in talks with Binance over its operations. Adding that there was hope to find a path forward in the lawsuit, the commissioner <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/cftc-commissioner-hopes-to-find-path-forward-in-binance-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> to CNBC whether it should be taken to courts or go for a settlement is yet to be decided. The lawsuit alleged that the exchange violated regulations pertaining to trading and derivatives</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have been in continuing conversations with the business (Binance) to describe what we understand is potentially problematic conduct and to give them an opportunity to explain that conduct and to help us find a path forward.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It may be recalled, however, that CZ rejected the CFTC&#8217;s claims about violating the law. Hence, it would be interesting to see how a common ground would be reached between the two parties.</p>

<h2>About 20% Workforce Based In China</h2>
<p>According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-25/binance-us-crypto-exchange-has-tech-workers-in-shanghai-china?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow">report</a> by Bloomberg that cites unnamed sources, the United States currently has approximately one hundred contract workers located in China&#8217;s biggest city and a global financial hub Shanghai. The majority of these people are employed in engineering and product-building departments. The proposal to move at least a portion of the workforce to North America has been in the works for at least a year, but there has been very little development on the matter.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Genesis Bankruptcy Proceedings May be Prolonged, Here’s Why" href="https://coingape.com/genesis-bankruptcy-proceedings-may-be-prolonged-heres-why/" rel="bookmark">Genesis Bankruptcy Proceedings May be Prolonged, Here’s Why</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance.US last month, alleging that there were ambiguities between Binance.US and Binance Holdings, the parent company for all Binance subsidiaries and affiliates. The <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/binance-exchange-review/">Binance exchange</a> has been accused of running a &#8220;intentionally opaque common enterprise&#8221; that ought to have been registered with the CFTC a long time ago but wasn&#8217;t, according to the agency&#8217;s announcement, which also mentions Zhao in its lawsuit and is seeking fines in addition to permanent trading and registration restrictions.</p>
<p>While speaking about the subject of manpower and staff, a spokesperson from Binance.US was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Binance.US has a global workforce of more than 500 employees and contractors that serve our US-based customers.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Will Binance Face Further Trouble?</h2>
<p>According to former senior US government officials quoted by Bloomberg, any linkages to the East Asian country in which Binance was established may cause authorities in the United States to investigate the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> further. As reported earlier on CoinGape, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Justice Department, and Internal Revenue Service have all conducted preliminary research and pursuing their own investigations against Binance.</p>
<p>Binance debuted its US operations back in 2019 using resources and employees &#8220;from the international platform, which at the time had operations in China&#8221;, according to the report. Some of the personnel based in Shanghai migrated over to the U.S. location over the course of time, while the US subsidiary continued to bring on new contractors based in the city.</p>
<p>In light of this Binance news, the exchange’s native cryptocurrency BNB, witnessed a drop of roughly 0.41% in the past one hour. As things currently stand, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/binance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price of BNB</a> is exchanging hands at $329.66 and boasts a market cap of roughly $51 billion.</p>

This retracement has plunged the coin price by 12.38% within a fortnight and plunged the prices to the $17250 mark. This support most likely caused a temporary halt so sellers can recuperate bearish momentum for further rallies. Here are the key levels to watch amid the current correction.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin price breakout from the current range formation will determine the near future price movement</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a higher possibility, a breakdown below the range support of $17250 will pull the Bitcoin price to $16750 mark.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $15.4 Billion, indicating a 5.43% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/n/nPsZeGY3.png" alt="BTC Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past three days, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> had been wobbling in a narrow range from $27900 to $27250. After a significant drop, this consolidation is a short break where the rising buying pressure gets neutralized, and the sellers eventually resume the prevailing downfall upon the breakdown of range support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the 4-hour candle closes below the $27250 support, the selling pressure will accelerate and plunge the prices to the immediate support of $26750 accompanied by a 32.8% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a>.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals-and-how-do-they-work/">What Are Bitcoin Ordinals And How Do They Work?</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This aforementioned level is a crucial level to watch as buyers may have regrouped near this support to offset the ongoing retracement. A bullish reversal from $26750 will encourage buyers to rechallenge the $30000 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below $26750 will dump the price straight to a 50% retracement level of $25200-$25000.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index:</strong> A bullish divergence in the 4-hour <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI</a> indicates rising buying pressure in the market as buyers try to wrestle for trend control.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the 20 <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope acts as a dynamics resistance currently carrying the ongoing correction phase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $27397</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $27900 and $2900</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $27250 and $26750</span></li>

According to the embattled firm, the bankruptcy proceedings agreed on about 2 months ago have been rejected by a group of unnamed creditors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the company, it has not been able to fully comprehend the reasons behind why the creditors backed up from the previous agreement but it revealed that the process may not be concluded in due time as might be envisaged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;More than two months after all parties agreed to a comprehensive settlement that was submitted by Genesis Capital to the bankruptcy court, a group of Genesis Capital&#8217;s creditors have reneged and raised all new demands,&#8221; the DCG statement reads, &#8220;We do not know if the hundreds of thousands of individual creditors are aware of this development, but the latest maneuver will prolong the court process.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Genesis </span><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-lender-genesis-filed-for-bankruptcy-amid-troubles/"><span style="font-weight: 400">filed for bankruptcy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in January and stands as one of the frontline casualties from the collapse of major hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) as well as FTX Derivatives Exchange. While the company was placed on life support following 3AC’s support, the frailty in its finances became evident when FTX filed for bankruptcy last November.</span></p>
<h2><b>Genesis is Committed to Finding a Solution</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the statement shared, the company is still very committed to finding a speedy solution to repay all of its creditors. Part of the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-prices-to-recover-as-dcg-genesis-gemini-and-creditors-reach-agreement/"><span style="font-weight: 400">earlier agreement reached</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with its creditors earlier in the year was to liquidate some of the assets of the company in order to repay a significant part of its current debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Genesis is currently owing the sum of $3.6 billion to the top 50 creditors chief of whom is Gemini exchange which has a claim of about $900 million belonging to its previous Earn customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the new course of action remains obscure following the rejection of the earlier plan, Genesis said it “committed to reaching a fair outcome for all and while we look forward to a constructive mediation process, we will have to weigh any new demands against the concessions we&#8217;ve previously made.”</span></p>

With another massive LUNC burn, the total burn by Cremation Coin has reached nearly 369 million LUNC tokens.</p>
<p>The latest burn gave some relief to the crypto community amid a continued decline in the LUNC burn rate, with the weekly LUNC burn chart almost appearing flat.</p>
<h2>Cremation Coin Burned Over 24 million Terra Classic Tokens</h2>
<p>As per the burn <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://finder.terra.money/classic/tx/BB47537591BD3BF9A7C2BA1F832EB91627F867469E03BBE5FC4DBD57D81CA32E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transaction</a>, <strong>Cremation Coin</strong> sent 24.04 million LUNC tokens to the burn address on April 25. Also, the transaction fee for the transfer was 48k LUNC.</p>
<p>Cremation Coin took to Twitter to announce the latest burn and shared the details of the transactions of both LUNC and CREMAT burns. While other projects and validators have stopped contributing to the LUNC burn campaign to reduce the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/circulating-supply/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulating supply</a>, Cremation Coin burned 24 million LUNC tokens.</p>
<p>The total LUNC burns by the Terra Classic community reached <strong>53.45 billion LUNC</strong>, with Cremation Coin contributing 368.95 million LUNC in total. However, the drop in the LUNC burn rate as well as the prices raised some concerns for the community.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-projects-to-burn-millions-of-lunc-key-proposals-passed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new projects coming onto the network</a> are expected to increase the LUNC burn rate in the coming months. <strong>TerraPoker</strong> commits to burn 10% of the rake fees collected through its poker game, after <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-luna-classic-supports-parameter-change-proposal-lunc-price-dump-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal 11477 was passed</a> by the community. Others such as validator <strong>LUNC DAO</strong> and project <strong>GenesisX50</strong> promise to continue the LUNC burns.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price To Rally?</h2>
<p>LUNC price remains under pressure as Terra Luna Classic community <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-core-developers-edward-kim-zaradar-leave-joint-l1-task-force/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing a minor crisis</a> as core developers <strong>Ed Kim</strong> and <strong>Tobias “Zaradar” Andersen </strong>left the Joint L1 Task Force developer team. The community remains divided over the capabilities of the new Joint L1 Task Force.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/terra-luna-classic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LUNC price</a> fell 1% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.000109. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000108 and $0.000111, respectively. The price is trading below the key support level and a recovery will be difficult amid the current market conditions.</p>

This retracement phase offers a discount opportunity in well-established cryptos and our favorite <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoins</a>. In this article, we’ll analyze these popular currencies to determine buying opportunities and future potential.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin(DOGE)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/j/jHCXuutL.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 3rd, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/">Dogecoin price</a> gave a massive breakout from a resistance trendline which carried a sustained downfall for over four months. After the breakout the resistance which limited growth potential is offering significant support to buyers indicates the market sentiment shifted from selling on rallies to buying dips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing correction phase in the market, the DOGE price revisits the support trendline and forms an inverted flag pattern shown in the above chart. If the coin price manages to breach the overhead trendline of the triangle, the buying pressure will intensify and signal the start of a fresh recovery rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the DOGE price trades at $0.0787 with an intraday gain of 0.09%. The recovery triggered by the triangle breakout may encourage buyers to rechallenge the $0.1 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiba Inu(SHIB)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/oUZxezX3.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 4-hour time frame chart, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu price</a> shows the formation of an inverted flag. In theory, this pattern signals the resumption of prevailing downfall if the prices break the lower trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a potential breakdown may tumble the SHIB price by 5.38% and plunge it to local support of $0.00000968. The aforementioned level accompanied by 78.6% Fibonacci retracement support indicates a strong support zone for buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a country note, a breakout above the triangle resistance trendline may encourage buyers to drive the price rally to $0.00001173.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floki(FLOKI)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/i/iO5F96of.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 24th, the Floki price witnessed a massive inflow which is more likely associated with its <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-news-support-for-floki-inu-meme-season-incoming/">listing announcement</a> on the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance. With a 56% intraday jump, the prices breached a monthly resistance of $0.000042.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the news-driven rally couldn’t sustain above the breached barrier, and thus, the Floki prices tumbled 16.8% today and currently trades at $0.0000373. This bull trap could increase selling pressure in the market and plummet this memecoin 27% to revisit $0.000027 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aforementioned support has assisted buyers to sustain higher prices for nearly a month and therefore could offer a strong accumulation phase for interested traders.</span></p>

<p>On chain tracker highlighted that a whale address holding 79,957 Bitcoin. The wallet reportedly didn’t get active as no BTC has been moved from this wallet in the last 12 years. However, it is speculated that this address belongs to the Mt.Gox hacker. Meanwhile, someone randomly sent 0.00001 Bitcoin in the past year. <a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/bitcoin-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More Bitcoin News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>

Prosecutors froze $185 million in assets as part of the investigation, with Bitcoin worth millions remaining in a Swiss bank.</p>
<p>The action came after a <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-luna-is-not-a-security-declares-s-korean-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Korean court on Monday dismissed</a> prosecutors&#8217; appeal to confiscate Daniel Shin&#8217;s properties and his arrest for violating the Capital Markets Act.</p>
<h2>Terra Founders Do Kwon and Daniel Shin Faces Prosecutors&#8217; Wrath</h2>
<p>The Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office indicted Terra co-founder Daniel Shin and seven others without detention for multiple charges including fraud, breach of duty, and embezzlement. While two were indicted for breach of trust, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20230425009600315?input=tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> Korean news agency Yonhap on April 25.</p>
<p>Shin and others pocketed nearly $300 million won in illegal profits from Terra ecosystem tokens by marketing and promoting these cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In a press conference after the prosecution indicted 10 people, head prosecutor Dan Seong-han said the prosecutor’s office will continue to track Bitcoin holdings and transactions by TFL and LFG. Do Kwon still have Bitcoin worth millions in a Swiss bank, after converting some into cash last year.</p>
<p>Earlier, the U.S. SEC revealed that Do Kwon cash out about $100 million worth Bitcoin from a Swiss bank. Some amount was transferred to Kim &amp; Chang law firm for paying legal fees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Do Kwon was detained and <a href="https://coingape.com/montenegro-charges-terra-do-kwon-extradition-delayed-further/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicted in Montenegro</a> for passport forgery. Daniel Shin and others were behind the structuring of the TerraUSD and LUNA cryptocurrencies, causing $60 billion wipe-out in the Terra-LUNA crisis.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are also seeking the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro. The U.S. prosecutors also indicted Terra and Do Kwon for fraud and seek extradition. The extradition will take months as court proceedings for extradition haven&#8217;t started yet.</p>
<p>Terra (LUNA) and Terra Classic (LUNC) prices remains under pressure after Do Kwon&#8217;s arrest and prosecutors&#8217; office continued action against Daniel Shin and related entities. LUNA price trades at $1.24, while <a href="https://coingape.com/price/terra-luna-classic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LUNC price</a> is at $0.000109, down 1% in the last 24 hours.</p>
