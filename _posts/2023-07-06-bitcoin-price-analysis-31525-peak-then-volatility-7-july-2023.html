<p>BTC/USD Bulls Stampede to 31525 Before Volatility:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 7 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) attempted to retain recent strong advances early in the Asian session as the pair was lifted to the 31525.10 area, a fresh twelve-month high, after Stops were elected above the 31443.67 area that had represented a recently-established yearly high.&nbsp; Buying pressure emerged around the 30328.79 area and follow-on technical activity around the 30439.66 and 30575.66 areas accelerated the move.&nbsp; &nbsp;During a volatile pullback, buying pressure initially emerged around the 31828 level, a move lower to test the 38.2% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 30189.56 to 31525.10.&nbsp; Stops were eventually elected below the 31014, 30857, and 30699 areas during the eventual profit-taking depreciation, and additional downside retracement levels include the 30504 and 30475 areas.</p>
<p>Above the market, additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.&nbsp; Following recent activity, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
