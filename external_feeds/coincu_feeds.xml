<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-10.png"><img decoding="async" width="709" height="473" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-10.png" alt="Nigerian SEC Plans To Support The Issuance Of Tokens But &quot;Excluding Crypto&quot;: Bloomberg" class="wp-image-184909" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-10.png 709w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-10-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" title="Nigerian SEC Plans To Support The Issuance Of Tokens But &quot;Excluding Crypto&quot;: Bloomberg 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Nigeria&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to broaden market participation by processing trial applications for digital exchanges. While the Central Bank of Nigeria restricts cryptocurrency trading, the SEC is considering allowing tokenized coin offerings on licensed digital exchanges backed by assets such as equity, debt, and property. This move is expected to attract digitally-savvy individuals in the nation of over 200 million, including 43% of the population below the age of 14, to local assets like equities that have been shunned for years.</p>



<p>Paxful reports that Nigeria has the highest volume of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions outside the US. Other countries are also experimenting with similar tokens. For example, DBS Bank Ltd., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and Marketnode Pte are leading &#8220;Project Guardian&#8221; in Singapore, which aims to explore the potential uses of asset tokenization. It involves creating a permissioned liquidity pool with tokenized bonds and deposits.</p>



<p>The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to register fintech firms as digital sub-brokers, crowdfunding intermediaries, robo-advisors, fund managers, and tokenized coin issuers. Digital exchanges, however, will not be registered until standards are agreed upon with the central bank, which has banned cryptocurrency transactions. </p>



<p>Digital exchanges in the country will undergo a year of regulatory incubation, during which they will offer only skeletal services that will be monitored by the SEC. The SEC will study their operations and determine by the tenth month whether to register the firm, extend the incubation period, or ask the firm to stop operations.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a cooperative market maker of TUSD, the main purpose of TRON DAO Venture&#8217;s deposit of TUSD is to promote market making among TUSD&#8217;s leading exchanges, thereby improving liquidity and trading volume, rather than participating in any exchange promotions,&#8221; <a href="https://news.coincu.com/181358-justin-suns-withdrawal-sparks-crypto/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/181358-justin-suns-withdrawal-sparks-crypto/">Justin Sun</a> tweeted in response to Changpeng Zhao. Our market maker has reached a total trading volume of 40 million US dollars in the last several hours, contributing to the stability of the TUSD price.Â </p>



<p>According to him, certain team members did not fully comprehend the intended use of these money and, as a result, used some of them mistakenly to participate in exchange activities. When they realized their error, they immediately contacted the exchange team and arranged for a full refund. He also expressed regret for the oversight.</p>

<p>Today, Justin Sun sent 405 million TUSD to Binance in ten transactions, according to reports. Changpeng Zhao indicated that Justin Sun has been told not to use his TUSD in SUI new currency mining or he will take action against him.</p>



<p>Changpeng Zhao (CZ) issued a warning. CZ stated that if Sun uses TUSD to join Sui LaunchPool, he would face consequences. CZ further stressed that the Binance LaunchPool is intended for retail consumers, not just a few whales.</p>



<p>This event emphasizes the significance of transparency and effective money management in the cryptocurrency business. It is critical that all individuals involved understand the intended use of the funding and act properly and ethically. It is worth noting that TRON DAO Venture acts as a TUSD partner market maker, facilitating market-making between prominent TUSD exchanges rather than participating in exchange advertising.</p>

<p>BIT Mining has recently launched a new generation of mining machines, the LD4, designed explicitly for the Dogecoin and Litecoin blockchains. Boasting peak hashrate and energy efficiency, the LD4&#8217;s peak output can reach 5GH/s, making it the superior choice for Litecoin and Dogecoin mining. </p>



<p>The LD4 is the third ASIC mining machine developed by BIT Mining since its acquisition of mining hardware manufacturer Bee Computing in 2022. It has reliable design features such as excellent heat dissipation and a computing chip that can frequently work at lower temperatures, extending its lifecycle.</p>



<p>The LD4 boasts improved security features over the previous generation, with hardware and high-level security software protection against known vulnerabilities. Its single airflow channel design also enables the deployment of more machines in limited spaces, simplifying assembly and maintenance processes and lowering operational costs.</p>



<p>BIT Mining&#8217;s dedication to advancing the industry through state-of-the-art technology and increased efficiency positions the company as a technical leader. LD4&#8217;s advantages, such as its single airflow channel mining machine design and aluminum PCBs, make it a significant improvement from LD3 in terms of durability, portability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness.</p>



<p>BIT Mining is a cryptocurrency mining company driving the industry forward with innovative technology and increased efficiency. They specialize in cryptocurrency mining, mining pool, data center operation, and mining machinery manufacturing. </p>



<p>They own BTC.com, the world&#8217;s top blockchain browser, and operate a comprehensive mining pool that provides multi-currency mining services, including BTC, ETC, and LTC. BIT Mining also owns a 7nm cryptocurrency mining machine manufacturer, Bee Computing, which enables the company to be self-sufficient through vertical integration with its supply chain.</p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase announced that it had received all regulatory approvals and that the deal (purchase of First Republic Bank) was completed. JPMorgan Chase stated it would pay the FDIC $10.6 billion for the acquisition of First Republic Bank. JPMorgan Chase would also return $25 billion in deposits from major US banks and cancel a $5 billion deposit owing to JPMorgan by (First Republic Bank).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of the United States will supply it with $50 billion in fixed-rate financing over five years. The weekend auction, which received offers from JPMorgan Chase and PNC as well as interest from other institutions, was a &#8220;highly competitive bidding process,&#8221; according to the FDIC.</p>



<p>According to the regulator, the transaction will cost the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund an estimated $13 billion. In comparison, the SVB process cost the fund approximately $20 billion. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation announced Monday that it had taken custody of First Republic and designated the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver. JPMorgan&#8217;s bid for the bank&#8217;s assets was accepted by the FDIC.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>According to Changpeng Zhao, the banking industry is becoming increasingly inefficient, and the collapse of banks has nothing to do with the development of encryption technologies.</em></li>



<li><em>He said that the most challenging issue is securing the support of banks, particularly if banks are extremely eager to cooperate and engage with encrypted companies. He thinks this will be the case if banks are particularly interested in working with encrypted enterprises.</em></li>

<p>In an <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1lPKqBdRkbLGb?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1lPKqBdRkbLGb?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMA</a>, Binance CEO <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184404-changpeng-zhao-282-billion-wealth-assessed/">Changpeng Zhao</a> stated that the banking business is becoming increasingly inefficient, and that the failure of banks has nothing to do with the growth of encryption. Cryptocurrency is simply a method for people to invest. People do not jump into crypto after failing their banks since they want various forms of assets.Â </p>



<p>&#8220;The better the banking system, the better cryptocurrency.&#8221; He added that the developers should concentrate on making encryption easier to use. He believes that the largest issue in the face of regulation in various regions is the assistance of banks, if banks are especially eager to work and interact with encrypted firms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this method, the market may achieve true and convenient liquidity integration between the traditional financial system and the encrypted financial system, which benefits both sides. He stated that he believes bank support and education, particularly financial education, are extremely important and that we devote a significant amount of time and energy to them. Hong Kong is embracing cryptocurrency, which is a welcome move. As China&#8217;s &#8220;encryption testing ground,&#8221; I believe Hong Kong is prudent.</p>



<p>In addition, Changpeng Zhao has indicated that he does not participate in the process of listing projects on Binance and that he is not familiar with the majority of the projects that are listed there. The number of registered users on Binance is the primary factor considered by the independent committee that evaluates applications for listing on the exchange.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/182170-pepe-gained-21000-in-3-day/">PEPE</a>, a fresh 17-day-old initiative, maintains its lead in this year&#8217;s memecoin season with strong growth. The token has gained by 84.1% in the last 24 hours and 241.5% in the last 7 days, according to CoinGecko. This token nearly surpassed the top 100 largest coins on the market in the early afternoon of May 1, 2023, with a current market value of 451.5 million USD.</p>



<p>As a result, the green frog became the market&#8217;s third largest memecoin, trailing only two dogs, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Furthermore, the community anticipates that the &#8220;green frog&#8221; token will progress toward its goal of becoming a &#8220;billion dollar memecoin&#8221; comparable to DOGE and SHIB.</p>



<p>With market capitalizations of $400 million and $322.5 million, respectively, the growth of PEPE pushed BABYDOGE and FLOKI to fourth and fifth place. The PEPE community is celebrating the project&#8217;s top 100 milestone, which has resulted in the $PEPE keyword trending on Twitter recently.</p>

<p>Of course, with such rapid expansion, there is no shortage of &#8220;life-changing&#8221; examples made possible by PEPE. The unifying feature of these wallets is that, because to &#8220;early entry,&#8221; purchasing PEPE at a low cost makes it simple to open accounts. Despite being heavily promoted on all fronts by the community, investors must remain vigilant in order to assess risks and limit fomo at this time.</p>



<p>It is obvious that this meme coin has generated enormous profits, but the capitalization is currently too massive, making it difficult to increase several times. Furthermore, there are many large wallets (whale) holding a large amount of PEPE, so a profit-taking dump is not ruled out.</p>



<p>Furthermore, it is understandable for investors to be looking for other memecoins similar to PEPE or AIDOGE. To avoid &#8220;losing money,&#8221; however, it is vital to be vigilant of sophisticated fraudulent methods.</p>

<p>In recent news, Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, has made a significant transfer of 59 million TUSD to Binance. Sun stated that this transfer was intended solely to provide liquidity, but Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) responded with a warning. CZ said that if Sun uses TUSD to join Sui LaunchPool, action will be taken against him. CZ also emphasized that Binance LaunchPool is meant for retail users, not just for a few whales.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our team told Justin, if he uses any of these to grab the LaunchPool Sui token, we will &quot;take action against it&quot;.

</div></figure>



<p>This situation highlights the importance of transparency and proper use of funds in the cryptocurrency industry. It is essential for all parties involved to have a clear understanding of the intended purpose of the funds and to act responsibly and ethically. It is worth noting that TRON DAO Venture serves as a partner market maker for TUSD and aims to facilitate market-making between leading TUSD exchanges rather than participating in exchange promotions.</p>



<p>Later, Justin Sun revealed that some of his team members inadvertently used some funds to participate in exchange campaigns. Upon realizing their error, they promptly refunded the funds. This serves as a reminder that proper communication and management of funds are crucial, especially in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Regrettably, some of our team members were not fully aware of the intended purpose for these funds and inadvertently used a portion of them to participate in exchange campaigns.

</div></figure>



<p>On the bright side, this situation highlights the transparency of blockchains. The public nature of blockchain technology makes tracking and verifying transactions easier, ensuring that all actions are transparent and accountable.</p>



<p>As for the future relationship between TRON and Binance, it remains to be seen. Nevertheless, this event has brought attention to the need for clear communication and ethical use of funds in the cryptocurrency industry. This situation emphasizes the importance of responsible and transparent behavior to maintain the wider community&#8217;s trust.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>NFTs worth $3.23 million were stolen in April 2023, a 68% reduction from the previous month.</em></li>



<li><em>Within two hours, half of the stolen NFTs were sold on the market.</em></li>



<li><em>Approximately 70% of stolen NFTs were initially sold on Blur.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have spurred renewed interest in blockchain technology.

<p>According to PeckShieldAlertâs early warning and monitoring, in April 2023, NFTs worth approximately $3.23 million were stolen, a decrease of 68% from the previous month. Half of the stolen NFTs were quickly sold on the market within 2 hours. About 70% of stolen NFTs were first sold on Blur, followed by OpenSea (27.94%).</p>

<p>Compared to 2 months ago, this is the lowest level since the beginning of the year when February saw $16.2 million stolen in the NFT market.</p>



<p>The recent theft of MAYC #8530, an NFT, has reignited these fears. In this post, we will go into the specifics of the robbery, the blockchain community&#8217;s reaction, and what it implies for the future of the NFT business. MAYC #8530, an NFT, was allegedly unsold for 528 days before being stolen. The most recent transaction prior to the heist was for 7.45 ETH, which is equal to $14,195.30. The MAYC #8530 sold for a 10.7 Blur Pool shortly after PeckShield&#8217;s notice.</p>

<p>Ancilia, a blockchain security company, is trying to avoid breaches and cut losses for Web3 firms. Ancilia&#8217;s work is especially essential considering the industry&#8217;s rising occurrence of hacks and thefts. The firm offers a variety of security services, such as vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and incident response.</p>



<p>Regardless of one&#8217;s feelings about theft, it is evident that security will remain a big problem in the NFT industry. As the value and ubiquity of NFTs rise, it is expected that hackers and other harmful actors will become more focused on exploiting system weaknesses.</p>

<li><em>PeckShield reported in April this year, 41 crypto hacking incidents occurred, with a total of $93.4 million stolen.</em></li>



<li><em>1245 ETH and 2515 BNB had been converted to Tornado Cash as of April 30, while 203 ETH had been transferred to Fixed Float.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The recent market rally has created a wave of interest in the crypto community. However, as the industry grew, so did security concerns and the possibility of theft. In the past month, crypto-related theft has also recorded numbers worth considering.</strong></h5>

<p>PeckShield&#8217;s monitoring showed that in April this year, 41 hacking incidents occurred, with a total of $93.4 million stolen. As of April 30, 1245 ETH and 2515 BNB were transferred to Tornado Cash, and 203 ETH were transferred to Fixed Float.</p>



<p>Additionally, &#8220;jaredfromsubway.eth&#8221; earned at least $1.4 million from sandwich attacks involving PEPE. The &#8220;jaredfromsubway.eth&#8221; was wedged between crypto traders, mostly those wagering on tokens like PEPE and CHAD.</p>



<p>Sandwich bots are early adopters of freshly released tokens like PEPE and CHAD &#8211; meme currencies with no inherent value that captured the attention of Crypto Twitter degens virtually overnight as the tokens skyrocketed over 10,000%.</p>

<p>CertiK, a crypto security and auditing company, also published an April overview of crypto vulnerabilities, scams, and hacks, indicating a total loss of $103.7 million in April, increasing the year-to-date total loss to $429.7 million.</p>

<p>According to CertiK, the sum lost to crypto and DeFi exploits in the month was $74.5 million, accounting for over half of the total $145 million exposed in the first four months of the year.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the exit scam occurred after CertiK audited the protocol and warned about centralization issues. Following the attack, CertiK launched a compensation plan in which it urged the rogue developer to return 80% of the stolen funds in exchange for a 20% white hat bounty.</p>



<p>The most recent was the Polygon-based Ovix protocol, which lost $2 million in an April 28 flash loan attack.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>According to Dune Analytics, daily Ordinals Inscriptions set a new all-time high of more than 300,000 yesterday.</em></li>



<li><em>The all-time high daily average transaction count on Bitcoin might be attributed to Inscriptions, which have boosted demand for block space on the dominant blockchain.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The number of daily Inscriptions for Bitcoin Ordinals hit a new all-time high, a remarkable achievement while it was still in development.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="658" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-1024x658.png" alt="Ordinals Minted Hit A New All-time High, Reaching Over 300,000" class="wp-image-184854" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-1024x658.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-300x193.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-768x493.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-1536x987.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-750x482.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-1140x732.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3.png 1782w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ordinals Minted Hit A New All-time High, Reaching Over 300,000 33"></a></figure></div>


<p>At least, it seems like Bitcoin Ordinals have taken over Web3. Since software programmer Casey Rodarmor unveiled the protocol on January 21, the area has been humming, with some delighted about the new improvement and others swearing off Ordinals completely. At the time of writing, there are over 2,690,204 Ordinals in circulation.</p>



<p>Grayscale indicated in an April 27 Market Byte blog post that Ordinals give two significant advantages to the growth and development of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The first is a significant rise in fees paid to miners since the protocol&#8217;s inception in January. Grayscale said that this would assure continuous network security throughout the Bitcoin network&#8217;s existence.</p>



<p>Ordinals and the velocity of NFT adoption, according to the firm, might also attract new Bitcoin users and spur additional development on the Bitcoin network.</p>



<p>According to a frequently <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used</a> Dune dashboard, Ordinals set a new record on April 30 with over 300,000 daily inscriptions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-09.41.40.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="550" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-09.41.40-1024x550.png" alt="Ordinals Minted Hit A New All-time High, Reaching Over 300,000" class="wp-image-184855" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-09.41.40-1024x550.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-09.41.40-300x161.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-09.41.40-768x412.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-09.41.40-750x403.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-09.41.40-1140x612.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-09.41.40.png 1468w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ordinals Minted Hit A New All-time High, Reaching Over 300,000 34"></a></figure></div>


<p>The daily record for inscriptions created was broken four more times in April alone. On April 2, there were around 72,000 inscriptions, and on April 23, there were over 193,000 inscriptions.</p>



<p>Despite what appears to be a large number, the vast majority of people simply do not know how to buy them, let alone create them. With increasing entrance hurdles, intriguing possibilities exist. However, it also means greater risks.</p>



<p>At the same time, according to blockchain analytics startup IntoTheBlock, the quantity of Bitcoin transactions is approaching levels not seen in many years. According to the business, the weekly average of daily Bitcoin transactions was over 396,000 on Sunday, the highest level since December 2017.</p>



<p>All of this is to imply that Ordinals on Bitcoin may not only represent a cultural shift for Bitcoin, but they may also be a technological upgrade over NFTs. Ordinals&#8217; dramatic ascent has been a contentious subject in the larger Bitcoin community, with Bitcoin maximalists heavily criticizing them for deviating from Bitcoin&#8217;s initial purpose as a peer-to-peer electronic money and cluttering up precious block space.</p>
