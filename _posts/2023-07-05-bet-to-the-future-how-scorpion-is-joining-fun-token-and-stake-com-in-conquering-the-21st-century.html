<p>Great Scott! Just as crypto itself is constantly evolving, so is its close relative, the world of online crypto gambling! Despite the huge success that many platforms within the market have already experienced, this hybrid industry is still young and growing in prominence, meaning right now is an important time to pay attention to all the progress it's making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good way to track this is by taking a look at the future long-term plans of some of the best platforms around, such as Scorpion Casino (SCORP), Fun Token (FUN) and Stake.com. Scorpion is especially worth paying attention to at the moment - read more to find out why.</p>
Scorpion Aims To Change The Game!
<p>Scorpion Casino is currently in the midst of a widely successful presale, which will end with the launch of its native Scorpion Token (SCORP). SCORP will be a deflationary token that improves alongside the platform through automatic burns every single time a user makes a transaction and every single time the casino generates profit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of the upcoming token is important due to the position it holds as the asset that empowers the platform&rsquo;s ecosystem and its total 370 licensed games (210 casino games and 160 live games) as well as all the sports betting opportunities for popular sports such as American Basketball and International Football. The token will join a short but solid list of top cryptos users can bet with, including the biggest crypto of all time, Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
Have All The FUN You Want With The Token
<p>As suggested by its name, Fun Token is a platform focused on becoming the home of all the fun users can have online when it comes to crypto gaming. The platform prides itself on being a diverse place that offers fairness and transparency to all of its player base, meaning that everyone can bet and play amongst each other using the assets in their wallets without any worries of being taken advantage of or worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the latest developments being made in the world of Fun token are about accessibility. The project has partnered with Now Payments that has made for users to pay with FUN easier than before and the integration with ChangeNOW DEX, ensures faster and more secure FUN token swaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Stake.com Builds An Empire
<p>Stake.com is an online sportsbook and casino that debuted in 2017 and shot to fame right away. They quickly rose to the position of becoming one of the world's largest online casinos, thanks to its numerous sponsorship agreements. The success of Stake.com is proof that the merger of crypto and betting will become a telling tale in the near future!</p>
<p>According to rumours, Rush Street Interactive may be on Stake.com's list of prospective targets as it seeks acquisitions that could provide it access to the US iGaming market. The platform wants to expand into more regulated gambling areas in the US and abroad. Furthermore, Stake is also aiming to obtain a licence in Australia's regulated online gambling industry. It also has an application for iGaming in Ontario, Canada, that it is currently waiting to hear back from. Considering the fact that Stake is based out of Cura&ccedil;ao and already has offices all over the world, global domination is clearly on its agenda!</p>

How Scorpion Claws its Way To The Top
<p>One of the platform's primary focuses is its community, ensuring that all its users have an enjoyable and lucrative experience on the platform to make sure they keep coming back for more. Users can create a passive income avenue on the platform, potentially earning up to $10,000 per day by betting with SCORP, thanks to its integrated distribution. On top of that, users can earn rewards of $1000 upwards if they take part in other platform features, such as signing up for the VIP Members Club and much more. There&rsquo;s even more about the platform that could establish it as the go-to place once the presale is over, but for now, when it comes to earning opportunities - it's unmatched!</p>
