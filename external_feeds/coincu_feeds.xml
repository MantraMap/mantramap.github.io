<h5><strong>The RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints operated by the Solana Foundation are currently unavailable. Solana stopped working due to a bug in the 1.14 Solana Validator beta.</strong></h5>

<p>RPC is understood as a network technical model, a method of communication between two processes, helping programmers to interact easily with the blockchain network. However, the RPC endpoints that help cryptocurrency applications and wallets connect to the blockchain are now offline<strong> due to a bug in the 1.14 Solana Validator beta.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This bug impacted other nodes which had adopted the test release. If you are operating a node on a test release, please change over to 1.13</p>&mdash; Solana Status (@SolanaStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1611952768880721921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The tweet also clarified that the incident did not affect Solana&#8217;s ability to generate new blocks, unlike previous outages or network outages. <strong>Other RPCs provided by Triton, QuickNode, and Alchemy are still working correctly.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Mainnet beta Explorer and Solana Foundation Public RPC endpoints are currently offline as RPC node software is upgraded, following a bug in test release 1.14. Block production has not been impacted and the Solana network has not been impacted.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>This is the first time Solana has encountered a problem in 2023</strong>, but in 2022 alone, there have been <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=85900&amp;action=edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least five times</a> the Solana network shutting down</strong>. Most of these outages are due to poor resistance to spam bots, which overloads transactions.</p>



<p>Most recently, more than 1,000 nodes were disconnected because of being blocked by a cloud service provider, causing over 22% of SOL staking not to receive transaction confirmation rewards. The most extended network outage in 2022 was in May when the network <strong>&#8220;stood still&#8221; for more than 8.5 hours</strong>.</p>



<p>The above incident does not have too much impact on the network nor negatively impact Solana&#8217;s SOL token price. <strong>SOL even increased by more than 22% in the last 24 hours.</strong></p>

<p>Representatives from Banxico, <strong>Mexico&#8217;s central bank</strong>, noted in a statement that the currency&#8217;s development is <strong>still in its early phases</strong>, and<strong> no date for its introduction</strong> has been determined.</p>



<p>The Mexican government announced the development of its own <a href="https://news.coincu.com/51366-bank-of-mexico-to-introduce-cbdc/"><strong>digital peso</strong></a> &#8211; the <strong>Mexican CBDC</strong>, via social media on<strong> December 29, 2021,</strong> with a <strong>debut date of 202</strong>4. However, according to fresh information from <strong>Banxico,</strong> the country&#8217;s central bank, this timeframe is becoming increasingly unlikely to be met.</p>



<p>According to local sources, the <strong>Mexican CBDC</strong> is still in its early phases, with <strong>the general directorate of payment systems and market infrastructures</strong>, the bank division tasked with its development, still setting the requirements for its issuance.</p>



<p>&#8220;The consequence of this initial step implies the establishment of a budget that is presently being defined, and will in turn allow defining a probable date on which said CBDC will be available,&#8221; Banxico said of the possible date of issuance of the digital peso.</p>

<p>Varying government officials have offered different estimates for the Mexican CBDC&#8217;s start date. Furthermore, it was revealed that <strong>more than $500,000</strong> was spent on the development of this currency<strong> throughout 2022,</strong> with funding provided by Banxico. The governor of Banxico,<strong> Victoria Rodrguez Ceja</strong>, claimed <strong>in April </strong>that the <strong>entire growth cycle would take the institution three years</strong>. This, however, contradicts the institution&#8217;s claims that there is currently no launch date for the digital peso.</p>



<p>Rodriguez Ceja also made a <strong>clear contrast between the prospective CBDC and other cryptocurrencies</strong> at the time, claiming that they were unsupported assets and not legal money in the country. <strong>The Mexican CBDC</strong> is intended to be coupled with the traditional financial system, allowing banks to enable the exchange of these tokens using the existing payment system.</p>

<p>Based on local media, police and tax officials in Romania conducted <strong>17 raids in the fall of last year </strong>as part of an investigation into individuals <strong>accused of dodging revenue</strong> by concealing income from cryptocurrency trades.</p>



<p>According to <strong>Cristian Roman</strong>, partner at <strong>the legal firm Iordăchescu &amp; Asociații</strong>, who provided the information with Romania Journal, addresses were checked in Bucharest as well as the counties of Dâmbovița, Ilfov, and Olt.</p>



<p>The lawyer was referring to information provided by Romanian authorities. According to law enforcement officials<strong> in the EU country</strong>, <strong>19 targeted persons</strong> created or joined an organized crime organization for the goal of <strong>tax evasion between 2019 and 2022</strong>. According to authorities, the taxable income that they attempted to conceal was <strong>obtained through transactions with digital currencies</strong>. According to preliminary estimates, their efforts have cost the state budget <strong>3 million Romanian lei (almost $650,000)</strong>.</p>

<p>The Tax Administration is attempting to increase compliance among cryptocurrency taxpayers. The operation came after the <strong>National Agency for Fiscal Administration&#8217;s (ANAF)</strong> tax fraud unit initiated an investigation this summer into proceeds from crypto trading acquired <strong>between 2016 and 2021 </strong>through various platforms such as <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156150-changpeng-zhao-binance-wont-go-bankrupt/"><strong>Binance</strong></a><strong>, Kucoin, Maiar, Bitmart, and </strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/157412-sbf-met-with-us-sec-chairman/"><strong>the now-bankrupt FTX</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Tax investigators discovered almost <strong>€131 million in revenue</strong> received by <strong>63 Romanian residents</strong> at the time. They also discovered that the individuals had omitted to register approximately<strong> €48 million in digital assets</strong> on their tax forms.</p>

<p>Following the purchase of BIT, the <strong>BitDAO treasury</strong> will still contain <strong>$300 million in USDT/USDC</strong> and <strong>270,000 ETH (roughly USD 345 million)</strong>, which should be able to meet BIT product development needs for more than <strong>5 years</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DAO actually has the world&#8217;s second largest cryptocurrency treasury, with <strong>$2 billion in diverse assets</strong>, including significant quantities of<strong> ETH, USDC, USDT, and FTT</strong>.&nbsp; BitDAO is also working on <strong>Mantle, a modular ETH L2 that uses EigenLayer</strong>.</p>

<p>This kind of business dealing was <strong>evidently quite low on the evolutionary scale</strong>. There were several other reasons why the transaction should not have been accepted, one of which being the lack of knowledge regarding potential buyers and whether or not the proposition had already been factored into the price. Despite this, the value of the <strong>BIT token increased dramatically.</strong></p>

<p>Previously,<strong> on December 23</strong>, the BitDAO community considered a proposal to purchase back<a href="https://news.coincu.com/156717-bitdao-token-rises-20-as-buyback-proposal/"> $100 million</a> in bit tokens. This idea is that BitDAO set its daily buy limit at $2 million in USDT for<strong> 50 days beginning January 1</strong> of the following year. The value of <strong>DAO reserves</strong> has plummeted this year, with native tokens accounting for <strong>the vast majority of their holdings</strong>. This is because the price of these tokens, like the price of the entire crypto market, has plummeted during 2022. In response, DAOs are investigating techniques to <strong>diversify their treasuries</strong>. They are achieving this by increasing their exposure to stablecoins and investing in low-risk tangible assets such as US Treasuries.</p>

<p>Base on <strong>BlackRock&#8217;s disclosure daily update page</strong>, the share of USDC reserves held in the<strong> </strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/157134-circulation-circle-usdc-200-mil/"><strong>Circle Reserve Fund</strong></a> has climbed to about <strong>$28.6 billion, or 65%</strong>, since then.</p>



<p>This appears to be positive news for <strong>USDC users</strong>. Circle is ceding some of its management over <strong>USDC&#8217;s reserves</strong> to an external manager subject to SEC oversight, which eventually <strong>makes USDC safer.</strong> Transparency is also improved because USDC users can now receive regular updates from BlackRock.</p>



<p>Circle received <strong>$400 million</strong> in capital from <strong>BlackRock in April</strong>. At the time, the asset manager stated that it was interested in employing USDC for capital market operations. However, stablecoins are not regarded as a <strong>risk-free settlement asset.</strong> Thus, the RRP would significantly improve USDC&#8217;s risk profile.</p>

<p>Previously, the <strong>Bank Policy Institute </strong>expressed concern that the<strong> BlackRock fund </strong>utilized for USDC stablecoin reserves could get access to quasi<strong> Federal Reserve deposits</strong>. The Bank Policy Institute, a bank-supported think tank, wrote a blog post voicing worries that a portion of the <strong>USDC stablecoin reserves</strong> could be parked at the Federal Reserve, despite the stablecoin issuer not having a central bank account. If this were permitted, in times of uncertainty when there is a flight to quality, this may result in bank runs <strong>moving capital into the USDC stablecoin</strong>, which could be viewed as being as good as a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>



<p><strong>Since November</strong>, BlackRock has managed a<strong> major chunk of the USDC stablecoin&#8217;s reserve assets</strong> on behalf of the stablecoin&#8217;s issuer, Circle. <strong>The Circle Reserve Vehicle</strong>, developed by BlackRock, is a customised money market fund that invests in<strong> US short-dated Treasuries</strong>. It presently handles almost two-thirds of the assets of the<strong> $44 billion stablecoin</strong>, which<strong> retains 80%</strong> of its reserves in Treasuries.</p>

<h5><strong>What is Ethereum?</strong></h5>



<p>Ethereum is a blockchain platform on which developers may create decentralized apps (dApps). Every application in the Ethereum ecosystem is based on smart contracts and functions independently without the intervention of a third party.</p>



<p>After Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. It debuted in 2015 and quickly became the most popular smart contract blockchain.</p>



<h5><strong>What Are P2E games or blockchain games?</strong></h5>



<p>To encourage players to interact with their platform, <strong>play-to-earn games (or blockchain games) employ a token economy and NFTs</strong>. They allow you to earn cryptocurrency by playing. You receive tokens that you may exchange for prizes like as NFTs or money.</p>



<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a special sort of cryptocurrency. <strong>This implies that each NFT is unique and may be utilized in gaming as well as other applications</strong>. They are frequently used to symbolize uncommon in-game objects or assets, and if well-designed and popular, they may be priceless.</p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:26px"><strong>Big Time</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Big-Time is a time-travelling-themed free-to-play multiplayer action RPG. The game style is similar to Diablo, with 3D aesthetics similar to World of Warcraft</strong>. The game was created by a team of industry veterans from Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment, EA Sports, and Riot.</p>



<p>The combat in the game is a Diablo-style mix of melee and magic-based battling. You may also raid randomly generated dungeons for NFTs with up to six other players.</p>



<p>When fighting monsters and clearing dungeons, <strong>NFT drops are random</strong>. Cosmetic NFTs have an effect on your character&#8217;s appearance. Utility NFTs are items used to create cosmetic weapons and armour skins as well as earn bitcoins.</p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:26px"><strong>Sorare</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Sorare is a fantasy sports game in which you may <strong>buy, sell, and trade NFT cards of real-life NFL and MLB players</strong>.</p>



<p>The game resembles popular sports card games such as Upper Deck&#8217;s &#8220;Fleer Ultra&#8221; series. Sorare, on the other hand, uses Ethereum NFTs rather than actual cards.</p>



<p>Each card is an individual digital depiction of a real-world footballer. <strong>Over 230 teams are represented in the game, including significant leagues such as the English Premier League, La Liga, and Bundesliga.</strong> <strong>These cards may be used to form teams of five players and engage in weekly fantasy football games</strong>. The game also has a season-long mode in which you may compete against other players in your league.</p>



<p>Cards may be purchased through the Sorare marketplace or from other players. And, just <strong>like traditional sports cards</strong>, <strong>the value of these Ethereum NFTs might fluctuate depending on the success of the real-world footballer.</strong></p>



<p>Sorare&#8217;s most recent update now covers Major League Baseball. Baseball lovers may engage in fantasy baseball games by assembling the finest team of NFTs representing Major League Baseball players.</p>

<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Conclusion&nbsp;</h1>



<p>Ethereum is the most popular and largest smart contract platform. On the one hand, this makes it an excellent platform for game creators looking to create new and intriguing games that reward players with bitcoin. <strong>However, because of the network&#8217;s huge demand, Ethereum suffers from congestion and expensive transaction costs. </strong></p>



<p>Ethereum is still a popular platform for earning money through play-to-win games. Nonetheless, because <strong>Ethereum&#8217;s costs are too expensive, several games have shifted to other blockchains and implemented layer two solutions such as Matic, Enjin, or Immutable-X</strong>. In this piece, we reviewed games that use NFTs and tokens that are now running on the Ethereum blockchain, but the majority of them are in the process of scaling to a layer-2 solution.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Federal prosecutors are looking into the operations of American hedge funds with cryptocurrency exchange Binance.</em></li>



<li><em>In an interview, Binance chief strategy officer Patrick Hillmann said the company is talking to virtually every regulator across the globe on a daily basis.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>According to the article, the Western District of Washington U.S. attorney&#8217;s office recently sent subpoenas to American hedge firms in order to <strong>investigate their connections to the cryptocurrency exchange.</strong></p>



<p>Legal experts warned that<strong> just though there have been subpoenas issued, it does not always guarantee that charges would be filed</strong>. As they consider whether they have enough evidence to file charges against Binance, prosecutors are still talking about a potential settlement with the firm.</p>



<p>Patrick Hillmann, chief strategy officer at <a href="https://news.coincu.com/158401-binance-is-the-hegemonic-in-spot/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/158401-binance-is-the-hegemonic-in-spot/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, stated in an interview that the business speaks with &#8220;<strong>virtually every regulator across the globe on a daily basis</strong>,&#8221; but he would not elaborate on the state of any American probe. Justice Department spokesperson Joshua Stueve similarly refrained from making any comments.</p>

<p>The investigation into Binance is taking place as the cryptocurrency market is experiencing extreme uncertainty. Concerns about the rogue, <strong>mostly unregulated internet markets where digital assets are purchased and traded have increased in response to the collapse of FTX</strong>, a well-known trading platform that police claim was the victim of a multi-year fraud operation against investors.</p>



<p>As the spotlight shifts to Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange, Zhao is doubling down on his criticism of FTX and positioning himself as an advocate for stronger industry regulation. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Regulators rightfully will scrutinize this industry much, much harder, which is probably a good thing.</p>
<cite>Zhao said in November at a conference in Indonesia.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Binance&#8217;s Hillmann said that the company&#8217;s approach to regulatory compliance was lacking in the early years of its fast development. However, he claims that <strong>Binance has recently aggressively invested in compliance procedures, collaborated with law enforcement, and created new technologies for capturing criminals on its network.</strong></p>
