Many of us said that it would only get stranger, but I’m not sure anyone was truly ready for what would transpire.</p><p>In this short article, I’m going to have a quick look at the good, the bad and the ugly of 2022, and I’ll talk a little about what decisions I’m making for 2023 onwards. I’ve been controversial at the best of times, to say the least, and perhaps unnecessarily toxic at the worst. I’ve decided that this needs to change because it’s neither healthy, nor useful. There are others who can hold that mantle. My focus herein shall be education. And more of it.</p><p>Anyway, let us get on with the review of the year of the bear.</p><h2>The Good</h2><p>This was a year of cleansing — a cold shower for the Bitcoin industry at large, which was caught up in the froth and hyperbole of the “crapto” industry.</p><p>Many of us came into 2022 expecting to see bitcoin rally back through all-time highs, through $100,000 and off to $250,000. It was almost a done deal. Major Bitcoin-focused social media accounts were adamant that, because bitcoin is now held on the balance sheets of large institutions and public companies, the days of “80% drawdowns are behind us.”</p><p>While we pointed out shitcoins, scams and the like, we were well and truly caught off guard with the level of fraud and shenanigans underlying much of the frothy price movement.</p><p>Let’s list them out:</p><p>First, we had the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/terra-collapse-teaches-about-crypto-and-bitcoin">shitshow over at Luna</a> with our friend Do Kwon, the stablecoin superman who thought he could do what no central bank in history has ever been able to do: maintain a peg.</p><p>He was positioned as a wonderboy of the financial world. Mike Novogratz even tattooed Luna on his shoulder in classic, frothy, peak-cycle fashion:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Of course, this stupidity blew up and took a bunch of idiots with it.</p><p>Next, we had Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and the “crapto hedge funds.” The <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/07/crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-founders-are-missing.html">managers of said fund disappeared</a>, along with their clients’ money, only to <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/07/12/three-arrows-capital-3ac-founder-su-zhu-kyle-davies-insolvency-bankruptcy-court-administrator/">reappear months later</a> to post inspirational tweets. Seriously.</p><p>The “no pants when the tide goes back” out continued as the contagion spread. It took out <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/voyager-digital-files-for-bankruptcy">Voyager</a> and friends, as some claimed that these bank runs were somehow the fault of the people who warned of their demise. Crazy.</p><p>And then, of course, we had the big daddy of them all: Scam Bankman-Fraud (SBF) and FTX. This kid put Bernie Madoff, Elizabeth Holmes and Enron to shame, combined. I’ll discuss him a little later in the “ugly” part (very fitting) but the benefit, i.e., “the good,” was multi-faceted.</p><p>It taught many people a number of key lessons:</p><ol><li>Crypto is crapto, and it's not Bitcoin</li><li>Not your keys, not your coins</li><li>Altruist, wonder-boy nerds are more than likely actors and scammers, not saviors</li></ol><p>And it took out an entire portfolio of shitcoin “companies” that <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/ftx-lost-up-to-2b-in-user-funds-10b-sent-to-alameda-report">Alameda had invested in by siphoning user funds through their accounting shenanigans</a>.</p><p>Sure, the bitcoin price was slammed, but considering the level of stupidity that we saw, and the backdrop of fiscal tightening, bitcoin is doing OK.</p><p>A lower price has meant that the classes of 2020 and 2021 have been able to accumulate bitcoin like never before. They had their 2019 moment. Perhaps even their March 2020 moment (although I hesitate to speak too soon). I’m not sure many of them would ever have become whole coiners had this gift not fallen in their laps. </p><p>And, in addition to that, we saw the elimination or re-evaluation of a lot of the ridiculous Ethereum envy that we saw emerging from the technical fringes of Bitcoin. Many went from raising money at stupid valuations for ideas that quite frankly do <em>not</em> matter now, to being very, very quiet. </p><p>So, all in all, there was much pain, but like on leg day or, perhaps more accurately, like a hardcore detox and water fast, we’ve had a clean up of the industry. A flushing of much of the shitcoinery (not all of it, unfortunately, but a lot), a clean up of the froth in bitcoin, the minting of a whole new cohort of Bitcoiners, and the “earning of stripes” for the last cohort from 2020 onwards.</p><p>Next…</p><h2>The Bad</h2><p>I’ve kind of killed my ammunition for this section because, if anything, it would’ve been used to point out what occurred in the aftermath of all the Ponzi schemes blowing up, and how they ran off with everyone’s money.</p><p>So, in the absence of pointing that out, let’s explore what else may have been bad about this year. At least in relation to Bitcoin.</p><h3>1. CBDCs</h3><p><br>It seems that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have moved closer to reality and are now well within the Overton window of economic discourse. This normalization is bad, because most people are stupid enough to continue supporting the very tools that will lead to their gulagification. The one saving grace we have is the incompetence of the institutions rolling this stuff out, but it may be balanced by the will to comply from the same people who fell for the lies of 2020 and 2021. It’s a shame that we’re all so politically and economically connected.<br></p><h3>2. Delay Toward Hyperbitcoinization</h3><p>This is a tricky one, because one day I believe we’ve been delayed, the next I think we have lightened the load and we’ll make it there quicker. I’m not sure where I stand, but there is a fair argument that says, “Had all of these stupid distractions and shitcoins not existed, and had the fraudsters not frothed and blown things up, perhaps 2021 and 2022 growth would have been a little more steady and sustainable — and we’d not have to go through this cleansing.” </p><p>It’s akin to the argument that you wouldn’t need to detox if you were more sensible with your diet in the first place. And this may be true. But alas, if society were a single human being, it would be an obese degenerate eating Cheetos and watching Netflix, who is in desperate need of a detox. Should we expect more?</p><h3>3. Infighting</h3><p>This one is also tricky, because I have been a very vocal advocate of weeding out adversaries, spooks and stupidity through unfettered discourse, which at times can and should be toxic. But…. I’m at the point where I think it’s unhealthy — and I, for one, have been a culprit in making it that way. I think a lot of us took on the mantle of “toxic” a little too literally, and instead of being useful, helpful or inspiring, we’ve just turned into a bunch of keyboard-warrior trolls. <br><br>I no longer think this shit is healthy. Instead of fighting the enemy, we’re fighting each other. Instead of producing meaningful content, we’re constantly making memes — which, granted, are very, very effective pieces of content, but at this point, many of them are just “in jokes” and don’t serve anyone or anything outside of a small click.<br><br>That’s fine if you want to just spend your days trolling, but similar to my own personal and stupid tirades on Twitter and often controversial (and sometimes ridiculous) takes, they don’t help anyone. I think many of us are so frustrated (I was squarely in this camp for 2022) that we can’t have the impact we want, that we’ve picked targets closer to us. Perhaps that’s the effect that Twitter has on people. My hope is that the discourse improves, and I intend to start with myself and perhaps inspire others. Time will tell.<br></p><h3>4. Wealth Effect Shattered</h3><p><br>For many Bitcoiners, (I think) we’d made plans based on an increasing purchasing power and envisioned a style of life that a greater bitcoin price could accommodate.<br></p><p>I personally did. I went hard at the beginning of the year after a few changes in personal circumstances. I didn’t keep much dry powder and, as such, I thought I had completed the greater part of my stacking, and that any future additions (flow) would only be marginal in relation to my stock. As such, I was caught in a tight spot when I had to juggle getting married, with sourcing new forms of revenue and reinventing myself as a content creator, in the middle of a bitcoin bear market, among other things. I get the sense that I was not the only one caught off guard in that sense. I, and many others, managed to find a way through it, but in many cases, it was not an easy process and I think it may have added to the subconscious frustration that manifested on Twitter. I’m calling myself out here first and foremost.</p><p>Other than these four standouts, there was obviously further insanity in the broader geopolitical and macroeconomic landscapes.</p><p>The stupidity of the State continued to exceed all of our expectations, which leads me into the final section…</p><h2>The Ugly</h2><p>The ugly part of 2022 was the utter injustice of everything.</p><p>The world is morally, socially and psychologically broken. Up is down, down is up. Bad is good, good is bad.</p><p>The things I listed in “The Good” section have their ugly parts.</p><p>Alex Mashinsky and friends at Celsius, Voyager and others, after blaming Bitcoiners for their woes, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bankrupt-crypto-lender-celsius-court-approval-pay-staff-bonuses-2022-12">paid themselves some fat bonuses</a> and resigned to a healthy retirement. No ramifications.</p><p>The ramifications for Do Kwon? Unknown. He’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/terra-luna-do-kwon-south-korea-interpol/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA3NYWzkRjkwNbjpf8CamxwjB8IeRUOBdWko-ZBYkhktibKUvZCy4pc0IN92wQE0GOoKoeGZ-VuUffWzVES8iSqnafSeZFJBMweYWmRG4B2V-8f_BHu8x71IkknVNm65m2wxbZSnFoii1MubRqAyP-7F7_HDLDOh8oWo30iRJHlb">at large</a>, probably living it up on some island, enjoying the money he scammed out of people.</p><p>Su Zhu and 3AC? Nada. Zhu returned to Twitter months after disappearing, to give people life advice in tweets as if nothing ever happened. I’m not sure if they embezzled or stole money, or just blew up from bad management, but from what I can tell, other than a little Twitter backlash, there’s been little justice.</p><p>And, of course, the absolute insanity of the SBF and FTX situation. </p><p>He was walking around, doing podcasts and Twitter Spaces <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3760932-somehow-sam-bankman-fried-gets-his-rehabilitation-media-tour/">as if nothing ever happened</a>. </p><p>Prior to the blow up, the media hailed him as the next coming of Jesus, and what’s worse, after the fraud all came out, the media kept <em>protecting</em> his image! The sheer audacity and injustice of it all was maddening. </p><p>He straight up stole $10 billion and was lined up to speak at a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-will-speak-at-conference-alongside-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelensky-and-us-treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-despite-ongoing-ftx-investigation.htm">finance event with Janet Yellen</a>!</p><p>After a couple of months of this crap, he was “arrested” only to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/nyregion/sbf-bail-agreement-explained.html">somehow post bail for $250 million</a>, which, God knows where the money came from, and was recently seen flying around in <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11571071/FTX-fraudster-Sam-Bankman-Fried-relaxes-JFK-lounge-class-AA-seat-flies-home.html">business class</a> to spend Christmas with the family, because he can’t get any vegan food in the prison he was in.</p><p>You can’t make this shit up. Steal $10 billion, go fly business class. Next step; Make him Time’s man of the year.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>As I said, if any of this ugliness tells us anything, it's that the world has lost its moral compass entirely. The evil are praised and bailed out in plain sight, while the good are locked up, and the key thrown away.</p><p>Ross Ulbricht is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-from-prison">serving two life sentences</a> for the alleged “crime” of building a goddamn online marketplace for consenting individuals to buy things from each other. The fact that the items are “illegal goods” as per the dictates of the State matters not. That’s just a ridiculous position set out by bureaucratic parasites who will often do the drugs themselves. Whether you’re pro or against drugs (I’m personally against them), the fact remains that Ulbricht took nothing from anybody and is suffering the severest of punishments for simply connecting people online, and protecting his business interests.</p><p>Edward Snowden is another example. Like Ulbricht, it’s not a “this year” thing, but he’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden_asylum_in_Russia#:~:text=citizenship%20by%20birthright.-,2022,passport%2C%20according%20to%20his%20lawyer.">living in exile somewhere in Russia</a>, as if he’s a criminal for “leaking” the <em>truth</em> to the American people.</p><p>And likewise, Julian Assange is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment_and_arrest_of_Julian_Assange">rotting in a cell somewhere</a> for literally reporting on the truth.</p><p>As Shakespeare <a href="https://literarydevices.net/something-is-rotten-in-the-state-of-denmark/">wrote</a>, “There is something rotten in the state of Denmark”</p><p>It’s hard not to get black pilled in the face of such absurdity. But I do believe there is some hope. My hope lies in the fact that, as I’ve said before, Bitcoin’s greatest impact on the world will be the reintroduction of localized economic consequences. The downstream effect of this, I believe, will be better governance and better, more just leadership — because without a money printer, you cannot paper over bad decisions and you are held to greater account.</p><p>I can only hope that such economic and mega-political impacts occur within the lifetime of people such as Ulbricht, Snowden and Assange, who are unjustly serving sentences for crimes not committed.</p><p>If not, then at the very least, it’s my belief that the era that our children or children’s children grow up in will be on a Bitcoin standard, and that such stupidity will be much harder to get away with.</p><p>It will be a more beautiful place in that sense, because beauty is a harmony and a symmetry.</p><p>Right now, the world is so out of center, so out of symmetry that we are seeing criminals walk free and fly in luxury, while heroes and leaders languish in cells.</p><p>And for those who want to claim that “beauty is subjective,” I'm sorry, but you’re either myopic or stupid. Beauty is an objective pattern, just like the fractals that exist from the microscopic through to the galactic.</p><p>Economics, society and civilization themselves are beautiful when they adhere to such symmetry and harmony.</p><p>It’s my hope that Bitcoin’s neutral, unchangeable presence will make beauty a reality once more, and I hope that by the end of the decade I am writing a guest piece called: “The Good, The Bad And The Beautiful” to commemorate how far we’ve come.</p><p>But, until then, we have a battle on our hands. So here’s to a better, more wholesome and meaningful 2023, where we each show up with greater strength and integrity than we have in the past.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Aleks Svetski.

But there are also many low-profile ripoffs that fly under the mainstream media radar.</p><p>Houston Attorney Andrew J. Cobos of the <a href="https://www.cobos.law/">Cobos Law Firm</a> includes Bitcoin-related legal disputes in his litigation practice. According to an interview with Cobos for this article, one of his current cases involves an elderly woman who, in 2017, was approached by a young pastor at her church, who encouraged her to invest in bitcoin with his help. The woman and the man entered into an oral agreement that she would transfer $80,000 to him, and he would use her money to buy bitcoin and safely store it for her. Now, the plaintiff in the case, the elderly woman, accuses the man of stealing her bitcoin through the knowledge and use of her private keys. Trial in this case is set for Spring 2023 in Harris County, Texas (<a href="https://www.hcdistrictclerk.com/Edocs/Public/CaseDetails.aspx?Get=KkdyeCwESDx%2fJ9I1y6%2f61YsoiQ5JVyca2nekkdqAVpt8h8ALjl110N8mEh+V71OtcoI0YTv7jz6OdXtj5M%2fJh3X0Yg6aqNZfi+Vu5Uz4r5E%3d">case number 2021-51487</a>). </p><p>According to the lawsuit, the pastor purchased and held the bitcoin for the elderly woman until July 2020, when the woman requested that the bitcoin be returned. The pastor then ordered and set up a Trezor hardware wallet containing 7.742 bitcoin, and gave the woman the Trezor device along with a “seed phrase card” that the pastor had completed. Days later, the woman opened the Trezor to discover that all of her bitcoin had been removed from the Trezor device. </p><p>Cobos has alleged that the pastor maintained a copy of the seed phrase card and recreated the wallet after giving her the Trezor, and thereafter transferred all of the bitcoin to a separate wallet that he controlled. The elderly woman contacted the pastor to inquire about the missing assets and was told that his system was “hacked.” With no recourse through law-enforcement, the elderly woman turned to a trial lawyer and the court system for help. </p><p>According to Cobos, this kind of malfeasance seems to be on the rise with Bitcoin’s growing adoption, as newbies to the space are being exploited by street-level fraudsters. Though it is novel case law, such fraud is not new to the Bitcoin space. Even some of the most sophisticated investors have been involved in this type of litigation. </p><p>Back in 2012, the Winklevoss twins contracted with Charlie Shrem to buy $750,000 in bitcoin, which was worth only $18.81 at that time. According to <a href="https://casetext.com/case/winklevoss-capital-fund-llc-v-shrem/">court documents</a> WCF (the Winklevoss' fund) alleged that Shrem could not account for $61,000 of the money they transferred to him, and that he had purchased 5,000 bitcoin for himself. WCF claimed that the stolen bitcoin was worth $26 million at the time of the filing.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://casetext.com/case/winklevoss-capital-fund-llc-v-shrem">case text</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“WCF hired an accountant in February 2013 to perform an audit, and the auditor found that Shrem could not account for $61,000 sent to him, which was the equivalent of about 5,000 Bitcoin at the time based on the average price of $12.15 per Bitcoin. Shrem disputed this, but never provided additional information. Another company hired by WCF identified that Shrem's Bitcoin address received 5,000 Bitcoin on December 31, 2012, almost exactly the amount of the shortfall identified by WCF's accountant.”</p></blockquote><p>The case was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/17/winklevoss-capital-charlie-shrem-settle-26-million-bitcoin-lawsuit/">settled out of court in April 2019</a> without a public disclosure of the terms. However, contrary to a filing by the twins’ attorney stating that “…WCF and Shrem will each bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs,” Shrem said in a statement to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/17/winklevoss-capital-charlie-shrem-settle-26-million-bitcoin-lawsuit/">Coindesk</a> that the Winklevosses were ordered to pay Shrem’s attorneys’ fees. </p><p>I believe that the most important lesson we can learn from these two similar stories is that the oft-repeated maxim should continue being oft-repeated by Bitcoiners: “Don’t trust, verify!” Though the Winklevoss hadn’t known Charlie for very long, they trusted him because he knew Bitcoin better than they did back in 2012. He was one of very few well known OGs around at the time. They learned the lesson the hard way, as did the elderly churchgoing lady. Though the young pastor was supposedly an upstanding member of her church, she leaned too far on his expertise, blindly trusting in his integrity, and waiting three years to verify that she still controlled the 7.742 bitcoins. </p><p>“Experts” in Bitcoin who call themselves “Bitcoiners” can equally be <em>practiced at the art of deception</em>. </p><p>Yes, the Bitcoin protocol is virtually perfect and incorruptible, but human beings — even Bitcoiners — are not (big shock gasp). As in any space where great wealth is at stake, there is a broad spectrum from naive innocents to career parasites — doves and vultures.

Reasons include being a scam or other related issues, being a joke or having no purpose, being an ICO or short-lived scheme, or simply running entirely out of volume.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin, in the midst of all this, has remained strong. Hash rate has continued a steady climb, now up to 270 EH/s <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/network-data/btc">according to Hashrate Index</a>.<br></p><p>In addition, <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1598742379061809158?s=20&amp;t=b_z05E-FRebBWT6lKnw7sQ">more than 1 million addresses</a> now hold one bitcoin or greater, although it should be noted that Bitcoiners may use multiple addresses.

Instead, eventually, they will aggressively compete for it and those with larger fractions of 21 million will have greater strategic and economic primacy than their geopolitical competitors. </p><p>With that being said, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Strategy_(United_States)">National Security Strategy</a> (NSS) is a periodic document designed to communicate the vision of the executive branch and serve as the roadmap for U.S. that helps Congress carry out the directions laid out by the highest office in the land. The October 2022 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf">NSS </a>outlines how the White House “will seize this decisive decade to advance America’s vital interests, position the United States to outmaneuver geopolitical competitors, tackle shared challenges, and set our world firmly on a path toward a brighter and more hopeful tomorrow.”</p><p>These powerful words not only inspire hope and promise of a better future for the American people as the U.S. strives to continue to be the champion of freedom and democracy on the world stage, but they also recognize that if there are any missteps in the nation’s strategic interests, that might bring further darkness to a country desperately seeking light or, even worse, cost the nation to lose a grip on its global influence. It is imperative that the U.S. truly weighs all available options in order to secure the best outcomes that promote American values and protect the American way of life.</p><h2>Digital Currency Can No Longer Be Ignored</h2><p>Part of the most recent NSS, under the “Trade And Economics” section, states, “[the U.S.] will explore the merits and responsibly lead development of digital assets, including a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/central-bank-digital-currency.htm">digital dollar,</a> with high standards and protections for stability, privacy, and security to benefit a strong and inclusive U.S. financial system and reinforce its global primacy.”</p><p>Despite being labeled “magic internet money” and “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/05/warren-buffett-says-bitcoin-is-probably-rat-poison-squared.html">rat poison</a>” over the last decade, the rise of Bitcoin secured its credibility and since then, has gradually made its way into committees and boardrooms consisting of members holding the highest positions of influence. It can no longer be ignored. The aforementioned excerpt of the NSS provides important insight into the executive branch’s current view of the growing significance of developing digital assets like Bitcoin.</p><p>One driver for this growing interest into digital assets is undoubtedly the U.S. national debt, as the nation currently runs a <a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/">$31 trillion deficit with no sign of slowing down.</a> Senator Rand Paul recently acknowledged that <a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=rand+paul+omnibus+bill&amp;docid=13930151887506&amp;mid=FC16587E08054145C578FC16587E08054145C578&amp;view=detail&amp;FORM=VIRE">“the greatest national security risk is our debt</a>” after the release of a single, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3785395-senate-passes-1-7-trillion-omnibus-spending-package/">$1.7 trillion</a> (or roughly 95 million bitcoin, in today’s value) spending package. The mountain of national debt is certainly a cause of concern.</p><p>There are only two ways a deficit of that magnitude can ever be paid: either by default through a monetary reset or inflation. Because of the unsurmountable level of debt, there is a growing need for innovation to help solve this dilemma. The path to a digital dollar is nearly inevitable, as the era of 0% money quickly approaches its expiration date and forces the transition into a new monetary system that will be birthed into existence — a monumental shift of which the world has not experienced since the likes of the <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/nixon-shock">Nixon Shock in 1971</a>. In 1971, instead of defaulting on its financial obligations, the U.S. changed the economic policy entirely, ended the Bretton Woods era and removed gold from being tied to the U.S. dollar. </p><p>If history is any future indicator of what will occur at the end of the next financial cycle, the U.S. will likely explore an alternative economic policy as alluded to in the NSS, but this time will introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC), or a digital dollar, to avoid defaulting on its current debt which, ironically, is a form of default.</p><h2>The U.S. Can Adopt Bitcoin</h2><p>However, there may not be a need for the U.S. to invent a domestic digital dollar as Bitcoin fits the criteria that the NSS details. Bitcoin is the hardest form of money and provides&nbsp;the highest standards of protection to individuals. It is the most <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3y">stable</a> digital asset as it continues to release a new block every 10 minutes, and is the most inclusive monetary protocol as it allows not just individuals with social security numbers and two forms of government-issued IDs to access its benefits, but its open-source protocol grants protection and services to everyone including<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services"> the 1.4 billion unbanked people across the worl</a>d while the <a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning Network</a> promotes efficient transactions,&nbsp;arguably the most important dimension of a globalized economy.</p><p>As more individuals, companies, banks and countries are forced by the market to pay out loans in bitcoin instead of notes, holders of the largest bitcoin stacks will naturally gain more influence. Its built-in deflationary nature and absolute scarcity features ensures that 100% of the work and value created by people is enjoyed and never diminished through monetary debasement. Lastly, Bitcoin’s enormous defense system discourages bad actors as the <a href="https://u.today/heres-how-much-it-costs-to-51-attack-bitcoin-btc">cost of attack</a> has become too great and thus forces peaceful and mutually beneficial agreements.</p><p>In every sense, the Bitcoin protocol perfectly aligns with the core values of the United States and its national security strategy. Contrary to what some senior officials claim, Bitcoin does not generate a national security risk. Instead, ignoring the Bitcoin network would significantly impede the U.S.’s ability to pay its national debt, “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf">outmaneuver [its] geopolitical competitors</a>” and weaken the country’s economic instrument of power, which aims to leverage the country’s wealth to influence the behaviors of others. Thus, further delaying Bitcoin adoption is the national security risk.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Matt Smith.

    </figure><p>I believe I have discovered a symbol that we might all agree on — it seems obvious in hindsight. But wait until you hear the reasoning and symbolism before deciding. Here's the symbol I am proposing:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMjY5Njk4NTg0/sat-symbol-3.png" height="844" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The symbol is made with a reverse "S" which is like writing a "2" (but not quite), and a vertical strikethrough, which is like a "1." The number two and the one together also make 21, referencing the 21 million bitcoin hard supply cap. </p><p>The sat symbol. It's poetically beautiful in my opinion.</p><p>What's more, it's a vertically-reversed dollar sign, which is representing the anti-dollar, or the dollar-killer. Alternatively, it’s a horizontally-reversed dollar sign (it can’t be both, otherwise it would end up flipping back to the dollar sign).</p><p>One of the most important things about the symbol is that there’s a <em>reasonable</em> chance that most people will naturally agree to use it. There has been a very quick and overwhelmingly positive response to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Parman_Public/status/1603698639947599873?s=20&amp;t=6WlY-K_JE_fj8A8lsCFfMQ">tweet announcing the symbol, posted under my public Twitter account</a>.</p><p>This was a typical response:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMjY5NzY0MTIw/tweet-reply-on-new-sat-symbol.png" height="106" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>And others:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMjY5Njk4MjEw/twitter-replies-on-sat-symbol.png" height="828" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Another Twitterer commented that the reverse “S” and strikethrough can represent the first and last letters of “Satoshi,” which was interesting. Others have said that it contains elements of Knut Svanholm’s “infinity” divided by 21 million meme:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMDAxMTk3MjE4/image5.png" height="656" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/jo4g5p/bitcoin_everything_there_is_divided_by_21_million/"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>An actual “2” was suggested instead of an “S” but that can look a little messy when written in front of actual numbers, and is unlikely to get as much support as I’ve witnessed with the inverted dollar sign. It also doesn’t look pleasing to my eye:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMDAxNzIxODgw/potential-sat-symbol-1.png" height="1043" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>To me, it looks better with an “S”:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMjY5NjMzMDQ4/potential-sat-symbol-2.png" height="830" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>We've already agreed on 21 million bitcoin, or 2.1 quadrillion satoshis — anchoring this Schelling point to a new one I think has a great chance of success.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gcomxx/status/1603756164118114305?s=20&amp;t=6WlY-K_JE_fj8A8lsCFfMQ">Someone else suggested</a> it looks like an “L2” — fitting because sats are the default unit on the primary Layer 2 protocol, the Lightning Network.</p><p>It’s also important to consider the ease and speed of writing this symbol. It only takes two pen strokes. You only need to lift the pen once. The more decorative the symbol, the more annoying it is to write it by hand, and then, it will just get abbreviated.</p><p>I love the idea of reinforcing the 21 million cap “brain virus” every time someone writes the sats symbol. At least for me, it would bring great satisfaction to write it each and every time.</p><p>No matter which symbol is your favorite, having everyone agree has been part of the problem. Because there are so many reasons that this is a good symbol, I think there’s a good chance that we might settle on this one.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Arman The Parman.

This article provides an overview of the localized changes in regulatory posture toward miners.</p><h2>Mining Regulations In Canada</h2><p>In late 2022, Hydro-Quebec announced its proposal for the province to stop selling cheap power to cryptocurrency miners, as<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/quebec-shuns-bitcoin-mining-in-bid-to-conserve-power-11670514921"> reported</a> by The Wall Street Journal. The proposal called for the Canada Energy Regulator to suspend the allocation of 270 megawatts requested by cryptocurrency miners. Bitcoin miners in Quebec<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/03/canadian-energy-provider-hydro-quebec-proposes-stopping-electricity-supply-to-blockchain-industry/"> already recognize</a> that local regulations are too restrictive for easy growth, but this new proposal could make mining in the province even harder.</p><p>Right after Thanksgiving, Manitoba<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/energy-demand-manitoba-suspend-cryptocurrency-1.6667264"> announced</a> its plans to halt any new electric grid connections for cryptocurrency mining operations. The suspension will last 18 months from November 2022 to allow for a review of the externalities from the mining industry’s energy demands, according to the province’s finance minister. The 37 currently-operating mining facilities in Manitoba will not be affected for now. But recent requests for new connections from 17 different operators have been suspended, according to<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/energy-demand-manitoba-suspend-cryptocurrency-1.6667264"> CBC</a>.</p><p>Just before Christmas, British Columbia<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/british-columbia-cryptocurrency-suspended-1.6693976"> made headlines</a> for its efforts to stop mining growth to assess the environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining operations. An 18-month moratorium has been placed on accepting any new requests for electrical grid connections exclusively from bitcoin mining companies. The province said at the time that 21 applications that were pending approval have been suspended. Assessing how bitcoin mining affects the province’s “environmental goals” is the stated reason for B.C.’s 18-month suspension.</p><p>Before these grid connection limitations, Canada had long stood as a global hub for cryptocurrency growth generally and bitcoin mining activity in particular, with a loose<a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map"> estimate of 7%</a> of global hash rate operating within its borders. But several localities are starting to make miners feel not so welcome. Two is a coincidence, three is a trend, as the adage says.</p><p>All the way at the top of the Canadian government, the current prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has made it no secret that he frowns on the entire cryptocurrency industry. After his conservative counterpart Pierre Poilievre voiced strong support for Bitcoin, Trudeau wasted no time firing back by<a href="https://decrypt.co/109619/canada-justin-trudeau-conservative-poilievre-bitcoin"> calling</a> his rival’s views “irresponsible” and cryptocurrency “volatile.” From his personal Twitter, however, Trudeau has never tweeted about crypto, bitcoin or mining.</p><h2>The Canadian Mining Landscape</h2><p>Mining discourse generally references “North America” collectively or “the U.S.” individually. But Canada plays a significant role in bolstering the hash rate staying online across the North American region. And, for the most part, Canadian miners endure much harsher climates than their southern counterparts. For example, Upstream Data CEO Steve Barbour<a href="https://twitter.com/SGBarbour/status/1382329723494178828?t=6T7But623-6K1CAHWilYYw&amp;s=19"> shared pictures</a> on Twitter of the underappreciated, destructive effects of harsh Canadian weather on bitcoin mining operations. Frozen cables, iced hardware and large snow drifts do not make for ideal mining conditions.</p><p>But some of the most well-known public and private mining companies operate or are headquartered in Canada. For publicly-traded firms, the list includes Bitfarms, SATO Technologies, Hut 8 and more. The roster of private companies based or operating in Canada includes Compass Mining, Bitfury, Upstream Data and others. Nearly all of these brands are quasi-household names in the bitcoin economy and often play key roles in advocating for and educating about Bitcoin. Canada’s footprint in the bitcoin market is not small.</p><h2>Reacting To Regulatory Changes</h2><p>Local hostility to operational bitcoin mining expansions may be recent news in Canada, but the broader industry is no stranger to this sentiment. The entire industry<a href="https://twitter.com/KMSmithDC/status/1517640771008184323"> banded together</a> to vociferously<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/01/senate-backs-down-on-cryptocurrency-mining-moratorium-00036388"> oppose</a> a proposed two-year moratorium in New York for fossil-fuel-powered mining expansion projects. In late November 2022, the bill<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/23/new-york-imposes-2-year-moratorium-on-new-proof-of-work-mining-after-governor-hochul-signs-bill-into-law/"> passed</a>. The move was<a href="https://twitter.com/RepHuffman/status/1597321342810198017"> cheered</a> by other left-leaning politicians. And Canada seems to be copying their playbook.</p><p>Canada’s new posture toward miners also imitates another international mining hotspot: Kazakhstan. After absorbing an abundance of mining activity that left China, Kazakhstan started<a href="https://forkast.news/kazakhstan-proposes-to-limit-power-consumption-for-new-crypto-miners-as-power-deficit-bites/"> proposing</a> power consumption limitations for new mining activity in October 2021.</p><p>So, how are Canadian miners reacting?</p><p>News of Quebec’s proposal to suspend any new grid connections was widely<a href="https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1588252621928034304"> shared</a> among Bitcoin social circles on Twitter. Unsurprisingly, the chatter was uniformly negative and critical.</p><p>Upstream Data’s Barbour was not altogether shocked, though. Taking to Twitter, he<a href="https://twitter.com/SGBarbour/status/1588267374440218624"> noted</a> that Quebec is “once again” censoring bitcoin miners. Why are the proposed grid connection limitations unsurprising? Because miners “compete with utilities,” according to Barbour. </p><p>“Expect increasing discrimination,” he tweeted.</p><p>Despite changing regulatory sentiment, some of Canada’s biggest miners still plan to expand. Bitfarms said it “continues to look to expand its operations in Québec and add more jobs across the region” in a<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/11/04/2548576/0/en/Bitfarms-responds-to-erroneous-article-advising-that-current-hydroelectric-energy-agreements-remain-in-place-current-and-future-production-continues.html"> press release</a> published shortly after news of Hydro-Quebec’s proposal broke. Quantifying Bitfarm’s impact on the local economy, the press release added, “Bitfarms has invested over CAD$350 million in Québec since its inception and currently employs over 100 employees.”</p><h2>Canada’s Choice</h2><p>Political favor or hostility toward Bitcoin ultimately means very little for the long-term success of the network. In the short term, however, regulatory limitations can make life very difficult for mining companies trying to process transactions and find new blocks. Any regulatory opposition from Canada is highly unlikely to rival China’s all-out ban from 2021. But multiple localities suspending all new requests for grid connections is extremely disruptive all the same.</p><p>Canadian provinces now face a choice: risk losing hash rate to other jurisdictions or embrace mining and the heavily-documented socioeconomic benefits it affords. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Zack Voell.

    </figure><p>"Chancellor on brink of the second bailout for banks." A simple but powerful message. The engraving in and of itself serves as an anchor to the physical world, an atestment to Bitcoin’s birthdate –– or, at least, that it couldn’t have possibly been created before Jan 3, 2009, the date the cover was published. But more importantly, and more philosophically, the message establishes a sort of manifesto, from the start. It makes it clear that the system being ignited by that very block takes a stand against the central bank policies enabled by a culture of easy money. Bitcoin, instead, would seek to restore accountability and antifragility through a monetary system based on sound money; one that can’t be debased or controlled, manipulated or manufactured to benefit a lucky few. Bitcoin would seek to level the playing field, ensuring property rights to millions worldwide, equally and irrespective of their status, race, religious beliefs, gender or nationality.</p><p>The fundamental properties of Bitcoin would enable such dream to come true. Powered by a distributed network of nodes, each running the protocol’s software and as such enforcing its rules, Bitcoin would be able to let individuals take up the reins of their financials –– once and for all. As the days and years went by, however, more and more Bitcoin-related activity began drifting to centralized institutions, initially for buying and selling, later for custody, and nowadays for a plethora of services unimaginable in the days of Nakamoto. While such a move enabled a greater participation by people around the world, the initial ideals of Bitcoin have started being neglected. After all, true peer-to-peer electronic cash can’t be actualized in a custodial model where the movement of funds is but an update on a centralized database. Instead, that reality more closely resembles the old, traditional financial system Nakamoto sought to fight in the first place –– one that makes it impossible for people to be sovereign as they can’t be the master of their finances.</p><p>While there are multiple requirements for Bitcoin holders to break free of the established system’s reality, this article focuses on a keystone aspect that shares the holiday with Bitcoin’s birthday. Proof of Keys Day, also celebrated on January 3, was started by infamous Trace Mayer, who rallied people to withdraw their bitcoin en masse from centralized exchanges and custodians. The reason? Only by withdrawing their BTC can people ensure companies of the burgeoning industry aren’t taking part on old and established vices like fractional reserve banking. Moreover, only with bitcoin in their possession –– held by a wallet to which they control the keys –– can people be free to do as they please with their BTC. There are many different ways to do self-custody, and while it can be daunting at first, it’s a necessary step to take the leap from the old to the new system. </p><p>The "keys" discussed here are the <em>private keys</em> for a given Bitcoin wallet. They can be thought of as the wallet’s actual key in that it "unlocks" the wallet and the bitcoin held in it for spending. Without the keys, no bitcoin can be spent. This is because when a Bitcoin transaction is being formed, the sender "locks" the bitcoin with information about the receiver. Thanks to asymmetric cryptography, this transacting dynamic ensures that only the entity that received the bitcoin can spend it next. And this spending is made possible by the receiver’s private keys. So as long as the receiver takes good care of their private keys, only they will ever be able to spend their bitcoin –– no matter what a government, institution or agency thinks or does about that. </p><p>By holding bitcoin in a wallet you create, you ensure that only you can move the bitcoin held in that wallet. When a third party custodian holds your bitcoin for you, they create a wallet for you and tell you the address so you can deposit, but ultimately they control that wallet’s private keys and more often that not that is an information you can’t access. As such, there is a need for permission to be asked to move your bitcoin. While such an ask is automated, it is still necessary so you can move your funds. Often, this takes the form of a "withdrawal request" you issue to your exchange. Proof of Keys Day aims to raise people’s awareness to this fact and entice them to take control of their finances once and for all, making the leap from the traditional financial system to the new, decentralized, Bitcoin-based one. As the saying goes, Not your keys, not your bitcoin!</p><p><em>Start your self-custody journey:</em></p><ul><li><em>Find out how to withdraw from the exchange you use <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/why-and-how-to-withdraw-your-bitcoin-from-exchanges"><em>here</em></a>.</em></li><li><em>Quick and easy step-by-step guide for small amounts of bitcoin <a href="https://twitter.com/namcios/status/1591129413139431425"><em>here</em></a>.</em></li><li><em>Twitter thread with links to tutorials of different levels of self-custody, from beginner to advanced <a href="https://twitter.com/namcios/status/1592678048385871875"><em>here</em></a>.</em></li></ul>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTEzOTYyMzU2NzEyNjEw/filc6b5xsaym1ge.jpg" height="316" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTEzOTYxMjgyMzgxMzM2/filc6i2x0aewcth.jpg" height="801" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crypto Contagion Lesson For Lenders: Stay Out Of Bitcoin Mining]]></title><description><![CDATA[The collapse of two giant crypto lending businesses that also mined bitcoin yields a few interesting lessons.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/crypto-lenders-shouldnt-mine-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/crypto-lenders-shouldnt-mine-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Contagion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lending]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Blockfi]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celsius network]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Zack Voell]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDg4MTA1ODc5ODA3NjY1/crypto-is-broke.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The collapse of two giant crypto lending businesses that also mined bitcoin yields a few interesting lessons.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>“Contagion” is the most popular word in crypto after the disastrous fallout of the past year. And dominos keep falling as investors painfully realize how closely intertwined the entire cryptocurrency industry is. Hundreds of billions of dollars were <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/three-arrows-capital-kyle-davies-su-zhu-crash.html">incinerated</a>.</p><p>And bitcoin mining companies have not completely avoided this. In fact, a unique type of mining business failed catastrophically, which could provide valuable lessons for future entrepreneurs. The combination of crypto lending and crypto mining was showcased in two high-profile companies: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy">BlockFi</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a>. Both of these companies are now bankrupt. What happened?</p><p>This article explores the histories, downfalls and lessons of both organizations.</p><h2>The Crypto Lending Businesses’ Mining Interests</h2><p>Even the most casual crypto observer would be familiar with the two industry-leading crypto lending businesses that went bust in 2022. What may be less widely known is that both of these companies also maintained significant bitcoin mining units. BlockFi and Celsius were not only the go-to names for centralized crypto lending, they also heavily invested in bitcoin mining. And when both companies sank, so did their mining teams.</p><p>BlockFi<a href="https://blockfi.com/blockfi-taps-blockstream-for-mining-colocation-services"> announced</a> its new mining operations in May 2021 in the form of a partnership with Blockstream and its long-standing mining unit. Exactly how much hash rate BlockFi is managing through Blockstream has not been disclosed, and the current status of BlockFi’s hash rate at Blockstream facilities is also not fully known. But the lending company <a href="https://blockfi.com/blockfi-taps-blockstream-for-mining-colocation-services">said</a> it viewed mining as a complement to its financial service offerings.</p><p>Celsius also invested heavily in bitcoin mining, with<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/124968/celsius-500-million-bitcoin-mining"> $500 million</a> spent on its mining efforts as of November 2021. In an older<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/124968/celsius-500-million-bitcoin-mining"> interview</a>, former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky said the company operated 22,000 mining machines, most of which were Antminer S19 models. Like BlockFi, Mashinsky described his company’s mining efforts as a strategic complement to its lending business.</p><p>To be clear, BlockFi and Celsius were not the only companies operating at the intersection of mining and lending. Mining companies lending their coins to other institutional market participants (e.g., trading firms) is not uncommon. And it’s not unreasonable to assume other, smaller lending firms also had exposure to the mining industry. But BlockFi and Celsius were unparalleled in the combined scale of both their lending and mining operations. Both companies were also bankrupted as a direct result of the fallout from the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">stunning collapse of FTX</a>.</p><h2>Tale Of Two Bankruptcies</h2><p>Both companies — Celsius and BlockFi — have now filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>In June 2022, Celsius announced it was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/celsius-halts-bitcoin-withdrawals-what-went-wrong">pausing all withdrawals</a>. The next month, the company<a href="https://dfr.vermont.gov/consumer-alert/celsius-network-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy"> filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Machinsky abruptly<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/27/celsius-ceo-resigns-in-the-middle-of-bankruptcy-proceedings.html"> resigned</a> in the middle of the bankruptcy proceedings but not before<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-founder-reportedly-withdrew-10m-before-bankruptcy-filing-ft"> reportedly</a> withdrawing $10 million.</p><p>The bankruptcy of Celsius Mining came just months after it<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/14/celsius-mining-unit-files-for-bankruptcy-just-months-after-announcing-ipo-intention/"> announced</a> its plans to go public. But the company planned to continue mining throughout its bankruptcy proceedings, and defended these plans vigorously. Celsius<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/crypto-lender-celsius-defends-bitcoin-mining-plans-bankruptcy-kicks-off-2022-07-18/"> said</a> its mining operations were key to the company’s restructuring efforts. But mining isn’t cheap. In the first two weeks of mining through bankruptcy, Celsius Mining burned $40 million,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/celsius-spent-40-million-on-crypto-mining-in-first-two-weeks-of-bankruptcy-11660945275?mod=article_inline"> according</a> to reporting by The Wall Street Journal. At the time, Celsius Mining told the court it expected the mining operations to become profitable by January 2023.</p><p>Shortly after Thanksgiving, BlockFi also<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/28/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-ftx-fallout-spreads.html"> filed</a> for bankruptcy. Its bitcoin mining operations have not played as prominent a role in the proceedings as Celsius’ has. No reports found for this article indicate that Blockstream’s agreement with BlockFi has been terminated or otherwise interrupted.</p><p>But the BlockFi-hosted mining operations were not its only mining-related concerns. In addition to hashing for itself, the company also originated loans to other mining entities. BlockFi’s corporate account<a href="https://twitter.com/blockfi/status/1587141611334443008"> addressed</a> this matter on Twitter one month before filing for bankruptcy. Some reports indicate that BlockFi could have suffered up to<a href="https://financefeeds.com/blockfi-faces-80-in-losses-over-exposure-to-crypto-miner-core-scientific/"> $80 million</a> in losses from its exposure to Core Scientific, for example.</p><h2>Why Mine And Lend?</h2><p>Why a lending company wants to mine bitcoin at all is a question worth answering. The precise answers to this vary, but here’s a simple explanation of one potential motivation: By essentially acting as “crypto savings banks” and lending bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) to various retail and institutional counterparties, institutions like BlockFi, for example, had minimal exposure at best to bitcoin’s parabolic upside. Its borrower clients, on the other hand, had full exposure to the market’s volatility. In theory, spinning up a mining operation could give lenders more material risk exposure with larger potential profits.</p><p>But the lending business — especially given how some of the crypto financial institutions manage their books — carries enough counterparty risk and operational complexity by itself, one would think. The mining business is notoriously ruthless and complicated, which places new entrants at massive disadvantages even in the best market conditions. Managing a mining unit in addition to a core lending service is beyond doubly tough compared to running only one or the other business, since business complexity scales exponentially, not linearly. Although successfully running a joint lending/mining business is not impossible, it certainly is not for an inexperienced or risk averse founder.</p><p>In short, after a decade of institutionalized mining growth, there are good reasons why most mining companies are only mining companies — not hybrid businesses with other core offerings outside of mining. Sure, some miners play the role of lender in limited cases, as previously mentioned. But their core business is mining. Doing anything else is often too much to manage.</p><h2>Don’t Rinse And Repeat</h2><p>2022 was a brutal year for all of “crypto,” but especially for miners and lenders. Both high-profile companies that combined the two businesses ended in bankruptcy. Unfortunately, the “crypto” industry has a goldfish-like memory and is more likely to repeat rather than avoid these mistakes. But, hopefully, the future includes severe adjustments in accepted practices for lenders and also strong recovery from well-managed, bear-market-hardened mining companies. If not, the pain and suffering of the 2022 bear market was for nothing. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Zack Voell.

Fedi shared some ideas of what those could be, including modules that would enable a communal savings pool to accumulate bitcoin for a large project, storing value in a local currency like dollars, receiving payments privately via static QR codes or links (similar to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/blockstream-core-lightning-bitcoin-rebrand">CLN’s BOLT 12 offers</a>), or operating a communal vote based spending pool.</p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-fedimint-scales-bitcoin-custody">Fedimint</a> is an open source custody platform that allows users to not only store their bitcoin, but also extend the functionality of their bitcoin with privacy, smart contracts, and more. It is based on the concept of <em>second-party custody</em>, which involves trusting family members or friends with the custody of one’s bitcoin in a way that improves the trust and security models inherent in the classic centralized third-party custody solutions. And it leverages<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-is-the-future-of-bitcoin-privacy"> Federated Chaumian Ecash</a>, which means users also gain privacy. <a href="https://twitter.com/ODELL/status/1531648367658401792?s=20&amp;t=dz1WCiFL_woUvwvc-r5Ypg">In a nutshell</a>, Fedimint wallets have the potential to bring strong privacy to Bitcoin users with better security than third-party custody setups and more ease of use than fully-fledged self-custody solutions.</p><p>"At Fedi, we believe that Fedimint will become the ideal open platform for the delivery of consensus-based applications on the internet," said Obi Nwosu, Fedi CEO, in a statement sent to Bitcoin Magazine. "Bitcoin was created to be a peer-to-peer sound money with full privacy, and that's what we want to offer to everyone globally.

During the event, we announced the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-to-issue-bitcoin-bond-on-the-liquid-bitcoin-sidechain">Bitcoin Volcano Bonds</a>, while President Bukele made a significant announcement of his own: the creation of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-president-nayib-bukele-released-model-of-bitcoin-city">Bitcoin City</a>. By legally recognizing bitcoin as tender and establishing Bitcoin City, President Bukele took a bold step toward nationwide adoption. This decision has helped to accelerate the timeline for bitcoin becoming a recognized currency on a national level.</p><p>Following the announcements, I received numerous requests from Bitcoiners around the world asking for my assistance with implementing Bitcoin projects in their local communities or with their governments. This interest came from both individuals actively involved in the Bitcoin community as well as from investors. The enthusiasm was largely inspired by the developments happening in El Salvador and the impact they were having on the global Bitcoin landscape.</p><h2>Driving Nation-State Adoption Of Bitcoin</h2><p>I had been considering the idea of promoting the adoption of Bitcoin by nation states for some time. After careful thought, I decided to leave Blockstream in 2022, start my own company called JAN3 and dedicate myself to advancing the adoption of Bitcoin as a global currency, known as hyperbitcoinization, and its adoption by nation states. Now, many might ask, why help nation states, why accelerate hyperbitcoinization? </p><p>The traditional fiat currency system has greatly exacerbated the credit cycle, a wave-like pattern characterized by periods of prosperity and recession. Under a gold standard, credit is issued based on assets like gold deposits or real estate. In contrast, under a fiat standard, credit is issued by governments and is backed by debt, such as government bonds. During times of economic expansion, more loans are issued and businesses grow. However, at a certain point, there may be too much credit in circulation relative to the actual output or productivity of the economy, leading to a mismatch between the financial and real economies and resulting in the formation of bubbles or market corrections. These events have been occurring more frequently and with more extreme highs and lows.</p><p>The mechanisms that central bankers have traditionally used are becoming less effective, like a diabetic needing more and more insulin. If this trend continues, we can expect a severe economic depression in the future. Without clear price discovery, a dynamic economy and the technological and market forces to alleviate competitive pressure, nation states may devolve into conflict and war. When the pie is not expanding, it is easier to take from someone else. </p><p>Under a Bitcoin standard, nation states have more incentive to better utilize their resources, as there is a real cost. This encourages peaceful, diplomatic resolution as the default game theory equilibrium. Adopting a Bitcoin standard and accelerating hyperbitcoinization may be our best hope of avoiding civilizational collapse, and ensuring a free and prosperous future for humanity. Simply put, it may help to prevent conflicts and wars driven by economic competition.</p><p>I announced the formation of JAN3 at <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/global-legislators-announce-pro-bitcoin-legislation">Bitcoin 2022 in Miami</a>. JAN3 is of course named for January 3, 2009, which is the day that Bitcoin came into existence, also known as Genesis Day.</p><p>As our director of operations, a former Royal Marine named Doogie, told me, establishing a presence in El Salvador was important for gaining a foothold for Bitcoin and allowing it to take root. We made the decision to open an office there for this reason. </p><p>For the Bitcoin network to become more robust, it is essential for more countries to adopt a Bitcoin standard. Although Bitcoin does not need anyone's help, it can be accelerated and supported by having more countries, territories and cities adopt it. For example, if a country is mining Bitcoin, it is not attacking the network. If a country has made bitcoin legal tender, it is not likely going to attempt a ban on “unhosted wallets.” Overall, having more countries adopt a Bitcoin standard is positive for the network.</p><h2>Hashing Through 2022</h2><p>2022 was an interesting year for many reasons. </p><p>Madeira, Portugal’s president, Miguel Albuquerque, announced the creation of <a href="https://www.freemadeira.com/">F.R.E.E. Madeira</a>, which gives Bitcoin a foothold in the European Union. The autonomous nature of the Madeira region gives it the ability to make bitcoin a de facto legal tender.</p><p>Próspera, Honduras has become <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/pr%C3%B3spera-bitcoin-legal-tender-explained">one of the most active Bitcoin hubs in the world</a>. President Joel Bombar <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/global-legislators-announce-pro-bitcoin-legislation">announced that bitcoin is legal tender in Próspera during Bitcoin 2022</a>. Recently, a Bitcoin space was inaugurated there, and a legal framework has been put in place to enable the issuance of Bitcoin bonds.</p><p>On April 27, the government of the Central African Republic <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-adopts-bitcoin-an-official-currency-2022-04-27/">announced that it would be adopting bitcoin as a legal tender</a>. This news was welcomed by Bitcoin enthusiasts, but the government also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-launches-sango-coin-cryptocurrency-amid-industry-rout-2022-07-15/">announced a project called Sango</a>, which is based on an alternative cryptocurrency. It is clear that the adoption of Bitcoin in the country has not progressed as quickly as some had hoped, but we remain hopeful that the Central African Republic will continue to embrace and support the use of Bitcoin.</p><p>The crypto market experienced a bear market due to a variety of factors, including the collapse of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX exchange</a>, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/terra-collapse-teaches-about-crypto-and-bitcoin">Luna/Terra crash</a> and the collapse of companies like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">Three Arrows Capital</a>.</p><p>At the Panama Blockchain Conference in July, Towerbank, a leading Panamanian bank, announced <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/one-of-panamas-largest-banks-just-became-bitcoin-friendly">plans to offer crypto banking services</a> throughout Latin America and beyond and has enlisted our assistance in implementing the Liquid network. Liquid, a Bitcoin sidechain, allows for the expansion of Bitcoin's capabilities through the use of smart contracts, without introducing a native token. This relationship with Towerbank is a promising development in the world of crypto banking and could help to further establish Bitcoin as a powerful and versatile financial tool.</p><p>On October 28, at Lugano’s Plan B Forum, Senator Zury Ríos of Guatemala presented a video for the Bitcoin community in which she expressed an interest in potentially incorporating Bitcoin into her future political plans. She opened up a dialogue with the community and invited them to share their thoughts and ideas on the matter. El Salvador <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/28/el-salvador-lugano-sign-agreement-to-help-spread-bitcoin-adoption-and-education/">also announced</a> it was opening an office in Lugano, intending to exchange knowledge and benefit commercially. Through the incredible efforts of Bitfinex and Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino, Lugano is making great progress onboarding merchants to Bitcoin. They have already succeeded in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/28/tethers-paolo-ardoino-discusses-luganos-plan-b-bitcoin-progress/">getting thousands of merchants</a> to adopt the cryptocurrency, and they are continuing to bring on more.</p><p>At the Adopting Bitcoin conference in El Salvador in November, it was clear that the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/reality-of-bukeles-bitcoin-el-salvador">situation with gangs in El Salvador has greatly improved</a>. Public safety has significantly increased, with a notable decrease in homicides and other crimes. This improvement is a testament to the effective measures put in place to address the issue and bring peace and security to the people of El Salvador.</p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/el-salvador-submits-bitcoin-bond-bill">The minister of the economy in El Salvador announced a new digital securities bill</a>, paving the way for the country to issue bitcoin-backed bonds. The legislation will establish the National Digital Assets Commission, which will be responsible for regulating digital asset issuers, service providers and other participants involved in the public offering process of digital securities.</p><p>There’s a lot more to go over, but unfortunately I can’t discuss it just yet. Change is coming and Bitcoin is going to be a major topic across the world.</p><h2>Visions For 2023</h2><p>2023 is shaping up to be a promising year for Bitcoin. In El Salvador, the digital securities laws that will form the foundation of the Bitcoin Volcano Bonds have been sent to Congress for approval. These bonds could be available on Bitfinex Securities very soon.</p><p>El Salvador’s star will truly continue to rise. El Salvador has already attracted a lot of interest for its embrace of Bitcoin, and many other countries are watching closely to see how things progress there. As El Salvador continues to lead the way in Bitcoin adoption, we expect it to continue to rise in prominence.</p><p>We expect to see more adoption of Bitcoin in the coming year, as it continues to gain traction despite the current lows. The world needs bitcoin, at any price. For those living in affluent countries, Bitcoin is optional, but for people living in the global south, it is a necessity. Take note, the gap between “affluent county” and “global south” is closing fast. </p><p>At JAN3, we have been receiving numerous requests from people in different countries for assistance with adopting Bitcoin. In addition to our work in El Salvador and the Madeira region, we are also focusing on countries like Costa Rica, Ecuador and more. Just last week, Sitiveni Rabuka, the prime minister of Fiji, stated that <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/fiji-prime-minister-bitcoin-legal-tender">he was considering making bitcoin legal tender</a>. </p><p>Despite the current bear market, we believe that there is no better time to build a strong foundation for the future of Bitcoin adoption. The work we do now will lay the foundation for a more free and prosperous economic future through the acceleration of hyperbitcoinization and nation-state adoption.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Samson Mow.

Here are some themes I’m seeing for Bitcoin in 2023.</p><h2>Regulatory Overreach</h2><p>The Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-fatf-is-loading-the-gun">forcing exchanges and bitcoin service providers to document and share ever-more information about customer transactions</a>. We are seeing politicians such as Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/elizabeth-warren-introduces-anti-bitcoin-bill">publicly go against Bitcoin</a>, and even if her proposed digital asset AML act has no real chance of passing, it does foreshadow that there are future battles coming on this. </p><p>But, on the other hand, we should also remember that governments were <a href="https://voipstudio.com/blog/why-are-governments-threatened-by-voip/">initially against voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technologies</a> (e.g., Skype, etc.), and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/skype-accused-of-helping-government-spy-on-people-2012-7">nowadays they <em>use </em>VoIP</a>. It’ll be similar with bitcoin, where some countries adopt it as legal tender, hold bitcoin in reserves, provide Bitcoin services for citizens and encourage bitcoin investors and entrepreneurs. </p><h2>CBDCs And The War On Cash</h2><p>The war on cash proceeds, with many countries taking <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/money/where-have-the-rs-2000-notes-gone-finance-ministry-clarifies/2911041/">high-denomination cash notes out of circulation</a>, or <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigeria-bans-atm-cash-withdrawals-over-225-a-week-to-force-use-of-cbdc">banning physical cash transactions above a threshold</a>. There are many countries talking about central bank digital currency (CBDC) trials, but my speculation is that most will not have the technical and overall economic capability to stand up a fully-functioning CBDC in 2023. </p><p>2023 will mostly be about trials and rhetoric, in preparation for future CBDC rollouts. Governments can especially force people into CBDCs in countries with large welfare states, with the understanding being, “If you want your welfare check, you’ll take it as a CBDC.” Just like Darth Vader in “Star Wars,” it’ll be a case of, “Pray I do not alter the deal any further.”</p><p>Once upon a time, CBDCs might have been seen as a “conspiracy theory” but by now they are clearly coming as a threat to financial freedom and privacy. Sadly, most people will not see the threat until it is too late and CBDCs are upon them — but it is also the pain of CBDCs that will push more people into using Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. </p><h2>Maxis Being Minted And Resurgence In Self-Custody Interest</h2><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-bitcoin-maximalism-is-critical">Bitcoin Maximalists</a> are being minted as casual “crypto” fans get rekt on platforms such as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy">BlockFi</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/voyager-digital-files-for-bankruptcy">Voyager</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-26/crypto-lender-nexo-in-talks-on-terms-of-planned-vauld-purchase">Vauld</a>, etc. So, in some ways, it’s very cyclical, the 2014 to 2015 bear cycle followed after the collapse of Mt. Gox, and during the 2018 to 2019 bear cycle, we saw the breakdown of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/latest-report-on-quadrigacx-confirms-fears-of-mass-fraud">QuadrigaCX</a> — so we’re just going through another round of people having to learn the hard way. </p><p>For 2023, we will see a stronger self-custody culture given the pain of 2022 is more recent. This is not to preclude future cycles and waves of new adoption with people coming in who are not as careful. Yield and shitcoin scams will be back in another form sooner or later, but it will be a new round of people who succumb to them. </p><p>We are seeing more rounds of content and webinars that relate to self custody. For example, with Swan Bitcoin I hosted some <a href="https://swanbitcoin.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_hh2CClPTRQqjxeBAI2ogbg">self custody 101 webinars</a> (which will be ongoing), and these webinars had some of the highest interest and registrations of <em>any</em> Swan webinars ever offered. Offering an easy auto-withdrawal feature or being 100% non-custodial will be an important feature for Bitcoin on-ramps in 2023. </p><h2>Miniscript Wallets And Features</h2><p>Per <a href="https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/">Pieter Wuille’s site</a>: </p><p>“Miniscript is a language for writing (a subset of) Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way, enabling analysis, composition, generic signing and more.”</p><p>For those who are unfamiliar, Miniscript is a way to more easily express different scripts or spending conditions for bitcoin. This could be built into different wallets in ways that enable easier cross-hardware and -software compatibility. </p><p>You might first think, “Why should I care?” and, at the start, you’d be right to ask that. But over time, this will enable more sophisticated self custody, enterprise or even inheritance planning scenarios. Want to have a three-of-three multisig setup that degrades down to a two-of-three multisig setup after 90 days? Or have different “back out” conditions that exist for a business context? Miniscript makes it <em>easier</em> to do these things, and to let people use their existing software or hardware for this purpose. To be clear, some of this is already possible with Bitcoin script today, but Miniscript makes it more technically feasible or easier to achieve in practice. </p><p>It will take time for these solutions to be built out, but the functionality does seem promising. Businesses and enterprise customers may be particularly interested in this because it could make their self-custody practices more practical for employees and key holders to execute. </p><p>Currently, there is <a href="https://github.com/revault/liana">Liana</a> (by the same team behind Revault), and <a href="https://blog.ledger.com/miniscript-is-coming/">Ledger</a>, which has announced Miniscript support in its hardware, and <a href="https://twitter.com/StepanSnigirev/status/1375113463421399043">Specter DIY had already enabled support in 2021</a>! Rob Hamilton has also spoken about Miniscript uses in the world of insurance <a href="https://twitter.com/Rob1Ham/status/1603124029212196865">here</a>. I anticipate more support coming in 2023. </p><p>This could help push the use of bitcoin into self-custodial directions, and away from the “old model” of financial services where you have to place more trust in government, banks and fiat financial institutions to honor their word or not debase your wealth. </p><h2>Lightning First</h2><p>It’s time to bring about a Lightning-first model for two types of bitcoin transactions: low-value transactions and in-person commerce. We saw the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/rbf-debate-is-incentives-and-choice">mempoolfullRBF debate</a> blow up toward the end of 2022, but the real answer for most of us is to promote and use Lightning first, where possible. </p><p>As a quick anecdote, I recall talking with Giacomo Zucco who was explaining his experience in El Salvador of paying with bitcoin at a supermarket. Unfortunately, the Chivo terminal at that time defaulted to Bitcoin on-chain, and as he paid on-chain, the people in the line behind him had to wait for confirmation, which was very awkward. Contrast this with a Lightning-first experience which could look more like this:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbeastmedia/status/1607045177499324418"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>We should show people the best of Bitcoin and for in-person, lower-value commerce, we should go for Lightning first. I believe we’ll start to see this being driven and encouraged by more Bitcoiners and local communities in 2023. </p><h2>Expansion Of Bitcoin-Only Communities And Events</h2><p>We will see more events and small-sized conferences in different countries around the world. Contrary to some who believe there are too many Bitcoin conferences, the issue is more one of assuming that you must attend them all! </p><p>You should instead attend the events and conferences that align with your interests and/or geography. Having more conferences is a good thing, so long as they are done in a low-cost, effective way. For example, the <a href="https://stephanlivera.com/episode/440/">Bitcoin bush bash</a> is a model that we may see replicated around the world — free to attend, held in a hall or other free/cheap area, no recordings, smaller-size gathering that is hosted somewhere that is cost effective. </p><p>By lowering the expectations about things that typically cost a lot more money (e.g., fancy, professionalized operations, live streaming, lots of international speakers), Bitcoiners can grow their local scenes and meetups. This is not to detract from the larger Bitcoin events and conferences, as they also play a key role — but I see a “middle ground” that can be taken up by low cost, local events. </p><h2>Overall Sentiment</h2><p>Without having a crystal ball for 2023, I believe bitcoin’s fiat price will remain in a mostly sideways trend. Forget what the bull-hopium people are posting and talking about, they are usually chasing engagement or getting too caught up in their own echo chambers. It takes time for the cycle to bottom out. </p><p>But let’s look on the bright side, it’s a great time for stacking sats and building something. Remember, in prior cycles, it wasn’t so clear that “Bitcoin would come back,” whereas now, the world is slowly realizing that Bitcoin is here to stay. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Stephan Livera.

He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.</em></p><blockquote><p>“First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/first-they-ignore-you/">Attributed to Mahatma Ghandi</a></p></blockquote><p>At the time of this writing, the U.S. Senate had just introduced the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sen-warren-unconstitutional-crypto-bill">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2022</a>. The bill contains many threatening aspects, such as KYC laws for self-custody wallets and money-transmitter licensing requirements. </p><p>This bill also comes on the heels of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/30/ecb-says-bitcoin-is-on-road-to-irrelevance-amid-crypto-collapse">revelation</a> that Bitcoin is on an “artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance.” About a week later, an official from the bank announced it was considering a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/ecb-considers-bitcoin-ban-to-curb-environmental-damage/ar-AA154ilO">Bitcoin and crypto ban</a> in order to mitigate environmental damage. </p><p><a href="https://www.powermag.com/energy-crisis-deepens-as-nuclear-reactors-remain-offline-in-france/">But as the energy crisis in Europe deepens</a>, don’t you think European regulators have bigger fish to fry, like <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/energy-crisis-fuels-coal-comeback-114311573.html">Germany’s rising use of coal power</a>? Or maybe politicians and officials are starting to understand Bitcoin and how it tips the scales of power? On second thought… maybe not. </p><p>The below is a thread by Level39 depicting testimony from the recent Senate Banking Committee hearing.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1603214594012598273"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>&nbsp;I think this is just the beginning of the “then they fight you stage” and it will only get worse in 2023. Stay vigilant this year. While a ban and much of the regulations would be comically impossible to actually enforce, they would serve as a significant speed bump to widespread adoption. I would keep an ear to the ground (and probably to Bitcoin Twitter) to stay abreast of situations that could be influenced by a sea of calls to your governmentally-elected representatives, just like what happened with the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-infrastructure-bill-engage">infrastructure bill in 2021</a>.</p><h2>The Debt Spiral… Spirals</h2><p>Luckily, I think more and more people will begin to wake up from the matrix and realize just how bad the situation really is. The fact is, it’s getting pretty hard to obscure at this point.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The above chart is essentially my new favorite picture. When people ask me about Bitcoin lately, all I do is show them this graph and they pretty quickly understand the magnitude of money creation during the 2020 COVID-19 era. What they don’t quite understand, just yet, is that it is going to continue, and probably at increasing rates and intervals. </p><p><br>The U.S. federal government is already <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-pace-1-trillion-budget-deficit-2023-2-7-billion-new-debt-day">projected</a> to run a $1 trillion deficit in 2023 (that’s 12 zeroes, folks). Even if the U.S. government shut down the entire military and eliminated the Department of Defense’s <a href="https://veteran.com/2023-defense-budget/">projected $800 billion budget</a>, the budget would still be projected to be operating in the red for 2023. The real kicker in this is that the deficit is likely to be much higher, meaning that more debt will have to be issued, and that would be in a period of increasing interest rates due to Federal Reserve tightening.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/12/12/unhappy-new-year-cbo-forecasts-poor-economy-soaring-deficits-in-2023/">Congressional Budget Office</a> is projecting that negative growth in GDP is about as likely as lower-than-expected positive growth. Couple that with an expected increase in unemployment, and you get yourself a fiscal double whammy. First, unemployment and negative GDP growth imply less tax receipts to the federal government, meaning a potentially bigger deficit, i.e., more debt. You add in the fact that the debt is being issued at a significantly higher rate, and you’ve got yourself the ingredients for an accelerating <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/debt-spiral-leads-to-bitcoin-adoption">debt spiral</a>. </p><p>Even if everything goes completely to plan, a trillion-dollar deficit is certainly nothing to celebrate. I think the numbers speak for themselves. People I work with and am friends with are really starting to notice and get worried; people who have never previously given a lick of interest to economics before.</p><p>And when all of the proverbial stuff hits the spinning thing, you can bet that the Fed steps right in with more money printing. Adding a trillion or so dollars to the debt at <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/traders-trim-bets-fed-rate-hike-slowdown-after-jobs-report-2022-12-02/">5% interest</a>? I don’t think it’s gonna happen. I’m betting interest rates won’t be much higher for much longer. Quantitative easing three is dead. Long live quantitative easing infinity.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Coincidentally, as I write this article, I received the above article in an email from the <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/thebitcoinlayer/p/merry-christmas-rate-hikes-are-over?r=5b4lf&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_campaign=post">Bitcoin Layer</a>. Looks like they agree with me. Rate hikes can’t hike much more than they’ve already hiked. They’re basically off of the trail. </p><h2>Bitcoin Reignites The Pioneer Spirit</h2><p>Once upon a time, in a place called America, people used to take responsibility for their actions, traveling off to seek adventure and opportunity in the West. The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-infrastructure-bill-engage">Oklahoma Sooners</a>’ namesake hails from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Rush_of_1889">Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889</a>, where nearly 50,000 Americans lined up on the edge of the “Unassigned Lands” to race to claim their stakes in the undeveloped wildlands that became Oklahoma. </p><p>Much like homesteading in the 19th century, Bitcoin is both a team sport and a race. It’s a race in the sense that if you do not take responsibility to claim your stake in cyberspace before someone else, you may have missed an opportunity of a lifetime. It’s a team sport in the sense that successfully adopting Bitcoin into your life will likely require a degree of help from others. </p><p>How many BTC Sessions videos did you watch before setting up your first hardware wallet? How long after that did you actually send any UTXOs to your self-custody address? How long did it take before you even knew what a UTXO is?</p><p>Bitcoin is the new frontier, the digitalization of the Unassigned Lands in the old American West. The journey is fraught with dangers and pitfalls, but the payoff is an opportunity that we will likely never see again during our lifetimes. Everyone gets bitcoin at the price that they deserve, yes, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help them accelerate the learning process. </p><p>Let’s make 2023 the year we drained the exchanges; auditing them for paper bitcoin through sheer blunt force trauma. I challenge you to try and embody the homesteading pioneer spirit to help make this happen; to help your friends and family understand this phenomenon and opportunity. To help them take self custody and preserve their wealth in a self-sovereign way. Help lead the horse to water, so to speak. You can’t save everybody, but you can at least try to help them see what’s coming, and stake their claim in the new Wild West in cyberspace. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

This was caused by the United States setting up the American Colonial Bank and declaring the U.S. dollar as legal tender (the official money) of Puerto Rico, changing it from the peso.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Nzk4MzE4MjE0MTk0MzM4/colonial-bank.png" height="442" width="620">

    </figure><p>However, in <a href="https://waragainstallpuertoricans.com/historical-overview/">1899, one peso was only worth 60 cents</a>, meaning the local businesses of Puerto Rico and its citizens <a href="https://waragainstallpuertoricans.com/historical-overview/">lost 40% of their net worths overnight</a> from causes totally outside of their control. This resulted in Puerto Ricans, attempting to save their net worths, <a href="http://colonial">borrowing money from the American Colonial Bank</a>. However, high interest rates made it very unlikely that locals were going to be able to pay back their loans, causing many Puerto Ricans to default on their debt. The result was that the bank seized their assets (in these days, typically their land).</p><section><figure>

    </figure><p>Puerto Rico uses the U.S. dollar as its legal tender and is vulnerable to the consequences of reckless monetary policy, including the expansion of this money supply (inflation), and has already experienced major currency devaluation (as noted above). Looking at the 2020 section of the chart above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States central bank<a href="https://www.cityam.com/almost-a-fifth-of-all-us-dollars-were-created-this-year/"> printed about 20% of the total dollars circulating in the economy</a>, flooding the market with dollars. Money printing has devastating consequences on local economies, especially for lower- and middle-income families. Money printing results in a wider wealth gap with goods and services becoming more expensive. Home prices and food prices in Puerto Rico are rapidly increasing.</p><figure>

A man who valued human freedoms, the right to privacy, self sovereignty, independence and prosperity. </p><p>He grew up in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Albizu_Campos">Machuelo Abajo</a> section of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Incredibly well educated, Campos graduated from a top-tier school in the United States and could speak six languages. He was that guy, he led by example, showed up every day to lead, instilled values, dreamed big and provided inclusiveness regardless of class or status. He was a true man of the people, who understood the power within others, recognizing that they don’t need to be dependent on anyone else. </p><p>During his time, his focus in particular was Puerto Rico’s freedom and independence. Understanding the in-depth history of Puerto Rico is crucial to understanding why he chose this focus. If Alibuzu Campos was alive today, he would be a Bitcoiner.

    </figure><p>When individuals don’t have access to proper banking or financial services, the implications are devastating. Bitcoin not only allows anyone to open a bank account, it allows anyone to become their own banker.</p><h2>Why Bitcoin?</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin is:</p><ul><li><strong>Decentralized: </strong>Bitcoin is the first form of money in the history of human existence that is not controlled by any individual, corporation or government.</li><li>Open: Bitcoin allows anyone to participate in the network. It doesn’t recognize race, borders, religions or any cultural identities. On a deeper level, it doesn’t even recognize humans or age.</li><li><strong>Permissionless:</strong> Bitcoin doesn’t require permission from a government or third party to save or transact value, meaning that the only participants in a financial transaction are the senders and receivers. No banks, PayPals, Venmos, <a href="https://portal.athmovil.com/">ATH Móvil</a>, etc. are involved. You don’t need permission to open a savings account.</li><li><strong>Unconfiscatable: </strong>With Bitcoin, your wealth is protected for generations to come. This is made possible by encrypted keys (passwords) that only you may know. It cannot be frozen, seized or stolen from you. If you die without a contingency plan, your bitcoin will die with you and can’t ever be spent.</li><li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Bitcoin’s transaction ledger is available to anyone at any time. Issuance of the currency is known and cannot be changed. Bitcoin’s network audits the ledger every 10 minutes to ensure all participants are operating within the rules of the network.</li><li><strong>Absolute Scarcity:</strong> Bitcoin has absolute scarcity. Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist. Bitcoin can’t be replicated, duplicated, counterfeited or double spent. Bitcoin is the perfect unit of account.</li><li><strong>Growth In The Future: </strong>Bitcoin allows Puerto Ricans to become individually sovereign. Bitcoin separates money from the power of the State, just as critically as the separation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state">church from the government was in the 18th century</a>, which led to the great enlightenment. We can’t rely on systems of trust in individuals, institutions or governments to have control over our financial destiny. Bitcoin is trustless — verify everything.</li></ul><h2>Love For Puerto Rico</h2><p>My inspiration to write this piece came from not only being a bitcoiner but from being a local of Puerto Rico. I love the people, the communities and the values that are instilled in this island.</p><p>Puerto Rico offers an <a href="https://www.ddec.pr.gov/en/puerto-rico-incentives-code">Act 60 decree</a> for business and individuals who can move form the United States to the island and establish businesses there, which enables them not to pay any capital gains taxes and only a 4% income tax as long as they spend 51% of their time in Puerto Rico. </p><p>Now, to be clear, Act 60 provides tremendous value to Puerto Rico and should be embraced. However, on the contrary, Act 60 also provides an open invitation to bad actors and scammers who can walk away from their scams in the form of failed projects/businesses without tax implications. During the 2021 crypto bull market, I saw personally that Puerto Rico became a cesspool of individuals who launched cryptocurrency projects and marketed their questionable financial innovations to everyday investors, only to walk away from the projects with large sums of investors’ money, burning those who invested with funds earned from working real jobs that provided real benefits to the world. There are countless examples of this, which provide context and makes it understandable as to why many locals may have resentment toward cryptocurrency.</p><p>Bitcoin is not crypto, Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme, Bitcoin is not an individual nor company, Bitcoin is not an Act 60 beneficiary, Bitcoin is not colonialism, Bitcoin is not instilled by the government. Bitcoin is money, Bitcoin is freedom, Bitcoin is independence, Bitcoin allows every Puerto Rican to have the individual prosperity that many locals have defended and died for. </p><p>Bitcoin is Puerto Rico’s chance to have an independent identity while allowing its citizens to be 100% self sovereign. Adapting a bitcoin standard would provide tremendous benefit for places like Puerto Rico. Learn what bitcoin is, educate others, become individually sovereign and start building the Puerto Rico your ancestors envisioned.</p><figure>

"However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change. Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly."</p><p>McClurg told Bitcoin Magazine that the proposal would be for current GBTC shareholders to vote on <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxy-vote.asp">via proxy</a>. If chosen by the shareholders, Valkyrie would become the sponsor.</p><p>The process isn’t as straightforward as it seems, however. As highlighted on a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/valkyrie-unveils-proposal-for-grayscale-s-troubled-bitcoin-trust-gbtc">Bloomberg</a> report, "Grayscale <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001588489/000119312522053501/d289251d10k.htm">filings</a> state that shareholders take no part in the management or control of the trust, and have limited voting rights. In addition, no amendments to the trust agreement that could materially affect the interests of shareholders can be made with a vote of at least a majority — meaning 50% — of the shares."</p><p>McClurg explained to Bitcoin Magazine that Valkyrie is aware of those issues, and has planned ahead. He declined to comment on any specifics of what that plan might entail, but hinted that this wouldn’t be their first time achieving such a goal. When it comes to the plans for after an eventual takeover, McClurg has it laid out. </p><p>The first action Valkyrie would take in the event that it becomes GBTC’s sponsor and manager would be to "immediately file for Reg M exemption," the executive explained. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/grayscale-ceo-bitcoin-etf-now-165836645.html">Yahoo Finance</a> earlier this month that the trust not allowing redemptions is a result of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shutdown in 2014, who found GBTC redemptions to be in violation of Reg M. According to <a href="https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulation-m-filings">FINRA</a>, the SEC’s Regulation M "is designed to prevent manipulation by individuals with an interest in the outcome of an offering, and prohibits activities and conduct that could artificially influence the market for an offered security."</p><p>"If approved by the SEC, [the exemption] would allow us to redeem shares at par value for shareholders who want to redeem," McClurg told Bitcoin Magazine. </p><p>The move would allegedly help alleviate what might currently be GBTC’s most pressing issue: a whopping 47% discount of its shares compared to the value of the underlying assets held.</p><p>"Redemptions typically cause a discount to narrow due to ability of market makers to arbitrage," Valkyrie’s executive added.</p><p>McClurg said the firm would also reduce the management fee to 75 basis points, down from the 200 basis points currently levied by Grayscale.</p><p>It isn’t clear whether Grayscale has sought Reg M exemption yet, and McClurg told Bitcoin Magazine that "nothing is stopping Grayscale from doing this themselves." GBTC’s current manager is seeking a conversion of the trust into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund –– something it claims would eliminate the discount given the ability of an ETF to create and redeem shares on demand. It has gone as far as to sue the SEC under the basis that the regulator allowed the listing of futures-based products and doesn't have the grounds to deny similar spot offerings. This could seemingly help explain the firm’s reluctance to apply for Reg M exemption, as an eventual exemption from the SEC could reduce the discount to near zero and kill its leverage for the ETF move. It isn’t clear whether that is the case, however. Valkyrie would still pursue the conversion if turned GBTC's manager.</p><p>"We would still attempt a conversion, but would work with regulators for an orderly conversion on their time," McClurg said.</p><p><em>Find more details of Valkyrie's proposal <a href="https://valkyrieinvest.com/press/opportunities-around-gbtc/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</em></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5MDM2OTg5NDkwNjY5MDEy/20220424_btcfinal_decentralized-law-vs-centralized-legislation---jimmy-song.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why A Bitcoin Ban In The EU Is Likely… And Stupid]]></title><description><![CDATA[Despite holding off to date, a Bitcoin ban by the EU could be on the horizon.

It is increasingly seen as a “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1aecb2db-8f61-427c-a413-3b929291c8ac">dirty currency</a>.” Elon Musk’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/elon-musk-tesla-to-resume-bitcoin-payments">Tesla</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/05/02/wikipedia-wikimedia-foundation-no-crypto-donations-environment-climate-bitcoin-ethereum/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/21/greenpeace-bitcoin-carbon-footprint/">Greenpeace</a> and other organizations have stopped accepting BTC for their products or as a means to donate money. </p><p>Musk, who is not only one of the richest but also one of the most controversial people on this planet, <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musks-surprise-statement-crypto-001738245.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCryptocurrency%20is%20a%20good%20idea,transitions%20to%20more%20sustainable%20energy.%E2%80%9D">has said</a>: “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels, and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.” Ouch.</p><p>And it’s not just Musk. Politicians have also taken aim at Bitcoin.</p><p>Before the European Commission’s <a href="https://www.klgates.com/MiCA-Overview-of-the-new-EU-crypto-asset-regulatory-framework-Part-1-11-15-2022">Markets in Crypto-Asset Regulation</a> (MiCA) regulation was passed, it caused quite a stir within the Bitcoin community, especially due to the left-wing factions of the EU Parliament that were opposed to proof of work (PoW) and the power consumption of the Bitcoin network. In the trilogue, a version of MiCA was finally passed that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-14/eu-crypto-proposal-seen-as-de-facto-bitcoin-ban-fails-in-vote">did not ban PoW or mining</a>. </p><p>As became known in April 2022, some members of the European Parliament (MEPs) tried to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-officials-considered-bitcoin-trading-ban-to-enforce-proposed-mining-ban?_ga=2.28113724.1436037453.1666349186-1472835858.1607893106">push through a ban on bitcoin mining and one on BTC trading</a> in the course of the draft law. Luckily, they failed.</p><p>However, the foundations for further steps have been laid. For example, the issuers of cryptocurrencies, which we know are mostly simply tech startups, will be obliged to deliver some kind of report on the energy consumption and the associated carbon footprint of the respective asset.

The ECB is issuing warnings about cryptocurrencies on a regular basis, naming their <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/fsr/html/ecb.fsr202105~757f727fe4.en.html">“exorbitant carbon footprint” as “grounds for concern”</a>.</p><p>Just recently, on November 30, 2022, the ECB published a blog post titled “<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2022/html/ecb.blog221130~5301eecd19.en.html#:~:text=Amid%20the%20widespread%20fallout%20in,17%2C000%20by%20mid%2DJune%202022.">Bitcoin’s Last Stand</a>.” In it, ECB’s Market Infrastructure And Payments Director General Ulrich Bindseil and advisor Jürgen Schaff argue that, “Bitcoin's conceptual design and technological shortcomings make it questionable as a means of payment.” </p><p>According to Bindseil and Schaff, Bitcoin transactions are “cumbersome, slow and expensive,” which they say explains why the world’s largest cryptocurrency — created to overcome the existing monetary and financial system — "has never been used to any significant extent for legal real-world transactions.” Bindseil and Schaff added that since Bitcoin is neither an effective payment system nor a form of investment, “it should be treated as neither in regulatory terms and thus should not be legitimized.”</p><p>While it may seem paradoxical to very vocally attack something that is on the “road to irrelevance,” it is not the first time that the ECB has attacked Bitcoin.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1583459590653419521"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>In July 2022, the ECB singled out Bitcoin in a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_3~d9614ea8e6.en.html">research article</a> and compared proof of work to fossil fuel cars while considering proof of stake as more akin to electric vehicles. Let’s ignore for a minute that this doesn’t make sense and look at what it wrote in detail:</p><blockquote><p>“Public authorities should not stifle innovation, as it is a driver of economic growth. Although the benefit for society of bitcoin itself is doubtful, blockchain technology in principle may provide yet unknown benefits and technological applications. Hence, authorities could choose not to intervene with a view to supporting digital innovation. At the same time, it is difficult to see how authorities could opt to ban petrol cars over a transition period but turn a blind eye to bitcoin-type assets built on PoW technology, with country-sized energy consumption footprints and yearly carbon emissions that currently negate most euro area countries’ past and target GHG saving. This holds especially given that an alternative, less energy-intensive blockchain technology exists.”</p></blockquote><p>In general, the ECB believes it’s highly unlikely that the European Union will <em>not</em> take action in terms of carbon emissions on PoW-based assets like bitcoin. The authors of the paper argue that in their view it’s likely that the EU will take similar steps on phasing out PoW as they are doing with fossil fuel cars. Especially since, according to them, an “alternative, less energy-intensive” technology like PoS exists.</p><blockquote><p>“To continue with the car analogy, public authorities have the choice of incentivising the crypto version of the electric vehicle (PoS and its various blockchain consensus mechanisms) or to restrict or ban the crypto version of the fossil fuel car (PoW blockchain consensus mechanisms). So, while a hands-off approach by public authorities is possible, it is highly unlikely, and policy action by authorities (e.g. disclosure requirements, carbon tax on crypto transactions or holdings, or outright bans on mining) is probable. The price impact on the crypto-assets targeted by policy action is likely to be commensurate with the severity of the policy action and whether it is a global or regional measure.”</p></blockquote><p>The vast majority of citizens are used to thinking of money as something other than what it really is, and the ECB is also to blame for this. Money is perceived as something that has value by itself, instead of something whose value comes from the interaction between the people who use it.</p><p>The euro is subject to both constant changes (regular inflation) and traumatic events (devaluations, forced exchange rates, etc.), but these are ignored or otherwise underestimated. People believe they own it, although they can only exchange it for other things.</p><p>For how many and for what things will 100 euros be exchanged in one year, five years or ten years? This is, in no way, up to us.</p><p>Its exchange function is constantly changing due to factors we cannot control. The interaction between those who use it is the main factor and, in turn, this interaction depends on economic and monetary policy rules that few people know about.</p><p>Bitcoin escapes these rules (and this is the reason why the ECB wants to ban it), it is just code that the ECB and the regulators are trying to make useless. Bitcoin also and above all expresses its value through features that are totally independent of a government’s power and, therefore, the ECBs.</p><h2>What Will Happen Next?</h2><p><br>In 2025, we will see a rating system for cryptocurrencies according to their environmental impact within the European Union — think energy labels for fridges or TVs. You can already expect that bitcoin will get the worst classification. <a href="https://www.business2community.com/crypto-news/eus-crypto-energy-labelling-good-for-ethereum-bad-for-bitcoin-02562875">This step will essentially be positive for Ethereum and bad for Bitcoin</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>It’s quite unlikely that such a label will scare off investors from buying bitcoin, especially since the Bitcoin community is saying that the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-a-green-energy-battery">Bitcoin network is not an obstacle but a solution for more green energy</a>.</p><p>Therefore, the Bitcoin mining industry has the incentive to become greener: The fossil fuel analogy in the ECB paper makes no sense. The energy mix of a PoW network like Bitcoin can come entirely from renewable, green sources. Bitcoin can serve as a way to immediately monetize energy, as is <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/03/30/exxon-bitcoin-mining-gas-flares-crypto-electricity/">already happening with flared gas</a> that would be flared anyway. However, it’s questionable how fast and effective this effort will be to policymakers, especially since fossil energy companies like Exxon are now mining Bitcoin using flared gas.</p><p>The authors of the ECB paper are already implying that a higher bitcoin price equals more energy consumption, as more miners will participate. Destroying demand for bitcoin would hence be an effective solution to bring down the hash rate. At least in theory.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The academic and political consensus seems to point toward something like trying to retire the “old” PoW, and moving towards the “new” PoS standard. Particularly since Ethereum’s recent merge, many bystanders believe this could be a viable path for the Bitcoin network. We doubt that and plan to elaborate on that in a future post. As we’ve seen in different scenarios, banning Bitcoin is hard, if not impossible. The Nigerian government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/31/out-of-control-and-rising-why-bitcoin-has-nigerias-government-in-a-panic">tried, failed and eventually gave up</a>, for instance.</p><p>It will be quite a while until 2025, and with an energy crisis, increased focus on carbon emission as well as global uncertainty overall, the only thing we can do at this point is to expect the unexpected.</p><p>Even if the worst-case scenario happens, and we see a Bitcoin ban of some sort happen in the EU, we doubt that this will hold forever. Bitcoin does not ask for permission. Bitcoin is something that ontologically struggles to stay inside a fence. It is not an idea derived from anarchist positions, it is an argument derived from the inherent characteristics of the technology introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto. The regulators work in an authorizing logic and so it is clear that they struggle to intercept the Bitcoin phenomenon, which functions regardless of someone else’s permission.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Guglielmo Cecero and Raphael Schoen.

But other factors will continue to incentivize miners.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Dillon Healy, a member of the institutional partnerships team at Bitcoin Magazine and The Bitcoin Conference.</em></p><p>A topic that has <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1597320944846254080?s=21&amp;t=XbrTMWx_blK5GzLVnuXaxQ">received increased attention</a> lately is the concern around Bitcoin’s future “security budget.”</p><p>This mainly stems from the worry that miner revenue will not be enough to offer adequate security in the future, post <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/b/block-subsidy/">block subsidy</a>. Bitcoin miners play a crucial part in securing the network by proposing blocks of transactions which nodes then verify, accept and update to the Bitcoin ledger. Competing against other miners to propose this new block to the chain, miners use intense computing power to complete the proof-of-work consensus algorithm, and win the right to propose the new block.</p><p>For this service, the winning miner receives a block reward, which is made of two components: the block subsidy and the transaction fees. The block subsidy is the amount of new bitcoin minted in each block (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter">currently 6.25 bitcoin</a>), this subsidy of new bitcoin released from the total supply of 21 million is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769">cut in half about every four years with the halving</a>. The block subsidy<a href="https://www.theblock.co/linked/113186/bitcoin-miners-earned-971-million-in-revenue-during-july"> currently makes up the vast majority of total miner revenue</a>. </p><p>Simplified, the concern is that the transaction fee portion of the miner rewards will not be raised enough to make up for the loss of the block subsidy, resulting in decreased security for the Bitcoin network and an increased likelihood in attacks as miners are no longer incentivized to participate. My view, though, is that most who are worried about this are misunderstanding Bitcoin’s long-term game theory, incentive mechanisms, scalability and adoption potential.</p><p>With that being said, this is a topic that should probably be discussed more publicly and not shrugged off as a non-issue. There are <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/it-time-begin-talking-seriously-about-bitcoin-tail-emissions.htm">people advocating for tail emissions to be added</a>, creating an increase to Bitcoin’s 21 million supply as a solution to the security budget (settlement finality) issue, which is concerning. </p><p>I believe the solution (if you can call it that) is already baked into the Bitcoin incentive structure and adoption curve. There are two parts: one, transaction fees scaling with Bitcoin adoption and as a security measure and two, Bitcoin mining transitioning to an auxiliary tool. </p><h2>Transaction Fee Scaling</h2><p>When this issue is raised, it usually comes from somebody with a misunderstanding of how or why transaction fees will increase or advocating for proof of stake (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1597320944846254080?s=21&amp;t=XbrTMWx_blK5GzLVnuXaxQ">here’s an example</a>). Ironically, one of the reasons for increased transaction fees could be a natural defensive reaction to an attack from a bad actor mining empty blocks to prevent users from transacting. If empty blocks are being mined, the mempool will fill with Bitcoin transactors that are raising fees, competing with each other to get in the next block. Riot Blockchain and Blockware Solutions released an <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5de588aa3e9c044c1ad8cb59/t/6329b32325b7205aea8e14f8/1663677220899/Bitcoin+Transaction+Fees+Final+Draft.pdf">incredible report</a> outlining how this and similar attacks would be met with naturally-occuring defense mechanisms from the Bitcoin immune system, most resulting in much higher transaction fees:</p><blockquote><p>“Under an empty block attack or other attacks attempting to stop users from transacting, it is in the self-interest of Bitcoin users to raise their transactions' fees to get into the next block. The more empty blocks (the longer the attack lasts), the more pending transactions in the mempool. Transaction fees could soar from 1 sat/vbyte to 1,000+ sats/vbyte. The reward for one block could go from close to 0 BTC to 10+ BTC assuming the current maximum block size of 1,000,000 vbytes. The system is antifragile, and an empty block attack would be met by an endless market based counterattack of high transaction fees. And knowledge of this counterattack would likely deter the attacker from this attack in the first place.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Another example of fees raising as a result of the network defending itself would be a reaction to miners attempting to censor merchants. This example is covered more in depth in <a href="https://sgbarbour.medium.com/the-state-vs-bitcoin-dbc044f23ea6">this article</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“If a majority miner is not accepting transactions from merchants then the censored merchants must either increase their fees or not transact at all. If a merchant cannot move their bitcoins then they effectively have no value for the duration in which they are being censored. We can deduce that, due to personal time preference, a merchant who is being censored will be willing to pay a higher confirmation fee proportional to the duration in which they are being censored, up to the theoretical maximum in which the fee is the entirety of the transaction.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In addition to naturally-occuring defensive incentives that would result in increased transaction fees, there are also countless arguments for transaction fees increasing as a result of Bitcoin adoption, specifically as a medium of exchange. </p><p>As adoption increases, competition to add transactions to Bitcoin’s scarce block space will increase, and this increases current fees, which then creates further demand for scaling solutions. The market will continue to present these scaling solutions as demanded — some popular solutions now include exchanges batching transactions, the Lightning Network and other Layer 2 and Layer 3 developments that can ultimately bundle thousands of Bitcoin transfers into one transaction that settles on-chain. </p><p>When you understand Bitcoin’s adoption curve, it is completely reasonable to assume that the majority of normal user transactions will occur on additional layers or sidechains. Final settlement of these more efficiently-bundled transfers will occur on-chain, along with transactions that want increased security or institutions moving large values. The final settlement would warrant a much higher transaction fee.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bitcoin Mining As An Auxiliary Tool</h2><p>The second route that should lower concern around miners dropping offline and reducing the overall security of the network is increased efficiency and a newer realization that Bitcoin miners can act as an auxiliary tool for other business practices. A highly-overlooked development in the mainstream lately has been the Bitcoin miners’ incentive to pursue <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/how-bitcoin-shakes-the-energy-industry">stranded, wasted or excess energy</a>. </p><p>Bitcoin mining offers a unique and new proposal for society, where untapped or un-transportable energy can now be instantly sold to the Bitcoin network on-site via mining. One of the most interesting innovations in this sector is <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/hydropower/ocean-thermal-energy-conversion.php">ocean thermal energy conversion</a> (OTEC) merging with Bitcoin. </p><p>There is an incredibly in depth article on how OTEC and Bitcoin can further energy production and efficiency <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-unlocks-ocean-energy">here</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Bitcoin has the potential to help <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse6010012">unlock between 2 to 8 terawatts</a> of clean, continuous and year-round baseload power — for one billion people — by harnessing the thermal energy of the oceans. that turns Earth’s oceans into an enormous renewable solar battery.</p><p>“It does this by combining warm tropical surface water and deep cold seawater to create a conventional heat engine. This simple idea is perfectly suited to be expanded to a planetary scale by Bitcoin’s unique appetite for purchasing and consuming stranded energy from the prototypes and pilot plants that will be required to prove it works. Furthermore, by harnessing virtually unlimited quantities of cold water for cooling co-located ASIC miners, OTEC may very well be the most efficient and most ecological way to mine Bitcoin.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This is just one example of how mining can become even more efficient over time, and with increased efficiency comes continued network security as it makes less sense for miners to go offline.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin mining is also now becoming an auxiliary tool for other industrial processes. Bitcoin miners can pair with different industries and businesses and offer enormous benefits to seemingly-normal business practices. One mind-blowing example: ASICs used to mine Bitcoin generate heat, this heat can be used to boil water and create steam, condensing the water again is a form of purification, and ultimately this can result in water distillation that was subsidized by mining, as was discussed in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vROP40L9Bg">Troy Cross interview</a>.</p><p>These ASICs that generate heat also need to be cooled with fans. Another mind-blowing concept is combining mining with businesses or industries that naturally create cool air. An example that Cross discussed was carbon capture facilities, which integrate enormous fan banks as part of their normal business operations. Pairing these fan banks with a mining operation subsidizes the cost of ASIC cooling.<br></p><p>As these innovations get more developed, simply adding Bitcoin mining to countless unrelated industries and businesses that generate cooling or need heating will improve efficiency and reduce costs. Bitcoin mining is already <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/flower-powered-bitcoin-miner-heats-greenhouses-in-the-netherlands">heating greenhouses</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-florida-distillers-bitcoin/">distilling whiskey</a>, while at the same time monetizing stranded or wasted energy.</p><p>Over time, Bitcoin mining will continue to be paired with industries that make mining or normal business operations more profitable. Eventually it will be ridiculous to not use your businesses' naturally-generated heat or wasted energy on Bitcoin miners, or if your business happens to have enormous fan banks, it will become ridiculous to not point them at ASICs. All of this results in more positively-incentivized miners over time which maintains network security and has the potential to counterbalance the shrinking block subsidy.</p><p>The combination of Bitcoin’s adoption naturally leading to increased transaction fees over time and Bitcoin mining shifting into an auxiliary tool for a wide range of independent industries demonstrate how the long-term security of the network is something to be optimistic about.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dillon Healy.

If people take the metaphors too literally, they inevitably make mistakes in their reasoning about Bitcoin. </p><p>First, let’s consider this quotation on whether all metaphors are wrong:</p><blockquote><p>“For it would be an absurd undertaking to banish from the language of economic theory every manner of speaking that is not literally correct; it would be sheer pedantry to proscribe every figure of speech, particularly since we could not say the hundredth part of what we have to say, if we refused ever to take recourse to a metaphor. <strong>One requirement is essential, that economic theory avoid the error of confusing a practical habit, indulged in for the sake of expediency, with scientific truth</strong>.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://mises.org/wire/objectivist-law-prof-mossoff-copyright-or-misuse-labor-value-and-creation-metaphors">Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk</a></p></blockquote><p>So, clearly, not all analogies are harmful. But when striving for accuracy, the metaphor can’t be confused with the real scientific truth. </p><h2>‘Bitcoin Is Stored Time’</h2><p>The popular notion that bitcoin can “store our time” is an overly loose and imprecise metaphor. It typically comes up when Bitcoiners are talking about the injustice of fiat currency (this part is correct), but then it goes awry when the metaphor is stretched too far into suggesting that we should “store our time” in bitcoin instead of fiat currency. </p><p>The “store of value” concept can arguably apply to Bitcoin if we consider longer time frames, but it’s really not storing <em>time</em>. As the saying goes, time waits for no man. We speak in loose terms such as economizing time or “saving time,” but really, time itself is not what we economize, it’s <em>how we spend our time</em>. The preference is in the <em>doing</em>. Or, as my podcast guest <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/443">Conza</a> recounted from a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/KonradSGraf">Konrad Graf</a>, “Go ahead, try not to spend some time and save it for later instead.”</p><p>Even when equivocating bitcoin as purchasing power which may be the <em>spirit</em> of the analogy, it is important to remember that there are no guarantees here. Bitcoin’s purchasing power has gone down over selected time frames, which is where thinking of bitcoin as stored time can really lead a person astray if taken too literally. </p><p>Now, a shout out to my friend Gigi, who has written on the concept of <a href="https://dergigi.com/2021/01/14/bitcoin-is-time/">Bitcoin as building out an arrow of time</a>. This concept does make sense and it helps to explain why Bitcoin is designed the way it is — by keeping time using blocks instead of seconds and not relying on a centralized time keeper. This is distinct from the incorrect metaphor of “bitcoin as storing your time.” So, a more accurate framing would be that bitcoin <em>keeps</em> time (using blocks, not seconds), but it does not store your time.</p><h2>Bitcoin As Energy/Battery</h2><p>Some people speak of Bitcoin as digital energy or as though it is a battery. But remember, while Bitcoin miners use energy, Bitcoin still does not allow anyone to store or transport energy. There is not some central counter that we can go take our bitcoin to and redeem it for a set amount of energy. Yes, energy could be <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/431">priced and sold for bitcoin</a>, but that’s not the same thing. The price of energy will fluctuate and bitcoin will not even metaphorically store the same amount of energy over time.</p><p>What error can this lead to? It can mislead people on where the value is coming from. This metaphor leads people toward a kind of <em>cost</em> theory of value, effectively putting the horse before the cart. Instead, we should reason from the <a href="https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value">subjective theory of value</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“The value of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the amount of labor required to produce the good, but instead value is determined by the importance an acting individual places on a good for the achievement of their desired ends.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>A related cousin of this is the notion that bitcoin is “backed by” energy. Typically, this comes up when a nocoiner says, “But Bitcoin isn’t backed by anything.” So, in some cases, a well intentioned but wrong Bitcoiner may say, “No, Bitcoin is backed by energy!” But this is wrong. </p><p>Generally, when something is “backed by” something else, it implies that it somehow has the support of some other entity, like a government. Historically, people say the U.S. dollar was “backed by” gold, and people could historically redeem notes for gold, but no such thing exists with Bitcoin. So, perhaps a better question to ask is, “What’s gold backed by?” Only then are we getting to the truth of the matter: it was all subjective valuation all along. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. </p><h2>Bitcoin As Violence Or A ‘Weapon’</h2><p>Some people want to frame Bitcoin as a kind of “digital violence” or, more recently, frame it as a weapon and part of a “soft war protocol.” But this is a gross misrepresentation of what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is more like cryptographic messages being passed around and validated on a network. Surely that is closer to “speech” than a “weapon.” Or, more accurately, bitcoin can be thought of as a rivalrous digital commodity (the first of its kind), operating on an open-source monetary network. </p><p>If the pen is mightier than the sword, would it be appropriate to call a pen a weapon? Not really. Also, this whole line of argument is clearly blurring a line between what’s voluntary, and what is initiating aggression (which is the part that’s wrong). How is running a node, adopting bitcoin as a rivalrous digital commodity and participating in the network a form of “weaponry”? This is just gross mischaracterisation. Words mean things. </p><p>Some of the analogies and metaphors used in relation to “bitcoin as soft war protocol” relate to miners competing to secure the “chain of custody.” But do they? Or is it really more like Bitcoin nodes are what secure Bitcoin? Miners can’t make invalid transactions appear valid to those who are running and verifying transactions with their own Bitcoin node. So, isn’t it more relevant to think of it like <em>nodes</em> secure Bitcoin? The job of miners is important, but their job is more related to <a href="https://stephanlivera.com/episode/442/"><em>finality</em> of transactions</a>, not security. </p><h2>So, What Is The Real Truth Then? </h2><p>So, as mentioned earlier, economically speaking, bitcoin is more accurately characterized as a rivalrous digital commodity. Bitcoin <em>is</em> the commodity itself — it’s not a claim on something, it is the commodity itself. When people ask what it is backed by, this indicates they haven’t quite grasped what it is. </p><p>If an analogy helps a new person get into Bitcoin and start going down the rabbit hole, that’s great! But as that person advances their knowledge about Bitcoin, additional precision about what Bitcoin is will help us all. </p><p><em>Thanks to my friend </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Conza"><em>Conza</em></a><em> for inspiring this article and providing feedback. </em></p><p><em>This is a guest post by Stephan Livera.

I found a nation in distress about money, because of a kleptocratic ruling elite that had been defrauding and stealing from their people by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe">inflating the national currency for decades</a>. Despite this, corruption and military support allowed these leaders to stay at the top for over 40 years.</p><p>The need was there, but what about understanding of Bitcoin? I found a few true believers and HODLers from the early days, but I didn’t find a single Bitcoin-only event or community. What existed were cryptocurrency trading groups on WhatsApp and Facebook and a lot of scams. The first questions about Bitcoin always were: “How can I join Bitcoin?” (which is the language that scammers are using to lure in their victims) and “How can I trade it?” (which is the language of short time preference).</p><p>In 2021, I had the idea to bring Bitcoin knowledge to the Global South with a focus on fostering communities on the ground and connecting them infrastructure-wise and people-wise with the Bitcoin network. Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs encouraged me to apply for a donation at the Human Rights Foundation, <a href="https://hrf.org/bitcoin-dev-fund-q1-2022gifts">which became the first donor supporting “Bitcoin for Fairness.”</a> </p><p>With the advice of Sharon Dow and Jacob Strumwasser of Lightning Labs, I drafted a grant proposal, which resulted in sponsorships from LEDN, Okcoin, Paxful, Coinfinity, Breez and Trezor. I set up a crowdfunding campaign on Geyser which received over 500 donations from Bitcoiners all over the world. Brad Mills, Peter McCormack and f418_me all donated significant amounts. I’m sure I’m forgetting other donors — sorry about that and thank you each and everyone for your support!</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Our Impact</h2><p>Through Bitcoin For Fairness, I visited four African countries to spread Bitcoin education and connections this year. The most time I spent was in Zimbabwe and Zambia, which I visited two times each. In April after Bitcoin 2022 in Miami, I gave up my apartment in Vienna and started my nomad life. </p><p>It led me to South Africa in May, where I worked with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ekasi-township-one-year-later">Bitcoin Ekasi</a>. In June, I was at the Oslo Freedom Forum to connect with human rights activists and freedom fighters like Meron Estefanos, Farida Nabourema and Leopoldo Lopez. COVID-19 stopped me for a few weeks and after the Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga, I returned to Zimbabwe and Zambia. The last traveling I did in 2022 led me to the first pan-African Bitcoin conference in Ghana.</p><h4>Zambia</h4><p>In March, I was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0uSQI0B5Nw">speaking to 50 students at the University of Zambia</a> — we hosted a Lightning Network workshop, I gave radio and newspaper interviews and we started a Bitcoin education group on WhatsApp, which has grown to 65 members. All of this was organized by Ndesa, Emmanuel and Japhet, three crypto-interested individuals who hadn’t known each other before. In May, they set up the <a href="https://bffbtc.org/first-bitcoin-for-fairness-bitcoin-meetup-photos/">first Bitcoin For Fairness (BFF) meetup in Lusaka</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In October, I visited for the second time. I was speaking at the <a href="https://anitaposch.com/internet-freedom-africa">Forum On Internet Freedom In Africa 2022</a> (FIFA22) and at the University of Zambia<a href="https://anitaposch.com/bitcoin-unza"> to about 30 students, and we installed wallets and sent sats</a>. We organized a BFF meetup and donated a RaspiBlitz full node to one of the local Bitcoiners. Together, with the BFF team, we conducted a <a href="https://bffbtc.org/bitcoin-workshop/">one-day Bitcoin workshop for journalists</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In December, the fifth BFF meetup took place and the Bitcoin and Lightning node was up and running. The BFF goal to initiate a local group of Bitcoiners to conduct regular meetups and bring Bitcoin infrastructure to Zambia has been fully met. The local BFF group has set up their own <a href="https://zambiabitcoinmeetups.com/">ZambiaBitcoinMeetups.com</a> website, it meets at Scallywags a (restaurant accepting bitcoin) and one of the members started a <a href="https://btcpodcasting.com/@BantuBitcoinBemba/episodes">Bitcoin podcast in the local Bemba language</a> on our recently-launched BTC Podcasting platform.</p><h3>Zimbabwe</h3><p>We kicked the Zimbabwe trip off with a Bitcoin talk in early March which was attended by 60 participants in the capital of Harare. One of them was Alexandria, who took a six-hour bus ride from Bulawayo, because he didn’t know any other Bitcoiners. I encouraged Alexandria to start a Bitcoin-only WhatsApp group and ask the guests to join. Today, that group has grown to 300 members and is on <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinreach">Twitter</a>, too. Alexandria and his Bitcoin Reach group is fully independent from BFF now. This has also been a goal of mine: self sovereignty and self organization of the communities.</p><figure>

I also connected Paxful with the community, which led to a Paxful and Built With Bitcoin education center being placed on site.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi/status/1579837612914720768"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><h3>Ghana</h3><p>As soon as I heard the announcement of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/africa-bitcoin-conference-starts-december-5">first Pan-Africa Bitcoin conference</a>, I knew I wanted to be a part of it. Organized by Farida Bemba Nabourema, a Togolese human rights and Bitcoin activist, it came to be the greatest Bitcoin conference I have been to so far. The focus on Bitcoin as a tool for Africans to empower and free themselves financially from colonial and authoritarian structures resonated with the work of BFF.</p><p>Prior to the conference, I helped Marcel Lorraine, the founder of <a href="https://twitter.com/dada_bitcoin?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Bitcoin Dada</a>, a women-focused Bitcoin education group raising funds, to visit the conference and I also met Noelyne Sumba and Mary Imasuen who organized a BFF sponsored meetup in Nigeria earlier this year.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Built Educational Content And Infrastructure For Communities</h2><h3>The Bitcoin Flyer</h3><p>On top of all of the above, I published the <a href="https://bffbtc.org/flyer">BFF Bitcoin flyer</a> together with the <a href="https://cryptoconsortium.org/">C4 Cryptocurrency Certification Consortium</a>. The flyer is an easy and cheap-to-produce Bitcoin FAQ to give away at meetups or conferences. With the help of volunteers, we translated the flyer to twelve languages, including Swahili, Luganda and soon, Akan Twi and Eritrean. We encourage volunteers to translate the open-sourced folder into their local languages.</p><h3>BTC Podcasting</h3><p>Together with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07HAcQDDAmo">Michael Bumann from Alby</a>, I developed a new podcast hosting platform called BTC Podcasting, where Bitcoiners can <a href="https://btcpodcasting.com/">host their podcasts for free and, at the same time, earn bitcoin from their listeners</a> without the need to run their own Lightning nodes. BFF wants to encourage communities to start their own podcasts. Given that the cost for internet bandwidth is very high and the speed also doesn’t allow video streaming in many African regions, we learned that audio is a much better medium through which to reach people.</p><h3>Documentary: How Bitcoin Enforces Human Rights</h3><p>One of the most compelling reasons for me to start working with and for Bitcoin was the humanitarian and social aspects. The possibility to stick it to authoritarians and take the power out of their hands and put it back into the hands of the people was compelling. </p><p>During the last six years since I started in the Bitcoin space, it became clear to me that only Bitcoin delivers fair access for anyone to take economic action and that it is essential for enforcing human rights. This is the reason why I called my NPO initiative “Bitcoin For Fairness” and why I wrote an essay for <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-enforces-universal-human-rights">Bitcoin Magazine about “How Bitcoin Enforces Human Rights.”</a> </p><p>I also produced a podcast and a video documentary about it, so that people can share these thoughts easily with their peers. The importance of the Bitcoin project may not be underestimated. It’s our only shot to regain digital and financial privacy and to have an alternative system for the short-sighted, debt-based and consumption-driven fiat economy. If we mess up, there will be no similar freedom project in the near future.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AXLiwrrk3sk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2>Learnings</h2><p>Blockchain technology and crypto are big in African countries. But the differences between Bitcoin and altcoins are widely not understood. Altcoins and their marketing departments have done a great job of letting people believe that they are the better Bitcoin, telling them that the original is slow and not scalable. Even the people who are organizing events and sharing crypto knowledge haven’t heard of the Lightning Network or sidechains like Rootstock or Liquid yet.</p><p>In most countries, crypto and stablecoins are king. Only in Nigeria is the share of Bitcoin usage higher than that of altcoins, as I was told by Ray Youssef, the CEO of Paxful. In Zimbabwe, a <a href="https://anitaposch.com/insights-from-exchanging-bitcoin-peer-to-peer-in-zimbabwe">trader who exchanged a volume of $6 million in 2021 told me</a> that most people are using USDT, and only a handful of convinced Bitcoiners are HODLing.</p><p>There are hundreds of free guides, tutorials and videos about Bitcoin, but where to start? Five out of 50 people at my first talk in Lusaka were interested in Bitcoin only. They are isolated and far away from where the experienced users and developers are — it’s hard to catch up. They can’t afford to attend Lightning hackdays or other Bitcoin-focused conferences, which are mostly in the U.S. or Europe. Traveling to other African countries is expensive and cumbersome.</p><p>There is a need for more boots on the ground to share knowledge and tools. Nobody I had met at my talks was using a hardware wallet. The devices are very expensive for the average person and hard to get. I gifted a BitBox02 to a friend in Zimbabwe two years ago and he told me that he hadn’t set it up yet.</p><p>There is a need for more local Bitcoin infrastructure and the <a href="https://bitcoiners.africa/africa-free-routing/">Africa Free Routing project</a> is a great start, because the two nodes I was able to bring are not enough. One great example of a solution built for Africa by an African is <a href="https://twitter.com/Machankura8333?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Machankura</a>, a custodial Lightning wallet, which allows you to send and receive bitcoin on a feature phone without internet connection. It’s using the same technology that mobile money providers in Africa have been using for years called USSD. We used it in Zambia.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FCiK1AZuPRM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2>Going Forward</h2><p>Building in the bear market was not an easy task, but thanks to the BFF volunteers and donors, we did so. Our goal for 2023 is to focus even more on education around self custody and privacy. </p><p>One thing we learned is that after all of the crypto scammers who have been hitting the African continent, building trust by being on the ground is essential. But it’s not enough, there has to be a possibility to stay connected and offer further knowledge to the communities and especially the individuals who are driving their groups. </p><p>That’s why I’m going to build a community site with online courses and education around non-KYC bitcoin, privacy tools and, of course, self custody in 2023. At the same time, BFF’s goal is to find more volunteering translators for the Bitcoin flyer and to accompany Bitcoiners to develop their community podcasts and start earning bitcoin.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Anita Posch.

It presents an open mechanism to denial-of-service attack nodes on the network to prevent them from routing, losing them money while their liquidity is locked up and unable to forward payments that will earn them fees. An attacker can route a payment through other nodes from themselves to themselves, and refuse to finalize the payment. This makes that liquidity useless for forwarding other payments until the hashed timelock contract (HTLC) timelock expires and the payment refunds. </p><p>Last month, Lightning developer Antoine Riard proposed a formal specification for a solution to this problem. In August, Riard and Gleb Naumenko published <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/channel-jamming-bitcoin-lightning-network">research</a> looking at the general problem itself, as well as a number of different solutions that could be used to mitigate or solve it. One of those proposed solutions was a form of anonymized credentials that nodes could use to build a sort of reputation scoring system for users routing payments through them without having to dox or associate that reputation with a static identifier that would negatively impact peoples' privacy. This solution has now become the <a href="https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/80214c83190836c4f7699af9e8920769607f1a00/www-reputation-credentials-protocol.md">formal protocol proposal</a> made by Riard last month. </p><h2>Inside The Channel Jamming Mitigation Proposal</h2><p>The core of the idea is a Chaumian ecash token. These are centralized tokens issued by a mint authority in a way that prevents the issuance of a token from being correlated to the redemption of a token later. This is done by signing a token in a blinded way, allowing the receiver of the token to unblind it without invalidating the signature. The issuer can then verify it is a legitimate token without being able to connect that token to when it was issued. </p><p>The proposal suggests using these Chaumian tokens, issued by each routing node on the network, as a form of reputational proof. When routing a payment, a Chaumian ecash token issued by each node in the payment hop would be wrapped up in the onion bundle for that node along the payment. Token units would represent both the value of the HTLC allowed as well as the refund timelock period. Before forwarding the HTLC, each node would verify that the token included in their onion blob is valid and has never been redeemed before, only forwarding the HTLC if both of those conditions are true. </p><p>If the HTLC settles successfully with the preimage being revealed, then every node along the payment path signs and includes a newly-issued Chaumian token to be returned back to the sender, along with the HTLC preimage. If the HTLC does not successfully settle, then the routing nodes "burn" the token by including it in their spent token table and do not issue a new token. This forces the sender to have to acquire new tokens from those nodes in order to route payments through them again. The entire concept is that jamming attacks always fail to settle, so in this scheme, these tokens issued by each node that you route through are burned if you perform a jamming attack and create the cost of acquiring more to do it again. Right now, jamming attacks cost nothing but time, so this would add an economic cost to them. </p><p>So, it’s time to discuss the elephant in the room: how do you bootstrap the issuance and circulation of these tokens across the network? Each node that you wish to route through would require a token issued by them. The solution: pay for them. Another proposed solution to the channel jamming issue is up-front fees, i.e., charging a fee to even try to route a payment regardless of whether or not it even succeeds. So, even failed payments would incur a fee for the sender. </p><p>Riard’s proposal is to purchase these tokens directly from each node as one-off purchases. From that point forward, instead of paying upfront fees for every payment, as long as the prior payment successfully settled, you would be reissued "routing tokens" that would enable your next proposed payment to be routed without a fee. This way, successful payments only pay the actual routing fee, and failed payments only pay the up-front fee, preventing a sort of "double fee" for successful payments. At least economically, think of it as a sort of middleground compromise between the current state of affairs&nbsp;where failed payments cost nothing and only successful payments pay a fee, and a full up-front fee model where all payments pay an up-front fee and successful ones pay a routing fee as well.</p><h2>Takeaways From The Proposal</h2><p>Personally, I think this sort of direct payment for tokens ahead of time could introduce a large degree of UX friction into the process of using the Lightning Network. However, I think there is a pretty simple solution for that friction by tweaking the proposal a bit. </p><p>Instead of having to specifically pay each node directly for Chaumian tokens ahead of time, the proposal could be hybridized more directly with the up-front fee proposal. If you have tokens for a node, then include those in the onion blob, if not simply pay an up-front fee directly within the HTLC proposal and if the payment settles successfully, you will be issued Chaumian tokens back in proportion to what your up-front fee was. This way, instead of having to collect tokens from many different nodes ahead of time, you simply acquire them over the course of making initial payments until you have a good collection from the different nodes that you use frequently and very rarely have to incur the cost of up-front fees to attain them. </p><p>Another potential source of friction is for node operators, and comes down to fundamental issues of Chaumian ecash itself. In order to ensure that a token is only spent once, the issuer needs to maintain a database of all the tokens that have been spent. This grows forever, making lookups to check token validity more and more expensive and time consuming the bigger that database grows. Because of this, Riard proposes having these Chaumian tokens expire periodically, at a block height advertised in the gossip protocol per node. This means that senders need to periodically repurchase these tokens, or if the implementation were to support it, redeem them for new tokens signed by the new signing key after the prior one expires. </p><p>This would either place a regular economic cost on the senders of payments, or require them to periodically check in to ensure reissuance when old tokens expire. In practice, this can be automated for people running their own Lightning nodes, and for any wallets built around an Lightning service provider (LSP) model, the LSP itself could actually handle the acquisition and maintenance of tokens on behalf of its users, handling the token provisioning for its users' payments. On the fringes, however, without a full Lightning node or LSP, this could become a bit of an annoyance for light wallet users. </p><p>I think this proposal could actually go a long way to mitigating channel jamming as an attack vector, especially if hybridized a little more tightly with the basic up-front fee scheme, and most of the UX frictions can be handled very easily for LSP users and people who operate their own Lightning nodes. And even if the up front fees do present a high degree of friction, it's possible that simply <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-November/002884.html">proving control of a Bitcoin UTXO</a> could be used in place of actually paying fees to acquire tokens. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shinobi.

You can find the Kiboruto and more at <a href="https://crazyk3d.com/">crazyk3d.com</a>.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>If you have taken self custody of your bitcoin, congratulations on taking the first steps toward leading a permissionless life. Now, you should make sure your bitcoin is secure and safe from environmental hazards like fire and flood. Writing down your backup information in a notebook is a good start but at some point, you may find that this no longer feels secure enough when you take environmental hazards into account.</p><p>When you take the radical responsibility of self custody over your bitcoin, you and you alone are responsible for those funds. There is no charge-back feature or 1-800 helpline with Bitcoin, so you want to be sure that you take every precaution in protecting your funds. Since the Kiboruto is tailor made for Samourai Wallet, that wallet will be the focus of this guide. With Samourai Wallet, there are three key pieces of information you want to secure:</p><h3>1. Seed Words</h3><p>When you set up Samourai Wallet, you will be given a list of 12 words known as your “seed words,” sometimes also referred to as your “seed phrase” or “mnemonic phrase.” These 12 seed words are a key piece of information that allows you to restore your Bitcoin wallet in the event that you lose your phone, or it is stolen, or it is damaged beyond repair, for example. Seed words always need to be saved in the same order that your wallet presents them to you. If you get even one word in the wrong order, it could render your bitcoin backup useless. Be prepared for the worst and secure your seed words like they were gold or jewelry.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>2. Passphrase</h3><p>You will also set a passphrase when generating your Samourai Wallet. The passphrase is something unique that you set, it is not generated by Samourai Wallet. Your Samourai Wallet has no way of knowing what passphrase you set and also, any passphrase you enter will generate a valid wallet. Whether that is the wallet which contains your bitcoin or not depends on your ability to enter the same passphrase as the one you originally set when setting up your wallet for the first time. Unlike seed words, which come from a predefined list of <a href="https://www.bitcoinsafety.com/blogs/bitcoin/seed-phrase-list">2,048 English words</a>, a passphrase on the other hand can include any combination of lower/upper case letters, numbers and special characters that you want to use.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>3. PayNym</h3><p>Last but not least is your PayNym. The PayNym is a unique name and avatar that is associated with your wallet. You can use this PayNym to verify that you have in fact restored the correct wallet. Your PayNym is capable of a lot more though: It can display a static payment code to receive funds without revealing any of your prior transaction history to anyone. Use your PayNym to connect with other Samourai Wallet users so that you can build collaborative CoinJoin transactions like Stowaway or StonewallX2.

    </figure><p>The next section will walk you through exactly how to get these three pieces of information from a new Samourai Wallet.</p><h2>Setting Up Samourai Wallet</h2><p>The Kiboruto stainless-steel backup was designed specifically for your Samourai Wallet. Stainless-steel backups like this can withstand extreme environmental conditions such as a house fire or severe flooding. Oftentimes, people will use a pen and paper to write down their seed phrases — this is a good start and if you want to use a pen and paper, then download the Samourai Wallet recovery template <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/recovery/worksheet">here</a>. But your paper backup may not withstand a house fire or flooding, so consider using both methods to have one as a fail safe. Keep in mind, though, that anyone who gains access to this information will technically be able to gain access to your bitcoin, so keep them secure.</p><p>Here is a video on how to set up your Samourai Wallet for the first time and get the seed words that you will later stamp into your Kiboruto. Please note that the wallet version (0.99.96g) used in this video has since been updated to a newer version with a detailed explainer introduction. The new version will be showcased later in the guide when demonstrating how to recover your seed words.</p><iframe height="315" width="560" src="https://media.econoalchemist.com/videos/embed/b2433030-a704-453b-be5a-311e8c8c5e87" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><p>The next section will walk you through how to stamp your Samourai wallet backup information into your Kiboruto.&nbsp;You can download Samourai Wallet for your Android device directly from the <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/download">Samourai Wallet website</a> or use the F-Droid repository option or Google Play Store option listed on the website as well.</p><h2>Stamping The Kiboruto</h2><p>Once you have set up your wallet and identified your PayNym, you can navigate back through the menu to display your seed words and then stamp them into the Kiboruto, as shown in the video below. </p><ol><li>From your Samourai Wallet homepage, navigate to the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner and select “settings,” then “wallet,” then “show mnemonic.” A dialog box will appear with your 12 seed words. These are the words you want to stamp into the Kiboruto in order. </li><li>To test your passphrase prior to stamping, from your Samourai Wallet homepage, navigate to the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner and select “settings,” then “troubleshoot,” then “passphrase/backup test.” From there, you can enter your passphrase and Samourai Wallet will confirm if it is correct. Once you know that you have it correct, then you can stamp it in the Kiboruto. </li><li>To view your PayNym from your Samourai Wallet homepage, navigate to the blue "+" sign in the lower right-hand corner then select the purple PayNym icon. Your PayNym short name will be displayed directly below your PayNym robot avatar. </li></ol><p>Make sure that you use a solid surface on which to stamp your Kiboruto, like a concrete floor. A heavy hammer, like a four-pound mini sledge, works well to get a crisp stamp. You will stamp the 12 seed words in order on the large Kiboruto plate and then stamp your passphrase and PayNym on the small Kiboruto plate. This way, you can store the two pieces of information separately if you want. You will need both pieces (seed words and passphrase) to recover your bitcoin in the event that you lose access to your wallet.</p><iframe height="315" width="560" src="https://media.econoalchemist.com/videos/embed/de10cf90-f185-4bbb-834e-4456949e8b29" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><p>Now you should have your seed words, unique PayNym and your passphrase secured in metal on the Kiboruto. This way, you have the information needed to restore your Samourai Wallet and recover your bitcoin in case your phone is lost, damaged or stolen or your backup is exposed to fire or flooding.</p><figure>

This means that you can use a variety of Bitcoin wallets to recover your funds from this kind of backup. For example, if you lost your mobile phone and bought a new one, you could <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/download">download</a> the Samourai Wallet application again and then follow these recovery steps using your Kiboruto to regain access to your bitcoin. </p><p>Once you launch Samourai Wallet, you will have the recommended options to connect to Tor and connect to your own <a href="https://ronindojo.io/en/tanto">RoninDojo</a>. Then you will have the option to restore from backup. Simply enter your seed words in order from your Kiboruto and then add your passphrase from your Kiboruto and then you should be presented with the same PayNym as your original and have access to your bitcoin once again.</p><iframe height="315" width="560" src="https://media.econoalchemist.com/videos/embed/358f5ee3-775b-4d9c-af93-b3b83d6812b6" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>That should be everything you need to restore your Samourai Wallet after a catastrophic event in which you lose your phone and need to restore access to your bitcoin. Should you ever have questions about the wallet derivation path, <a href="https://walletsrecovery.org/">WalletsRecovery.org</a> has compiled most Bitcoin wallets in a list. </p><p>Here are the Samourai Wallet derivation paths, for example:</p><ul><li>Deposit: m/44'|49'|84'|47'/0'/0'</li><li>Bad Bank: m/84'/0'/2147483644'</li><li>Pre Mix: m/84'/0'/2147483645'</li><li>Post Mix: m/84'/0'/2147483646'</li><li>Ricochet: m/44'|49'|84'/0'/2147483647'</li></ul><p>When restoring a Samourai Wallet on another Samourai Wallet client, you will not need to worry about these derivation paths. This would only be cause for consideration if restoring across platforms to another wallet. </p><p>Some final considerations are how many copies of the Kiboruto you want, where to store them and whether you store the passphrase separately or not. Everyone's threat model, situation and circumstances are unique, so each individual will need to make these decisions on their own. Just keep in mind that an adversary could restore your wallet if they found your seed words and passphrase. </p><p>Using a <a href="https://ronindojo.io/en/tanto">RoninDojo</a> is the most private way to use Samourai Wallet. <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinQ_A">@BitcoinQ_A</a> wrote a great <a href="https://bitcoiner.guide/ronindojo/">guide</a> on getting started with it and there are full instructions maintained on the <a href="https://wiki.ronindojo.io/en/home">Ronin wiki page</a>.

And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.”</p><p>–<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/481916-every-record-has-been-destroyed-or-falsified-every-book-rewritten">George Orwell, “1984”</a></p></blockquote><p>At the outbreak of the<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42367551"> first world war</a>, Great Britain had the world’s most sophisticated undersea telegraph cable system, which wrapped around the entire world. On August 5, 1914, a day after the British had declared war on the Germans, a British ship, the Alert, set sail from the port of Dover with a mission of cutting off all of Germany’s communications with the world by sabotaging the Germans’ undersea cables and the mission was accomplished successfully.</p><p>A day before the Alert set sail, on August 4, a man was deployed to the cable station at Porthcurno in Cornwall and the cables carrying traffic across the Atlantic came ashore on the beach. The job title of this man was “censor” and numerous other censors were deployed across the empire, from Hong Kong to Malta to Singapore. Once the censors were in position, a worldwide system of intercepting communications known as “censorship” was born. Its main aim was to prevent the communication of strategic intelligence between the enemy and their agents. In other words, the goal had evolved from just crippling the Germans’ ability to communicate, to also gathering intelligence. </p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42367551">Over 50,000 messages per day were handled by the network of 180 censors at U.K. offices.</a> By leveraging their dominance over the international telegraph infrastructure, the British created the first global communications surveillance system that stretched from Cape Town to Cairo and from Gibraltar to Zanzibar. This became one of the choke points that led to the defeat of the Germans.</p><p>While the phenomenon of censorship is by no means a new one, as highlighted by the historical account above, the fact still stands that it’s a weapon that has been deployed throughout history to silence opposing views, cripple independent thought and ultimately subjugate “enemies of the state” or entire nations. </p><p>2022 was in many ways what I would personally call the year of the “censor.” As I look back and reflect on 2022, it seems to me that incidents of censorship are now the rule and not the exception thanks to the rise of<a href="https://nypost.com/article/what-is-cancel-culture-breaking-down-the-toxic-online-trend/"> cancel culture</a> on social media and various independent media voices offering diverse views on controversial topics that, in some cases, contradict the “official narrative.” Honest and open debate is stifled when these views get censored, resulting in further polarization.</p><p>Furthermore the convergence of digital platforms and banking has led to the rise of another, more dangerous and pervasive form of censorship: financial censorship. This is a more malicious<a href="https://charityandsecurity.org/issue-areas/deplatforming/"> form of censorship</a> that isn’t just about hindering or intercepting communications, but is characterized by cutting off one’s access to basic financial services, restricting who one can trade with and hindering the ability to transact freely. This includes but isn’t limited to shutting down the bank accounts of political opponents, being blacklisted and deplatformed by payment processors and economic sanctions. What started out as a tool to stop criminals and other bad actors from financing their nefarious activities has now morphed into a weapon for silencing critics, oppressing dissenters and harassing whistleblowers, as well as indirectly controlling the spending habits of people. </p><p>Given Bitcoin’s censorship resistance, it too was also subjected to numerous attacks in this past year as the censors clearly understand that it’s an alternative monetary system that they cannot stop, control or influence.</p><p>In a world where the definitions of what constitutes “acceptable speech or appropriate behavior” are constantly moving targets, who knows when you may end up having your bank accounts frozen for having a different perspective or for something you posted on social media ten years ago? Will independent thought result in financial retaliation? In this essay I will highlight a few of the key incidents of financial censorship that occurred in 2022 which were basically free Bitcoin marketing campaigns, and more importantly, discuss how Bitcoin is the perfect shield going forward.</p><h2>The Freedom Convoy</h2><blockquote><p>“The greatest danger to the State is independent intellectual criticism.”</p><p>–<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3196240-the-greatest-danger-to-the-state-is-independent-intellectual-criticism">Murray N. Rothbard</a></p></blockquote><p>The increased levels of collusion between the State, bankers and big tech against individuals and organizations that hold legal but dissenting views is perhaps the most obfuscated and dangerous form of financial censorship. </p><p>The<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60420470"> Freedom Convoy protests</a> that kicked off on January 22 by Canadian truckers who were protesting against COVID-19 vaccine mandates clearly demonstrated how third-party payment platforms and banks can collude with the State to financially cut off individuals without due process. Through the crowdfunding site GoFundMe the truckers managed to<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60267840"> raise approximately</a> $7.9 million in donations. GoFundMe then withheld and later refunded the donations to the donors citing a violation of their terms of service against the promotion of violence. </p><p>Not long after that, Prime Minister Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act, which allowed the government to freeze the bank accounts, suspend insurance policies and withhold other financial services from the protestors and their donors.</p><p>During a<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/02/14/full-text-of-chrystia-freelands-remarks-during-emergencies-act-announcement.html"> press conference</a> on the February 14, after the invocation of the Emergencies Act, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland made the following remarks:</p><blockquote><p>“The government is issuing an order with immediate effect, under the Emergencies Act, authorizing Canadian financial institutions to temporarily cease providing financial services where the institution suspects that an account is being used to further the illegal blockades and occupations. This order covers both personal and corporate accounts…As of today, a bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order. In doing so, they will be protected against civil liability for actions taken in good faith. Federal government institutions will have a new broad authority to share relevant information with banks and other financial service providers to ensure that we can all work together to put a stop to the funding of these illegal blockades.”</p></blockquote><p>The Canadian government chose to shut down the protests by nuking the protestors’ financial infrastructure. Financial services providers were given the green light to do so without due process and were given legal cover by the state for any blowback that could result from enforcing this decree. Furthermore, the government intends to<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/trudeau-government-moves-to-make-expanded-surveillance-powers-over-financial-transactions-permanent/"> extend these measures</a> and make them permanent. </p><p>Whether one agrees with the truckers or not, it is very obvious that using financial censorship to resolve domestic dissent is a terrible precedent to set.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NTY1MTAwMTQ3ODQ0NzE4/the-matrix.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>On the flip side the weaknesses of State-controlled money were exposed in full view for all to see. This incident was the best Bitcoin commercial ever made, as it simultaneously showed the weaknesses of centralized financial platforms while proving the utility of a decentralized currency like bitcoin. </p><p>At the stroke of a pen, thousands of people were denied access to their own money and it was all “perfectly legal.” The message was clear; reliance on a centralized financial system that is biased is very risky. By applying pressure on this one choke point, the expression of other freedoms is also curtailed, whether it’s freedom of expression or freedom of movement as they all contingent on one’s ability to transact. One of the truckers<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUYNDBRHvwE"> described how</a> his personal and business accounts were shut down. The business in question wasn’t connected in any way with trucking, politics, protests or the Freedom Convoy, but its bank account was still shut down by the Canadian government and this has completely crippled the owner’s ability to make a living.</p><p>Following the action taken by GoFundMe, a Bitcoin fundraising campaign dubbed “Honk Honk Hodl” was started on Twitter<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/freedom-convoy-cryptocurrency-asset-seizure-1.6389601"> with the intention</a> of raising 21 bitcoin (worth approximately $1,100,000 at the time) for the truckers and they successfully raised <a href="https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/cryptocurrency/behind-honkhonk-hodl-the-story-of-the-trucker-convoys-bitcoin-team-lead">more than 14 bitcoin</a>. In response to this, the government<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/16/canada-sanctions-34-crypto-wallets-tied-to-trucker-freedom-convoy/"> extended the ban</a> to include bitcoin and other cryptocurrency donations and pressured cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze the accounts of anyone involved in funding the truckers as well as to share their personal information with the State. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice<a href="https://ottawaconvoyclassaction.ca/order-mareva.pdf"> ordered</a> self-custody wallet provider Nunchuk<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/18/private-lawsuit-freezes-canadian-freedom-convoy-crypto-fundraising/"> to disclose user information</a> and freeze Bitcoin wallets of its users in accordance with the government decree. The<a href="https://twitter.com/nunchuk_io/status/1494885897577271299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1494885897577271299%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinbold.com%2Fbitcoin-wallet-rejects-canadas-court-demand-to-freeze-funds-citin"> official response</a> from Nunchuk was as follows:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Once again, Bitcoin’s censorship resistance passed the test, and Nunchuk’s response not only highlights the importance of owning money that cannot be seized or censored, but of self custody as well.</p><p>Not to be outdone, the Iranian regime took a page out of the Canadian government’s playbook of using financial censorship as a weapon to crush dissent amongst its citizens when they issued a<a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-07/No-hijab-no-banking-Iran-ups-the-ante-on-anti-hijab-protestors.html"> decree</a> that will enable the state to freeze the bank accounts of women that will not wear a hijab. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/17/iran-protests-death-kurdish-woman-mahsaa-amini-morality-police">Protests have been going on in Iran since September 17</a>, when Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman, was arrested by the morality police for not wearing a hijab and later died under dubious circumstances at a Tehran hospital. The case for Bitcoin, a censorship resistant form of money, has never been stronger.</p><p>It’s against this background that I am convinced that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are a threat to individual liberty and financial sovereignty as they endow the state with the ability to financially censor anyone, for any reason at the push of a button, without due process. In a CBDC world, a protest such as the Freedom Convoy would probably not have happened. This is why it’s a matter of great concern that <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap125.pdf">nine out of 10</a> of the world’s central banks are currently actively working on launching their own CBDCs. Furthermore, according to<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap125.pdf"> a report</a> released by the Bank for International Settlements in May this year, “the growth of cryptoassets and stablecoins'<em> </em>is the main reason that the majority of these central banks are actively pursuing CBDCs. </p><p>In other words, the censors’ top priority is to neuter Bitcoin and stablecoins since they neither want to lose their power to print money ad infinitum nor to loosen their grip on the scepter of financial censorship.</p><p>This explains why the Nigerian central bank<a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2022/CCD/RevisedCashWithdrawal.pdf"> issued an edict</a> on December 6, that capped ATM withdrawals at a maximum of $45 a day and $225 a week in a bid to coerce more people to use the eNaira, the country’s CBDC. After experiencing<a href="https://qz.com/africa/1922466/how-bitcoin-powered-nigerias-endsars-protests"> similar financial censorship</a> to the truckers in 2020 during the anti-police brutality<a href="https://www.africanews.com/2022/10/21/nigeria-police-use-tear-gas-on-anniversary-of-fatal-protest//"> “End Sars” protests</a>, Nigerians are definitely not keen on signing up for CBDC induced digital serfdom. As a result adoption of the eNaira has been dismal to say the least, with<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-25/shunned-digital-currency-looks-for-street-credibility-in-nigeria?sref=323RPL5z"> only 0.5%</a> of the country’s 217 million citizens having used it since its launch in October 2021. The Nigerian central bank’s draconian measures to promote the eNaira by declaring war on cash will just serve to strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal and adoption is likely going to keep rising. Having said that, I wouldn’t be surprised to see in the coming year more measures of this sort being implemented by central banks as they “promote” their CBDCs.</p><h2>Censorship-Resistant Design</h2><blockquote><p>“When we can secure the most important functionality of a financial network by computer science rather than by the traditional accountants, regulators, investigators, police, and lawyers, we go from a system that is manual, local, and of inconsistent security to one that is automated, global, and much more secure.”</p><p>–<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability/">Nick Szabo</a></p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin is a global, fully-decentralized, trustless, permissionless, non-sovereign and censorship-resistant form of money. It exists beyond the control of the State or any corporation and functions perfectly without the need for coordination by any centralized third parties. Of the many attributes of Bitcoin, censorship resistance remains one of the most unappreciated yet very important in this age of pervasive surveillance and financial censorship.</p><p>Censorship resistance is the ability of a currency to be stored and transacted, unhindered and unencumbered. Censorship-resistant money is immune to confiscation, freezing or interception by any third party. Anyone can access Bitcoin because it’s permissionless and, as it scales, it becomes more decentralized and therefore harder to censor. </p><p>Valid transactions that are processed on the Bitcoin network are uncensorable and no third party can block them or blacklist a wallet address. Users are protected from asset seizures by the state or freezing by private corporations — in short, it is neutral money that is governed by rules and not rulers. If WikiLeaks had been receiving donations via Bitcoin from day one, the financial blockade it experienced would have meant nothing.</p><p>The Bitcoin architecture is by design built to be censorship resistant as this ensures that no arbitrary changes to its monetary policy or to the protocol itself can be made unilaterally, thus guaranteeing the stability and integrity of the network. Without this attribute in place, what would be the guarantee that the maximum supply cap of 21 million bitcoin will not be increased unilaterally in future? </p><p>As Parker Lewis aptly<a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-is-not-for-criminals/"> puts it</a>, “Censorship resistance reinforces scarcity and scarcity reinforces censorship resistance.”<em> </em>Bitcoin’s absolute scarcity is the foundation for every financial incentive that makes the Bitcoin network functional and valuable; thus, without censorship resistance built in, the entire system is compromised.</p><p>Contrast this with the current fiat system and its various payment rails that have terms of service that can be changed at the drop of a hat by a committee or due to pressure from social justice warriors as well as the State. An example that comes to mind would be PayPal’s <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/paypals-indymedia-wipeout?s=r">deplatforming</a> of alternative media sites, Consortium News and Mint Publishing, for publishing stories that were critical of the “official narrative” with regards to Western support of Ukraine. PayPal didn’t stop there, in September of this year, it also simultaneously <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/09/21/paypal-shuts-account-parents-group-campaigned-keep-schools-open/">shut down</a> the accounts of the Free Speech Union and “UsforThemUK” (a parents group opposed to locking down schools during the pandemic) due to the “nature of its activities.” This was done with no prior warning, or clear explanation and it was unable to withdraw the thousands of pounds’ worth of donations that were still in its account. </p><p>Other organizations that were added to PayPal’s blacklist this year include: <a href="https://dailysceptic.org/">The Daily Sceptic</a>; the<a href="https://www.ukmedfreedom.org/"> U.K. Medical Freedom Alliance</a>; <a href="https://laworfiction.com/"> Law Or Fiction</a>, a website that educates citizens on their rights and how they have been affected by the British government’s response to COVID-19; and <a href="https://www.momsforliberty.org/">Moms For Liberty</a>, to name just a few. These organizations will soon realize that the solution to the predicament of financial censorship is the adoption of a Bitcoin standard, where no entity, no matter how powerful, can censor their transactions.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Rise Of Financial Restrictions</h2><blockquote><p>“Liberty once lost, is lost forever.”</p><p>–<a href="https://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/archive/doc?id=L17750707ja#:~:text=Liberty%20once%20lost%20is%20lost,they%20can%20never%20regain%20it.">John Adams</a></p></blockquote><p>On August 8, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">sanctioned</a> Tornado Cash (TC), an Ethereum <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/cryptocurrency-mixers/">smart contract mixer</a>, and <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">added it to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List</a>. According to OFAC, TC was allegedly used to launder cryptocurrency worth $455 million that was hacked by the North Korean government-backed hacker organization the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Group"> Lazarus group</a>. According to the<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b6b7513-8b57-4582-9c98-82c48f756f94"> Financial Times,</a> a senior, unnamed Treasury official commenting on the sanction of TC said:</p><blockquote><p>“‘We do believe that this action will send a really critical message to the private sector about the risks associated with mixers writ large,’ adding that it was ‘designed to inhibit Tornado Cash or any sort of reconstituted versions of it to continue to operate. Today’s action is the second action by Treasury against a mixer, but it will not be our last.’”</p></blockquote><p>This is clearly a warning that the State intends to continue tightening the screws on financial privacy tools and will not hesitate to blacklist any insufficiently-decentralized protocols. This action by OFAC of sanctioning an open-source protocol sets a precedent that indirectly outlaws financial privacy. This further breeds uncertainty within the open-source community, as developers may be prosecuted for writing code, should it be deployed by criminals later on. </p><p>As if on cue, four days after TC was sanctioned, one of TC’s contributing developers, Alex Pertsev, <a href="https://www.fiod.nl/arrest-of-suspected-developer-of-tornado-cash/">was arrested</a> by Dutch authorities on allegations of money laundering. Apart from being a contributor to TC’s code, no concrete evidence has been disclosed yet that ties Pertsev to the laundered funds, nor have any official charges against him been made, yet he remains in pre-trial detention.</p><p>Following a recent hearing, he was<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/22/tornado-cash-developer-alexey-pertsev-to-remain-in-jail-until-at-least-late-februrary/"> remanded </a>in custody until February 20, 2023, pending investigation as the court deemed him to be a flight risk. It remains to be seen how this case will turn out, but as one of the biggest crypto-related cases to reach a court of law, the outcome of it will set a precedent within the EU that could negatively affect the Bitcoin ecosystem in the region, particularly where financial privacy is concerned. This is the slippery slope that we find ourselves on, where the slow creep against financial privacy is another tactic that censors are using to protect their powers.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>OFAC’s tentacles have also extended to Ethereum, which is gradually getting<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/flashbots-build-over-82-relay-blocks-adding-to-ethereum-centralization"> more centralized</a> and less censorship resistant due to OFAC compliance as<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/flashbots-build-over-82-relay-blocks-adding-to-ethereum-centralization"> MEV-boost relays </a>become more and more dominant. Following the long awaited merge upgrade in September that transitioned Ethereum to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism,<a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1570339602346684416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1570339602346684416%7Ctwgr%5E259c919ab035e9fbd1511f4607a6eaf0636146dd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fflashbots-build-over-82-relay-blocks-adding-to-ethereum-centralization"> data by Santiment</a> indicates that 46.15% of Ethereum’s PoS nodes are controlled by just two addresses that belong to Coinbase and Lido. MEV-boost relays are also centralized entities that function as a bridge between block producers and block builders, giving all Ethereum PoS validators the option to outsource block production to third parties. As a result of this centralization, OFAC-compliant blocks came into existence, where it’s possible to censor certain transactions; like those from blacklisted TC addresses and any other sanctioned wallet addresses as designated by OFAC.</p><p>To put things in perspective, as of December 19, 2022, the production of OFAC-compliant blocks on a daily basis stands <a href="https://www.mevwatch.info/">at 72%, </a>up from 51% in October. While the possibility exists for sanctioned transactions to make it onto the Ethereum blockchain as things currently stand, this will become a rarity as more validators (and relays) will likely opt to exclude those transactions. </p><p>In case you weren’t paying attention, this is one of the biggest reasons why calls for Bitcoin to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-29/greenpeace-crypto-billionaire-lobby-to-change-bitcoin-s-code"> “change the code”</a> and transition to PoS keep getting louder. The censors know that Bitcoin as it exists today is censorship resistant, largely due to proof of work, and in a bid to seize control of it at a protocol level, the attacks to force such a change are going to intensify in the years to come.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In an op-ed piece titled,<a href="https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/get-ready-for-the-no-buy-list?s=r"> “Get Ready For The 'No-Buy' List,”</a><em> </em>David Sacks, the founding COO of PayPal, wrote:</p><blockquote><p>“Kicking people off social media deprives them of the right to speak in our increasingly online world. Locking them out of the financial economy is worse: It deprives them of the right to make a living. We have seen how cancel culture can obliterate one’s ability to earn an income, but now the canceled may find themselves without a way to pay for goods and services. Previously, canceled employees who would never again have the opportunity to work for a Fortune 500 company at least had the option to go into business for themselves. But if they cannot purchase equipment, pay employees, or receive payment from clients and customers, that door closes on them, too.”</p></blockquote><p>This observation is 100% accurate and mirrors the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4">Chinese social credit system</a>, which is a harbinger of a soon-to-be-global trend, especially as the wave of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/stakeholder-capitalism-4774323">stakeholder capitalism</a> sweeping the private sector intensifies. </p><p>The term “stakeholder capitalism” is a euphemism for fascism and is used to control private companies through “woke'' economic metrics like environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores. Adherence to woke capitalism is then indirectly forced upon the customers of the companies in question, with dissent being punished by denial of services or even financial penalties. PayPal once again surfaces as a textbook example of this. In September, it announced a policy through which it intended <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/10/10/paypal-users-fine-misinformation-aup-error-confusion/">to fine users $2,500 </a>for sharing “misinformation” online. Last time I checked, PayPal was neither a content moderation platform nor a social media company. </p><p>Following a social media backlash against this proposed policy, PayPal then<a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/paypal-reverses-course-says-company-will-not-seize-money-for-promoting-misinformation_4783827.html"> issued a statement</a> citing that the policy was put out erroneously and as a result would not be implemented. Well, three weeks after backtracking on this policy, PayPal<a href="https://techstartups.com/2022/10/27/paypal-reinstates-policy-take-2500-account-spread-misinformation/"> re-introduced the $2,500 fine</a> in its newly-updated policy. The $2,500 fine was quietly added to its terms of service after the social media driven furor against it had disappeared. As if that’s not enough, PayPal <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full?locale.x=en_US#restricted-activities">added a clause</a> that allows it to “freeze” <em>all</em> the money in your accounts for up to six months, “if reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability or if you have violated our Acceptable Use Policy.”</p><p>What we are witnessing is the gradual roll out of a Chinese Communist Party style social credit system. Take this as an early warning, especially in this era where<a href="https://future.a16z.com/software-is-eating-the-world/"> “software is eating the world”</a> and everything from banking to shopping has migrated to digital platforms.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Escaping Sanctions</h2><blockquote><p>“Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.”</p><p>–<a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/james_a_garfield_136333#:~:text=Garfield%20Quotes&amp;text=Whoever%20controls%20the%20volume%20of%20money%20in%20any%20country%20is,of%20all%20industry%20and%20commerce.">James A. Garfield</a></p></blockquote><p>Financial censorship is not exclusive to individuals and organizations but it is also extended to countries in the form of sanctions. They are also preferred as an acceptable alternative to military conflict since they are an avenue for non-kinetic power projection and are thus weapons of economic warfare. </p><p>The goal of economic sanctions is to impoverish and sicken the civilians of the sanctioned nation with the intention of pressuring the government of the sanctioned country into compliance in its hopes of avoiding civil unrest. Unfortunately, this hardly happens and as a result it’s the ordinary citizens that bear the brunt of sanctions and not the targeted politicians.</p><p>Economic sanctions are enabled by the centralized nature of the financial infrastructure of the fiat monetary system which is mainly controlled by the U.S. and the EU. One of the economic warfare tools in their arsenal is the SWIFT network. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT">SWIFT is an international bank messaging system</a> which has been operational since the 1970s that enables the transmission of almost<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Appendix_D.pdf"> $5 trillion globally</a> every day. This system enables financial institutions to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized environment.</p><p>Since the dollar is the global reserve currency, SWIFT facilitates the international dollar system. Although SWIFT is headquartered in Belgium, dollar dominance gives the U.S. a great deal of leverage over other countries. As a result of this dominance, the U.S. is able to use SWIFT as a financial weapon against nation states like Russia and Iran that violate<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_international_order"> “the rules based order.”</a> Deplatforming or removing a country from SWIFT is basically cutting it off economically from trading with the rest of the world.</p><p>In stark contrast to this, Bitcoin is a fully-decentralized digital currency and peer-to-peer payments system that is not under the control of any nation state. According to a report titled, “<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury-2021-sanctions-review.pdf">The Treasury 2021 Sanctions Review</a>” by the U.S. Treasury Department, between 2001 and 2021 the number of sanctions that were imposed by the U.S. Treasury had increased by a whopping<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/no-surprises-but-fascinating-statistics-7929959/"> 933%!</a> In a world of increasing weaponization of the dollar and centralized financial infrastructure, nation state adoption of Bitcoin is a matter of national security. </p><p>In his article titled,<a href="https://balajis.com/why-india-should-buy-bitcoin/"> “Why India Should Buy Bitcoin,”</a> Balaji Srinivasan made the following remark:</p><blockquote><p>“It is this property (referring to Bitcoin’s decentralization) that makes Bitcoin so precious for safeguarding Indian national security. A network that cannot be shut down by any state is a network that India and its diaspora can rely upon in times of conflict. For the same reason that Germany recently repatriated<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-repatriates-gold-reserves-ahead-of-schedule/a-40208045"> 3,378 tons of gold</a> from the United States, India should prioritize national support for digital gold as a financial rail of last resort in a situation like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 COVID crash…Remember also that India has had a multi-millennia long<a href="https://mises.org/library/gold-indias-capital-asset-through-history"> love</a><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-29720925"> affair</a><a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/-1830717.html"> with</a><a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/11/20/why-do-indians-love-gold"> gold</a>, and is the world's largest<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/gold-imports-dip-14-23-to-28-2-billion-during-2019-20/articleshow/75167104.cms?from=mdr"> importer of gold</a>. Gold was never a threat to India; gold has always been an asset for India. And Bitcoin is valuable for all the same reasons<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/millennials-twice-likely-buy-bitcoin-221520470.html"> gold is valuable</a>. It’s an internationally accepted store of value, it's highly scarce, and it's a so-called<a href="https://hackernoon.com/cryptocurrencies-future-bearer-instruments-of-choice-31494e34257e"> bearer instrument</a> that can't be seized with a keypress.”</p></blockquote><p>I would also add that Bitcoin adoption at the nation state level is a shield against being deplatformed from financial payment rails like SWIFT. Sanctions have downstream ripple effects that negatively affect everyone tied to a particular country, industry or company that would have been sanctioned. Bitcoin’s censorship resistance shields the citizens of a sanctioned country from the crippling effects of sanctions, and insulates an entire nation’s economy from being unjustifiably attacked. By leveraging off of Bitcoin’s decentralization and censorship resistance people living in sanctioned countries are able to use it in lieu of the dollar for trade and an alternative payments rail to SWIFT.</p><p>In late February, the EU along with the U.S., Australia, Canada and Japan<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-26/u-s-weighs-sanctions-on-russia-s-central-bank-over-ukraine?srnd=premium&amp;sref=PqmVp1JY"> agreed to disconnect</a> some Russian banks from the SWIFT network as part of restrictive measures meant to prevent the Russian central bank from circumventing sanctions that had been imposed on Russia as a result of its “military operation” in Ukraine. In a bid to pile more pressure on Russia to cease its “military operation,” Western powers seized Russia’s $640 billion worth of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/02/26/russia-central-bank-white-house/">foreign currency reserves</a>.</p><p>The implications of this unprecedented move are much bigger than the deplatforming from SWIFT but in my opinion this was the death knell for the risk-free status of U.S. treasuries, which central banks around the world hold. Not only is the entire premise of holding reserves nullified but this action has also proven that a sovereign country’s reserves can be confiscated at the drop of a hat. What had previously been regarded as safe and risk-free assets became risk free no more as non-existent credit risk was replaced by very real confiscation risk. What good are reserves that you can’t access when you need them?</p><p>To quote a remark from an article in the<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-currency-reserves-arent-really-money-the-world-is-in-for-a-shock-11646311306"> Wall Street Journal</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Barring gold, these assets (i.e. forex reserves) are someone else’s liability—someone who can just decide they are worth nothing…If currency balances were to become worthless computer entries and didn’t guarantee buying essential stuff, Moscow would be rational to stop accumulating them and stockpile physical wealth in oil barrels, rather than sell them to the West.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The financial censorship of Russia may seem justified today, but is there any guarantee that the weaponization of the financial system will not be abused in future? Every country that doesn’t want to become vulnerable to “denial-of-service attacks” will need to hold bitcoin in its treasury as a matter of national security. This also includes countries that aren’t sanctioned as they still need to diversify and limit their geopolitical risk in a vastly-polarized world. The same also holds true for individual citizens as they are the collateral damage when economic warfare is unleashed on their countries.</p><p> A nation cannot be truly sovereign if its financial destiny is controlled by another nation. The risk of being deplatformed from the current dollar-based fiat monetary system either via SWIFT, the IMF or private companies like PayPal continues to grow each day, both for nation states and individuals alike. While the IMF or SWIFT aren’t institutions that deal directly with the public, they do have great influence on the financial well being of a country. Great consideration needs to be made when deciding which assets to acquire in order to maintain individual sovereignty and defend your freedom to transact in the face of an attack. Bitcoin is currently the only financial asset that can be used as a defense against financial censorship at an individual level as well as at a nation state level.</p><p>Had the Russian central bank's reserves been in bitcoin, no nation would have had the ability to arbitrarily freeze or seize them. On the flip side, this event may be the dollar system’s Waterloo and could lead to rapid de-dollarization by countries seeking to reduce their vulnerability to the U.S.’s control. </p><h2>Attacks On Bitcoin Will Increase In 2023</h2><blockquote><p>“A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s. I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.”</p><p>–<a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/quotes/cryptocurrency/">Satoshi Nakamoto</a></p></blockquote><p>In conclusion, as the curtain comes down on 2022, it’s clear from the few examples that we explored in this essay that financial censorship is a huge problem of great concern given its increased usage with no signs of slowing down. </p><p>Financial censorship will continue to be one of the most-preferred levers that the state, big tech and bankers will use to silence critics as well as to force compliance with authoritarian policies. As the relationship between the state and “private sector” players gets cozier with regards to financial censorship, our society will continue its slow creep toward a dystopian digital feudalistic future. </p><p>The censors are not ignoring Bitcoin anymore and are taking active steps to capture it and/or restrict its usage as much as possible. Senator Warren’s<a href="https://decrypt.co/117221/senator-warren-crypto-bill-kyc-self-custody-wallets"> Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering bill</a> along with the EU’s<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/02/analyzing-whats-next-for-europes-markets-in-crypto-assets-law/"> Markets In Crypto Assets law (MiCA)</a> are two examples of ongoing attempts at regulatory capture, where the low-hanging fruit of fiat on/off ramps are the initial targets. Given everything that transpired this year, it would be naive to expect the state and its private sector allies to abandon their plans to destroy Bitcoin in the coming year.</p><p>That said, there is plenty of light at the end of the tunnel. With each attack that the State throws at Bitcoin, the network gets more resilient and stronger. Every attempt at banning Bitcoin, or destroying it, or financially censoring dissenters will have the opposite effect of further substantiating the reason for Bitcoin’s existence. These “free marketing campaigns'' will drive home the importance of decentralization and censorship resistance in a more effective way. </p><p>The centralized nature of the fiat monetary system and its dependency on trusted third parties is both its strength (as this is how financial censorship is enforced) and its Achilles heel (as this is what Bitcoin dematerialized). In the coming year, as more people get canceled financially, it’s incumbent upon us to build more user-friendly tools that enhance financial privacy, develop Bitcoin circular economies and more Bitcoin-focused educational content. Reducing the Bitcoin learning curve, coupled with enhanced financial privacy and thriving Bitcoin circular economies, will be a great bulwark against attacks from the censors.</p><p>In a February 1995<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1995/02/msg00508.html"> email,</a> Wei Dai, the cryptographer who invented<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/b-money/"> B-Money,</a> which was referenced in the<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"> Bitcoin white paper</a>, perfectly captured the spirit of the above solution when he wrote the following:</p><blockquote><p>“There has never been a government that didn't sooner or later try to reduce the freedom of its subjects and gain more control over them, and there probably never will be one. Therefore, instead of trying to convince our current government not to try, we'll develop the technology that will make it impossible for the government to succeed. Efforts to influence the government (e.g., lobbying and propaganda) are important only in so far as to delay its attempted crackdown long enough for the technology to mature and come into wide use. But even if you do not believe the above is true, think about it this way: If you have a certain amount of time to spend on advancing the cause of greater personal privacy, can you do it better by using the time to learn about cryptography and develop the tools to protect privacy, or by convincing your government not to invade your privacy?”</p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin’s censorship resistance presents a viable option to both individuals and countries alike to withstand financial deplatforming and maintain sovereignty as well as neutrality in a highly-polarized and cancel-culture driven world. Despite the prevailing bear market, Bitcoin’s censorship resistance remains unchanged. Having a Bitcoin “insurance fund” is the most prudent thing one can do. </p><p>As Satoshi Nakamoto <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-writings-of-satoshi-f4d86e94694f#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20might%20make%20sense%20just,a%20self%2Dfulfilling%20prophecy.%E2%80%9D">wrote</a>, “It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.”</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

When the bear market hit this year, we saw a "cleansing" of the Bitcoin ecosystem and an opportunity to refocus on its main mission of monetary freedom.</p><p>The snowball started in the heat of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/celsius-bankruptcy-judge-orders-return-some-crypto-assets-customers-2022-12-07/">July with the Celsius bankruptcy</a>, which was the first sign that the ecosystem we were building was not healthy. The fact that we were using a decentralized currency to mirror the centralized financial system did not match the vision for Bitcoin.</p><p>This once again highlighted the existence of two alternate and diverging realities for Bitcoin: "real" Bitcoin, which is rising from the bottom up and focuses on the value Bitcoin can bring to the world, and "regulated" Bitcoin, which is focused on price and committed to regulatory systems and adoption through speculation.</p><p>I <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-exchange-coincorner-acquires-coinfloor-customer-base-domain">sold Coinfloor in 2021</a> because I realized that exchanges like ours were too often dedicated to keeping their users trapped in regulated Bitcoin land. As we near the end of 2022, the negative effects of this have been painfully demonstrated by the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">collapse of FTX</a>, the regulatory fallout and the losses incurred by so many innocent people.</p><p>On the other hand, real Bitcoin is flourishing in the Global South and post-Soviet regions, where innovation is addressing the narrative that Bitcoin has no good use cases. For instance, a new version of <a href="https://twitter.com/obi/status/1602719065394626561?s=20&amp;t=Q3N3roPSGa5IRrFRNrmC2g">frontier towns</a> is emerging, combining renewable energy, Bitcoin mining, internet connectivity and community custody. As I have long suspected, real Bitcoin adoption can only come from the people, and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fediment-evolution-of-bitcoin-custody">Fedimint</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/fedi-global-bitcoin-adoption-tech">Fedi</a> seek to be key in achieving hyperbitcoinization. The world will experience the most primitive form of protection — humans united — translated and turbocharged through the highest technology.</p><p>In the coming years, communities will play a crucial role in defining the path for Bitcoin. Bitcoiners are already empowering communities around the globe, but it is vital that our global community also stays united to win this battle. As I predicted in my 2020 post, we will certainly succeed in this endeavor and so <a href="https://twitter.com/obi/status/1603395290198904843?s=20&amp;t=70xvNHh_VdPiZBIvaxhh-g">I am more convinced than ever that Bitcoin will win in 2023</a>.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Obi Nwosu.

We’re at a turning point. It is clear that Bitcoin is starting to cut the dead weight of speculation. All eyes are on us and it’s our responsibility to educate people and governments about why Bitcoin has real-life use cases that will allow money to flow freely and include billions more into the global economy. I’m ready to onboard the next billion Bitcoiners.</p><p>Here are my 2022 takeaways and predictions for 2023:</p><h2>The Global South Will Continue To Lead Bitcoin Adoption</h2><p>I just came back from the<a href="https://www.afrobitcoin.org/"> Africa Bitcoin Conference</a> in Ghana — an inspirational event bringing together pan-Africa and international leaders to talk about Bitcoin’s purpose over its price (thank you <a href="https://www.afrobitcoin.org/about-us">Farida Nabourema</a>!). As a legacy for the event, our team at<a href="https://www.builtwithbitcoin.org/"> the Built With Bitcoin Foundation</a> opened the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/built-with-bitcoin-opens-bitcoin-technology-center-in-ghana">Bitcoin Technology Center (BTC), a learning and training center in Kumasi, Ghana</a> — which is set to educate 400 people in its first year. </p><p>This trip reenergized my hope for the future. Even in a bear market, trade volume in Africa continues to press forward. Looking at our volume on Paxful, we predict further increases in both Ghana and Nigeria for 2023. Why? We’re still seeing growth in Africa because of the necessity for Bitcoin on the continent — it offers a cheaper and more efficient solution for people to send money back home, make payments and preserve their wealth. And that does not go away because of market conditions. I expect Africa to continue to lead the way heading into the next year. </p><h2>The Divide Between Bitcoin And The Rest Will Grow</h2><p>Bitcoin is backed by human work and has proven its utility beyond the West’s obsession with speculation. It has the ability to bank the unbanked and finally shift the tides of economic apartheid — Bitcoin’s impact cannot be overstated. The bulk of “cryptos” are for wild speculation and investing, relying on the morals of these shady authorities. </p><p>As we’ve seen with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, people’s life savings can be demolished when there is only a single point of failure. This narrative is the same game the banks have been running for centuries. I’m not buying it. Next year, we will see more Bitcoin-only companies and conferences as the Bitcoin community works to clean up the mess of misinformation caused by these bad actors.</p><h2>Governments Need A Rethink</h2><p>Smart regulation fosters safety, but poor- or overregulation stifles innovation and growth. We need to strike a balance and that comes with education. My hope for next year is that more Bitcoin companies come together to share why Bitcoin cannot and should not be regulated as you would, for example, stocks or wheat futures. </p><p>It’s our responsibility to also advocate for transparency — like requiring companies to share their proof of reserves. Without this, we’re going to see more far-reaching regulation like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sen-warren-unconstitutional-crypto-bill">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act</a>, which pegs more consumer surveillance as the savior and touts Western Union as an example to lead the industry. We know how that narrative will play out... </p><h2>‘Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins’ Will Get Louder </h2><p>The trust of the people was tested this year and I don’t blame them for shying away. Life savings were destroyed because of despicable morals and we need to earn back that trust. This is why I<a href="https://paxful.com/university/why-you-should-hold-own-bitcoin/"> advocate</a> for decentralization and for users to self custody their savings. </p><p>Using a non-custodial wallet means that users are their own banks, managing their own money and controlling the future of their own finances. In 2023, we’ll see more of a narrative and product push around self custody. I am already doing my part to amplify this message, including sharing a<a href="https://paxful.com/university/bitcoin-self-custody/"> step-by-step process</a> on how to self custody your bitcoin.</p><h2>Bear Markets Will Build A Stronger Industry</h2><p>I am a natural builder and I have gone back to my roots this year. I’ve come to realize that we are not building products for how people live their daily lives in the Global South. There is too much focus on the unrealistic dream of minting millionaires and not enough around the pain points that keeps billions of people enclosed in economic apartheid. Next year, you will see more products that cater to the true needs of everyday people and offer them solutions for remittance, payments, e-commerce, wealth preservation and basic communication. </p><p>Bitcoiners, 2023 is looking brighter than ever. This is the way!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ray Youssef.

Every year millions of Americans save between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/travel/medical-tourism-coronavirus-pandemic.html">40-80% in medical fees</a> by crossing the border or taking a short plane ride to receive the care they need. Even after the pandemic slowed international travel, more people looked abroad for shorter wait times, better service, and lower fees. </p><p>Bitcoin can boost the medical tourism sector and help patients get the treatment they need at a price that is affordable. Bitcoin can make transactions abroad easier and ensure that everyone gets a fair deal. </p><h2>Medical Tourism</h2><p>Medical tourism has a bad reputation. It’s commonly associated with experimental treatments, suspicious surgeons, and concerning cosmetic procedures. However, these issues are largely overplayed and overstated. For millions, medical tourism is a lifeline that helps folks get the treatment they need at a price they can afford. </p><p>The <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism">CDC defines medical tourism</a> as the practice of traveling to another country for medical care. Common medical tourism destinations include Canada, as well as countries in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. </p><p>The CDC does warn that medical tourism carries risks. Flying shortly after surgery increases the patient’s risk of deep vein thrombosis. Medical tourists may be exposed to bacterial infection due to a lack of immunity and should research any care providers thoroughly before going through with treatment. </p><p>People elect to travel abroad for many different treatments. However, medical treatments are particularly popular for treatments that have <a href="https://sanantonio-lasik.com/cataracts/how-soon-after-cataract-surgery-can-you-drive/">shorter recovery times like cataract surgery</a>. People who have cataract surgery can usually drive the day after treatment, so negotiating an airport shouldn’t be an issue. </p><p>Patients who are considering medical tourism should consult with their primary care provider before moving forward. The primary provider has a complete medical history and will know whether or not a procedure is viable. They’ll also be able to arrange follow-up care when patients arrive home. </p><h2>Transactions Abroad</h2><p>Bitcoin transactions may be particularly important in the future, as the U.S. medical economy appears to be set for a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/us-economy-medical-debt-black-swan-event">black swan event</a> following the pandemic. Trillions of dollars of medical debt have accumulated in the U.S., which may push folks to seek better service and lower costs abroad. </p><p>Medical debt is a serious issue in the U.S., though most people can <a href="https://www.nationaldebtrelief.com/proactive-ways-to-avoid-medical-debt/">avoid medical debt</a> by researching billing codes and negotiating a payment plan that works for them. This may involve negotiations with partial payments in bitcoin, too. </p><p>Bitcoin has the potential to make medical tourism more affordable for all. This can close the care gap, and ensures that everyone has access to high-quality, reliable medical care. </p><p>This sentiment is echoed by Renée-Marie Stephano, CEO of Global Healthcare Resources and the Medical Tourism Association. Stephano <a href="https://www.magazine.medicaltourism.com/article/cryptocurrency-medical-tourism">notes</a> that there has been a “sharp uptick in the utilization of cryptocurrency” to pay for medical treatment abroad.</p><p>Decentralized currencies like bitcoin return power to the patient and make it easier for patients to pay for their treatment. Bitcoin can help patients avoid issues with currency conversions and international payments. Bitcoin payments to clinics are fast and come with minimal charges compared with traditional transactions. </p><p>Providers who accept bitcoin find that the process is easy and can be quickly converted to national currencies. Ken Fryer, a spokesperson for Vinci Hair Clinic in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hair_clinics_in_london_spain_dubai_and_brazil_accepting_bitcoins">admitted</a> that their clinic had to cancel previous treatments for international patients due to issues with fund transfers and banking restrictions. </p><p>Fryer says that Bitcoin solved these issues and gave patients the ability to pay quickly in large sums if needed. </p><h2>Countries Accepting Bitcoin For Medical Tourism</h2><p>Medical tourism often occurs in less economically developed countries (LEDC). Bitcoin can help these nations close the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-opening-to-financial-inclusion">wealth inequality gap</a> by encouraging a fair, free-flowing exchange of funds in return for legitimate healthcare services. </p><p>Despite the recent downturn in cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin utilization remains high in many countries where medical tourism is popular. </p><p>Currently, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/china-back-among-top-10-crypto-using-countries">top 10 countries for Bitcoin adoption</a> include Brazil, India and Pakistan. Many of these countries are popular <a href="https://shifainternationalpatients.com/blog/medical-tourism-in-2021/">destinations for medical tourism</a>.</p><p>India is a particularly popular destination for medical tourism in Asia. India has a favorable medical visa policy, which allows family members to stay with patients. India also scores highly in Bitcoin adoption and is ranked first in centralized service value received and retail centralized service value received. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Bitcoin has the potential to improve medical tourism and help everyone get the treatment they need. Bitcoin is particularly important in today’s post-pandemic world, where medical bills are spiraling and the U.S. medical sector holds trillions of dollars of debt. </p><p>Bitcoin can be particularly useful when traveling to countries with tricky transfer laws. Treatment can be delayed or even canceled if patients aren’t able to pay on time. Bitcoin can negate this issue, and help everyone get a fair deal. </p><p>Before paying for medical treatment in Bitcoin, patients should consult with their primary care provider to ensure that they get the treatment they need when they return home. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Frankie Wallace.

"But to pay for foreign trade transactions, we still assume the possibility of using cryptocurrencies, for example, for parallel imports."</p><p>Russian officials have teased at this possibility for almost a year, following an intense package of Western sanctions deployed in the wake of the nation’s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Russia laid out a roadmap for bitcoin regulation <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/russia-prepares-roadmap-for-bitcoin-crypto-regulation-report">in January 2022</a>, and the Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/russia-submits-first-bitcoin-bill-proposal">in the following month</a>. Around the same time, U.S. President Biden announced the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-imposes-sanctions-on-russia-bitcoin-jumps-to-39k">first tranche of Russian sanctions</a>, blocking five of the biggest Russian banks and freezing all the assets they held in America.

If they want bitcoin, we will trade in bitcoin," the chairman of the country’s Congressional energy committee, Pavel Zavalny, said in a press conference at the time.</p><p>Soon, the idea gained steam and different areas of Russia’s government began endorsing it.

Although once-touted as a non-correlative asset compared to equity markets, bitcoin’s beta is ultimately well past one as it falls at a rate nearly twice that of the struggling stock market.</p><p>But, recently, it appears that the coin is <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-price-crypto-markets-today-51667468347">stagnating below</a> $20,000. In this apparent consolidation, some fear that it may simply be butting up against a previous support floor and that any additional bad bitcoin news will cause a further drop.</p><p>Some are more confident in the coin.</p><p>According to them, this consolidation is a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-price-tests-critical-support-levels">strong sign of a bottom</a>, and the support making bitcoin range-bound is a sign of a strong future. Whether the coin will shoot back up to close to its previous all-time-high of nearly $70,000 remains to be seen – but some are cautiously optimistic. </p><h2>Gathering Statistics</h2><p>According to the crypto research giant Kaiko, the volatility of the<a href="https://www.compareforexbrokers.com/forex-trading/statistics/"> $201B cryptocurrency market</a> fell below standard market benchmarks. This is a harbinger of solid consolidation, even as a stronger US currency and more attractive fixed-income assets distract investors. </p><p>In fact, for some, that bitcoin stability is the best news of the year.</p><p>Luno exchange head Vijay Ayyar reinforced the thesis that consolidation is an indicator of future stability or moves upward rather than further crashing, saying that “Bitcoin has largely been range bound between $18-25K for four months now, indicating consolidation and a probable bottoming out pattern, given we are seeing the Dollar Index top out as well.”</p><p>Calling the bottom (or the top) is as much art as science, with a healthy dose of luck needed, but Ayyar relies on past trends to make his assessments: “We’ve seen BTC bottom when DXY has topped in the past, as in 2015, so we could be witnessing a very similar pattern again.”</p><p>Others in the industry agree; Antoni Trenchev of the lending firm Nexo says that the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/discussing-the-revenge-of-the-nodes">consolidation and reduced volatility</a> are “strong evidence that the digital assets industry has matured and is becoming less fragmented.”</p><h2>Has Spring Sprung?</h2><p>As the rest of the equities market fell by “only” <a href="https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/is-a-market-correction-coming.html">around 20%</a>, bitcoin dropped by a multiple of that, losing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/bitcoin-has-lost-more-than-50percent-of-its-value-this-year-what-to-know.html">nearly $2</a> trillion in net value and falling by over 50% just this year. It has dropped almost 70% compared to its<a href="https://youngandtheinvested.com/cryptocurrency-statistics/"> $68,543 peak</a> in November 2021. This fall was devastating to the class of investors who saw bitcoin as a hedge or means of diversification in a portfolio, as the coin proved substantially correlated with stocks.</p><p>As we’ve said, and you’ve undoubtedly heard parroted endlessly since October 2021, that fall is mainly due to the Federal Reserve’s attempts to tamp down inflation. Those attempts have proven to be largely insubstantial thus far, requiring a further rate increase of 75 BPS at a time with no end.</p><p>Compounding the correlation issue was that many large institutional crypto bulls built heavily leveraged positions they were then forced to unwind to avoid margin calls, ultimately driving the price down further as the assets were sold for relative scraps.</p><p>Some call this nuclear fallout in the crypto sphere, aptly, a crypto winter. Some, like Three Arrows Capital, even lost their entire firm as they unwound too slowly — the firm lost <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/battered-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-considers-asset-sales-bailout-11655469932">more than $3B</a> of investor money before collapsing.</p><p>Going back to Ayyar, the stability indicates an “accumulation period.” That accumulation may indicate a willingness to tentatively return to bitcoin for funds, firms and investors, as the modeling shows the $20,000 range undervalued.</p><p>“The fact that bitcoin is trapped in such a range makes it boring, but this is also the point at which retail investors lose interest, and smart money begins to amass,” Ayyar said.</p><p>Not only that, but many family offices are expanding their crypto holdings as they, too, seek diversification and increasingly move towards alternative investments for clients. Digital asset management fund president Matteo Dante Perruccio reinforced this trend by pointing to a “counterintuitive spike in demand” from big money and smart money. This could be a move towards diversification or, just as likely, seeking substantial upside as they think the bottom is in.</p><p>Bitcoin miners, too, have reduced their crypto sales. As this happens, selling pressure also falls, another harbinger of positive movement in the coin’s future and the mining industry at large. Analysts from Goldman Sachs say that publicly traded bitcoin miners sold <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/boring-could-be-beautiful-for-xbtf">around 3,000 bitcoins</a> in September compared to 12,000 in June.</p><p>Back to Perruccio: he predicts that the crypto winter will break in Q2 of 2023. “For the market to advance,” he said, “we’ll have seen a lot more failures in the DeFi [decentralized finance] arena and a lot of the smaller firms.”</p><p>Even financial service providers haven’t abandoned crypto.</p><p>Joining the trend, Mastercard just rolled out options for banks that enable crypto trading alongside traditional accounts. Also, Visa is collaborating with the FTX exchange to bring debit cards to market that direct links to trading accounts and help users <a href="https://www.waveapps.com/blog/accounting-and-taxes/cash-flow-projection">ensure cash flow</a> as they speculate, spend, and manage the transition from cash to crypto (and vice versa). </p><h2>Fed Watch</h2><p>Head of Crypto Research at the alternative asset management company CoinShares James Butterfill is a bit more cautious, reminding investors that it’s difficult to make too many predictions before more information and data come out. “We err on the side of higher upside possibilities rather than further price declines,” he said.</p><p>“The largest fund withdrawals recently have been in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/earn-interest-on-bitcoin-short-sellers">short-bitcoin positions</a>, whereas we have seen tiny but consistent inflows into long bitcoin over the last six weeks,” he said to CNBC via email. He later added, “A statement from the Federal Reserve that it intends to ease its aggressive tightening would be the major factor driving uptake of bitcoin.”</p><p>The Fed is expected to continue the 75 BPS incremental hikes. Still, some also see a pivot on the horizon back to the days of easy (or easier) money: “Clients are telling us that they will start increasing positions to bitcoin once the Fed pivots, or is close to it,” Butterfill said. “The recent liquidations of net shorts are consistent with what we observe in terms of money flows and suggest that short sellers are starting to give in.”</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So what’s the bottom line? Unfortunately, the future is impossible to predict, and we can only manage expectations in line with past trends, data, and our thesis about the coin. For bullish investors, though, the recent <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/buyers-of-last-resort-and-bitcoin-price-volatility">reduction in volatility</a> is a good sign indeed – and institutions appear to agree.</p><hr><h2>Addendum – FTX And Its Dramatic Effect On The Crypto Capital Market</h2><p>Sometimes you speak too soon, and in the case of Bitcoin's reduced volatility, unforeseen circumstances are forcing the metaphorical groundhog back into his hole for another extended period of crypto winter. </p><p>Midway through the month, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, previously the third largest and seen as broadly beyond reproach, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">collapsed</a> in a spectacular mess of financial mismanagement and tabloid-style personal intrigue. </p><p>While the latter is undoubtedly good for gossip fodder, the crux of what happened and how it will affect Bitcoin moving forward lay in the former. In short, the appearance of mismanagement led to the uncovering of real abuses as the largest exchange, Binance, announced they'd be closing their positions in FTX's proprietary coin FTT based on perceived conflicts of interest between FTX and trading firm Alameda. That announcement led to an effective bank run on FTX as thousands of customers pulled or cashed in their coins, triggering a liquidity crisis as FTX failed to deliver on customer withdrawals.</p><p>I told you it was complicated, and that's just scratching the surface. But what matters now is the effect we see on Bitcoin capital markets. </p><p>Despite a period of consolidation and accumulation as Bitcoin stayed effectively "flat," the news of FTX's collapse and shadow of doubt cast over the crypto arena. After just a week of increasingly concerning information, Bitcoin fell to a two-year low of $15,480, bringing the total market loss for the year to a round $1.5T. </p><p>Some look to the FTX collapse as a final nail in the crypto coffin, rounding out stablecoin UST's loss of stability and widespread failure of former monolithic crypto-focused funds that appeared to bring legitimacy to the markets as a safe(ish) store of value. It's unclear whether the winter will continue. Still, increased regulations are almost a sure bet as agents from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice, and other government giants converge on the scraps of FTX to find out what happened and how to prevent it in the future. </p><p>Even the most optimistic Bitcoin bulls see the crypto winter extending through 2023, so it's best to be prepared to hunker down for another rough ride. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><em>Francois Moreau</em><em>.

Allen. The hearing, entitled "<a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/crypto-crash-why-the-ftx-bubble-burst-and-the-harm-to-consumers">Crypto Crash: Why the FTX Bubble Burst and Harm to Consumers</a>," had all the markings of political theater and provided a stage to misinform senators and the public. It coincided with Elizabeth Warren's new financial surveillance bill, which <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/20/elizabeth-warrens-new-financial-surveillance-bill-is-a-disaster-for-privacy-and-civil-liberties/">is a disaster for privacy and civil liberties</a>. On December 18, the Senate Banking Committee Chair Senator Sherrod Brown divulged on “Meet The Press” that the hearing was intended to “educate the public” on the dangers of cryptocurrencies and <a href="https://youtu.be/gzqJahHvhsY?t=513">floated the idea of banning them</a> altogether.</p><h2>Mr. McKenzie Goes To Washington</h2><p><br>Actor Ben McKenzie, who has starred in “The O.C.<em>,</em>” “Gotham” and “Southland,” lacks the qualifications and expertise one would expect for being called before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee to testify on the inner workings of financial technology. It should therefore come as no surprise that he made basic errors in his testimony, and could have been avoided altogether had witnesses with actual expertise been called. According to Mr. McKenzie:</p><blockquote><p>"Bitcoin cannot work as a medium of exchange because it cannot scale. The Bitcoin network can only process 5 to 7 transactions a second. By comparison, Visa can handle tens of thousands. To facilitate that relatively trivial amount of transactions, Bitcoin uses an enormous amount of energy. In 2021, Bitcoin consumed 134 TWh in total, comparable to the electrical energy consumed by the country of Argentina. Bitcoin simply cannot ever work at scale as a medium of exchange.</p><p>–<a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Schenkkan%20Testimony%2012-14-22.pdf">Written testimony of Ben McKenzie Schenkkan</a>, December 14, 2022, U.S. Senate Banking Committee</p><p> </p></blockquote><p>McKenzie’s testimony leaves one with the impression that he intentionally sought out the most biased and unreliable sources to confirm his own predetermined conclusions. Unfortunately, it was false information.</p><p>Leaving aside the fact that he referenced Digiconomist, an<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/not-science-digiconomist-bitcoin"> unreliable, exaggerated</a> and<a href="https://blog.zorinaq.com/serious-faults-in-beci/"> seriously flawed</a> electricity consumption estimate from a<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/questionable-ethics-of-bitcoin-esg"> Dutch central bank employee's personal blog</a> that<a href="https://medium.com/@nic__carter/comments-on-the-white-house-report-on-the-climate-implications-of-crypto-mining-8d65d30ec942"> lacks peer review</a> (Cambridge University’s data is well respected and estimates that Bitcoin consumed<a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index"> 105 terawatt hours (TWh)</a>, or roughly 22% less energy than Digiconomist estimated, for 2021), McKenzie is effectively comparing a car engine to a wheel and not realizing how they relate to each other.</p><p>In technical terms, McKenzie conflated Visa’s transaction network with Bitcoin’s final settlement network, to make the illogical claim that Bitcoin cannot scale. This is a novice mistake. One could use the same faulty logic to make the erroneous claim that millions of retail payments within the banking system should be impossible because banks typically <a href="https://www.theclearinghouse.org/payment-systems/chips">wait until the end of the business day to settle funds with each other</a>. That, of course, is not true, as gross settlement is precisely how high-volume retail payments are batched between banks.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/bluepnume/status/1393857753559420930"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Visa is a credit-based transaction network. It’s not a financial institution, so it does not actually transfer money and cannot perform final settlement like Bitcoin can. Visa is effectively an IT company that<a href="https://youtu.be/i9timulsE4o"> informs its member banks how to clear and perform gross settlement with each other</a> during business hours. If you’ve ever waited a few days for a check to clear, you know that payments between two bank accounts are not instantaneous. Credit card transactions take <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-posting.asp">one to three days to post</a>. And <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1605946168667766784">90 to120 days to settle</a>.</p><p>The Visa system works well and offers services such as risk assessment, fraud prevention and clawbacks, but can incur high fees from the banks and intermediaries along the way. Member banks aren’t actually sending each other tens of thousands of payments every second. Instead, they batch millions of transactions together into a small number of final settlement payments. The settlements are typically routed through lower-volume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_gross_settlement">real-time gross settlement</a> (RTGS) networks operated by central banks, such as <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/wires">Fedwire</a> in the U.S. or <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/target/target2/html/index.en.html">TARGET2</a> in the EU.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin and Fedwire can perform about the same number of transactions per year. In December of 2020, Bitcoin<a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1363877250744152069"> performed 26 million transfers</a> (counting multiple outputs) across 9.6 million transactions, while Fedwire settled<a href="https://frbservices.org/resources/financial-services/wires/volume-value-stats/monthly-stats.html"> 18 million transactions</a> during the same time period. Just as Visa operates on transactional layers that batch transactions into gross settlement layers, Bitcoin is designed to scale in a similar manner.</p><p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning Network</a> was formally <a href="https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf">theorized</a> as a scaling solution <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/lightning-network">at MIT</a> in 2016 and today is a burgeoning Layer 2 open payments protocol, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">layered on top of Bitcoin</a>. The Lightning Network enables instant payments, and micropayments down to a fraction of a penny, and can scale up to the entire world. Micropayments alone could change e-commerce and the internet itself as we know it. Imagine machines or people <a href="https://podcastindex.org/podcast/value4value">streaming fractions of pennies for content</a> or APIs and you can already begin to see a new future for the internet emerging. Traditional finance simply cannot achieve this.</p><p>The Lightning Network allows high throughput Layer 3 retail payment apps and services such as <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a>, <a href="https://strike.me/">Strike</a> and many other apps to efficiently batch transactions into Bitcoin's "blocks" for final settlement. Services on Layer 3 <a href="https://youtu.be/276N9y293_k?t=4775">can offer the same protections</a> we are used to in the legacy financial system, but anyone can freely access Bitcoin’s Layer 2 or Layer 1 whenever they want.</p><blockquote><p>"While it would require time and investment, Visa’s payment network could sit on top of the bitcoin network to fulfill payments much the same way it sits on top of the existing banking system."&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-is-not-too-slow/">Parker Lewis</a></p></blockquote><p>While Fedwire adheres to <a href="https://app.frbservices.org/resources/financial-services/wires/operating-hours.html">limited operating hours</a>, shutting down on weekends and <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/about/holiday-schedules/">holidays</a>, Bitcoin never shuts down and it continues settling transactions roughly every 10 minutes — 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Bitcoin has achieved a<a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-uptime/"> similar uptime to Fedwire since Bitcoin's inception</a> and has demonstrated<a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-uptime/"> better uptime</a> than Fedwire since 2013. Fedwire experienced a<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/the-feds-system-that-allows-banks-to-send-money-back-and-forth-is-down.html"> major outage in 2021</a>.</p><p>There is no doubt that the larger cryptocurrency industry has become rife with fraud, scams and deception and it's commendable that McKenzie makes an effort to warn the public about those dangers. However, in his haste to condemn the entire industry, he failed to fundamentally understand<a href="https://youtu.be/RI4xEHI7tGg"> what sets Bitcoin apart</a> from the seemingly endless “crypto” scams and fraud that have sprung up around Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention. </p><p>Bitcoin's Lightning Network has a<a href="https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/1456088664132440069"> theoretical throughput of 40 million transactions per second</a>. Just as the internet took more than a generation to achieve today's levels of connectivity and reach, the Lightning Network would need time to grow its liquidity for it to achieve this theoretical maximum throughput. The performance of the Lightning Network is already astounding and is <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeNakamoto/status/1551546953934278660">faster than traditional contactless payments</a>. Thus, the testimony McKenzie provided to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee that, "Bitcoin simply cannot ever work at scale as a medium of exchange" was not only misleading, it was false.</p><p>Bitcoin uses multi-layered architecture,<a href="https://www.layeredmoney.com/"> modeled after the existing financial system</a> and banking systems going back to <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1604368939428958209">at least the 15th century</a>. Layered architecture is an ideal pattern for<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture"> well-built information technology systems</a> — including<a href="https://5g.systemsapproach.org/arch.html"> mobile networks</a> and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite"> the internet itself</a>. This kind of deliberate and intelligent architecture is what enables Bitcoin to become a decentralized medium of exchange for the entire planet.</p><p>In his written testimony, McKenzie <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Schenkkan%20Testimony%2012-14-22.pdf">highlighted</a> the issues plaguing El Salvador’s Bitcoin banking system, <a href="https://www.chivowallet.com/">Chivo</a> — a privately-built, government-controlled Layer 3 system that plugs into the Lightning Network. However, he failed to inform senators that users in El Salvador are free to use high-quality open-source wallets, such as <a href="https://muun.com/">Muun</a> or <a href="https://www.bitcoinbeach.com/">Bitcoin Beach</a> wallet and a wide range of others. More importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ibw7YA39s-M">the technology is starting to make a difference</a> in the lives of those who would otherwise be unbanked, as <a href="https://youtu.be/Ibw7YA39s-M">journalist Sharyn Alfonsi of “60 Minutes” discovered on a visit to El Salvador</a> earlier this year.</p><p>McKenzie, who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2022-11-24/counting-the-ways-the-world-hates-crypto-crypto-irl">after getting high one evening</a> decided to write a book on the rampant fraud in the crypto industry, has since begun a collaboration with journalist Jacob Silverman on the endeavor. McKenzie <a href="https://uvamagazine.org/articles/before_batman">earned his bachelor of arts degree from the University of Virginia in 2001</a>, majoring in foreign affairs and economics. That the U.S. Senate Banking Committee felt that an actor with an atrophied undergraduate degree in economics would somehow make an expert witness for a particularly complicated financial innovation suggests that the hearing was solely intended as political theater.</p><h2>Senators Regurgitate Ben McKenzie’s Fallacious Testimony</h2><p>When it was Senator Mark Warner’s turn to ask questions, he remarked:</p><blockquote><p>“I do think it’s curious that China made the decision to basically take that kind of risk, to ban crypto, because of their, at least, risk/reward analysis... The clunkiness of the technology behind Bitcoin, it could never go to scale no matter what! If you can only do 5 or 6 transactions per second, that is not a scalable tool and obviously a technology at a power and environmental cost. It just doesn’t make sense to me.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1603260817251745792">Senator Mark Warner</a></p></blockquote><p>Ignoring for a moment that Senator Warner thought it was “curious” that an authoritarian country made the risk/reward calculation to ban free speech of code and software — which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_v._United_States">protected under the First Amendment</a> — McKenzie’s false testimony had misinformed the senator into thinking that Bitcoin cannot scale when it is in fact already <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-lightning-network-surges-6746790">rapidly scaling</a>.</p><h2>The Energy Debate</h2><p>Earlier this year,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/style/ben-mckenzie-crypto.html"> McKenzie toured</a> Riot Blockchain’s<a href="https://www.riotblockchain.com/bitcoin-mining/whinstone-u-s"> Whinstone U.S.</a> — North America's largest Bitcoin mining facility, located about an hour outside Austin, Texas. When it was Senator Tina Smith's turn to ask questions, she turned to McKenzie and, doing her best to act confused,<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1603823473524187137"> asked what appeared to be a series of pre-scripted questions</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>SMITH: </strong>As I understand it, crypto mining is built on a process that becomes more and more energy intensive, over time. Is that correct?</p><p><strong>MCKENZIE:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>SMITH:</strong> So, it's inherently inefficient. Is that correct?</p><p><strong>MCKENZIE:</strong> The technology is bad.</p><p><strong>SMITH: </strong>And so, where is the benefit of this kind of innovation? How should we think about the impacts when it comes to the climate and energy impacts? Because when crypto mines are located in communities, those communities often see their energy prices go up — their energy rates go up — is that correct?</p><p><strong>MCKENZIE:</strong> That's right. I visited the largest crypto mine in the country, Whinstone, which is in Rockdale, Texas, just outside of my hometown of Austin, Texas. Local citizens are upset. It raises the cost of electricity for all citizens. And it also uses an enormous amount of energy. It took over a former Alcoa aluminum smelting plant that had been abandoned and now we are using it to mine ephemeral digital assets of no productive value.</p></blockquote><p>While it's convenient that McKenzie just happened to have visited a mining operation and could provide Smith with the exact answers that confirmed her biases, unfortunately he has zero expertise on energy markets,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_response"> demand response</a> programs, power engineering or mining and has no qualifications to inform congress or policy on the matter.</p><p>The idea that Bitcoin mining is an "inefficient" technology and therefore needs the government to reign it in is nonsensical. If it were as inefficient as claimed, there would be no need to stop it, since more efficient technologies would be able to outcompete it and easily replace it. This is precisely the reason we have markets — to let the most efficient and cheapest technologies win over the inefficient and expensive technologies that will fail. Those who are willing to take the risk on those technologies are either rewarded or bear the consequences.</p><p>McKenzie doesn't divulge that<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2003/08/why-texas-has-its-own-power-grid.html"> ERCOT, the Texas grid, is isolated</a> and therefore is required to have excess dispatchable energy for extreme weather events. That excess energy needs to be consumed by large scale flexible customers who are willing to pay for it is an open market when it’s not needed. Buying energy that would otherwise go wasted, for computation, keeps dispatchable energy profitable and officially classifies Bitcoin miners as beneficial<a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/11/29/SARA_Winter2022-23.pdf"> large flexible loads (LFLs)</a> by the ERCOT grid. A<a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/11/29/SARA_Winter2022-23.pdf"> recent ERCOT study</a> showed miners are<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/applied-direct-response-ercot-study-shows-bitcoin-mining-is-beneficial-to-the-texas-grid/"> essential to its demand response strategy</a>. </p><p>As demand response consumers, miners purchase wholesale energy in advance and buy private insurance products that incentivize them to turn off their machines when prices rise during periods of increased consumer demand — thus<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1548550264218583040"> balancing the grid and its prices, while increasing grid reliability</a>. The idea that McKenzie or any critic could isolate escalating power prices to a single consumer in a deregulated wholesale market is extremely dubious. Such a claim ignores the recent <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/natural-gas-prices-tripled-diesel-oil-2021-almost-no-ceiling-2022-5">tripling in natural gas prices</a>, as well as the recent build out of over <a href="https://tppa.com/texas-expected-to-add-10-gw-of-solar-by-2023-according-to-eia/">10 gigawatts of solar power</a> and Texas load growth from non-mining customers, such as the<a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-gigafactory-texas-3k-model-y-per-week/"> Tesla Gigafactory</a>.</p><p>While the Tesla Gigafactory may be considered a more productive use of energy, it is not nearly as<a href="https://youtu.be/TpqoJnpzK9g"> flexible at demand response as miners</a>. Miners<a href="https://www.seetee.io/podcast/s2e10/shaun-connell-bitcoin-mining-is-the-holy-grail-for-power-grids/"> de-risk excess renewable power</a> and will<a href="https://youtu.be/-k0eRTcMJQ4"> instantly shut down for high consumer demand when prices rise</a>. In fact, contrary to what McKenzie claims, The U.S. Department of Energy<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/activities/technology-development/grid-modernization-and-smart-grid/demand-response"> explains that demand response technologies are beneficial</a> for "balancing supply and demand" and says "such programs can lower the cost of electricity in wholesale markets, and in turn, lead to lower retail rates."</p><p>While McKenzie may have come across local residents of Rockdale, Texas who were "upset" about the Whinstone mining operation replacing the town's <a href="https://grist.org/article/rockdale-texas-alcoa-luminant-sandow-lakes-ranch/">abandoned Alcoa aluminum plant</a>. In reality, the new mining facility<a href="https://www.governing.com/community/a-small-town-in-texas-turns-to-bitcoin-mining-to-survive.html"> is a net positive for the struggling community</a>, boosting its economy, local tax collection and<a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2022/11/29/SARA_Winter2022-23.pdf"> grid stability</a>.</p><p>Senator Smith and McKenzie's suggestion that mining becomes "more and more energy intensive over time" is highly misleading and shows a lack of understanding of the technology. Like any publicly-traded commodity<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@customerprotection/documents/file/oceo_bitcoinbasics0218.pdf"> such as bitcoin</a>, the energy required is economically linked to the public's demand for its declining issuance, and unfolds in a highly-competitive open energy market. There is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/03/05/the-frustrating-maddening-all-consuming-bitcoin-energy-debate/">nothing about the technology</a> that requires the consumption of more and more energy over time. Bitcoin's four-year "halving" cycle reduces the rewards that miners receive to purchase energy. In fact, Bitcoin's critics claim that miners <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/interview-vitalik-buterin-creator">may not be able to afford to buy as much energy</a>, decades from now — a topic which is hotly debated. Eventually, critics will need to get their stories straight. Either miners will have the money to purchase energy in the future or they won’t, however, both outcomes cannot be true.</p><p>Using energy to remove the need for <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/proof-of-stake/">equity-based governance</a> is not “bad.” Equity-based governance was a common <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/proof-of-stake/">criticism of proof-of-stake "crypto"</a> networks in the hearing. Using energy for issuance and security is breakthrough technology that has <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1549805288269701120">many applications for energy innovation</a> that we are only just beginning to discover.</p><p>None of the witnesses or senators were even aware, or cared, that Bitcoin is<a href="https://twitter.com/DSBatten/status/1570624374927167489"> on track to becoming CO₂e carbon negative by 2024</a>, by<a href="https://batcoinz.com/quantifying-the-potential-impact-of-bitcoin-mining-on-global-methane-emissions/"> mitigating CH₄ methane emissions</a>.

Or that Bitcoin can bring<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-unlocks-ocean-energy"> clean baseload power to one billion people</a> in developing nations by monetizing stranded pilot plants that would be too expensive to test, prove and scale on a highly-competitive grid.

    </figure><p>The Senate’s thespians don't care that Bitcoin mitigates waste methane emissions<a href="https://twitter.com/denverbitcoin/status/1549693747935461376"> from oil and natural gas exploration</a> where there is no other use for waste CH₄, which would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere and would heavily contribute to warming forces. To them, Bitcoin is "bad" simply because people having the voluntary<em> </em>option for a digital sound money, without counterparty risk, threatens their politics.</p><h2>Professor Allen Fails Bitcoin 101</h2><p>Professor Allen, an <a href="https://www.wcl.american.edu/community/faculty/profile/hjallen/">associate professor at American University Washington College of Law</a>, made a fallacious claim about Bitcoin’s decentralization during her testimony:</p><blockquote><p>"It's not decentralized... Bitcoin is controlled by a few core software developers — fewer than 10. And they can make changes to the software and that software is implemented by mining pools and there's just a few of them."&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1603214594012598273">Professor Hillary J. Allen</a></p></blockquote><p>Allen's assertion is factually incorrect and shows a fundamentally flawed understanding of how Bitcoin works and why it is valued for being extremely difficult to change. Even if you believe that the<a href="https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin-core/people"> project's maintainers</a>, who have the elevated commit and publishing privileges, could persuade the largest mining pools to support their own whims, they would still need to persuade a majority of the world's independent miners to stay loyal to existing mining pools. Creating new competing pools <a href="https://bestfinancier.com/how-to-create-your-own-mining-pool/">is trivial</a> and any software update supported by pools that miners disagreed with could easily be avoided by creating new pools for defectors to join.</p><p>And what if miners unanimously supported a software update that users didn't want? In 2017, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/786sfo/if_rbitcoin_are_apposing_segwit2x_why_has_it/">83% of the global hash rate</a> attempted to force an update to increase Bitcoin's block size and failed because the users, who are actually responsible for propagating and interacting with the Bitcoin network through their own full nodes, refused to install the new software. The Bitcoin network simply doesn't exist or propagate without the user nodes, so miners defecting to their own network is pointless unless they convince users to come with them. The history of this critical test for Bitcoin was carefully documented by Jonathan Bier in his book, "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM">The Blocksize War: The Battle Over Who Controls Bitcoin’s Protocol Rules</a>."</p><p>Running a full node<a href="https://thebitcoinmanual.com/behind-btc/nodes/full-node/"> is fairly easy</a>. At minimum, all it takes is a hard drive, a Raspberry Pi and an internet connection. Since Bitcoin updates with soft forks (backwards-compatible software updates), users who find themselves in the minority always have the <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9mm9uem3k?t=343">right to dissent</a> and oppose contentious updates by just continuing to run the software with the rules they signed up for. Additionally, even if the entire Bitcoin Core team went rogue, users would be able to install <a href="https://bitcoin.eu/bitcoin-core-alternatives-dont-fork-blockchain/">alternative competing clients in their nodes</a>, without forking the blockchain.</p><p>Other so-called innovative “crypto” projects use <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ethereum-is-coercive-bitcoin-is-not">coercive techniques to force updates</a> while they try to rapidly innovate like software companies. No other project offers the kind of user rights that Bitcoin offers. As such, there is no incentive for Bitcoin users to run a fork that fundamentally changes Bitcoin's properties — its resistance to change is the core value proposition that its users are drawn to and demand. </p><p>Is it plausible that Bitcoin could be tested again and fail the same test in the future? Of course. But for Professor Allen to ignore the fact that users ultimately decide Bitcoin's fate — as well as its well-documented history proving its resilience to unwanted changes from miners and developers — shows Allen was either woefully unprepared to be discussing such technical aspects of Bitcoin or is intentionally misleading senators and the public with her testimony.</p><h2>A Performance Of Misinformation</h2><p>If anything was evident from the hearing, it was that there was zero effort to ascertain nuance or truth — the hearing was political theater. Unfortunately, having an undergraduate degree in economics, or reaching the higher echelons of<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-does-academia-have-a-bias-against-bitcoin"> Bitcoin-resenting academia</a>, does not automatically qualify one to have the expertise to inform the Senate on how Bitcoin works. If only it were that easy. Understanding Bitcoin requires an open, multidisciplinary mind and hours upon hours of research just to begin scratching the surface. Perhaps Kanye West's recent public statement on Bitcoin could have gone a long way for McKenzie and Allen.</p><blockquote><p>"As far as Bitcoin, I'm just not knowledgeable enough to speak on that subject."&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://twitter.com/BTCGandalf/status/1584085032523530241">Kanye West</a></p></blockquote><p>Warren's rapid-fire question and answer session with Allen<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1603873902211522562"> showed Allen nervously reading, verbatim, pre-scripted answers to Warren's questions</a>. McKenzie on the other hand had the discipline to memorize and perform his lines with poise and confidence. If only they each had the expertise required to address the U.S Senate Banking Committee on Bitcoin — a technology that quite literally enables self custody and solves the breaches of trust that the hearing was ostensibly concerned with.</p><p>While Allen, McKenzie and the senators who invited them to testify were eager to perform their anti-technology, anti-free speech propaganda, the rest of the world is capitalizing Bitcoin for energy innovation. Just last week, Japan's<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tepco-to-mine-bitcoin-with-excess-power"> TEPCO announced it is mining Bitcoin with surplus energy</a>. And now Russia is <a href="https://cryptonewsland.com/russia-to-pass-bill-legalizing-bitcoin-btc-mining/">set to pass a bill</a> to legalize Bitcoin mining. Meanwhile, a distinguished U.S. national defense fellow is <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery/status/1594475293275656192">advising the White House on the strategic benefits of Bitcoin</a>.</p><p>Whether the hearings participants realized they were being manipulated by politicians or not, participating in political theater means they are normalizing the loss of privacy rights as they lobby for legislation to limit the right to<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-journey-to-self-custody-bitcoin"> self custody</a> digital property and<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/dids-built-on-bitcoin-fix-the-web"> one's identity</a>. Such action not only empowers governments to enact greater monitoring controls, install social credit systems and strip personal freedoms, but it also exposes consumers to the prying eyes of corporations and any hackers that can infiltrate highly-centralized data. Ironically, such restrictions will empower their<a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1552313697736998914"> political opponents</a> when our political pendulums invariably swing in the other direction.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1603084958502903814"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>While those unfamiliar with Bitcoin may believe they are siding with a morally superior government, Satoshi Nakamoto's invention is seen by many as <a href="https://youtu.be/Amcj-IKmGKA?t=949">American technology</a> that<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-the-american-idea"> digitally enshrines personal freedoms afforded to Americans by the Founding Fathers</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, Warren is headed in the opposite direction. She recently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/business/elizabeth-warren-bipartisan-crypto-crackdown/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twCNN&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_content=2022-12-14T11%3A54%3A07">introduced a bipartisan bill</a> with Senator Roger Marshall to aggressively close crypto money laundering loopholes by imposing Orwellian controls on all users. The bill seeks to make self-custody technology illegal — a dangerous policy that would expose Americans to <a href="https://twitter.com/ODELL/status/1603078096097255424">mandated government surveillance</a> and only increase the chances of the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ftx-founder-indicted-fraud-money-laundering-and-campaign-finance-offenses">fraud</a> that FTX committed against its users when funds were rehypothecated and stolen through their custodial platform. Stopping this kind of fraud was what the hearing was supposed to be about and is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-helps-users-avoid-the-downfall-of-ftx">exactly the kind of protection that Bitcoin already empowers through self custody</a>.</p><p>Warren <a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1603033907968049154">argues</a> that “rogue nations, oligarchs and drug lords are using crypto to launder billions, evade sanctions and finance terrorism.” This is <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/articles/bitcoin-wont-save-russia-from-western-sanctions">fear mongering</a>. The reality is that public, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/haileylennon/2021/01/19/the-false-narrative-of-bitcoins-role-in-illicit-activity/">immutable ledgers are too transparent for most crimes</a>. Physical <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cash-still-king-criminals-prefer-cash-for-money-laundering">cash is far better</a>. Firms that do on-chain analysis for law enforcement have <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-Crypto-Crime-Report.html">documented that cryptocurrency usage for criminal activity is rather low</a> and is trending downwards. Warren’s eagerness to make self-custody technology illegal would be like banning the internet because phishing scams exist.</p><blockquote><p>"Regardless, the good news is two-fold: Cryptocurrency-related crime is falling, and it still remains a small part of the overall cryptocurrency economy."&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-Crypto-Crime-Report.html">The Chainalysis 2022 Crypto Crime Report</a></p></blockquote><p>However, this is not to say that crypto doesn’t have a problem with fraud. To Allen and McKenzie's credit, 99.99% of the "crypto" market is indeed scams, and they should be commended for calling them out. Yet, to blindly call Satoshi Nakamoto's invention a scam shows a lack of critical thinking and expertise. To attack Bitcoin — an open, global and neutral economic protocol layer for the internet<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI4xEHI7tGg"> with no issuer</a> and no central control — simply because one does not like it or understand it, shows a lack of humility and unwillingness to recognize<a href="https://hrf.org/why-bitcoin-matters-for-freedom/"> real-world benefits</a> with an open mind.</p><p>If they are willing to engage in thoughtful and meaningful discussion, Professor Allen and Mr. McKenzie would likely find a lot of common ground with members of the Bitcoin community, who<a href="https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1597254469750001664"> commonly criticize the scams</a> as well as the <a href="https://tomerstrolight.medium.com/bitcoiners-are-not-toxic-they-have-integrity-bd866d2773e9">lack of ethics and integrity that pervade the industry</a>. If not, it suggests they have an agenda.</p><p>If the U.S. Senate Banking Committee has any desire to preserve freedoms and keep the United States from falling behind other nations, it would do well to seek out actual experts who <a href="https://youtu.be/eAIR83im8Us">work in Bitcoin mining</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/TpqoJnpzK9g">energy markets</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZpKa1fzEKr4">those who are using its layered payments architecture</a> to build the next generation of commerce. Political theater will only cause the U.S. to fall further behind the rest of the world in all of these areas.</p><p>Alas, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, led by <a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1603033907968049154">Warren’s disdain for technology</a>, seems more interested in preserving the power of big banks and <a href="https://twitter.com/ODELL/status/1603078096097255424">mandating government surveillance</a>. Progressives, such as Warren, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/elizabeth-warren-progressives-should-love-bitcoin">should love Bitcoin</a> as an open payment rail that empowers the freedom of economic expression, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/wealth-gap-black-america-bitcoin">financial inclusion</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/elizabeth-warren-ironic-war-on-bitcoin">circumvents predatory banking practices</a> — something that <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1552313697736998914">progressives might one day find themselves in need of</a>. </p><p>Instead, they appear to be flirting with the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/cbdcs-orwellian-new-world-order">authoritarian playbook of China and its social credit system</a>. Perhaps it’s just as well that the committee was misinformed by its unqualified witnesses, as they now have no idea <a href="https://twitter.com/tatumturnup/status/1605048106848075778">how to stop a technology that manifests itself as free speech</a>. Information wants to be free, a lesson the United States and its misinformed senators will need to learn one way or another.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Level39.

Though I don't agree with its conclusion or reasoning, the fact that traditional outlets were asking questions like that was a massive signal that perhaps the normies are starting to catch on. </p><p>More recently, the Iranian government announced that it would be <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/iran-set-to-freeze-bank-accounts-of-women-who-refuse-to-wear-a-hijab">freezing the bank accounts</a> of women who refuse to wear hijabs, traditional Muslim head covering, in public. This came after the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/11/iran-stop-sentencing-peaceful-protesters-death-say-un-experts">threat of imprisonments and executions</a> in order to quell ongoing protests for the freedom of expression there. As of December 8, 2022, one protester had already been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-first-execution-protests-rcna60703">executed by hanging</a> by the Iranian government. </p><p>The fact is, nobody is going to save you. Ethereum insists on being the new decentralized money of the internet, and yet, the protocol is enforcing Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/ethereum-opac-compliant-blocks-in-decline-after-touching-80/">sanctions</a> on its base layer. It’s becoming pretty clear that Bitcoin is perhaps the only easily-transportable freedom money left. I think this distinction became all the more clear as 2022 continued. </p><h2>The Altcoin Bonanza Goes Down in Flames</h2><blockquote><p>“The same technology that allows for peer-to-peer money has allowed for peer-to-peer scams.”</p><p>–<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2oTSvVlzamB9aG1KvtZU0w?si=-4qKTAbYRNKxp-NibQTuvg">Lyn Alden, “Swan Signal” episode 92</a></p></blockquote><p>From <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a>, to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">Three Arrows Capital</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/lfg-bitcoin-reserves-at-risk">Luna</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy">BlockFi</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/voyager-digital-files-for-bankruptcy">Voyager</a>, and <a href="https://futurism.com/winklevoss-twins-crypto-exchange-halts-withdrawals">even Gemini</a>, companies that deal in altcoins all felt pain in one form or another — Leverage, rehypothecation, algorithmic Ponzi schemes and the like. It seems to be that the biggest use case for crypto is making a quick buck at the expense of others, while rug pulling normies as your exit liquidity. It’s like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">1990s tech boom</a> all over again. </p><p>One of the most interesting parts of this whole debacle were the accusations of a <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ftx-leaked-balance-sheet-visualized/">lack of bitcoin held at FTX</a> after its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2022/12/12/centralized-exchanges-like-sam-bankman-frieds-ftx-arent-needed-for-bitcoin-to-thrive/?sh=69a499f97e90">balance sheet was revealed in bankruptcy filings</a>. Whether or not the accusations are true, the fact that it’s a legitimate question is illuminating. It appears to have sparked a fire. I think, slowly but surely, people are starting to see the difference and realize that Bitcoin and crypto really aren’t the same things after all.</p><h2>The Turning Point Of 2023</h2><p>Bitcoin has differentiated itself not only from the traditional banking system in a meaningful way, but from crypto as well. </p><p>The FTX debacle has highlighted the necessity for self custody: that your coins may not actually exist and the only way to find out if they’re real is to take custody. Bitcoin is now <a href="https://worldnewsera.com/news/finance/stock-market/investors-withdraw-record-levels-of-coins-from-crypto-exchanges/">leaving exchanges</a> in droves.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Could this be a turning point for Bitcoin? Could people be waking up to the importance of self custody en masse? Only time will tell. I am optimistic that this trend will continue, taking the power from centralized exchanges and their ability to enforce censorship on behalf of hostile regimes. As far as I’m concerned, the more bitcoin in self custody, the better. </p><p>If you’re still hesitant to take self custody I recommend watching some <a href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UChzLnWVsl3puKQwc5PoO6Zg">BTC Sessions</a> demonstrations. It’s really not that difficult and the peace of mind is priceless. I nearly <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/multisignature-for-the-nontechnical-bitcoiner">lost everything</a> earlier this year when Celsius blew up. Don’t be like me. Stop procrastinating and take possession of your bitcoin today. Only then will you truly understand why and how it’s different. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

As <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/brazil-approves-use-of-bitcoin-as-payment">previously reported</a>, the new rules recognize bitcoin as a digital representation of value that can be used as a means of payment and as an investment asset in the South American nation.</p><p>A virtual asset is "a digital representation of value that can be negotiated or transferred electronically and used for payments or as an investment," per the bill’s text.</p><p>The new law, which goes into effect 180 days after today’s signature, does not make bitcoin or any cryptocurrency a legal tender in the country. Notwithstanding, the legitimacy conferred upon BTC’s use case as payment is meaningful, and has the potential to spur greater activity in the country. The extent to which that happens, however, is dependent on the actions of the regulator in charge.</p><p>The executive branch will select the government bodies that will oversee the market. The expectation is that the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) will be in charge when bitcoin is used as payment, while the country’s securities and exchange commission (CVM) will be the watchdog when it is used as an investment asset. Both the BCB and the CVM, along with the federal tax authority (RFB), helped lawmakers craft the overhaul legislation.</p><p>If the BCB gets confirmed as the sector’s watchdog, the outlook isn’t the best. While the regulator can’t override the aforementioned definition of a virtual asset determined by the law, there is little reason to believe that the BCB will go out of its way to push greater adoption of bitcoin as payment. Its President Roberto Campos Neto has said multiple times that he doesn’t see cryptocurrencies as a great alternative to fiat payments, citing mainly volatility. More importantly, the BCB is working to release its own digital currency, the Real Digital, which is currently planned to go live by 2024.</p><p>But the greater regulatory clarity given by the legislation encourages businesses to explore the burgeoning payment method more closely. This, in turn, can translate into more widespread adoption of bitcoin as a medium of exchange in Brazil, irrespective of whether an active endorsement by the BCB comes or not.</p><p><br><em>Read a detailed breakdown of the legislation </em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/heres-whats-in-brazils-crypto-bill"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MTAxMTcwMzk2OTk3Mjk3/26812213289_f460d63e07_k.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[CoinCorner Partners With Pouch To Bring Instant Remittance Payments To The Philippines Utilizing Bitcoin's Lightning Network]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Philippines’ remittance market now has a faster, cheaper option through the use of the Lightning Network.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/coincorner-pouch-bring-send-globally-to-philippines</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/coincorner-pouch-bring-send-globally-to-philippines</guid><category><![CDATA[Philippines]]></category><category><![CDATA[CoinCorner]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Remittances]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxOTg4NDM3NTk3ODg5OTkx/20220830_better-the-four-pillars-of-bitcoin-adoption---stefan-ristic.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The Philippines’ remittance market now has a faster, cheaper option through the use of the Lightning Network.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Customers in the U.K. and Europe can now use CoinCorner’s Send Globally feature to transfer funds to the Philippines after partnering with Pouch, a Lightning service provider based in the Southeast Asian country.</p><p>Send Globally utilizes the Lightning Network to convert one fiat currency into bitcoin, which is then sent over the Lightning Network to a receiving entity which converts the bitcoin into another fiat currency, effectively making global payments instant. <br><br>Send Globally was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-enables-instant-fiat-transfers-to-africa">recently</a> enacted for both <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-enables-instant-fiat-transfers-to-africa">CoinCorner</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/strike-launches-instant-african-remittances">Strike</a> through partnerships with Bitnob.

This simultaneously introduced a new mixing tool as well as the first wallet to implement a new second-layer scaling solution. The team built off of Ruben Somsen's original statechain proposal with some changes to make it work without the needed <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-sighash-anyprevout-and-eltoo-could-improve-the-lightning-network">ANYPREVOUT/Eltoo sighash flag</a>, and integrated a new CoinSwap design to allow users to mix multiple times without needing to transact on chain for each mix. </p><h2>Background</h2><p>To just quickly summarize for those who didn't read my previous piece: a statechain is an off-chain mechanism for transferring freely between anyone completely off-chain. The original owner/user collaborates with a statechain operator to construct a ECDSA-MPC address where the private key is sharded with one half held by the user and the other half by the operator, then a timelocked, pre-signed withdrawal transaction is created and signed, with the operator before sending funds to the new address. </p><p>Neither side fully controls the private key, and the user has a pre-signed transaction that allows them to unilaterally take the coins back after the timelock. When the user wishes to transfer the statechain, they notify the operator who then collaborates with the receiver. The receiver and operator generate a new set of private key shares that correspond with the same address, and generate a new pre-signed transaction with a lower timelock than the last one, and then the operator deletes their old keyshare. </p><p>The way the cryptography works, the operator's new keyshare will only work with the new user's keyshare, so if they delete the old one, it is not even possible for them to collaborate with the old user to spend the coins. Also, with the newer withdrawal transaction having a lower timelock, that transaction can always be confirmed before the prior owner's. This limits the number of times the statechain can be transferred before it has to be closed, but if the operator acts honestly, this prevents older owners from stealing funds. </p><h2>A Lightning Channel On Top of A Statechain</h2><p>Commerceblock is now working on a <a href="https://github.com/commerceblock/blip-XXXX/blob/main/blip-XXXX.md">new BLIP</a> (Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal) to implement a design for something proposed in Somsen’s initial statechain proposal: establishing a Lightning channel on top of a statechain.</p><p>One of the shortcomings of a statechain by itself is that the entire UTXO has to be transferred at once. If, however, the statechain withdrawal transaction spends into a Lightning channel instead of a single user's address, then fractions of the statechain can be transferred through the initial balance distribution in a channel and that channel can be used conventionally to make Lightning payments afterward. </p><p>The process first begins with a user creating a statechain. The creator and operator go through the normal process of creating the sharded key and signing a backup withdrawal transaction with a timelock, then the creator (Alice) finds a counterparty (Bob) that will accept statechains. Alice and Bob engage in the same protocol used to create a sharded key that Alice did with the statechain operator and generate their own shared key. Both of them then share both the cumulative public key and their individual public key shares to the statechain operator. This allows the operator to challenge both of them to individually sign and prove that they agree on the current balance for cooperative closes without waiting for the statechain withdrawal timelock to expire. </p><p>From here, with Bob's authorization, Alice and the statechain operator sign a transaction directly spending the statechain into the Lightning channel multisig and handle the Lightning channel transaction creation. At this point, the statechain address is still controlled by just Alice and the operator but the transaction opening a Lightning channel is now in Bob's possession with a lower timelock than the original statechain withdrawal, guaranteeing it can be confirmed before Alice can unilaterally close the statechain to herself. Then Alice and Bob finalize the protocol by completing one last update with the statechain entity, creating a final statechain transaction with a further decremented timelock using their combined key with the operator's to make a withdrawal transaction that spends the funds to the Lightning channel. They can both now advertise the Lightning channel as open and the protocol is complete.</p><h2>Improving The Utility Of Statechains</h2><p>This proposal would greatly improve the utility of a statechain by loosening the strict liquidity dynamics of how they work. Whenever someone would be willing to accept a statechain but the denomination doesn't match the payment, the sender can simply open a Lightning channel between them instead and wait until they need to spend the rest of the funds (or wind up receiving what they sent back) to finalize a transfer of the entire statechain balance. Such a possibility not only increases the utility of a statechain, but also increases the utility of the Lightning Network if properly supported. </p><p>Channel rebalancing is a necessity for nodes on the network, both routing nodes as well as edge nodes simply sending and receiving transactions. When funds flow completely to one side of a channel, it makes the channel useless for passing payments in one direction (if all of the money is on your side, then you can't receive payments; if it's on the other side, then you can't send payments). This necessitates shuffling money from one channel to another, which also contributes to unbalancing the channels along the way to rebalance your own. Eventually this dynamic gets to a point where things must actually be rebalanced by swapping funds between Lightning and the base layer on-chain. </p><p>Statechains allow liquidity to be moved around with the same freedom provided by doing so on-chain, without needing to create the on-chain footprint or pay fees for it. Say you have a depleted channel, with all of the liquidity on the other side leaving you, no spending capacity and you also have a statechain. That statechain can be freely transferred to anyone who will accept it, and it can even have a Lightning channel on top of it if you aren't sending the entire value, and it can be used to rebalance funds in your regular channel on your side. </p><p>This allows for much more efficiency in terms of how many channels you have to route through in order to rebalance your channel (remember, you are contributing to shifting the balances of every other channel you route through), in the best case literally sending it directly to the same peer that you have the channel that you are rebalancing open with. If you wish to close a channel with one peer and open it with another, you can even rebalance things so you have all of the balance of the channel and move it entirely off-chain to the new peer if it is built on top of a statechain. </p><h2>The Future Of Statechains And Lightning</h2><p>Discussing their plans going forward, Nicolas Gregory from Commerceblock said: "Our goal is to establish a standardized approach for combining statechains and Lightning technology in order to facilitate off-chain balancing of Lightning channels through the use of state channels. This specification will serve as the foundation for achieving this objective." </p><p>From the very beginning, statechains were always proposed to interact with Lightning in order to solve the issue of using them by themselves: that you must transfer the entire value of the whole UTXO. They also provide a degree of flexibility to Lightning that it does not have on its own in terms of how liquidity is managed and transferred around the network. </p><p>Now that Lightning is at a healthy stage in its early growth, and a concrete implementation of statechains has existed for over a year, it's time to start considering how these two technologies can interact together. Lightning as a network is a system for atomically-escrowing transfers between two parties that are not directly connected on the network graph. How each connection on that graph works, strictly speaking, should not matter to senders and receivers of payments, as long as it works. </p><p>Statechains and Lightning channels both have a lot to offer each other in terms of benefits, all that needs to be done is to work out standardizing the two interacting with each other. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shinobi.

I will use specific people’s quotes for my examples, but my intent is to respectfully challenge ideas, not attack people. Healthy debate of ideas in good faith helps Bitcoin, so I hope they understand.</em></p><p>In Gigi’s article, “<a href="https://dergigi.com/2021/12/30/the-freedom-of-value/">The Freedom of Value</a>,” he breaks down what’s broken with the monetization of information, “The problem with the internet is that information wants to be free.”</p><p>As a content creator, in my case a writer, this problem with the internet hits home. It’s a lot of work to write good content, and I don’t work for free. I look to be compensated for my proof-of-work. As the Joker says, “If you’re good at something, never do it for free.”</p><p>Gigi breaks down the problem of just trying to sell information (like a written book/article) behind a paywall into two distinct reasons, the “MTX problem” (Mental Transaction problem) and the “DRM paradox” (Digital Rights Management paradox).</p><p>I acknowledge the “DRM paradox” has no solution: “content will only stay locked behind paywalls if it sucks. If it's good, it will be set free.”</p><p>Additionally, Gigi explains: “The MTX problem, with MTX being short for ‘mental transaction,’ refers to the problem of irreducible mental transaction costs inherent to every transaction. Every time you hit a paywall, you have to make a conscious decision: ‘Do I want to pay for that?’”</p><p>Since Gigi “believe[s] that the MTX problem is a bigger deal than the DRM paradox,” that will be the focus of this article. Gigi acknowledges the traditional solution to spare the consumer of the headache of mental transactions is the subscription model, but then so many different subscriptions are needed for exclusive content that it becomes impractical again.</p><p>With an open mind, willing to see not just black and white but entertain shades of gray, please consider how lightning microtransactions, deployed the right way, can work towards solving the mental transaction problem. As <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/micropayments.html">Nick Szabo</a> states:</p><p>“A micropayments system assumes a solution to the mental accounting problem. If somebody could actually solve this problem … the savings would be enormous even in existing business ... not to mention all the new possibilities possible by lower transaction costs.”</p><p>To begin, why do people enjoy just outright buying a book? <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf">Nick Szabo</a> answers this concisely: “A flat fee constitutes an embedded, implicit insurance contract.”</p><p>When I offer my ebook at a flat price, the reader is safe. They know they own it and can read it at their leisure. However, this flat price creates a barrier to entry. It becomes all-or-nothing if they want to read the ebook. But if I break this barrier into pieces, and make each chapter a mini paywall pay-per-click lightning transaction, then the reader only pays for what they enjoy! </p><p>Enter: the pay-as-you-enjoy model. If the reader enjoys the chapter, they can pay-per-click to read the next one, and the next one. If they’re done reading before having reached the end, they’ll have spared themselves from having to pay to read the whole book. It wasn’t all-or-nothing!</p><p>Through pay-as-you-enjoy, the reader loses the insurance that I won’t increase the cost per chapter as they continue to read through the book over time, but hold onto that thought for a bit.</p><p>Nick Szabo points out the flaws of the pay-per-click monetization model: “There has been floating for a while the idea of ‘pay per click,’ a micropayment for every click on the Web to pay its owner for content. However, since there has been no chance to browse the content, there is no way to directly ascertain whether it meets tacit preferences: there is no accurate customer observable explicit preference. Browsing a preview or book cover is still inaccurate, and entails increasing mental costs the more accurate it is.”</p><p>Again, I’m building towards a solution to the mental transaction problem. “Attribute observation costs” are still present, and that’s ok. There’s no attribute observation cost in Value4Value because the reader can keep reading without paying anything at all. No cost per click. Even still, Value4Value confronts the same final problem that pay-as-you-enjoy tackles head-on. As Nick Szabo concludes:</p><p>“Assuming, for the moment, perfect information on the product at hand, and no uncertainty as to future cash flows, a third and more basic source of customer cognitive cost remains, namely the cost of making decisions with a large, but nevertheless very incomplete, set of alternatives.”</p><p>Even if the reader already knew everything about the content, and knew for sure their budget, how can they know for certain they should spend their money on this instead of something else?</p><p>In practice, consumers just make decisions because they have to. The mental transaction problem persists because they’re either deciding whether to give value back once they’ve finished reading, or they’re freed of this because they’ve already spent the money to read the work in the first place. </p><p>Value4Value is just delaying the mental transaction problem until after the reader has finished reading. As <a href="https://value4value.info/pieces/the-ask/">Adam Curry</a> explains, “<em>The Ask</em> is the most important piece of the puzzle. The #1 reason why people do not give to charities and the like is because they weren’t asked, and the same is true for the Value4Value model.”</p><p>Since part of the Value4Value loop is “The Ask,” it hasn’t fixed the “costly decision making” piece of the Mental Transaction Problem. Versus pay-as-you-enjoy, my readers can finish reading and feel good that they’ve paid a price I felt was fair, rather than wrestle internally on who to support.</p><p>In fact, with lightning, I think we’ve come close to solving the intelligent agent problem <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/micropayments.html">Nick Szabo</a> describes:</p><p>“There seems here to be a fundamental cognitive bottleneck. One proposed solution to this has been "intelligent agents". But since these agents are programmed remotely, not by the consumer, it is difficult for the consumer to determine whether the agent is acting the consumers' best interests, or in the best interests of the counterparty -- perhaps, necessarily, at least as difficult as reading the corresponding full statement of charges. Furthermore, the user interface to enable consumers to simply express their sophisticated preferences to an agent is lacking, and may represent another fundamental cognitive bottleneck.”</p><p>Nick describes an “intelligent agent” as someone the consumer delegates to make purchases on their behalf - sparing them the headache - but then they still have to explain to the agent what they enjoy. As part of pay-as-you-enjoy, once the consumer sets up their budget (their “flat fee” insurance mentioned above), they are free to engage in pay-per-click reading without worry about overspending! This agent which deducts sats per click is not programmed remotely, but by the consumer. Moreover, the consumer sees the author’s monetary policy up front when they set their budget. They know the price per chapter, but also how much to spend to get one month of free access - an incentive to give the author what they see as the full value for their work! The pay-as-you-enjoy user interface is slick. The consumer sets their budget and then it’s pay-per-click!</p><p>Nick Szabo summarizes the MTX problem as the following:</p><p>“We have seen how customer mental transaction costs can derive from at least three sources: uncertain cash flows, incomplete and costly observation of product attributes, and incomplete and costly decision making. These costs will increasingly dominate the technological costs of payment systems, setting a limit on the granularity of bundling and pricing. Prices don't come for free.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In the table above, they are tied.

Integrity over revenue," Youssef said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/raypaxful/status/1605529289054527488">tweet</a>, calling on fellow exchange runners to follow suit.</p><p>A screenshot of Youssef’s statement to clients accompanied the tweet. The text provided more details as to why the CEO chose to remove ETH from his P2P exchange. Youssef mentioned three overarching reasons for kicking Ethereum out: its move to proof-of-stake (PoS), a lack of decentralization, and the ever-growing dissemination of scams in its ecosystem.</p><p>Ethereum will be officially off the platform by 12:00 UTC, December 22. Paxful will maintain stablecoins up for trades, however, as Youssef claimed they have "real use cases."</p><p>Youssef argued that PoW is the innovation in Bitcoin and what enables it to be "the <em>only</em> honest money there is." The consensus mechanism that is often touted as an alternative to PoW, PoS, "has rendered ETH essentially a digital form of fiat," the executive added.</p><p>Next, the CEO of Paxful delved into the decentralization aspect of Ethereum, denouncing the small group of insiders who manage to exert enormous influence on the cryptocurrency project to this day.</p><p>Finally, Youssef explained that while "ETH had some utility on real use cases, such as credit and lending," it "thrives because of tokenization." Such a reality, he continued, has led to "scams that have robbed people of billions."</p><p>"They have stolen valuable momentum away from Bitcoin and cost us years on our mission."</p><p>"In short, our industry is under attack right now –– which means our responsibility to protect our users is greater than ever before," Youssef said in the statement. "We are not perfect, but we’ll always do the right thing, even if it’s not popular, and even if it costs us money. The pay off for all humanity will be so great that the billions scammers have stolen via tokens will seem like pennies in comparison."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3NzkxOTgxMTM1NTU1/paxful-announcement.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Remnant Returns: Bitcoin Is Right]]></title><description><![CDATA[Virtue signaling and altruistic positions on Bitcoin are a farce.

Choose Bitcoin because it’s right, not because you’re here to “help others.”</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Aleks Svetski, author of “</em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B837FN63"><em>The UnCommunist Manifesto</em></a><em>,” founder of The Bitcoin Times and Host of the “Wake Up Podcast with Svetski.” It is part four of his “</em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/the-remnant"><em>Remnant Series</em></a><em>.”</em></p><p>I grew up as an extreme empath. But the last few years have radicalized me and made me cold, dissociated and distant toward much of the world and its hordes of mindless inhabitants.</p><p>I traveled to 20 countries during 2020 to 2022, and no matter where I went, I was surrounded by compliant lemmings who either lacked the intelligence to recognize blatant lies, or the courage to call them out, or who were simply devoid of the dignity necessary to stand up for what is true and self-evident.</p><p>What’re more, I have seen a growing number of these creatures simply abdicate all responsibility and fill this vacuum with an ever-increasing diet of sludge for the mind (like Netflix, CNBC, Disney and Facebook), body (sugar water, seed oils, sunscreen and injection subscriptions) and soul (Scientism, Communism, Reddit Atheism and Moral Relativism).</p><p>It’s as disgusting as it is pathetic.</p><p>It is everything that our ancestors hoped we as humans would not become. Rivers of blood were literally spilled by those who came before us in order to build civilization from the soil of the earth itself. It is now being consumed by mindless zombies roaming around aimlessly, virtue signaling about their medical compliance paperwork, their gender dysphoria and their nihilism.</p><p>There is no more dignity in the mind, body or soul of the mindless masses. There is only emptiness. The <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=NPC">NPC</a> is real, and <em>it</em> is everywhere.</p><p>As such, I am no longer under the illusion that I am in Bitcoin for “the good of the masses.” No. Fuck that.</p><p>I do not care about the masses. I am in Bitcoin because it is right. Because it is just. Because it is sound. Because it is true.</p><p>I am in Bitcoin because it is the best thing I can do for me and my family and it is what any self-respecting individual would do. A dignified individual would not degrade themselves to the level of modern serf by trading the product of their blood, sweat, time and tears for digital Monopoly money issued by parasites.</p><p>It’s an absolutely ridiculous state of affairs that both our ancestors and forebears will be embarrassed by.</p><p>I doubt anyone with a sense of self would go and work all week at a cafe only to be paid in coffee grounds, or build a business only to sell products and services for mere hugs and high fives. </p><p>If you’re not accepting or demanding payment in bitcoin, or at least swapping out your surplus toilet paper money in exchange for bitcoin savings, then I don’t know what you’re doing.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Fair</h2><p>I am in Bitcoin because it is fair, and I want to play a fair game because it’s the <em>only</em> way to truly satisfy my soul. My pursuit in life is to become the best version of myself and to do so requires that I contend with my opponents on a battlefield with transparent rules of engagement.</p><p>To become better, I must play a fair game, not some rigged stupidity where I “win” because the other guy had his hands tied behind his back. There is neither honor nor dignity in that. One does not get better nor advance by cheating. That’s what the plutocrats and parasites do not understand, that’s why they are inferior, and that’s why they will forever be bitter and envious of the natural elite.</p><p>The parasites who run the central banking and planning offices of the globalist cabals are not “elite.”</p><p>They are pathetic worms who cannot compete, so they spend their entire lives cheating. The price they pay for winning a fake prize is a soulless existence, and cheap, frivolous obedience from the mindless masses.</p><p>They earn no respect or reverence from those who count, and they will go to their graves hated and irrelevant. Imagine living a life as pathetic as that: To be literally hated by anyone that matters, and obeyed by everyone who doesn’t matter. It’s quite sad, actually.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is For Anyone, But For Everyone</h2><p>Much to the chagrin of many of the egalitarian ilk of Bitcoiners, I do not believe that Bitcoin will “help” the masses of the world in the short term, nor is it likely to do so in the medium term. </p><p>The world is likely to continue to bifurcate in the coming decade(s), and largely be defined by the Bitcoiners and no-coiners (which includes shitcoiners and fiat maxis). Of course there will be sub-categories, and we always have the third class, known as parasites, as described in parts one and three of this Remnant Series, but for simplicity, let’s just think about it as the following image:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDY3NDM1NTQ0MzIzNzYx/freedom-vs-slavery.png" height="621" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The latter, the no-coiners, are the masses, and if anything, they will walk right into their central bank digital currency (CBDC) gulags with smiles on their faces (which won’t be visible behind their three-layer face diapers), and the continued monetisation of Bitcoin will actually <em>impoverish</em> them, relatively speaking.</p><p>The purchasing power of their fake money, coupled with the continued deterioration of their health and their productivity will mean that, in comparison to bitcoin-denominated strongholds, filled with healthy, strong, dignified and productive people, their relative wealth will crater.</p><p>They are categorically fucked, along with their parasitic overlords who they blindly worship. </p><p>And rightly so. I’m here for it. There is nothing more moral than a fair game, with just consequences borne by the actors themselves. You want to walk into the lava? By all means do so, but it’s <em>you</em> who burns. I won’t be jumping in to save you. In fact, I won’t even know, because I’ll be too busy building the walls around my citadel to keep your dumb ass out.</p><p>Bitcoin is the come-to-Jesus moment for all of humanity and mark my words: </p><p><em>In the short term, it will hurt more people than it helps, but in the long run, it will save us all.</em></p><p>Bitcoin is the long-term cure for a cancerous civilization that is eating itself alive. Every short-term opium hit that was injected to help obfuscate reality has led us down this path, step by step. We have weakened the corpus of humanity through this short-termism. Bitcoin changes this and will wreak havoc in the immediate future, in exchange for a much brighter, fairer and truer long-term future.</p><h2>But Aleks, Why Are You Such An Asshole?</h2><p>I’m not here to bring you sunshine and roses, or blow smoke up your butthole. There are British podcasters available for such deeds. </p><p>I’m here to preach <em>reality</em>.</p><p>I seek not to be a preacher for the masses, <em>but for the Remnant.</em> Despite my inherent empathy, I no longer care for the welfare of those who have neither the respect, courage nor dignity to care for it themselves.</p><p>I will help those who choose to help themselves first, but I will not be a martyr for the masses. I will not jump into the lava to save the lemmings. I will no longer sacrifice my time helping the unhelpable, when I could be using it to provide for my wife, my family and those who have first sought to help themselves.</p><p>I’m in Bitcoin for me, for those I love and, most importantly, because it is <em>right</em>.</p><p>Believe it or not, <em>you</em> are in it for the same reasons. You’re most likely just ashamed of admitting it, so you sugarcoat your own naturally-selfish, honorable desire with some fake, politically correct “crusade for the unfortunate.”</p><p>Please. Stop bullshitting me. I can see right through you.</p><p>The only people wanting to “altruistically” help others are either wolves in sheeps’ clothing, liars or the do-gooders who put their noses in everyone’s business. You know, that loser you didn’t invite or ask for an opinion, but who came to your house to tell you how you should run it. People like Bill Gates, Yuval Harari or Sam Harris. The kinds of walking turd most likely to become a Statist, Communist, intellectual or bureaucrat.</p><p>They project their own inadequacies on the rest of the world and proceed to push their flavor of “help” onto everyone under the often naively-believed guise of “helping the disadvantaged.”</p><p>I do not subscribe to such frauds. </p><p>A human with dignity helps himself and his family first. He extends that if it makes sense, but he does <em>not</em> impose that help. He does not meddle, and he leaves space for others to rise up of their own accord.</p><p>Only responsibility can fix the world, and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-responsibility-go-up-technology">Bitcoin is responsibility go up technology</a>. There is no more important force in the world today, and long term it will help everyone at the short-term cost of the comfortable, complacent life of many.</p><h2>Fitness Equals Rightness</h2><p>That which is right is that which fits.</p><p>This is the essence of fitness, and in my opinion, morality. Morality is doing the “right thing.” That which most fits and is of the greatest good for the most impacted. The golden thread, so to speak.</p><p>To me, this is “why Bitcoin.” It is the most right and fit money. There is no better money than one which respects and adheres to the conservation of energy and the direction of time.</p><p>This will have monumental consequences on civilization, and as I said, long term, it will help everyone by leveling the playing field and thus creating a realm in which people orient toward noble competition and cooperation rather than cheating in order to get ahead. People must orient toward responsibility in order to succeed on a Bitcoin standard, and for many, this will be painful.</p><p>But it’s necessary, because it’s right. And this is what I implore you to understand. Come to Bitcoin and embrace it, not for some altruistic, politically-correct notion of “I want to help the masses,” because that’s bullshit and deep down you know it.</p><p>Come to Bitcoin because it’s right. It’s the dignified individual’s choice. It’s your greatest advantage and the highest truth you will discover on your path through life.</p><p>You can be unapologetically honest and truthful, or a politely confused altruist and liar. The former will earn you respect, from your own self first, then everyone else. The latter will make you a simp, without dignity, always degrading yourself for some cause.</p><p>Ignore me, or allow these seeds to take root. The choice is yours.</p><p>Only remember…</p><p>Bitcoin will help those mostly who can help themselves. Bitcoin is just, fair and true. Bitcoin is right</p><p>The Remnant knows this. That’s why they love Bitcoin, and that’s why they are true Bitcoiners.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Aleks Svetski, author “The UnCommunist Manifesto” and founder of The Bitcoin Times.

Nor do I like just shoveling out a few extra billions and billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air. So I think I should say modestly that I think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization. And I’ll leave the criticism to others.” — <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffett-and-munger-on-bitcoin-213317653.html">Charlie Munger</a></p></blockquote><p>It’s time we condense into a couple of bullet points some of the ways in which bitcoin will likely contribute to civilization. For some of its contributions have by now become apparent. Afterwards, we’ll analyze Munger’s arguments. So, to start off, bitcoin:</p><ol><li>Reduces administrative bloat. By making the ledger public, much of the work needed to verify and audit wealth transfers is obliterated.</li><li>Cheaply transfers large sums of wealth across the globe.</li><li>Can potentially work like a treasury bond but delivering higher yield returns. This is because the real return on bonds is always lower than the nominal expectation, due to inflation.</li><li>Will increasingly function as a secure store of wealth or even as a savings account, as its market capitalization grows and its volatility decreases. Both the colossal amount of computing power that already powers Bitcoin, and the manner in which this computing power is distributed across several jurisdictions, ensure that Bitcoin’s network and therefore ledger is incorruptible.</li></ol><p>The contribution to civilization is expected to be so significant that gold and treasury bonds should gradually become obsolete, as bitcoin’s adoption rate increases. So bitcoin is indeed merely another financial product, or asset, at the moment, but assuming its adoption keeps growing, it will gradually replace older, less efficient, and ultimately more expensive financial products and assets. Bitcoin is real financial engineering that stores work-energy flows from energy production sites right into an incorruptible and irreproducible digital asset. As Michael Saylor elucidates, bitcoin is thermodynamically-sound monetary energy.</p><p>Let’s now dissect Munger’s arguments:</p><p>Munger: “Nor do I like just shoveling out a few extra billions and billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air.”</p><p>It is an interesting point, at least psychologically, but if we consider that every worthwhile invention started “out of thin air,” as an idea inside someone’s brain, we realize that it holds no ground. To give an example, the Wright brothers had first to imagine an airplane in their minds, “out of thin air,” as Munger says, before getting down to actually building it. Moreover, those billions and billions of dollars are not exactly going to the creator of bitcoin. Whoever buys bitcoin is in effect buying a piece of the Bitcoin network, i.e., a piece of finite blockchain property, and that piece will belong to the buyer and only the buyer as soon as he acquires it. The earlier adopters become wealthier as a side-effect of a growing adoption of the asset, but the positive civilizational event here is the radical optimization of wealth flows, as summarized above.</p><p>If Munger perhaps meant that one bitcoin can be easily created, or replicated, then that’s not true either. It costs, by design, a significant amount of energy to mine (i.e., to create) a single bitcoin. The side effect of this mining mechanic is that it incentivizes us to put to use lots of waste energy and also to repurpose power infrastructure. This is of course another excellent contribution to civilization.<br><br></p><p>Munger: “I hate the bitcoin success and I don’t welcome a currency that’s useful to kidnappers and extortionists.”</p><p>The thing with this line of reasoning is that it is equivalent to saying “I hate the success of knives and I don’t welcome a tool that’s useful to criminals.” But what if I told you that you can cut food, skin animals and help build an entire civilization with knives? Or like saying: “I hate fire because there are pyromaniacs.” But what if I told you that the “invention” of fire was practically the point at which human beings diverged from mere animals?</p><p>Not to mention that the moment regulation is tightened, criminals using bitcoin won’t be very bright: the ledger is public, and all transactions are tracked. As regulation and <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/2021/01/12/new-crypto-rules-in-the-eu-gateway-for-mass-adoption-or-excessive-regulation/">AML/KYC rules</a> start being enforced (on exchanges, and perhaps even on wallets), criminality driven by blockchain tech should gradually vanish. Good old plain cash, i.e. physical cash, is way more difficult to track. Why would a drug dealer, for example, accept bitcoin in his regulated, IRS-tracked wallet? Under such a regulatory scenario, in which the anonymity of bitcoin holders is non-existent to authorities, criminal activity driven by bitcoin transactions would hardly survive.</p><p>Sure, the criminals might create their own black-market of wallets and marketplaces, but as soon as a criminal wallet connected with a regulated, IRS-tracked wallet, it would sound an alarm. The “digital asset black-market” would consequently short-circuit itself from the economy–the criminal wouldn’t be able to use the wealth in his criminal wallet on anything other than untracked, criminal goods and services. Whereas now, the money, i.e. the physical cash, the criminal makes on the black-market can flow back into supermarkets, bars, restaurants, etc. and the criminal can effectively make a living out of crime.</p><p>In fact, the smartest anarchists are against bitcoin’s wide adoption, too, because they recognize it can lead to a society where your every move is tracked. So it follows that criminals, too, should be against it. If bitcoin works at the moment for them, this is because we are still early in its adoption and there is practically no regulation. After all, we are talking about replacing your physical, untracked wallet, with a digital, tracked wallet. How could crime prosper under these circumstances? Only through extremely organized crime and/or with government help.</p><p>When the first airplane the Wright brothers built crashed, there were guys laughing at the brothers.

    </figure><p>For most of us, walking the path of our individual Bitcoin journey has changed us in profound ways. We look more toward the future by improving our health, creating closer connections with those we care about (or reconnecting with them), and engaging in activities that represent our Bitcoin values. If you are looking for an activity that embodies these values in a single weird and wonderful place look no further than pickleball, the Bitcoin of sports.</p><p>If you just said, “What the heck is pickleball?” you are in the right place. Allow me to help you take your first steps down the pickleball rabbit hole and take you from no-pickler to new-pickler. If you already play, then this article might help you better understand why the sport feels like such a natural extension of who we are as Bitcoiners.</p><h2>Origin Story</h2><p>Like Bitcoin, pickleball combines existing equipment (technologies) from other sports and puts them together in a completely new way to create something entirely different. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickleball">Pickleball</a> was created in 1965 by Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell and Barney McCallum in Bainbridge Island, Washington. The three dads were trying to find something fun for their families to do during a summer vacation. They didn’t have a complete set of sports equipment available, so instead they took the best parts of what they had and collaborated with the kids to develop the rules for the game so that everyone would want to play (consensus mechanism).</p><p>Pickleball combines solid paddles like in paddle ball or ping pong, but in a size and shape more like racquetball racquets. It uses a net from badminton lowered to hip level like in tennis. The ball is plastic, much like the ones you might have used to play backyard baseball as a kid. The court is adapted from badminton, and the rules pull from multiple racquet sports and volleyball.</p><p>Even the name of the sport is shrouded in a bit of mystery, with Joan Pritchard saying they named it pickleball after the pickle boat in crew (the last boat to finish a race) because the oarsmen for the pickle boat are often chosen from the leftovers of other boats. Others believe the sport was named after the family dog, Pickles, who would dutifully retrieve the ball when it rolled off the court, although the Pritchards claim the dog came after and they named the dog after the sport (USA Pickleball).</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Low Time Preference</h2><p>One of the most valuable lessons Bitcoin teaches us is to prioritize the future over the present as we distance ourselves from the fiat world. Our time preference lowers, we stop seeking immediate gratification, and we learn the value of patience. Patience also happens to be the fundamental skill in pickleball. Success in pickleball is not about how many winners you can hit, but rather about how many points you don’t lose by making mistakes. Instead of constantly taking aggressive shots (trading), pickleball encourages patience (HODLing) and consistently executing basic shots (DCA) until the right moment arrives when the odds of winning the point are heavily in your favor. And when it does … Smash (BTFD)!</p><p>Even though the vernacular is different, you will find a lot of overlap in the languages of Bitcoin and pickleball. Below is a short sample of phrases that translate between the two. I welcome those of you who are Bitcoiners and picklers to add to the list!</p><div>  </div><h2>Hard To Grok</h2><p>Pickleball is easy to dismiss at first because, like Bitcoin, it is a little different. The rules are a little different, the equipment is a little different, and the people involved are a little different. But, like Bitcoin, once you experience the sport firsthand you realize it isn’t just different … it’s better. More importantly, it is better <em>because</em> it is different, and it is those differences that take new players on that familiar journey from confusion to curiosity to commitment. Players learn that playing good pickleball is counterintuitive to other sports, much like learning the fundamentals of Bitcoin is different from what we are taught about money and economics. At first, you think you should be aggressive, but then you learn to be patient. You think you should attack, but then you learn defending is more powerful. You think it will be easy, but then you learn that mastery can take a lifetime.</p><p>I was introduced to pickleball in late 2015 by Dave Leach (coincidentally, the same year I first heard about Bitcoin). Our sons were in the same Boy Scout troop and had become good friends. Dave tried explaining the game to me one night at a troop meeting. I didn’t really get it. To me, it just sounded like a weird form of mini-tennis. I listened politely and thought it was interesting, but never went out to play and forgot about it. Luckily, he kept encouraging me to give it a try and in early 2016 I went to the courts for the first time. I was instantly hooked. Like experiencing the rush of completing that first peer-to-peer transaction or holding your own keys for the first time, pickleball reels you in by perfectly balancing simplicity and challenge. This turned out to be about two months before I bought my first Bitcoin. Since then, I’ve been able to return Dave’s favor by introducing him to Bitcoin.</p><h2>Accessible And Challenging</h2><p>It doesn’t take much to get started in pickleball; all you need is a paddle, a ball, a court, and another player. With a couple of sessions of basic information and practice, you can go from “I’ve never played pickleball,” to enjoying fun games and holding your own on the court. However, taking the steps to learn the necessary skills to go from capable player to champion can take a lifetime. This is much like when you download a wallet and receive your first bitcoin while holding your own keys. From that moment you are a sovereign Bitcoiner, but taking the next steps to fully understand proper custody, privacy, and succession planning (not to mention economics, philosophy, etc.) can keep you engaged and intellectually challenged forever.</p><p>On your pickleball journey you will find that the biggest strides forward in your game often happen during the passive work you do off the court. After a game, you’ll have an a-ha moment like “I'm popping the ball up because I'm gripping the paddle too tightly near the net,” or, “With each step toward the kitchen, I should lessen my grip pressure by 10%.” The same thing happens to us as Bitcoiners. We make huge strides in our thinking when reading a non-Bitcoin article or having a non-Bitcoin conversation. We hear a news story about the Canadian truckers or about the failing Japanese yen and realize "This is the use case for Bitcoin."</p><h2>Proof-Of-Work</h2><p>Pickleball attracts players from other sports like tennis, ping pong and racquetball. They often arrive with an "I'm new to pickleball and I'm here to fix it," disposition. They assume their years of experience and skill building in other sports will immediately translate into dominance in this apparently easy pickleball thing. They quickly find out, usually by repeatedly losing games to more experienced players, that they must put in the necessary time and work to develop the specific skills and strategies that translate into success in pickleball. To paraphrase Max Keiser, "You don't change pickleball … pickleball changes you." Think it’s easy to be world class in pickleball? Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6MyDfJUTKg">this point</a> and think again.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Dare To Be Different</h2><p>Picklers are used to being snickered at by people that play more established racquet sports like tennis, racquetball, and squash (TradFi). They dismiss us and think “Aww, look at those pickleball players … aren’t they cute? It’s too bad they can’t play a real sport.” Then their courts get repurposed to become pickleball courts and they think “Maybe I should try it.” This is much like when normies think “Aww, look at those Bitcoiners … aren’t they cute? It’s too bad they don’t understand real money.” Then Bitcoin becomes the best performing asset in history, and they think “Maybe I should get some.”</p><p>Much like Bitcoiners proudly wear shirts that say “Rules not rulers'' and “∞/21M”, picklers proudly and unapologetically declare themselves as such by wearing merch with pickleball insider jargon like "Stay out of the kitchen!" and "I might have a dinking problem."</p><p>Pickleball players come from every type of political, religious, and cultural background. Like Bitcoiners, those differences sometimes come out in spirited discussions on and off the court. In the end, these differences are usually overshadowed by the common interest they share and their passion for the sport they love. What they share is more important than where they disagree, and it might even help them appreciate their differences a bit more.</p><section><figure>

    </figure><div><em>View the 2 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-pickleball-embodies-values-of-bitcoin">original article</a></em></div></section><h2>Inclusive</h2><p>Pickleball welcomes anyone and everyone to learn and enjoy the sport. Whether you are young or old, tall or short, rich or poor, walking on your feet or rolling on wheels, pickleball welcomes you and says “You can join this network. You can participate, benefit from, and contribute to this community.”</p><p>Pickleball not only accepts anyone and everyone, but it also encourages players of all types to play together. It is not uncommon to see high level players helping newbies, retirees playing against teenagers (and beating them), and children beating their parents.</p><p>Pickleball is also financially inclusive; it doesn’t take a lot of money to start playing. You can buy a pair of starter paddles for $20-$30. If you can’t afford that, just show up at a local court and I guarantee someone with an extra paddle will loan it to you, teach you the rules, play with you, and invite you back.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Passion</h2><p>There is no passion like that of a Bitcoiner who has fully gone down the rabbit hole, except possibly for someone that has been bitten by the pickleball bug. See if any of this sounds familiar:</p><ul><li>They watch videos, match replays, read articles and listen to anyone that can teach them about the game. </li><li>They constantly tell their friends how the game is fun, challenging and energizing.</li><li>They talk about how their physical, mental and social lives have been improved by the game.</li><li>They travel far and wide to find courts and instruction. Anything to be able to play more and improve.</li><li>They say pickleball is life.</li></ul><p>They play and play and they can’t get enough. You only need to hear the collective groans of 20+ people when the court lights shut off at 10 p.m. to know that pickleball is more than just another form of exercise.</p><h2>Gradually, Then Suddenly</h2><p>Parker Lewis’s perfectly named series has taught us that change happens gradually, then suddenly. Pickleball has grown from summer vacation family pastime to the fastest growing sport in the United States. Tennis courts, roller hockey rinks, and even basketball courts are being converted to pickleball courts everywhere, and demand is moving up and to the right. Multiple professional leagues have been started, with teams recently being formed by major celebrities like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/lebron-james-is-a-pickleball-fan-and-player-now-hes-buying-a-team.html">Lebron James</a> and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-kim-clijsters-join-star-studded-list-of-major-league-pickleball-team-owners/">Tom Brady</a> (Golden). Major networks are starting to pick up coverage of pickleball events, like the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/cbs-celebrity-pickleball-tournament-players-180024484.html">Celebrity Pickleball Challenge</a> that recently aired on CBS (Webb). Venues for incorporating pickleball into other industries are springing up, like <a href="https://chickennpickle.com/">Chicken and Pickle</a> and <a href="https://www.thepicklebar.com/">The Pickle Bar</a>. Pickleball clubs and meetups are starting up everywhere and growing fast. Even Michael Saylor has a court at his house. The FOMO is real.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Community</h2><p>No matter where you are from or where you are, if you meet a fellow pickleball player you often become fast friends. There is simply an understanding among players that if you share a love for pickleball you will likely have enough in common to get along. I have met and played with people from all over the world. Even in situations where we didn’t speak the same language, we could still communicate on the court and have a great time. Like Bitcoiners, pickleball players are givers. They freely give their time, their knowledge, and their help to anyone who wants to learn the game or improve their play.</p><p>One of the things I love most about both the Bitcoin and pickleball communities is that its stars and celebrities are approachable (rules, not rulers). Max Keiser, Cory Klippsten, and Marty Bent will gladly have real conversations with plebs like me at a conference, meetup, or event. Likewise, world class players like Steve Kennedy, Kyle Yates, and Anna Leigh Waters will play pickup games with amateurs like me and shoot the breeze about the latest happenings in the pickleball world.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Luckily, unlike Neo, you don’t have to choose between the orange and the yellow pill. You can take both, and by doing so discover a new world that embraces the same values that make our Bitcoin community so special. You will also find a whole new group of precoiners to potentially orange-pill. So, pick up a paddle and head to a pickleball court near you and remember … stay humble, stack sats and respect the net!</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Pre-Conference Orange Pilling On The Beach</h2><p>For some time now, I’ve been an avid fan of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/alexgladstein">Alex Gladstein</a> and his perception of Bitcoin as a tool for empowering the unprivileged, the exploited and the suppressed. This spring, I gulped down his new book called “<a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/products/check-your-financial-privilege">Check Your Financial Privilege</a>,” and a few weeks later I had the good fortune to visit his organization’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-purpose-at-oslo-freedom-forum">Oslo Freedom Forum</a>. But even though I understood <em>rationally</em> that Bitcoin is a necessity for billions around the world, I never really <em>experienced</em> adoption from this perspective, and never met the very people for whom Bitcoin can be a life preserver. That changed for me a few weeks ago in Ghana.</p><p>Curiously, the most eye-opening thing for me in terms of local Bitcoin adoption wasn’t the conference as such, but rather, it was interactions with ordinary Ghanaians in the city of Accra, most of whom learned about Bitcoin for the first time from us, the conference goers. </p><p>Several other Bitcoiners and I, including Hermann Vivier (the organizer behind the south-African circular economy project Bitcoin Ekasi) visited the local beach a day before the conference began, and spent the whole afternoon discussing Bitcoin with locals. What we found out was that Bitcoin becomes a very real thing once the locals are shown that they can receive value instantly, without any registration, and immediately spend it on airtime via Bitrefill. Whoever we talked to — fishermen, souvenir merchants, taxi drivers, artists — we witnessed the same cognitive process: from disregard and suspicion to excitement, within minutes. All that was required was to showcase a real-life immediate use for Bitcoin, and it all clicked. </p><p>Now, this might sound trivial to some readers, but the fact is that in many places, there is no easy way to conduct digital payments. Western Bitcoiners are mostly used to viewing bitcoin as a long-term store of value — which is, of course, a valuable use case everywhere around the globe — but in many countries, bitcoin serves as an incredible medium of exchange as well. And often, the only thing that is missing is knowledge about the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi/status/1599482511251251200"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi/status/1599686846354554880"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><h2>Bitcoin: The Pan-African Hope</h2><p>One theme that resounded throughout the three-day conference was the notion that Bitcoin can serve as a tool of liberation from the post-colonial systems of control in the form of the IMF, World Bank, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-a-currency-of-decolonization">CFA franc system</a> and similar constraints.</p><p>Gladstein explained in his keynote the precise nature of the debt slavery that most of the African nations find themselves in, with the IMF and World Bank happily lending billions of dollars to dictators, while it’s the citizens who are later forced to repay these debts, even though the loans only served to fill up the personal coffers of the kleptocratic dictators. Gladstein’s talk was based on his <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/imf-world-bank-repress-poor-countries">latest essay for Bitcoin Magazine</a>, where he outlines the frustrating details of the IMF/WB exploitation scheme.</p><p>Africa may very well be the continent most damaged by fiat money. <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fabric/backgrnd.htm">Fourteen countries</a> still have their currency managed by the French government (the CFA franc regime), two countries are currently experiencing inflation near or over 100% (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1220801/inflation-rate-in-africa-by-country/#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%202021,African%20continent%2C%20averaging%2090%20percent.">Zimbabwe and Sudan</a>), <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/10/20/africas-inflation-among-regions-most-urgent-challenges">almost half of the African countries face inflation higher than 10%</a>, and cross-border payments are often expensive or impossible. Many speakers pointed out that Bitcoin is the only viable way out, and the only practical chance for uniting the continent.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The pan-African nature of Bitcoin was touched upon often: in the many talks, panel discussions and off-stage networking — it didn’t really seem to matter which country the particular speaker was from; Bitcoin was generally understood as a pan-African phenomenon. </p><p>On the other hand, the lessons learned from Bitcoin adoption on the African continent are invaluable to Bitcoin itself and its potential for hyperbitcoinization — in Africa, Bitcoin is tested to its very limits: many countries are openly hostile to Bitcoin, the infrastructure of all kinds is often unreliable, people are often lured into bitcoin affinity scams; yet the adoption is following an exponential curve. </p><p>Obi Nwosu of Fedi summed up the perspective of many attendees in his keynote, when he stated that “Africa wins with Bitcoin. And Bitcoin wins with Africa.”</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1600536579340222469"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>A strong theme throughout the conference was the necessity of African Bitcoiners being the ones to build tools for Africa, the reason being that developers from the Western world often have an understandable blind spot for the needs and circumstances of Africans. </p><p>A prime example is this year’s rollout of <a href="https://8333.mobi/">Machankura</a>, a service that makes Lightning Network payments accessible on feature phones. Machankura is being developed by Kgothatso Ngako, a programmer from South Africa, where feature phones are still widespread (as is the case in most other African countries). It’s hard to fathom Machankura being developed and adopted in Europe or the U.S., since people in these regions simply do not have the need to use Lightning on feature phones; but in Africa, it’s a game-changer for millions.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Obstacles On The Road To Africa’s Hyperbitcoinization</h2><p>The exploding Bitcoin adoption in Africa has had its fair share of problems as well. </p><p>First: the infrastructure. As one of the speakers aptly put it: “Every Ghanaian knows — when it rains, the internet goes down.” The good news is that Africans are actively working on alleviating these problems; one of the interesting projects featured at the conference was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-miner-gridless-raises-2-million">Gridless</a>, a bitcoin mining company that leverages stranded energy, such as local hydro power plants that are not connected to the national grid. During the course of the conference, a fresh $2 million investment into Gridless was announced, helping the project expand beyond Kenya, its home country.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1601126305683996673"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>A second obstacle is that scams and exploitative schemes are widespread. A prime example is Worldcoin. Some time ago, the global Bitcoin community was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/25/why-everyone-is-mad-at-sam-altmans-worldcoin/">outraged by this project</a>, which onboards new users via airdropping tokens in exchange for a retina scan. After the initial wave of disapproval, things went quiet and the general impression was that Worldcoin was abandoned. To my surprise, I found out that the project is very much alive and the eye-scanning orbs are being deployed across the African continent. Bitcoiners worldwide have a duty to shine light on such disgusting data-harvesting experiments, and ensure that Africans are well-informed about the difference between Bitcoin and everything else.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/statusquont/status/1604017162615934976"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Third: corporate conquest. It would do no good for the African continent to get rid of the neo-colonial monetary schemes such as the CFA system, only to be replaced with their corporate equivalents. From several discussions, I understand that Binance and other major exchanges are muddying the waters about what it means to actually hold bitcoin, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/binances-cz-does-about-turn-on-crypto-self-custody-99percent-of-peoplewill-end-up-losing-it/ar-AA15ix0Q?li=BBnb7Kz">discouraging newcomers from self custody</a>, and instead promoting exchange accounts as the only option. The other alarming area of a corporate conquest is the widespread reliance on WhatsApp; as one Twitter commenter <a href="https://twitter.com/benji_fernandes/status/1603379200320507912">recently stated</a>, WhatsApp is “Africa’s e-mail.” This should be a reminder that education efforts should focus not only on Vitcoin and self custody, but also on the likes of Signal, encrypted email, password managers, VPNs and other similar tools of digital empowerment.</p><h2>All Eyes On Africa</h2><p>The Africa Bitcoin Conference was hands down one of the most inspiring events I’ve been to. Everyone I met — the entrepreneurs, the human rights activists, the circular community builders, the developers — was full of energy to orange pill the African continent. But their excitement wasn’t naive and didn’t stem from any kind of ideology or heterodox economic school; on the contrary, theirs was a very practical approach. Africa has its fair share of problems, and Bitcoin can help fix them — if we do things correctly.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/femilonge/status/1602210457280024578"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Many speakers throughout the conference reminded us of the crucial ingredient of the Bitcoin revolution: the people. If ordinary people can’t understand and easily use the technology to alleviate their day-to-day problems, Bitcoin won’t get too far. Bitcoin doesn’t need to onboard politicians and central bankers, but rather taxi drivers and street food vendors. Thankfully, there are many grassroots communities emerging on the continent, spearheading the bottom-up adoption of the orange coin. To name just a few, there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi">Bitcoin Ekasi</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_BitcoinMt">Bitcoin Mountain</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CowriesKumi">Bitcoin Cowries</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/VillageBitcoin">Bitcoin Village</a>, <a href="https://exonumia.africa/">Exonumia</a> and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/digioats">DigiOats</a>. And many more are emerging.</p><p>Personally, I can’t wait for another chance to visit a Bitcoin conference on the African continent, the optimism for a better future is simply unmatched. The next upcoming conference seems to be the <a href="https://nigeriabitcoinconference.com/">Nigeria Bitcoin Conference</a>, happening in March. Since Nigeria has one of the most <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/nigeria-looking-to-legalize-bitcoin">orange-pilled populations worldwide</a>, I’m sure it will also be a wild, unforgettable experience.&nbsp;</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iGvYndip3H4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><em>Note: live streams from day two and three of the Africa Bitcoin Conference are available at the </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@africabitcoinconference7037/streams"><em>conference YouTube channel</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>This is a guest post by Josef Tětek.

The company has closed a seed round at launch, raising $3 million in funding.</p><p>Layer 2 Labs co-founder and CEO Paul Sztorc said in a statement sent to Bitcoin Magazine that the firm seeks to "make everyone in the world a Bitcoin user." Sztorc is the author of two Bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs),  BIP 300 and BIP 301, which detail the technical specifications of drivechains. Naturally, drivechains are at the forefront of Layer 2 Labs’ mission.</p><p>"Layer 2 Labs believes that drivechains have the potential to revolutionize the way we use Bitcoin by enabling greater scalability, extensibility, privacy, and flexibility on the network," the company said in a statement. "We believe that drivechains have the potential to kill altcoins, increase Bitcoin adoption, and provide the catalyst for hyperbitcoinization."</p><p>Drivechains define a specific way through which to create Bitcoin sidechains. Sidechains are parallel blockchains to Bitcoin that enable BTC to "flow" between the two networks in a two-way peg. Since bitcoin can’t actually leave the Bitcoin network, sidechains accomplish this task by locking up BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain and representing them in different ways in the sidechain. The goal is that the representation of BTC in the sidechain maintains a 1:1 peg to the actual BTC locked on the Bitcoin network.</p><p>Liquid is perhaps the most popular sidechain in the Bitcoin ecosystem today. Blockstream’s model leverages a federation to handle the on-chain lock-up and withdrawals, as well as sidechain block creations. Drivechains attempt to move away from the federated model in favor of something it deems more decentralized –– Bitcoin’s own miners. </p><p>Under the drivechain model, bitcoin miners also mine sidechain blocks, albeit blindly. That is, the miner doesn’t need to run software for that specific sidechain, while accruing from the value being transacted on that parallel chain. This is because most fees paid on the sidechain go to the bitcoin miners. Ultimately, this also contributes to greater fee revenue in Bitcoin.</p><p><a href="https://www.drivechain.info/">Drivechains</a> allow for nearly any kind of chain to be created and take advantage of the two-way peg. This characteristic could allow for functionality present on any altcoin network to be indirectly ported to Bitcoin. Hence, drivechains –– and sidechains at large –– in some way allow for bitcoin to be used on another chain, with different rules and properties. The benefit is the user would be able to do things with their bitcoin that isn’t possible on the Bitcoin network. The risk is the pegging mechanism.</p><p>Sztorc said the company has three overarching goals. The first, as mentioned, is the desire to further develop and scale drivechains.</p><p>"We have 6 sidechain-designs in development already, including two which are exact clones of Ethereum and zCash (but BTC-only)," he said in a statement. "These allow for immediate global scale, impenetrable easy-to-use privacy, and complete freedom (for users and developers)."</p><p>Second, <a href="http://layer2labs.com/">Layer 2 Labs</a> aims to improve the user experience in Bitcoin, especially around activities necessary for truly self-sovereign bitcoin ownership.</p><p>"We want REAL bitcoin users –– users who run nodes, and hold keys," he added. "This requires a revolution in UX and education... which we aim to bring about. Nodes should be easy to run and do useful things that any layperson can understand and appreciate."</p><p>Finally, Sztorc said the firm plans to work on what he calls "high-risk, high-reward problems."</p><p>"These include prediction markets and a resurrected Namecoin," Sztorc said. "These services will revolutionize media/telecommunications, just as Bitcoin will revolutionize Banking."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNzU0OTcxNDk3MTEzMjUx/20220819_best-sidechain-recap---shinobi.png"/></item></channel></rss>
