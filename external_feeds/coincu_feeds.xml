<h5><strong>On December 26, Louis Liu, the founder of Octopus Network, a Near ecological multi-chain network, published a blog post saying that the core team of Octopus Network will launch a voluntary resignation plan to achieve restructuring.</strong></h5>

<p>The Octopus Network core team will be refactoring as we adjust our project plan to meet market demands. They have been through three seasons till this year 2022, the prior two were in 2014-2015 and 2018-2019. However, <strong>Louis Liu wrote that this year is extremely different from the others.</strong></p>



<p>Octopus Network was designed to support Web3 applications which takes a big chunk of resources to support an appchain in terms of IT infrastructure and community mindshare, but the <strong>Octopus community can’t afford to onboard a batch of appchains only to lose most of them in one year, according to the statement.</strong></p>



<p>Octopus Network was moving forward with the Voluntary Separation Program, in which <strong>about 40% of members (12 out of 30) will Leave the core team through the program. The remaining team members accept a 20% salary cut, and the team token incentive is suspended indefinitely.</strong></p>

<p>Louis Liu said that <strong>the plan aims to allow Octopus Network to survive the encryption winte</strong>r. Next year, the team will use Near and IBC as the strategic cornerstone of key construction.</p>



<p><strong>The Octopus team has been working on IBC for over two years</strong>. The firm expects that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154733-near-protocol-seeks-to-concentrate/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/154733-near-protocol-seeks-to-concentrate/" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEAR </a>Protocol will be the best L1 blockchain to host Web3 applications due to its unparalleled usability and scalability. Besides, the firm believes Octopus 2.0 will facilitate NEAR’s position as an inherent part of the blockchain Internet by widely connecting various appchains (Substrate or Cosmos SDK based) and all IBC-enabled blockchains.</p>

<p>In this regard, the BitKeep team has stated that they have noticed and <strong>are urgently investigating the cause</strong>. The platform says that if asset loss is caused by the platform, the BitKeep Security Fund will compensate in full.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that BitKeep&#8217;s multi-chain wallet has been hacked. As updated in an earlier Coincu News article, on October 18,<strong> the BitKeep Swap multi-chain wallet <a href="https://news.coincu.com/134702-bitkeep-swap-wallet-attacked-1m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hacked</a></strong>. Despite efforts to prevent and the development team to take urgent action, the hacker&#8217;s attack was blocked. However, the attack that focused on BNB Chain caused about $1 million in damage.</p>



<p>After that, the platform&#8217;s services are also interrupted to make sure there are no other errors. According to data monitoring by crypto security companies, Bitkeep Swap attackers transferred 4,300 BNB (approximately $1.18 million) of stolen funds to Tornado Cash in the form of 100 BNB each.</p>

<p>The platform also recently<strong> launched its new product <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149053-bitkeep-connected-walletconnect-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WalletConnect</a>,</strong> a Web 3.0 communication protocol that has linked to the BitKeep multi-chain wallet, seeing BitKeep as an important aspect of the “Wallet + dApp” ecosystem.</p>



<p>According to the announcement the new service will allow Users to be able to use WalletConnect to securely interact with all connected dApps by scanning a QR code on the browser or navigating to the APP using Deep Linking.</p>



<p>Although hacks continue to take place on BitKeep. However, the response from the platform can also be seen quite quickly. Follow us to stay up to date with the latest developments in the story.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Binance France and Binance Holdings Limited are being sued for alleged fraudulent concealment and deceptive business activities.</em></li>



<li><em>The plaintiffs also claim to have lost over 2.4 million euros as a result of the TerraUSD (UST) collapse, because Binance advertised the token as US dollar-backed.</em></li>

<p>The plaintiffs stated in a case filed on December 14 that <strong>the exchange breached French regulations by promoting and delivering crypto services before acquiring registration from the country&#8217;s authorities</strong>. As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/86247-binance-wins-regulatory-approval-from-france/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/86247-binance-wins-regulatory-approval-from-france/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, the Autorité des marchés financiers in France awarded the exchange a license as a digital asset supplier in May 2022. The license enables the crypto exchange to provide services including asset custody and cryptocurrency trading.</p>



<p><strong>The accusation also comprises photos indicating Binance&#8217;s social media activities previous to its licensing, including a Telegram channel titled &#8220;Binance French&#8221;</strong>. The plaintiffs also claim to have lost over <strong>2.4 million euros as a result of the TerraUSD (UST) collapse</strong>, because Binance advertised the token as US dollar-backed.</p>

<p>The exchange reacted to inquiries about the case in a blog post. According to them, <strong>the business did not undertake any promotional communications in France during the relevant period</strong> and stated that <strong>Telegram groups are worldwide community forums</strong>, allowing users to build and join channels on their own terms.</p>



<p>The exchange also addressed concerns about Terra stablecoin advertising in the nation. The firm stated that their communication portrays staking with Binance as <strong>safe, and not the underlying tokens</strong>. The exchange also stated that it always contains market risk warnings for crypto goods and that its explanations have been enhanced.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://news.coincu.com/88156-terra-luna-has-plummeted-99-bringing-its-value-to-0-20/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/88156-terra-luna-has-plummeted-99-bringing-its-value-to-0-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by Coincu, a sequence of dramatic events in May 2022 led to a dramatic drop in the price of the LUNA token and its associated stablecoin TerraUSD (UST), which was supposed to preserve algorithmic parity with the US dollar but lost its peg and fell to $0.2700.</p>

<ol>
<li>Some in the crypto industry hate centralization. Regardless if a CEX helps with crypto adoption at a faster rate, they just hate CEX;</li>



<li>Some lose money on trading or experience other issues and may blame and attack Binance;</li>



<li>Some industry players view Binance as a competitor and occasionally try to throw shade on the exchange in an attempt to knock them down a notch. Some media gets paid to FUD Binance, which is entirely owned by a competitor;</li>



<li>Crypto has not reached mass adoption yet, probably less than 5% globally. Many people are still skeptical about crypto. Some media have readerships that are more traditional and will tend to align with their views as the same goes for politicians and policymakers;</li>



<li>People like to spread Binance FUD simply because of generalizations that group the exchange with other failed centralized firms like FTX;</li>



<li>There may be a tiny number of people who are jealous, or just plain racist against Chinese-looking Canadians;</li>



<li>The sheer size of Binance. Writing about &#8220;Binance&#8221; gets more clicks than the other smaller exchange.</li>

<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-delay-for-implementation-of-600-reporting-threshold-for-third-party-payment-platforms-forms-1099-k" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-delay-for-implementation-of-600-reporting-threshold-for-third-party-payment-platforms-forms-1099-k" rel="noreferrer noopener">press </a>release from the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/64197-miners-and-stakers-may-not-be-required-to-report-to-the-internal-revenue-service/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/64197-miners-and-stakers-may-not-be-required-to-report-to-the-internal-revenue-service/" rel="noreferrer noopener">IRS</a>, <strong>third-party settlement companies will not be required to record transactions over $600 in 2022 as a result of the moratorium.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The new threshold</strong>, which was implemented as a part of the American Rescue Plan of 2021, <strong>will also be phased in starting in 2022</strong>, according to the IRS.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">The transition period described in <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-2023-10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notice 2023-10</a>, delays the reporting of transactions in excess of $600 to transactions that occur after calendar year 2022. The transition period is intended to facilitate an orderly transition for TPSO tax compliance, as well as individual payee compliance with income tax reporting. A participating payee, in the case of a third-party network transaction, is any person who accepts payment from a third-party settlement organization for a business transaction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Besides, the IRS has stated that it will<strong> provide the proper 1099 forms to taxpayers who request them when the time comes</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">The change under the law is hugely important because tax compliance is higher when amounts are subject to information reporting, like the Form 1099-K. However, the IRS noted it must be managed carefully to help ensure that 1099-Ks are only issued to taxpayers who should receive them.</p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">In addition, it’s important that taxpayers understand what to do as a result of this reporting, and tax preparers and software providers have the information they need to assist taxpayers.</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1917.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="735" height="400" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1917.png" alt="IRS Delays $600 Tax Threshold For Third-party Payment Platforms" class="wp-image-155350" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1917.png 735w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1917-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" title="IRS Delays $600 Tax Threshold For Third-party Payment Platforms 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>The extra time, according to IRS Commissioner Doug O&#8217;Donnell, will assist people in smoothly adapting to the new system.</p>



<p>In particular, the IRS will delay the implementation of <strong>the 1099-K changes to help smooth the transition </strong>and ensure clarity for taxpayers, tax professionals and industry. As IRS stated, the additional time will help reduce confusion during the upcoming 2023 tax filing season and provide more time for taxpayers to prepare and understand the new reporting requirements.</p>

<p>In particular, the Defrost team claimed in a tweet thread published that <strong>a first assault utilized a flash loan to siphon money from its V2 product</strong>. <strong>A second larger attack used the owner key to exploit V1</strong>. The leveraged trade protocol on the Avalanche blockchain didn&#8217;t specify how much money had been stolen.</p>

<p>Defrost Finance, on the other hand, stated in a tweet on the same day that it is prepared to discuss a return of the money with the perpetrators of the assault. An effort to contact the company via Twitter was unsuccessful since direct messages were disabled on the account.</p>

<p>A rug pull can occur when developers construct and finance a liquidity pool, only to withdraw the cash after investors have purchased the corresponding token. According to Defi Llama statistics, <strong>the total worth of money frozen on Defrost Finance, which peaked at $95 million in February, has dropped to around $13 million in recent weeks. Yesterday, it was reduced to less than $93,000.</strong></p>



<p><strong>DeFiYield</strong>, which provides a security layer for smart contracts with a cross-chain digital asset management platform to help investors avoid being scammed or hacked, claimed it audited <strong>Defrost Finance a year ago and identified the smart contract flaw utilized in the breach.</strong></p>

<p>According to Changpeng Zhao in the discussion, Binance&#8217;s FUD is mostly the result of outside causes, not the exchange itself.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>One of the reasons given by the CEO was that <strong>some members of the cryptocurrency ecosystem hate centralization</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Regardless if a CEX helps with crypto adoption at a faster rate, they just hate CEX.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>CZ also noted that <strong>Binance has been viewed as a competitor by many industry players</strong>, with increasingly aggressive lobbying against the exchange and &#8220;loaning sums of money to small media that&#8217;s worth many times the media outlet&#8217;s market value, including buying their CEOs houses, etc.&#8221;, referring to The Block&#8217;s CEO, Mike McCaffrey, who secretly financed the crypto news platform with loans from Alameda Research.</p>



<p>McCaffrey stepped down as CEO on December 9, after disclosing two loans totaling $27 million from the hedge fund part of FTX Group.</p>



<p>CZ consistently blamed FUD on media coverage, accusing some of being &#8220;paid&#8221; to manufacture it without giving any evidence.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The executive also pointed out that<strong> conservative lawmakers attempting to defend existing banking institutions from bitcoin disruption were disseminating falsehoods</strong>. &#8220;Being conservative is not wrong,&#8221; CZ said, but banks should embrace blockchain technology rather than resist innovation.</p>



<p>Finally, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152603-cz-delist-mith-is-right-decision/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/152603-cz-delist-mith-is-right-decision/" rel="noreferrer noopener">CZ </a>alleged that a &#8220;<strong>tiny number of people who are jealous, or just plain racist against Chinese-looking Canadians&#8221; may be contributing to the propagation of misinformation</strong> about the transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>A significant improvement to 1inch Network&#8217;s Swap Engine, called Fusion, was unveiled. For cryptocurrency investors, the Fusion update seeks to enable affordable, secure, and rewarding swaps.</em></li>



<li><em>DeFi investors can make orders with a predetermined price and time range without paying network costs by using the Fusion option in Swap Engine. The upgrade also contains network upgrades, including modernized staking contracts and tokenomics.</em></li>



<li><em>In addition, the Fusion mode protects users from the maximum extractable value (MEV), which is the maximum profit that can be made from block production over and above the regular block reward and gas charges.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The<strong> Swap Engine</strong> connects DeFi members and offers liquidity for crypto trades through experienced market makers as a decentralized trading and matching system. In describing the purpose of the Fusion upgrade, <strong>Sergej</strong> <strong>Kunz</strong>, a co-founder of 1inch Network, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Fusion makes swaps on 1inch dramatically more cost-efficient, as users won’t have to pay network fees, plus, an extra layer of security is added, protecting users from sandwich attacks. Our aim is to make users’ DeFi experience as smooth as never before. Thanks to the 1inch Swap Engine and Fusion mode, now, everyone gets incredible UX with a high degree of security.”</p>

<p>The<strong> Swap Engine</strong> is a decentralized trading and matching system that connects DeFi users with practically limitless liquidity (both centralized and decentralized) through experienced market makers. It is based in part on the existing technology, including the<strong> Limit Order Protocol</strong> and the<strong> Aggregation Protocol</strong>. In essence, the <strong>Swap Engine</strong> gives consumers access to nearly all of the market&#8217;s liquidity.</p>

<p>The <strong>Swap Engine</strong> revolutionizes the way swaps are executed on decentralized exchanges by providing a brand-new form of decentralized order-matching strategy based on market rates and taking price impact into account while utilizing the Dutch auction paradigm.</p>



<p>In addition, the Fusion mode protects users from the<strong> maximum extractable value (MEV)</strong>, which is the maximum profit that can be made from block production over and above the regular block reward and gas charges.</p>



<p>In conjunction with the upgrade, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/146291-rabbithole-protects-metamask-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1inch</a> introduced the <strong>1inch Resolver Incentive Program</strong>, which will assist resolvers in receiving refunds for the gas used to fill consumers&#8217; orders in Fusion mode through<strong> December 31, 2022.</strong></p>

<p>Investors had reported losing their staked <strong>Defrost Finance (MELT) </strong>and <strong>Avalanche</strong> <strong>tokens</strong> from their <strong>MetaMask</strong> wallets when the announcement was made.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/68778-what-is-defrost-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defrost Finance</a> initiated an investigation into a potential attack on its <strong>Defrost v1 and v2 platforms</strong> after a few users complained about substantial losses in their accounts.</p>

<p>The platform chose to shut down <strong>Defrost v2 </strong>while it conducted additional research because it first thought <strong>Defrost v1 </strong>had not been affected by the breach. One of the core team members, <strong>Doran</strong>, warned the users not to utilize <strong>Defrost v2 </strong>over <strong>Telegram</strong>.</p>

<p>PerkShield&#8217;s preliminary study revealed an exploit that could be used by manipulating the flash loan and deposit functions and was made possible by the absence of a reentrancy lock. The hacker used the option to change the share price of <strong>LSWUSDC</strong>. The hacker had made almost <strong>$173,000</strong> at the time.</p>

<p>Further investigation revealed that the hacker created a face collateral token and employed a fraudulent pricing oracle to liquidate platform users. The hack is thought to have cost more than <strong>$12 million</strong> <strong>in losses.</strong></p>



<p>A vital component of the platform is being held by the attackers, necessitating fast action that might prevent more damage. Defrost Finance&#8217;s management has announced an offer to hackers in the most recent developments and is prepared to settle with the attackers.</p>

<p>Avalanche blockchain-based <strong>Defrost Finance </strong>is a completely fair launch trading platform. As an internal team looks into and attempts to address the problem, the company has asked its investors to avoid utilizing its platform.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Avalanche-based DEX Platypus announced it would launch its native stablecoin $USP on testnet on December 28.</em></li>



<li><em>USP is an over-collateralized stablecoin. Users can use the LP tokens in the Main Pool as security to create USP.</em></li>



<li><em>With their LP tokens, they can continue to farm on the liquidity pool in the interim. The Platypus stableswap AMM algorithm and the interest rate model keep USP&#8217;s peg in place.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>The native stablecoin USP of DEX Platypus, which is based in Avalanche, will be live on the testnet on December 28.</strong></h5>

<p>The deployment of <strong>USP</strong> resulted from Platypus&#8217; desire to increase its users&#8217; capital efficiency. Long-standing stablecoin collateral issues are also resolved by <strong>USP</strong>.

<p>Users can get <strong>USP</strong> by using up to <strong>20 times leverage t</strong>o collateralize their LP tokens. Investors can ultimately boost their earning capacity by farming with their <strong>USP</strong> as a liquid asset. Initially, <strong>USP</strong> can be minted in the <strong>Main Pools LP</strong>; however, minting options will soon be available in the <strong>Alternative Pools LP.</strong></p>



<p>With the debut of <strong>USP</strong> as a follow-up to the platform&#8217;s release of its<strong> Voting Gauge mechanism</strong>, Platypus has continued to expand. The function essentially allowed consumers the ability to choose where PTP emissions entered the gauge and to receive incentives in the shape of bribes as they cast their ballots.</p>
