<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought to add to recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair traded as high as the 29033.95 level after buying pressure emerged around the 28742.27 area, a test of an upside price objective related to demand that strengthened around the 28122 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;During the recent depreciation, bears pushed BTC/USD as low as the 28394 area after Stops were elected below the 28481.31 level, a related previous upside price objective.&nbsp; &nbsp;Significant buying and selling activity also took place around the 29298.31 area during the depreciation, an upside price objective linked to the same buying pressure that expanded around the 28122 area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above the market, upside price objectives relate to recent buying pressure around the 27194.51 and 28161.74 areas include the 30420.74, 31237.11, and 32556.73 levels.&nbsp; Downside price objectives related to recent depreciating ranges and levels include the 26533, 26085, 25604, and 24103 levels.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31477.37, 32501.23, 32989.19, 34583.96, 34658.69, 35222.66, 37765.28, and 38403.97 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another important price objective is the 31846.88 area, a level that represents the 50% retracement of the depreciating range from 48233.76 to 15460.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishlly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 28924.21 and the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 28933.63.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;26533.04/ 25604.51/ 25094.62 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Investor sentiment can turn the fortunes of digital assets overnight. Astute observers are witnessing a fascinating shift in investor focus, marked by the recent staggering gains of Radicle (RAD) and DigiToads (TOADS). In today's analysis, we'll delve into the factors contributing to their rapid ascent while also exploring the reasons behind the unexpected stumble of established players like XRP and DOGE. This more significant trend amongst legacy tokens that grapple with stagnation and diminishing returns shows investors' clear pivot towards newer projects not weighed down by bloated valuations. DigiToads and Radicle exemplify the growing trend of digital assets offering new use cases, smaller market caps, and stronger narratives, which has driven their meteoric rise. &nbsp;DigiToads (TOADS) </p>
<p>DigiToads (TOADS) has been making waves as a meme coin with a unique ecosystem that appeals to a broad range of users. The project features play-to-earn gaming, NFT staking rewards, and a community-driven treasury, which have all contributed to its remarkable growth in the market. With plans to launch a soon-to-be popular NFT collection during its presale, DigiToads early gains may soon be dwarfed by its later price action.</p>
<p>The play-to-earn gaming aspect of DigiToads offers an engaging way for users to participate in the ecosystem while earning rewards. This gaming feature has gained traction among crypto enthusiasts and casual gamers alike. Additionally, the NFT staking rewards provide an opportunity for NFT collectors and investors to generate passive income from their digital assets.</p>
<p>The community-driven treasury is another key component of DigiToads that has resonated with investors. This feature gives the community a say in allocating funds, ensuring transparency and responsiveness to user needs. The governance model enables token holders to participate in decision-making processes, fostering a strong sense of community and ownership.</p>
<p>DigiToads' successful presale, which raised over $2.45 million, has further cemented its position as a project to watch. With significant backing from investors and a strong start, DigiToads is well-prepared to impact the market and continue its growth trajectory.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Radicle (RAD)</p>
<p>Radicle (RAD) is an altcoin that has attracted a significant following due to its innovative approach to decentralized code collaboration. As an open-source protocol, it enables developers to collaborate on projects without relying on centralized platforms like GitHub or GitLab. Instead, Radicle uses its peer-to-peer replication protocol, Radicle Link, to facilitate collaboration and build DApps.</p>
<p>The Radicle Link protocol maintains the efficiency of Git while providing a global, decentralized data repository through a peer-to-peer networking layer. Users can share data using "gossip," retaining redundant copies on their computers and sharing local data with the network. Additionally, users can fund and manage software projects initiated by others, promoting a "bazaar-style" collaboration where users host their own content and any content they find interesting.XRP &amp; DOGE Suffer Steep DeclineRecently altcoins Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP (XRP) have experienced a decline in value due to various factors. Dogecoin, a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has faced increased competition from newer meme coins and NFT projects that have captured the attention of investors.As for XRP, the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has created uncertainty surrounding the future of the token. This legal dispute has made some investors cautious about investing in XRP, consequently affecting its market value.Become Part of the TOADS Journey Today</p>
<p>Radicle (RAD) and DigiToads (TOADS) have more than doubled in value, and analysts now regard them as top altcoins, while XRP and DOGE have stumbled. These projects offer unique opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Radicle's innovative approach to decentralized code collaboration and DigiToads' unique ecosystem and meme coin status make them promising projects in the competitive digital asset market, especially DigiToads, which has plans to launch on centralized exchanges in the coming months which could see it undergo another rapid expansionary phase. </p>

<p>Bullishness on Arbitrum (ARB) ran into early resistance at $1.36 and reversed course to a 24-hour low of $1.31, where support developed. The bears' influence may still be seen in the 1.95% decrease to $1.32 on the Arbitrum (ARB) token as of the time of publication.</p>
<p>The next support level of Arbitrum (ARB) to watch is $1.28, which the bulls must defend if the bear market keeps testing the $1.31 level of Arbitrum (ARB). However, a potential rally toward the $1.40 resistance level may be seen if the bullish power returns from this level. </p>
<p>Aptos (APT) Price Study Shows A Bullish Trend</p>
<p>Today's price has slightly decreased, according to the Aptos (APT) price study. The bulls briefly interrupted the bears' slide, giving the bears the upper hand once more. The price has decreased to about $9.39 as a result of the market's downward correction. The Aptos (APT) market began the day's trading section with bullish momentum, but the purchasers were unable to maintain it, and the price declined to $9.91. Since then, the bears have seized the market and driven the price down to its present levels.</p>
<p>APT/USD is now trading at about $1.78 billion, a small decline in market value. Nevertheless, the trading volume for Aptos (APT) &nbsp;today has increased by 2.91 percent to $118 million, showing that there is still a significant amount of interest in the asset. An opportunity exists for bulls to advance and take up a higher position on the 1-day Aptos (APT) price analysis price chart. Following the negative rejection at $9.91, the bearish momentum has been steadily in the lead over the last few hours. To make a recovery, the bulls would need to rally ferociously, but the bears are resisting. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Why Yachtify (YCHT)?</p>
<p>Yacht ownership has always been reserved for the wealthy. We developed the world's first fractional yacht investing platform, allowing members of the community to purchase, sell, and rent real-world yachts.</p>
<p>Yachtify's goal is to develop a marketplace for anyone interested in earning passive income by investing in and owning fractions of boats. When you hire out your boat, you will receive a portion of the rental based on your overall share. If you hold 50% of the charter, you will receive 50% of the hire-less trading fees.</p>
<p>Using our native cryptocurrency $YCHT, investors can purchase fractional NFTs that represent a real yacht. Existing yacht owners are permitted to advertise a minimum of 25% of their private boats for fractional sale, and these ships are insured and kept in high-security ports across the globe. </p>
<p>Yachtify (YCHT) is now doing a presale that is in Stage One and costs $0.1. Presale investors can earn a percentage of the platform fees for as long as they have the tokens. Through the Yachtify marketplace, any investor will have the chance to invest in a fractional interest in a yacht and generate passive income.</p>
<p>In more tangible terms, they can profit from their ownership by renting out the yacht they own. Investors can relax knowing that the liquidity will be permanently secured and that the Yachtifynetwork has undergone an InterFi network inspection.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The markets have seen a drop, which startled bulls but resulted in 'I told you so' nods from bears. The market downturn has taken its toll on Arbitrum (ARB) and Aptos (APT), but the news isn't all terrible.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">The blockchain space is home to some of the most notable projects. From Hedera (HBAR) and Lido DAO (LDO), investors have historically begun to diversify their holdings with the goal of getting the most out of the space in regard to returns. </p>
<p class="s5">However, with their recent bearish performance, investors have begun turning to presale-stage projects, out of which Sparklo has gained a lot of attention. Today, we will go over why this is the case and will analyze each one of these cryptocurrencies individually.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Sparklo (SPRK) Gains a Lot of Attention from Investors</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo will be an investment platform that specializes in providing each user an opportunity to get into the luxury investment space, with an opportunity to diversify their portfolio with silver, gold, and platinum.</p>
<p class="s5">Every time someone makes an investment on top of the platform, a non-fungible token (NFT) gets minted and then diversifies.</p>
<p class="s5">Then, each investor will have the opportunity to either buy an entire NFT or buy a fraction of it. If they buy the entire NFT, they can then get it delivered to them at a location of their choosing.</p>
<p class="s5">Moreover, the project has been audited by the InterFi Network, and its liquidity will get locked for 100 years. As for the value of the SPRK token, at its presale, it trades at a value of just $0.017. Analysts predict a 4,000% increase in value within the next few months, providing early investors with a solid opportunity.</p>
<p class="s9">Hedera (HBAR) Worries Investors with a 17.6% Decrease</p>
<p class="s5">Hedera (HBAR) &nbsp;made huge waves on Twitter after they announced that the total transactions on top of the network reached 8 billion. In the last 15 days alone, Hedera (HBAR) reached one billion transactions, leading to a high level of momentum for the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s5">Despite this massive milestone, the value of the Hedera (HBAR) cryptocurrency has been in decline.</p>
<p class="s5">As of April 2, 2023, Hedera (HBAR) traded at $0.058200. In the last 30 days, Hedera (HBAR) decreased in value by 17.6%, and in the last 24 hours, its overall decrease was at 4.8%.</p>
<p class="s9">Lido DAO (LDO) Sees Massive 18.3% Dip</p>
<p class="s5">Lido DAO (LDO) made an announcement surrounding their most recent Node Operator Community Call, where they went over the slashing incident update, the V2 testnet status and updates, and updates on the Lido DTV testnet.</p>
<p class="s5">Moreover, on April 28, Lido DAO (LDO) announced that the V2 release was approaching and that the bounty for the not yet deployed code for Lido V2 has been raised to $1m per critical finding.</p>
<p class="s5">As for its value, the Lido DAO (LDO) cryptocurrency traded at $1.96 as of May 2, 2023.</p>
<p class="s5">Within the last 30 days, Lido DAO (LDO) saw a decrease of 18.3%. In the last 24 hours alone, Lido DAO (LDO) decreased in value by 2.4%.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Get ready for a thrilling ride through the cryptocurrency market as Polkadot (DOT) prices surge, Dogecoin (DOGE) leaps ahead and the Collateral Network (COLT) presale promises astonishing 35x gains. In this article, we will explore the meteoric rise of DOT and DOGE and uncover the potential profit opportunities presented by the ongoing COLT presale. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Polkadot (DOT)</p>
<p>The current price of Polkadot (DOT) is $6.27, with a 24-hour trading volume of $158,227,221 and a market cap of $7,351,032,056. The price decreased by 1.19% at the time of writing. </p>
<p>According to a new filing, Polkadot (DOT) has registered a trademark for a messaging service built on blockchain. Additionally, the current bullish wave was driving prices up, according to the Polkadot (DOT) pricing research. </p>
<p>Since March 2023, Polkadot (DOT) has gained by more than 20%, rising from $5.15 to a high of $6.71. </p>
<p>According to a recent article by Crypto News Flash, Polkadot (DOT) is likely to grow a lot in 2023, with a 4.45% gain and a $7.66 billion market cap. The article also mentions that creating a blockchain-based messaging app and a major partnership with Stellar network will increase Polkadot (DOT) liquidity and make it easier for different projects to use Polkadot(DOT).</p>
<p>RenQ Finance&rsquo;s innovative approach to DeFi, focus on security and interoperability, and impressive price growth make it a strong contender to replace Polkadot (DOT) in 2023. While Polkadot (DOT) is still a popular blockchain network with a loyal user base, the crypto space is constantly evolving, and there is always potential for new projects.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Dogecoin (DOGE)</p>
<p>The Dogecoin (DOGE) price assessment for April 4th 2023, shows that Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on the rise during the last 48 hours. On April 3rd, its value increased from $0.0767 to $0.1015. </p>
<p>On April 3rd 2023, the Dogecoin (DOGE) logo abruptly appeared at the top of the Twitter homepage, sending the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) soaring higher by 18.7% on the 24-hour chart. </p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) gained popularity after the Dogecoin (DOGE) logo surfaced, which led to a 27% price increase. The Dogecoin (DOGE) price turned bullish thanks to Elon Musk's Twitter, rising 30% in 7 days. Investors may want to reevaluate their high expectations for the token's development.</p>
<p>The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) in April 2023 was forecasted by Changelly's team of specialists in digital currency. The prediction relies on how it acted at the beginning of the year. According to their forecast, Dogecoin (DOGE) will sell for an average selling price of $0.0889911 and fluctuate between $0.0919908 and $0.095990.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s9">Collateral Network (COLT)</p>
<p>The Ethereum (ETH) network hosts Collateral Network (COLT), a distinctive crowdlending platform. It is the first of its type to use NFTs to simplify loan transactions. Collateral Network (COLT) enables borrowers to swiftly and easily access cash from their real-life assets on the blockchain. On the other hand, lenders can lend little money to borrowers at a predetermined fixed interest rate.</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT), a decentralised platform, offers low-cost, secure loans backed by physical assets as collateral. These assets, such as a watch or artwork, can be used to secure loans without needing credit checks. This is possible by minting the assets as NFTs and then fractionalizing them. Lenders buy fractions of the NFTs to fund the loan and receive a fixed interest rate in return. </p>
<p>If borrowers cannot repay their loans on Collateral Network (COLT), they lose their collateral assets. COLT auctions the distressed assets among community members, who can buy the items at a price below the market. As a result, Collateral Network (COLT) can return their money to lenders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Collateral Network (COLT) innovation has increased competition for well-known lenders like Compound and AAVE.</p>
<p>The Collateral Network (COLT) presale began at $0.01 and has now surged to its current price of $0.014, and only 38% of the 1,400,000,000 tokens&nbsp;could be accessible. </p>
<p>Fascinatingly, presale buyers will be eligible for VIP membership, giving them access to special sales. Analysts anticipate a 35x price gain for Collateral Network (COLT) over the following six months. Use this alternative coin now since its value will surge in 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Deus Finance has lost over $6 million due to a security breach on its stablecoin DEI (DEI). The hacker exploited a vulnerability in the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) on May 5th, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">A bot initiated the hack on the BSC, which led to a more than $1.3 million loss. The attacker also targeted the Arbitrum network, with ARB/ETH deploymfents losing over $5 million. Security researchers claim the token contract had a basic implementation error as the root cause, over $DEI, which is a fractional reserve stablecoin forked from frax.finance.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Update on DEI tokens security breachYesterday:In response to the security breach, all contracts were paused, and DEI tokens on chains were burnt to prevent further damage</p>
&mdash; DEUS (@DeusDao) May 6, 2023

<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Deus Finance is a decentralized marketplace that allows for digital and non-digital assets, such as commodities, to be traded on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform operates using a peer-to-peer bilateral agreement system, enabling digitized derivatives to be cleared directly between two parties in a trustless manner. Decentralized threshold-signature-based oracles help verify agreements by providing economic-driven third-party market observations. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The marketplace uses an n-dimensional "request for Quote" system, which lets liquidity providers produce derivatives with their preferred rulesets, creating unlimited market access. Users can create an immutable "request for Quote" on the blockchain with their desired trade parameters, allowing third-party order matching engines to connect sellers with buyers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In Deus Finance's particular implementation, "n-dimensional" refers to a system that can have multiple variables or parameters influencing the outcome or decision-making process, where n represents an arbitrary number of dimensions, which can be customized to accommodate various factors or conditions.Such a system allows liquidity providers to create derivatives with their preferred rulesets, considering multiple parameters simultaneously, leading to a more flexible and personalized trading environment. This approach contrasts with traditional order book-based exchanges that typically use a single variable, such as price, to match orders and limit market variety.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Deus Finance's $DEI has already lost its peg with the U.S. dollar last year.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In response to the attack, the protocol paused all contracts and burned DEI tokens to prevent further damage. &ldquo;We are currently in the process of comprehending the actual backing of DEI tokens,&rdquo; said the Deus team on Twitter, adding that a &ldquo;comprehensive recovery and redemption plan&rdquo; will be created after a full analysis of the balances and snapshots.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">DEI is used as a collateral mechanism for third-party instruments built on the Fantom protocol. Its price dropped 30% over the past 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The stablecoin is trading at $0.20 at the time of writing, losing its $0.30 peg. Last year, the stablecoin also lost its $1 peg after the Terra collapse.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This is not the first time that Deus Finance has been hacked. The protocol was exploited in March 2022 in a flash-loan attack, resulting in over $3 million in losses in Dai (DAI) and Ether (ETH). At the time, PeckShield revealed the exploiters funneled the stolen funds using the crypto mixer Tornado Cash.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Financial infrastructure firm Stripe has announced expanded access to its crypto on-ramp by introducing a new hosted option for Web3 companies, making it easier for US-based customers to purchase cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The fintech firm has been actively expanding its initiatives in the crypto and Web3 space to provide better financial infrastructure for businesses and facilitate the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain-enabled experiences. The fiat-to-crypto on-ramp service is designed to address the "cold start problem" faced by Web3 companies, which refers to the initial barrier faced by companies offering cryptocurrency and blockchain-enabled services when their customers do not have the required cryptocurrencies in their wallets to carry out transactions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Such an issue often arises because many potential users are unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies or do not possess any at the time they want to engage with Web3 services. Consequently, these users may find it challenging to start using the services, which in turn, hinders the adoption and growth of the Web3 ecosystem. The new hosted fiat-to-crypto on-ramp addresses this challenge by allowing customers to purchase cryptocurrencies at the exact moment they need them, streamlining the process of acquiring and using cryptocurrencies for Web3 services.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This on-ramp allows U.S. customers to purchase crypto at the exact moment they need it, with two implementation options: an embeddable on-ramp that can be integrated into a website or app, and a Stripe-hosted on-ramp at crypto.link.com, available to all Web3 users. Stripe's on-ramp is designed to optimize conversion and authorization rates while ensuring compliance with KYC and regulatory requirements. The platform includes built-in fraud tools and identity verification to support companies in meeting these requirements. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Stripe's infrastructure simplifies growth for businesses by enabling them to accept fiat globally, facilitate easy payouts with crypto (USDC), lower fraud, and ensure smooth onboarding. The company has partnered with various Web3 companies, including Brave, Safe, 1inch, and Lens Protocol, to integrate its fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, allowing them to focus on their core offerings while Stripe handles critical tasks.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Guillaume Poncin, head of engineering for crypto at Stripe, stated that the on-ramp would handle various compliance-related tasks, such as conversion and authorization optimization, identity verification, and fraud prevention. Poncin claims that this will help customers use Web3 services quickly and safely by providing built-in fraud detection and identity verification tools have also been implemented to support companies in meeting Know Your Customer (KYC) and compliance requirements.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The new fiat-to-crypto on-ramp offers a seamless and efficient solution for Web3 companies, allowing platforms to integrate for free while users cover the fees. With just a few lines of code, the on-ramp provides real-time quotes, automated KYC, and multi-chain support. It also features an embeddable widget that can be customized to match a company's brand. The on-ramp supports various payment methods, such as credit, debit, ACH, and Google Pay, and offers an array of cryptocurrencies like ETH, SOL, MATIC, BTC, and USDC on different networks.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, platforms have no fraud liability as Stripe handles all disputes and offers webhook generation for every status change within a session. Returning users may benefit from a 1-click checkout with Link, Stripe's consumer account infrastructure. This innovative solution is currently available in the US, excluding Hawaii, with certain limitations on specific currencies in New York and live mode only for MATIC, USDC (Solana), and USDC (Polygon).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Big Four accounting firm Deloitte has announced its integration with KILT Protocol, a Polkadot-based parachain, to enhance its Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) verification processes. The integration aims to streamline identity verification by issuing reusable digital credentials to customers, significantly improving operational factors.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to a press release shared with CryptoDaily, Deloitte's integration of KILT Protocol technology into its verification processes aims to improve efficiency, reduce redundancy, and enhance data privacy. The reusable digital credentials enabled by this integration will have applications across various sectors, including banking, DeFi, e-commerce, and more.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">KYC and KYB processes in the past have often involved paper-based certificates and require multiple data points for identity verification, leading to increased workloads and inefficiencies. These methods also pose a risk to consumer data privacy as personal information is stored across multiple platforms and databases. By integrating with the KILT Protocol, Deloitte seeks to address such issues by allowing its customers to store their verification credentials in a single digital wallet.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The digital credentials will then be applicable across various use cases, including regulatory compliance for banking and decentralized finance (DeFi), age verification for e-commerce, private logins, and fundraising. At the time of writing, however, Deloitte has not disclosed specific capacities and technical information for these use cases.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The wallet, in the form of a browser extension, will be stored on the customer's device and remain under their control at all times. Customers may also choose which data points to share and with whom they share their credentials. Deloitte claims that its customer base would not need any prior knowledge in blockchain-based technologies to make use of the new features.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, Deloitte has disclosed that it will retain the authority to revoke credentials using the parachain if a customer's circumstances change after the credential was issued. Tthe credentials are also digitally signed by Deloitte, ensuring authenticity and reliability.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">KILT Protocol founder Ingo R&uuml;be emphasized the benefits of the streamlined identity solutions built on KILT, allowing customers to use verifiable digital credentials across multiple services while maintaining control over when and where to share personal information. He also noted that KILT, as a Polkadot parachain, offers the scale and security required by enterprise partners.</p>

&mdash; Polkadot (@Polkadot) May 4, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">KILT Protocol's solution works by eliminating trust processes for real-world credentials like passports and driver's licenses to the digital world while maintaining data privacy and control. Built over Polkadot, KILT allows users to claim various characteristics about themselves and present these claims to trusted entities called "attesters." If an attester considers the claim to be true, they can certify it and hand the certificate to the user, known as the "claimer." The certificate's hash value is then stored on the KILT blockchain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The claimer may then present the certificate to the services they wish to use, and the verifier of a service can check the validity of the certificate by comparing it to the blockchain's hash. As attesters are not involved in the verification process, the claimer's behavior remains unknown, and the claimer can even hide sensitive data that is not necessary for verification. This system ensures that users have full data sovereignty, as they are in control of their certificates.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This announcement comes shortly after reports on April 26 that Deloitte had over 300 crypto-related job opportunities available, with most of them being posted within the same week. In contrast, searches for crypto-related job openings at other Big Four accounting firms&mdash;Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers&mdash;yielded no results.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase has finally launched its international exchange platform after facing severe challenges in the United States, primarily from the SEC. Let&rsquo;s find out more.</p>
DeFi
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Curve Finance&rsquo;s highly anticipated crvUSD stablecoin was finally deployed on the Ethereum mainnet.</p>
<p>Yet another hack hit the DeFi ecosystem, as decentralized perpetual market Level Finance was hacked for $1.1 million by an unknown attacker.&nbsp;</p>
Altcoins
<p>The memecoin Pepe, based on the frog, has taken the crypto space by storm and is soaring towards a $1 billion market cap.</p>
<p>Layer-1 blockchain Sui has announced the launch of its mainnet on Wednesday as it gears up to take on other DeFi heavyweights such as Aptos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some AI-related altcoins were among the best performers of the latest crypto rally, which topped in early February.</p>
Technology&nbsp;
<p>The Aptos Foundation has unveiled its first round of grant recipients, awarding more than $3.5M to 50 project teams focused on scaling the Aptos blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>X.AI, an advanced AI model specialized in crypto and blockchain, announced its official launch. Elon Musk serves as its director.</p>
Business
<p>US-based crypto exchange Coinbase had some cause for cheer as it released its first-quarter revenue report, with results exceeding expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company recently launched Coinbase International Exchange, a platform designed for institutional clients based in eligible jurisdictions outside the U.S.</p>
<p>Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit has become the latest exchange to offer a cryptocurrency lending service.</p>
<p>Gemini has officially announced the launch of the Gemini Foundation, the highly anticipated offshore crypto derivatives platform.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Toncoin (TON) is currently troubled by a continuous downtrend movement, and an impending price swing is about to shift to the bears in Uniswap (UNI). With hopes of little return on the aforementioned tokens, investment in the Sparklo presale couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time.</p>
<p class="s8">Uniswap's (UNI) Price Movement is Predicted to Shift to the Bears</p>
<p class="s6">Uniswap's (UNI) recent price movement is showing a bearish trend, with sellers populating the market more than buyers. Uniswap (UNI) has been trading on support, currently at $5.3 in the wake of a 1.77% decline in the past 24 hours at the time of writing.</p>
<p class="s6">The price swing, which is characterized by an increase in selling pressure, is set to shift once more to the bears, with support tested repeatedly. With Uniswap&rsquo;s (UNI) failure to break the $5.6 resistance earlier, it is currently trading at $5.2.</p>
<p class="s6">Considering the technical analysis of Uniswap (UNI), the bearish trend might endure for a while. Investors are bracing for Uniswap&rsquo;s (UNI) downtrend by putting their investment somewhere else, especially in the Sparklo presale.</p>
<p class="s8">Toncoin (TON): Persisting Bearish Movement Frustrates Investors</p>
<p class="s6">Toncoin (TON) is a decentralized Layer-1 blockchain experiencing a continuous downtrend on the 24-hour to 90 days price chart. The hopes of a price swing in Toncoin (TON) were dashed in the past 24 hours after it recorded a 1.9% decline in price.</p>
<p class="s6">With the hope of an upward price movement dampened and no scheduled events to impact the price of Toncoin (TON), investors are frustrated. Consequently, investments in other projects, which promise high profits, are on their cards, over Toncoin (TON). Moreover, the opportunity to invest in the Sparklo presale is too good to be passed up by them, thereby resulting in increased purchases at the expense of Toncoin (TON).</p>
<p class="s11">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BUY SPARKLO TOKENS&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s12">Sparklo (SPRK): Creating the Possibility to Invest in Bits of Precious Metals</p>
<p class="s6">Before the launch of Sparklo, it was difficult and almost impossible to invest in bits of precious metals such as platinum, gold, and silver. However, with its creation, investors can now invest in any amount of desired rare metals through fractionalized NFTs. Furthermore, investors who purchase the complete NFT will receive real-world assets in their chosen locations.</p>
<p class="s6">The token&rsquo;s presale is worth a competitive price of just $0.017. In addition, a further 30% bonus until May 5th makes the presale even cheaper and has mouth-watering growth potential. According to experts, the price of Sparklo can increase by over 3,000% in the following year.</p>
<p class="s6">With the importance given to transparency, the KYC audit is ongoing and in its final stage, and the smart contract has been successfully audited by InterFi Network, which it passed with no mishaps. Lastly, to promote investment security, the liquidity has been locked for 100 years, thereby dispelling fears of a rug pull.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">While many cryptocurrencies are currently dwindling, Collateral Network (COLT) has emerged as the most profitable project on the market. </p>
<p class="s6">Bulls have pounced upon the presale of Collateral Network (COLT), and it is predicted to make its investors 35x richer in the next two quarters due to its unparalleled use cases. In this article, we will understand why Collateral Network (COLT) has the potential to surpass Fantom (FTM) and Enjin Coin (ENJ). </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Fantom (FTM) Eyes Domination On Twitter</p>
<p class="s6">The market conditions seem to be favoring Fantom (FTM), as the platform has been rising steadily on the price chart. The market value of Fantom (FTM) has seen an uptick of 18% in the past week. As a result, Fantom (FTM), at the time of writing, is trading at $0.53. </p>
<p class="s6">Fantom received a major push recently when iME, a messaging platform-come-crypto wallet, released a new feature allowing FTM to be traded via Twitter. As Twitter recently signed a deal with eToro to enable the trading of cryptocurrencies, it is expected that iME&rsquo;s recent feature can make Fantom (FTM) the most traded token. The total value locked (TVL) of Fantom (FTM) has surged by 14% over the previous month. However, Fantom&rsquo;s (FTM) network growth has been under pressure, and dipped over 70% in the past month.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Enjin Coin (ENJ) Teases New Platform</p>
<p class="s6">Enjin Coin (ENJ) recently shared its development update, and made its community active on the charts. In its April update, Enjin Coin (ENJ) informed that a new platform UI is set to undergo the testing phase. The new Enjin Coin (ENJ) platform will empower developers to customize their collections and decide how they want to receive their creator fees. </p>
<p class="s6">The updates are expected to help Enjin Coin (ENJ) return to the growth path. Notably, EnjinCoin (ENJ) surged at the beginning of 2023, but has declined by 22% since February last week. Besides, the bearish sentiments around Enjin Coin (ENJ) have increased by 18% in the past week. At the time of writing, Enjin Coin (ENJ) is available to trade at $0.44.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Collateral Network (COLT) Shows Skyrocketing Potential</p>
<p class="s6">With the advent of Collateral Network (COLT), gone are the days when lending was an extremely draining and complex task.</p>
<p class="s6">Collateral Network (COLT) is the first decentralized cross-chain network that allows crowdlending against non-traditional assets like luxury watches, fine art, wine, and more. The platform assesses and evaluates physical assets, and mints an NFT against them. These NFTs are broken up into multiple pieces, letting the community fund loans backed by them on a fixed amount of interest rate.</p>
<p class="s6">This revolutionary ecosystem is beneficial to both borrowers and lenders. Borrowers can get a fast and low-cost loan that is secured on the blockchain, and private in terms of footprint on credit history. On the other hand, lenders enjoy the security of their investments, and earn a fixed passive income. </p>
<p class="s6">Powered by the project&rsquo;s utility token, COLT, holders will get special discounts on borrowing and trading fees along with voting rights on key matters.</p>
<p class="s6">The liquidity pool is locked for 33 years, and merely 38% of the total supply of 1.4 billion COLT tokens is available for presale. Collateral Network is currently selling at a price of $0.014. Therefore, investors and whales across the globe are seizing this great opportunity to invest in Collateral Network (COLT) as it is set to increase 35x in the next few months.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has seen its fair share of meteoric rises. A recent example is Cannation (CNNC), a weed-related meme coin that can be mined, which has experienced an astounding increase of over 1,250,000% in just 30 days. With such explosive growth, investors are now turning their attention to other potential high-growth opportunities, such as DigiToads(TOADS). In this article, we explore the reasons behind Cannation's surge and whether DigiToads could be the next big thing in the crypto market.DigiToads (TOADS)</p>
<p>DigiToads, an ERC-20 token stands out from other altcoins due to its emphasis on utility and community involvement. The project incorporates a play-to-earn gaming platform, allowing users to collect, nurture, and battle digital toads, while earning TOADS tokens as rewards. Integrating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into the ecosystem further enhances the project's appeal, with a collection of 3,500 unique NFTs launching during the presale. These stakeable NFTs provide additional opportunities for users to earn rewards, attracting investors who appreciate projects with real utility.</p>
<p>The question now is whether DigiToads can emulate the massive growth experienced by Cannation. While predicting the future performance of any cryptocurrency is always uncertain, DigiToads has several factors working in its favor. The project's successful presale, which has raised over $2.45 million so far, indicating strong investor interest and confidence in the project's potential. Moreover, the innovative combination of meme coin features, play-to-earn gaming, and stakeable NFTs sets DigiToads apart from other altcoins, increasing the likelihood of it capturing investor attention.Given the runaway success of its presale, investors and analysts lean towards a resounding yes. Many analysts pointed to the protocol&rsquo;s provision of passive income through NFT staking and TOADS airdrops which the market has not yet factored into its valuation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Cannation (CNNC)</p>
<p>Cannation, an altcoin that centers around the cannabis industry, recently captured headlines due to its exponential growth. This weed-related meme coin, which can be mined, has seen its value increase by more than 1,250,000% within a month. The staggering rise in Cannation's value can be attributed to the growing interest in meme coins and its focus on the cannabis sector, which has gained momentum in recent years. Moreover, the ability to mine CNNC attracts investors looking for ways to generate income. </p>
<p>Cannation Now Massively Overbought</p>
<p>While Cannation has seen a phenomenal increase in value the crypto is now horrifically overbought and investors entering now will most likely get burnt. Hence why attention is now shifting toward other potential high-growth altcoins like DigiToads. With its successful presale, unique combination of features, and strong focus on utility and community involvement, DigiToads stands out as a promising contender in the world of meme coins and ERC-20 tokens. Although predicting the future performance of any cryptocurrency is always a challenge, the factors working in DigiToads' favor suggest it could be well-positioned to follow in Cannation'sfootsteps. Crypto investors work on a probabilistic framework, and probability dictates Cannation retraces after such a violent move, whereas DigiToads has yet to explode upwards making it far more attractive. Become Part of the TOADS Journey TodayWhile nothing is guaranteed in crypto, projects like DigiToads represent an exciting and unique prospect for investors willing to explore the ever-changing landscape of digital assets. Given its innovative approach, strong presale performance, focus on utility, and above all provision of passive income through multiple angles, DigiToads certainly has the potential to become a significant player in the meme coin and altcoin sectors.</p>

With such explosive growth, investors are now turning their attention to other potential high-growth opportunities, such as DigiToads(TOADS). In this article, we explore the reasons behind Cannation's surge and whether DigiToads could be the next big thing in the crypto market.DigiToads (TOADS)</p>
<p>DigiToads, an ERC-20 token stands out from other altcoins due to its emphasis on utility and community involvement. The project incorporates a play-to-earn gaming platform, allowing users to collect, nurture, and battle digital toads, while earning TOADS tokens as rewards. Integrating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into the ecosystem further enhances the project's appeal, with a collection of 3,500 unique NFTs launching during the presale. These stakeable NFTs provide additional opportunities for users to earn rewards, attracting investors who appreciate projects with real utility.</p>
<p>The question now is whether DigiToads can emulate the massive growth experienced by Cannation. While predicting the future performance of any cryptocurrency is always uncertain, DigiToads has several factors working in its favor. The project's successful presale, which has raised over $2.45 million so far, indicating strong investor interest and confidence in the project's potential. Moreover, the innovative combination of meme coin features, play-to-earn gaming, and stakeable NFTs sets DigiToads apart from other altcoins, increasing the likelihood of it capturing investor attention.Given the runaway success of its presale, investors and analysts lean towards a resounding yes. Many analysts pointed to the protocol&rsquo;s provision of passive income through NFT staking and TOADS airdrops which the market has not yet factored into its valuation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Cannation (CNNC)</p>
<p>Cannation, an altcoin that centers around the cannabis industry, recently captured headlines due to its exponential growth. This weed-related meme coin, which can be mined, has seen its value increase by more than 1,250,000% within a month. The staggering rise in Cannation's value can be attributed to the growing interest in meme coins and its focus on the cannabis sector, which has gained momentum in recent years. Moreover, the ability to mine CNNC attracts investors looking for ways to generate income. </p>
<p>Cannation Now Massively Overbought</p>
<p>While Cannation has seen a phenomenal increase in value the crypto is now horrifically overbought and investors entering now will most likely get burnt. Hence why attention is now shifting toward other potential high-growth altcoins like DigiToads. With its successful presale, unique combination of features, and strong focus on utility and community involvement, DigiToads stands out as a promising contender in the world of meme coins and ERC-20 tokens. Although predicting the future performance of any cryptocurrency is always a challenge, the factors working in DigiToads' favor suggest it could be well-positioned to follow in Cannation'sfootsteps. Crypto investors work on a probabilistic framework, and probability dictates Cannation retraces after such a violent move, whereas DigiToads has yet to explode upwards making it far more attractive. Become Part of the TOADS Journey TodayWhile nothing is guaranteed in crypto, projects like DigiToads represent an exciting and unique prospect for investors willing to explore the ever-changing landscape of digital assets. Given its innovative approach, strong presale performance, focus on utility, and above all provision of passive income through multiple angles, DigiToads certainly has the potential to become a significant player in the meme coin and altcoin sectors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">In the cryptocurrency sector, there is always a new coin or token on the rise, with traders and investors keeping a watchful eye on the latest predictions and trends. One such token that has been making waves lately is Yachtify's (YCHT) token. </p>
<p class="s7">According to industry analysts, YCHT's token is poised to skyrocket 4,000x over Binance Coin (BNB) and Litecoin (LTC) shortly. Interestingly, the token is currently in the presale stage offering an opportunity for investors to get in for only $0.01 per token. </p>
<p class="s9">Binance Coin (BNB): Bearish Momentum Coming?</p>
<p class="s7">Last week, Binance Coin (BNB) tried to break above $340 resistance but failed as bears took over, leading to a correction similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Binance Coin's (BNB) price then dropped below $330 support and hit a low of around $320.8. </p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Binance Coin (BNB) is consolidating and trading below $330 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the 4-hour chart of BNB/USD, a bearish trend line with resistance near $333 is also forming.</p>
<p class="s7">If Binance Coin (BNB) fails to surpass the $335 resistance, it may continue to decline. The first level of support is around $320, followed by a major support level near $315. </p>
<p class="s7">If the token's price plunges below $315, it could extend the decline toward the $300 support level. By press time, Binance Coin's (BNB) price is $325.90, In the last 24 hours, the token's price has increased by 0.83%, but it has declined by 1.37% in the past week.</p>
<p class="s9">Litecoin (LTC) Meets Rejection At $90</p>
<p class="s7">According to Litecoin's (LTC) price analysis, the token found support at $86.00 and has since bounced back to $88.00 with bullish momentum. However, there is still strong bearish pressure, as Litecoin (LTC) bulls were rejected at $90.00. </p>
<p class="s7">Litecoin (LTC) is currently in a bearish rally, as the price broke down from $104.00 to $86.00. Nevertheless, the bulls made a partial recovery, and the price rebounded to $88.00.</p>
<p class="s7">According to data from CoinMarketCap, Litecoin (LTC) currently trades at $88.10, with a 24-hour trading volume of $475,893,346. The price has declined by 0.02% in the last 24 hours but has increased by 0.02% in the past seven days.</p>
<p class="s7">Traders should anticipate that Litecoin (LTC) will move sideways at its current price level before continuing its downward trend.</p>
<p class="s9">Yachtify (YCHT): Invest in Boats for Passive Income</p>
<p class="s7">Yachtify will be a new marketplace where users can rent, buy, sell, or own fractional timeshares in various watercraft, including Sunseeker Yachts and Jetskis. The platform will allow investors to create NFTs corresponding to each investment, which can be purchased to claim real-world asset ownership. </p>
<p class="s7">The Yachtify ecosystem encompasses a lending protocol, NFT marketplace, and rewards club, presenting a promising investment opportunity. Additionally, the team has passed KYC and audits by SolidProof, ensuring investor security. </p>
<p class="s7">With Yachtify, you can buy and sell all types of boats on the blockchain, and receive part of the platform fee shares depending on your investment. </p>
<p class="s7">Currently in its first presale stage, Yachtify tokens are priced at only $0.1 per token. Smart and early investors can benefit from a 30% bonus before the price increases at the end of the month. Furthermore, those who purchase an entire NFT can have the corresponding real-world asset (gold, silver, or platinum) delivered to their chosen location.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States Justice Department is investigating cryptocurrency exchange Binance in connection with possible Russian sanction violations.</p>
<p>So far, neither Binance nor the United States Justice Department have commented on the matter.</p>
Binance Under Scrutiny Once Again
<p>According to a report on Friday, the United States is investigating whether Binance Holdings allowed customers based in Russia to access the exchange. This would be in violation of the sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States following the former&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. The inquiry is being led by the Justice Department&rsquo;s national security division. Global regulators have consistently advocated stricter controls and regulations on crypto exchanges such as Binance. According to regulators, more stringent regulations could help curb activities such as money laundering and terror financing.</p>
Previous Action Against Binance
<p>The action by the justice department is the latest high-profile action against Binance and follows a 2021 joint investigation with the Internal Revenue Services against the exchange. Binance is also under investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating the company&rsquo;s relationship with two entities founded by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. A Binance spokesperson speaking on the matter stated that the company complies with all US and international financial sanctions.</p>
<p>Binance was also sued by the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) in March 2023. The CFTC alleged that Binance knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the United States, against federal law. In May 2023, Israel revealed it had seized around 190 Binance accounts with ties to known terrorist groups. However, it still needs to be made clear how Israel managed to seize the accounts since neither Israel nor Binance revealed details about any cooperation. It remains to be seen how Israel seized the accounts since Binance is not obliged to adhere to local laws in Israel.</p>
<p>However, Binance has pushed back against allegations against it, stating that it ensures complete compliance, having assembled the largest compliance team in the crypto space. According to Binance&rsquo;s head of compliance, Tigran Gambaryan, the exchange&rsquo;s compliance team addresses over 1300 law enforcement queries every week. The exchange has also claimed that it has figured out how to keep North Koreans off the exchange.</p>
Binance&rsquo;s Regulatory Woes
<p>Binance has run into trouble with regulators around the world, apart from the seizure of Binance accounts by Israeli authorities. In April, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) canceled Binance&rsquo;s derivatives license, which allowed it to operate in Australia since 2022. The cancellation was in response to a request submitted by Binance. Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Regulatory Authority (VARA) also asked Binance to submit additional information related to the exchange&rsquo;s auditing procedures, governance, and ownership structure. Binance is also subject to a probe by authorities in Brazil, with the authorities confirming the launch of an official investigation into the exchange. Brazilian authorities allege that Binance did not respond to a stop order that directed the exchange to stop selling crypto derivatives.</p>

In April, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) canceled Binance&rsquo;s derivatives license, which allowed it to operate in Australia since 2022. The cancellation was in response to a request submitted by Binance. Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Regulatory Authority (VARA) also asked Binance to submit additional information related to the exchange&rsquo;s auditing procedures, governance, and ownership structure. Binance is also subject to a probe by authorities in Brazil, with the authorities confirming the launch of an official investigation into the exchange. Brazilian authorities allege that Binance did not respond to a stop order that directed the exchange to stop selling crypto derivatives.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James proposed legislation to grant her office greater authority to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reports (WSJ) that New York Attorney General Letitia James proposed a new state law to tighten the rules governing crypto firms. James claims additional measures must be taken as the industry suffers from &ldquo;rampant fraud and dysfunction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposed legislation, dubbed Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency, and Oversight (CRPTO), introduces a rule in which New York requires independent audits of cryptocurrency exchanges and prohibits people from owning both brokerages and tokens in an effort to prevent conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>James explains that her proposal would be &ldquo;the strongest and most comprehensive set of regulations on cryptocurrency in the nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposal further requires crypto platforms to reimburse customers who have fallen victim to fraud and would strengthen the New York State Department of Financial Services&rsquo; authority to regulate digital assets. To this end, Attorney General James said:</p>

<p>Millions of investors have lost hundreds of billions in the value of their cryptocurrency investments because of rampant fraud, including market manipulation, hacking, and opaque business practices.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reports, CRPTO, if adopted by state legislators, would also prevent crypto brokers and marketplaces from trading in their accounts and would ban brokers from borrowing and lending customer assets.</p>
<p>James said in a statement:</p>

<p>Rampant fraud and dysfunction have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency, and it is time to bring law and order to the multi-billion-dollar industry. New York investors should have the peace of mind that there are safeguards in place to protect them and their money.</p>

<p>As an elected official, James seeks jurisdiction to enforce crypto firms&rsquo; violations of the law, issue subpoenas, and impose civil penalties of $10,000 per violation for every individual or $100,000 per violation for each crypto firm, according to the WSJ.</p>
<p>The AG also seeks authority to shutter businesses that engage in alleged fraud and illegality.</p>

<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom continues its fight against unregistered cryptocurrency ATMs (automatic teller machines).

<p>Besides disrupting unregistered crypto businesses, the joint efforts have helped raise awareness of illegally operated crypto ATMs in the UK among the public.

FCA Doubles Down on ATM Crackdown
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s action in Exeter, Nottingham, and Sheffield follows enforcement action taken in East London in March. The FCA and local law enforcement inspected several sites it found to be operating illegally.</p>
<p>The move against crypto ATMs is part of the larger scrutiny of the global crypto industry.</p>
<p>Crypto ATMs have gained in popularity since 2014, allowing millions of users worldwide to conduct seamless crypto-to-fiat conversions, Todayq reports. Between December 2020 and January 2022, more than 1,000 Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ATMs were installed each month globally.</p>
