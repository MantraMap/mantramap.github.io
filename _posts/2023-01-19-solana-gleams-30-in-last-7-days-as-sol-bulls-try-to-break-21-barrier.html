In the next few days, SOL is seen retesting the $18 and $16 supports.  Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: XRP Bulls Aim For $1 As Crypto Advances With 12% Weekly Pump SOL’s bullish pace in the weekly timeframe would certainly have an effect on the token’s ability to recover from the rejection. Although it is highly likely that the $18 support will break, investors and traders can rely on $16 as a launching pad to retest $25 in the coming days or weeks.  If $25 is broken, $30 should be the next target as a breakthrough in this area would give SOL bulls legroom for more upward movement. SOL can rely on a solid ecosystem and a bullish community to recover lost ground. Featured image by Sunshine Adult Day Care
