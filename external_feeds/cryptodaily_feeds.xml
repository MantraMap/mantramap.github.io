			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As CryptoDaily&trade; covered earlier, Choise.com, a revolutional crypto platform connecting CeFi and DeFi, secured a sponsorship deal with the Vienna Vikings, the reigning champions of the European League of Football (ELF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you have missed it, the partnership aims at bridging the worlds of sport and crypto against the backdrop of the American football boom in Europe. Choise.com will support the Vikings throughout their second season in the ELF, inspired by the team&rsquo;s huge potential and gritty determination to augment their collection of trophies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Viennese club has already added the Choise.com branding to its game helmets and social media content, while also providing the company with exposure in Hohe Warte Stadium. The next step in this evolving relationship will be the launch of a special fan-style collection of Crypterium VISA cards honoring the Vienna Vikings&rsquo; players and team officials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We sat down with the Choise.com CEO Vladimir Gorbunov to discover even more exciting details about the company&rsquo;s sensational initiative to support the favorites of Europe's most spectacular American football league.</p>
Seems like the convergence of sports and crypto is a trend that&rsquo;s showing no sign of stopping. What made Choise.com ride this wave?&nbsp;
<p>The phenomenon of the crypto brands scooping up big sports partnerships comes as no surprise; sport, just like cryptocurrency itself, has no boundaries or limits. Effectively, it boasts an extraordinary power to bring together people from all over the world, which can benefit crypto companies in terms of their coverage. By collaborating with the top sports rights holders, crypto advertisers reach out to a multi-million audience of fans who can further become their potential customers and loyal supporters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overriding objective of creating such an alliance is to help as many people as possible to understand crypto banking through the use of products with seamless experience. This is exactly what we took into account when joining forces with the Vienna Vikings. By jumping into the sports sponsorship race, Choise.com got an excellent opportunity to make the crypto lifestyle accessible to all.</p>
How will collaboration with the Vienna Vikings help Choise.com stand out from the competition?
<p>To start with, Choise.com takes precedence as the first crypto firm to team up with the American football club from Europe. Prior to that, we saw a tide of blockchain sponsorships reinforcing teams from the National Football League which is the premier tournament in the USA and Canada. The emergence of the ELF marked a crucial milestone in the history of American football in Europe and the sport itself deservedly gained popularity across the region. In Germany alone, American football experienced a real fan boom, becoming the number two sport behind only football.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Vienna Vikings are the ELF&rsquo;s defending champions. On the road the 2023 season, they are undefeated, which, we believe, is just the beginning of their grand journey to clinching the title once again. The Vikings&rsquo; accomplishments assure a strong presence for Choise.com, allowing us to make the most out of the team&rsquo;s growing influence in Europe and effectively communicate our mission and values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s also important is that this partnership takes place following the &ldquo;crypto winter&rdquo; which made many sports rights holders abandon crypto sponsorships. After all the 2022 collapses, they feel like crypto firms can be unstable partners posing particular financial and reputational risks to the whole industry. In this context, the Vienna Vikings&rsquo; trust in Choise.com and our products serves as a sign of credibility that the whole crypto industry acutely needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
As a result of your joint efforts, Choise.com will give a unique appearance to one of its distinct products &ndash; Crypterium VISA card. Do you plan to expand your partnership with the Vikings into other sectors of your business?&nbsp;
<p>All this is yet to be discussed with our colleagues from the Vienna Vikings. On the Choise.com side, we see enormous potential for our cooperation in many spheres. The NFT market is a fairly promising direction to consider, given that non-fungible tokens are the most common point of contract between crypto and sports. Not to mention that we have already built up high-flying experience in creating digital collectibles &ndash; our latest Chobies NTO Collection was a resounding success, with total sales exceeding $1.9 million.</p>
Are you a fan of American football yourself?
<p>Yes, I absolutely love it! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m even more happier to see our partnership with the Vikings gaining momentum. Doing an honorary toss before the Vikings&rsquo; inaugural game in the 2023 ELF season was a very special moment for me and my son. The overwhelming feeling of unity with the team that I saw and experienced that day, I will never forget.</p>
<p>American football is quite a tough sport bringing a lot of emotions and impressions to its lovers. At the same time, all fans and players seem pretty respectful to each other. For example, it&rsquo;s quite a common case to savor applause to those who were injured, even if they are members of the opposing team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some other subtleties which make American football an extremely appealing experience. We at Choise.com hope it will continue to make a whole lot of noise across the global sport industry, winning the hearts of new fans and onboarding them to a thriving world of crypto assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Polygon has formed its second significant partnership with the Indian government.&nbsp;</p>
A 3-way partnership
<p>The Indian government has partnered with Polygon and Airchains in order to develop a blockchain-based land ownership system. Under this agreement Polygon will closely collaborate with government bodies and stakeholders to explore and implement blockchain solutions across various sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary goal of this partnership is to utilise Polygons' expertise in scalable blockchain infrastructure to enhance existing government initiatives and streamline operations. By integrating blockchain technology into critical systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Airchain, a prominent player in the logistics industry, will also play a vital role in the partnership between Polygon and the Indian government. With its expertise in supply chain management and logistics solutions, Airchain will collaborate with Polygon to streamline and optimise the movement of goods within the blockchain-powered ecosystem.</p>
Two areas where blockchain provides the solution
<p>Land document mutation is a real issue in India and can often lead to landowners unlawfully losing possession of their land. The implementation of a system based on the transparency of blockchain will aim to bring trust back into land ownership transactions.</p>
<p>An additional and exciting new development that can become a reality through blockchain is that of fractional property ownership. Once properly implemented, the door will be open for many citizens to be able to own a fractional share of land, something that was unthinkable not so long ago.</p>
A Digital India
<p>This collaboration aligns with the Indian government's vision of a Digital India by accelerating the country's journey towards digital transformation. Polygons' established reputation, technical proficiency, and commitment to scalability make it an ideal partner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As demand for blockchain based solutions continues to rise, Polygon's infrastructure and expertise can play a crucial role in realising India's digital aspirations. This collaboration has the potential not only to unlock new possibilities but also drive innovation while establishing India as a global leader in blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By actively pursuing partnerships with prominent projects like Polygon the Indian government demonstrates its proactive approach towards embracing cutting edge technologies. Such collaborations foster cooperation, knowledge sharing, and innovation&mdash;an ecosystem that can keep India at the forefront of digital progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its endeavour to further engage with the Indian government, Polygon aims to create ripple effects that surpass national boundaries. This distinctive partnership paves the way for other governments globally, exhibiting how blockchain technology can bring about transformative changes in addressing tangible obstacles and stimulating socioeconomic advancement.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Popular walk-and-earn platform Sweat Economy has unveiled its latest initiative, Sweat Hero, this Wednesday. The hyper-casual community-based NFT game allows players to compete against friends on the Sweat Wallet mobile app, which uses data from other apps on your smartphone or smartwatch to monitor your physical activity. The game is created based on sustainable token economics, aiming to enhance the overall competition levels and maintain a thriving gaming ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sweat Hero introduces a unique approach to how gaming works. In contrast to the &ldquo;pay-to-play&rdquo; models adopted by legacy games, Sweat Hero offers new players a free non-fungible token (NFT) to start the game - basically, paying the users to play. Users connect with each other via the Sweat Wallet app and battle against each other to upgrade their NFTs or win $SWEAT token rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offering a free-to-play model also contrasts with most of the move-to-earn games today. Sweat Hero revolutionizes this industry by creating a sustainable tokenomics (token economics) model that doesn&rsquo;t involve asking players to purchase NFTs worth hundreds of dollars before playing. Many of these NFT games and M2E platforms sustain their economy by expecting new users to join and purchase an NFT. Additionally, the teams may limit the number of NFTs to induce artificial scarcity and potentially increase their value, preventing some players from ever getting their hands on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the contrary, Sweat Hero launches a &ldquo;token sink model&rdquo; that solves these problems and increases the economic viability of the game&rsquo;s ecosystem. The token sink system works by retaining 20% of the total battle wager as a battle fee, with 80% of the wager going to the winner. The battle fee is sent to Sweat Wallet&rsquo;s token sink and burned to reduce the total number of circulating $SWEAT tokens. As more people join the battle, more tokens will be burned, meaning there will be fewer idle and liquid tokens in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;"We're leaving behind the times of scarcity in the NFT space and breaking the old standard of 'pay to play' in the M2E gaming space,&rdquo;&nbsp; Oleg Fomenko, Co-founder of Sweat Economy, shared. &ldquo;With Sweat Hero, millions of people can engage with free NFTs, and the more players we have, the more $SWEAT goes into the token sink, making token economics sustainable."</p>

<p>As players win battles and challenges by increasing their daily steps, they will enhance their NFT Power, giving them an in-game advantage. These NFTs are dynamic and will evolve based on users' gameplay progression, physical activities, and engagement within the Sweat Wallet app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from rewards and earnings in the game, the gamification of physical activity on Sweat Hero makes exercising more fun and motivates users to follow their daily exercise routines. These factors can have an overarching effect on the overall health of the users by motivating users to walk more, creating a daily habit and driving engagement through battles with friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future upgrades on Sweat Wallet will introduce seven Arenas that players can level up into to secure a higher earning potential and a new dynamic NFT evolvement framework expected to launch in Q4 this year.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bears Eye Stops Below 30635:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 6 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to orbit the 31000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair remained within striking distance of testing the recent twelve-month high around the 31443.67 area, just below an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area. Decent selling pressure intensified around the 31142.38 area and this elevates the risk of another test of the 29427 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;Below that area, the 28604.83 level represents the 50% retracement of that appreciating range.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30576.33 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30698.91.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bears Eye Stops Below 30635:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 6 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to orbit the 31000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair remained within striking distance of testing the recent twelve-month high around the 31443.67 area, just below an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area. Decent selling pressure intensified around the 31142.38 area and this elevates the risk of another test of the 29427 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;Below that area, the 28604.83 level represents the 50% retracement of that appreciating range.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30576.33 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30698.91.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Great Scott! Just as crypto itself is constantly evolving, so is its close relative, the world of online crypto gambling! Despite the huge success that many platforms within the market have already experienced, this hybrid industry is still young and growing in prominence, meaning right now is an important time to pay attention to all the progress it's making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good way to track this is by taking a look at the future long-term plans of some of the best platforms around, such as Scorpion Casino (SCORP), Fun Token (FUN) and Stake.com. Scorpion is especially worth paying attention to at the moment - read more to find out why.</p>
Scorpion Aims To Change The Game!
<p>Scorpion Casino is currently in the midst of a widely successful presale, which will end with the launch of its native Scorpion Token (SCORP). SCORP will be a deflationary token that improves alongside the platform through automatic burns every single time a user makes a transaction and every single time the casino generates profit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of the upcoming token is important due to the position it holds as the asset that empowers the platform&rsquo;s ecosystem and its total 370 licensed games (210 casino games and 160 live games) as well as all the sports betting opportunities for popular sports such as American Basketball and International Football. The token will join a short but solid list of top cryptos users can bet with, including the biggest crypto of all time, Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
Have All The FUN You Want With The Token
<p>As suggested by its name, Fun Token is a platform focused on becoming the home of all the fun users can have online when it comes to crypto gaming. The platform prides itself on being a diverse place that offers fairness and transparency to all of its player base, meaning that everyone can bet and play amongst each other using the assets in their wallets without any worries of being taken advantage of or worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the latest developments being made in the world of Fun token are about accessibility. The project has partnered with Now Payments that has made for users to pay with FUN easier than before and the integration with ChangeNOW DEX, ensures faster and more secure FUN token swaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Stake.com Builds An Empire
<p>Stake.com is an online sportsbook and casino that debuted in 2017 and shot to fame right away. They quickly rose to the position of becoming one of the world's largest online casinos, thanks to its numerous sponsorship agreements. The success of Stake.com is proof that the merger of crypto and betting will become a telling tale in the near future!</p>
<p>According to rumours, Rush Street Interactive may be on Stake.com's list of prospective targets as it seeks acquisitions that could provide it access to the US iGaming market. The platform wants to expand into more regulated gambling areas in the US and abroad. Furthermore, Stake is also aiming to obtain a licence in Australia's regulated online gambling industry. It also has an application for iGaming in Ontario, Canada, that it is currently waiting to hear back from. Considering the fact that Stake is based out of Cura&ccedil;ao and already has offices all over the world, global domination is clearly on its agenda!</p>
<p></p>
How Scorpion Claws its Way To The Top
<p>One of the platform's primary focuses is its community, ensuring that all its users have an enjoyable and lucrative experience on the platform to make sure they keep coming back for more. Users can create a passive income avenue on the platform, potentially earning up to $10,000 per day by betting with SCORP, thanks to its integrated distribution. On top of that, users can earn rewards of $1000 upwards if they take part in other platform features, such as signing up for the VIP Members Club and much more. There&rsquo;s even more about the platform that could establish it as the go-to place once the presale is over, but for now, when it comes to earning opportunities - it's unmatched!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In its latest blogpost, Choise.com, a gateway crypto platform blending CeFi and DeFi in one concept, has revealed their exclusive partnership with the ELF (European League of Football) champions Vienna Vikings. According to the official statement, this effort is intended to encourage cryptocurrency adoption among numerous fans of American football around the world.</p>
<p>The collaboration with the Vienna Vikings marks the Choise.com&rsquo;s active involvement in the sports industry. As American football is now booming across Europe, this newly forged alliance promises a global wave of interest to the ever-growing crypto ecosystem. Choise.com has already onboarded more than 1 million users in over 170 countries to its platform and keeps spreading awareness about digital assets by joining efforts with the leading brands from various sectors.&nbsp;</p>
Why the Vienna Vikings?
<p>The Vienna Vikings have dominated American football in Austria for the past two decades. The club boasts a truly rich heritage which includes winning the national Austrian Bowl 15 times in their history, as well as capturing the Eurobowl title 5 times from 2004 to 2007 and in 2013. The beginning of the Vikings&rsquo; journey in the ELF, the Europe&rsquo;s biggest American football tournament, turned out to be striking &ndash; they triumphantly won their first season in 2022, beating the Hamburg Sea Devils in the Championship Game with a score of 27-15.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, the Viennese club is committed to Running It Back and repeating their resounding success in the third season of the ELF. After a continuous streak of 4 wins over the Berlin Thunder, the Prague Lions, the Leipzig Kings, and the Fehervar Enthroners, the Vikings opened further their lead in the standings ahead of matchups against the Raiders Tirol and the Panthers Wroclaw.</p>
<p>Next to that, the Vienna Vikings, rooted in the American Football &amp; Cheerleading Club of the Vikings, have established themselves as a powerhouse program with great youth development. Among their most famous inmates are Bernhard Raimann (OL Indianapolis Colts) and Bernhard Seikovits (TE Arizona Cardinals) who are currently shining in the NFL.</p>
<p>All this coupled with a persuasive fanbase resulted in the Vienna Vikings becoming the right partner for Choise.com, making its grand entrance into the thriving American football space.</p>
The Mutually Beneficial Relationship
<p>Choise.com is assured of a beneficial association because of the Vienna Vikings&rsquo; palpable affluence within Europe. Meanwhile, by collaborating with the reigning ELF champion, the platform will enhance the club&rsquo;s branding in several aspects such as the team&rsquo;s apparel, social media presence, and stadium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of the Choise.com logo featuring prominently in all official helmets, there is another joint initiative that has been planned for execution as well. Through their partnership with the Vienna Vikings, Choise.com intends to launch a unique line of Crypterium cards with a bespoke design celebrating the club and its team members. Crypterium card is a VISA card available for order in over 30 countries. Choise.com users can issue both virtual and plastic versions of the card, replenish it from their wallets, make worldwide payments wherever VISA is accepted, as well as withdraw cash from ATMs in more than 200 countries.To date, the product already serves over 50,000 clients.</p>
<p>On June 24, the Vikings demonstrated their newly branded helmets for the first time. This happened during their inaugural matchup against the Leipzig Kings. The game started with the opening ceremony during which the CEO of Choise.com Vladimir Gorbunov together with his son did the honorary coin toss in the center of the Hohe Warte stadium. But the real cherry on the cake was the incredible victory of the Vienna Vikings who defeated their rivals 47-14 in acknowledgment of a longstanding cooperation with the crypto platform. Since that day, the team has remained unbeaten and only strengthened their positions in the standings after the latest triumph over the Fehervar Enthrodes, 41-12.</p>
<p>Choise.com is an all-purpose crypto platform offering a broad set of crypto banking services at the junction of CeFi and DeFi. This includes purchasing and earning crypto in interest accounts, Web3 staking, generating profits from NFTs, as well as trying out dual-currency investments with high yields. You can also enjoy all the platform&rsquo;s features on the go by downloading the Choise.com mobile app.</p>
<p>What else makes Choise.com stand out from the competition is its latest state-of-art product &ndash; BitDriven index token overseen by acclaimed cryptocurrency researchers and analysts. Through this tool users can gain exposure to the portfolio of the most promising coins with a persuasive performance history and good fundamental reasons for substantial growth. The collective value of this portfolio is supposed to grow up to x12 after the 2024 Bitcoin halving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choise.com will provide support to the Vienna Vikings throughout the entire 2023 season, bringing digital assets closer than ever before to thousands of its enthusiastic fans.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The UK parliament has passed a bill that could help the authorities to seize and freeze cryptocurrencies that have been used for crime.&nbsp;</p>
Cryptos Can Be Seized Under New Bill?
<p>In a significant move to combat cryptocurrency-related crime, the UK House of Lords has passed a bill that empowers authorities to seize and freeze digital assets involved in illegal activities. The legislation aims to address the growing concern of cryptocurrencies being exploited by criminals for money laundering, fraud, and other illicit purposes. The bill, titled &ldquo;Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill,&rdquo; received overwhelming support from the House of Lords on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the provisions of the bill, authorities will have the power to freeze and seize cryptocurrencies suspected to be linked to criminal enterprises. The bill had been previously amended to include terrorism cases. The legislation also mandates exchanges and custodian services to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, providing them with access to relevant transactional information.</p>
How Is The Bill Becoming A Law?
<p>The bill was first introduced in September 2022, when Director General of the National Crime Agency, Graeme Biggar, said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Domestic and international criminals have for years laundered the proceeds of their crime and corruption by abusing U.K. company structures, and are increasingly using cryptocurrencies. These reforms &ndash; long awaited and much welcomed &ndash; will help us crack down on both."</p>

<p>Later in March, the government revealed its three-year economic crime agenda which including the fight against criminal abuse of crypto. As a part of the agenda to help identify digital assets linked to criminal activities, crypto tactical advisers have been incorporated into nationwide police departments.</p>
<p>In the next step, the bill will now proceed to the House of Commons for further review and debate. It will be passed back and forth between the chambers of Parliament until the House of Lords and the House of Commons both sign off on the document. Once an agreement is reached, it will be presented before the king, who can then sign it into law.&nbsp;</p>
UK Continues Its Crypto Stride
<p>The UK government has recognized the need to adapt its legal framework to keep pace with technological advancements and emerging threats in the digital realm. Most recently, the House of Lords passed the Financial Services and Markets Bill to regulate Bitcoin and crypto in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By bringing cryptocurrencies under the purview of existing anti-money laundering and asset forfeiture regulations, the bill aims to close existing loopholes and strengthen the country's financial integrity.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the wake of a series of high-profile security breaches plaguing the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, a proposed solution has emerged from the Ethereum community.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A group of Ethereum community members has put forth a new standard, ERC 7265, aiming to enhance the security of DeFi protocols. This standard could be pivotal in mitigating the risk of significant losses due to hacks and other security threats in an increasingly vulnerable DeFi landscape.</p>
Alarming Vulnerabilities
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape has been marred by an upswing in security breaches recently, with protocols including Poly Network, Chibi Finance, Sturdy Finance, Jimbos Protocol on Arbitrum, Hundred Finance, Sentiment, Deus Finance, and Tornado Cash, among others, all falling prey to malicious actors.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As these attacks escalate, both in frequency and impact, this proposal addresses some of the risks that the aforementioned exploits represent. The urgency for effective protective measures in the DeFi sector has been driven by several high-profile hacking incidents. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These incidents highlight a critical vulnerability in the DeFi sector. Once protocols are compromised, the damage is often irreparable, causing total value locked (TVL) to plummet to zero within seconds. Against this backdrop, the Ethereum community is rallying to propose a standard known as ERC 7265.</p>
Circuit Breaker: ERC 7265
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Ethereum community's proposed standard, ERC 7265, suggests the integration of a "circuit breaker" into DeFi protocols. This feature could act as a fail-safe in smart contracts, stopping token transactions before they exit contracts during a hack.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">"ERC 7265 allows teams to create a circuit breaker protecting their protocol, with highly customized rate limit parameters per asset," explains Meir Bank of Fluid Protocol. In the event of a hack, he says, "the attacker will no longer be able to drain an entire contract in seconds. The majority of funds can be recovered."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The ERC 7265 standard is primarily intended for DeFi protocols that can be upgraded by governance, a common practice in DeFi. Bank assures that this integration carries few downsides and numerous benefits for such governed DeFi protocols.</p>
The Path Forward?
<p class="md-end-block md-p">ERC 7265 is currently in the proposal stage and awaits approval by the broader Ethereum community. If accepted and implemented by core developers, it could become a critical tool in the ongoing battle against DeFi hacks.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The proposed ERC 7265 could play a key role in improving Ethereum's ecosystem. It comes in response to ongoing security worries in DeFi protocols, many of which are based on Ethereum. As we see, these requent exploits have shaken trust in these platforms.The Ethereum community's proactive stance in proposing ERC 7265 underscores the industry's commitment to tackling the security issues head-on. As DeFi continues to mature and evolve, protective measures like this circuit breaker may prove crucial in safeguarding protocols and building trust within the community. In the dynamic world of DeFi, one thing remains certain: security must remain at the forefront of every attempt at innovation.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The floor price of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection has dropped to the lowest in the last 20 months.&nbsp;</p>
BAYC Drops Below 30 ETH
<p>The forecast does not look good for NFTs, as the most popular collection ever, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), has sunk to a 20-month low. According to a report from the data analytics platform, CoinGecko, the floor price of the NFT collection from the iconic Yuga Labs drastically fell to 27.4 ETH, which is around $53,000 on Sunday evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NFT marketplace OpenSea claimed that the collection&rsquo;s trading volume has dropped by a significant 38% in just 24 hours. It did recover from the bottom, however, slightly, settling around 29.5 ETH at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p>
50% Decrease Since April&nbsp;
<p>The floor price is the lowest value a seller is willing to accept for an NFT and is a crucial indicator of the NFT&rsquo;s demand and popularity. For the BAYC collection, the floor price has experienced a 50% decrease since April of this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, it was being traded at 64 ETH, equivalent to approximately $126,000. However, across the month, pseudonymous collector Franklin sold 27 NFTs from his BAYC collection, which must have compounded the lack of interest further, dropping the floor price to a five-month low of 55.6 ETH, or about $110,000.</p>
Collectors Questioning BAYC Investment
<p>This is tough news for the collection, which has almost always seen high demand. In fact, the last time its floor price was below 30 ETH was back in October 2021. However, soon after, the NFT boom hit, and BAYC&rsquo;s floor price skyrocketed to new all-time highs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bored Ape Yacht Club, a popular and highly sought-after NFT collection known for its unique pixelated ape characters, had garnered significant attention and fetched substantial prices in the past, its highest being 153.7 ETH (approximately $430,000) in April 2022.&nbsp; However, the recent drop in floor prices has caught many collectors off guard, leaving them questioning the future of the collection and the broader NFT market.&nbsp;</p>
Many Challenges For NFT Market
<p>Other than the overall bearish market, experts also believe that the initial frenzy and hype surrounding NFTs have subsided, leading to a decline in demand and, subsequently, lower prices. According to OpenSea, this could be a result of the long crypto winter that pulled down the price of Ethereum. As a result, this has affected the price of the NFT collections like BAYC, which are powered by Ethereum. Other collections affected by the crypto winter are&nbsp; MoonBirds, Azuki, Doodles, and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the BAYC collection itself has seen a surge in supply that has put additional pressure on the prices, leading to the significant drop witnessed recently.</p>
<p>Additionally, the increased regulatory scrutiny toward NFTs and the broader cryptocurrency industry has introduced an element of uncertainty, causing some investors to pull back and leading to a decline in prices.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Still above $30,000, bitcoin looks to be gathering strength to make that all-important break of the $31,000 level.</p>
<p>The crypto market is in calmer waters currently as it looks to bitcoin to make that definitive move past $31,000. Given the sheer scale of the resistance above, bitcoin will need to gather the help of all the bulls in order to be successful.</p>
Momentum still gathering
<p>One of its main weapons to surpass the resistance will be momentum, and short term Stochastic RSIs are resetting to the bottom as bitcoin traverses sideways.</p>
<p>The daily timeframe RSI would be a major help, and this is now passing the halfway point on its way down. Once at the bottom and the signal lines cross up this can be a major sign that bitcoin has the impetus to make the break.</p>
Bullish chart patterns
<p>Having started this particular attack on resistance on June 15, the price reached a high on June 23 before traversing sideways, forming a bull flag as it went. The measured move for the flag is $36,000, the next real level of resistance after $31,000.</p>
<p>Another, even more bullish chart pattern has reached completion. This is a potential cup and handle pattern that started to form in early June 2022. The cup was completed on April 14 this year, and now the handle has also been completed. The measured move for this would be a massive move to $46,000.</p>
Institutional buying just around the corner
<p>If one takes into account the potential for enormous institutional buying should the Blackrock Spot Bitcoin ETF, and others be approved, then the second of these technical targets wouldn&rsquo;t be out of bitcoin&rsquo;s reach.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Still above $30,000, bitcoin looks to be gathering strength to make that all-important break of the $31,000 level.</p>
<p>The crypto market is in calmer waters currently as it looks to bitcoin to make that definitive move past $31,000. Given the sheer scale of the resistance above, bitcoin will need to gather the help of all the bulls in order to be successful.</p>
Momentum still gathering
<p>One of its main weapons to surpass the resistance will be momentum, and short term Stochastic RSIs are resetting to the bottom as bitcoin traverses sideways.</p>
<p>The daily timeframe RSI would be a major help, and this is now passing the halfway point on its way down. Once at the bottom and the signal lines cross up this can be a major sign that bitcoin has the impetus to make the break.</p>
Bullish chart patterns
<p>Having started this particular attack on resistance on June 15, the price reached a high on June 23 before traversing sideways, forming a bull flag as it went. The measured move for the flag is $36,000, the next real level of resistance after $31,000.</p>
<p>Another, even more bullish chart pattern has reached completion. This is a potential cup and handle pattern that started to form in early June 2022. The cup was completed on April 14 this year, and now the handle has also been completed. The measured move for this would be a massive move to $46,000.</p>
Institutional buying just around the corner
<p>If one takes into account the potential for enormous institutional buying should the Blackrock Spot Bitcoin ETF, and others be approved, then the second of these technical targets wouldn&rsquo;t be out of bitcoin&rsquo;s reach.</p>
<p>In spite of impending regulation for cryptocurrencies and all sorts of log jams being thrust into the sector by traditional financial agencies that now see crypto as a real threat to fiat currencies, the mood in the crypto sector is certainly a lot better than it was back in the depths of crypto winter back in November last year.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Members of the Azuki decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) have initiated a Snapshot proposal to hold the project&rsquo;s founder accountable over allegations of misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The accusations arise from the release of Azuki&rsquo;s Elementals collection, which launched last month, with buyers complaining that the NFTs are extremely similar to the original set, sold in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
A Frustrated Community&nbsp;
<p>The latest collection, called Elementals, could only be minted by users who held the original Azuki collection and a side project called BEANZ. The new set of NFTs, which represented half a suite of a collection of 20,000 profile pictures (PFPs), sold out in less than 15 minutes. The sale was able to raise 20,000 ETH ($39.4 million) for Chiru Labs, the LA-based startup that is behind the NFT collection, having a mint price of 2 ETH ($3900). The original Azuki collection had a floor price of 6.3 ETH ($12,400).&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after the sale, some buyers began complaining that the new collection was too similar to the original Azuki PFPs sold in 2022. The Snapshot proposal states,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have provided support to Azuki during its highs and lows. We have contributed to building a sub-community and promoting the brand in various ways, mostly on social media such as Redbook, Twitter, and in our discord. Despite our efforts, we have only been given a similar profile picture to that of the original Azuki holders and nothing more. The team is blatantly scamming us with empathy checks and promises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If passed, the DAO proposal would look for a lawyer to initiate a suit against the pseudo-anonymous co-founder of Azuki, Zagabond. It would also seek a refund, with all funds directed towards the project&rsquo;s growth and supporting research required for the lawsuit. Zagabond is the pseudo-anonymous founder of Chiru Labs, Azuki&rsquo;s parent company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DAO claims that the Azuki team has done nothing but issue the community members a profile picture similar to that of the original Azuki holders and nothing more and is convinced that the team is scamming them. The DAO members are overwhelmingly in favor of filing a lawsuit against Zagabond, retrieving a refund of 20,000 ETH, and redirecting it towards the project&rsquo;s growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Azuki Dao hires a lawyer and files a lawsuit against Zagabond for rugging multiple projects. Azuki Dao retrieves a refund of 20,000E from the team and allocates it to the Dao to promote the growth of the entire Azuki community and provide rewards and incentives for artists, content creators, and builders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zagabond had admitted in 2022 that he had abandoned three NFT projects, Tendies, CryptoPhunks, and CryptoZunks. He had claimed at the time that he was not happy with the development of the projects in question, an admission that had generated significant controversy at the time. So far, voting data has revealed that over 60% of the DAO members have voted in favor of the proposal.</p>
Not An Official Organization&nbsp;
<p>However, it must also be noted that the Azuki DAO is not an official organization associated with the project. The group claims that it was formed to support the project, with the token being utilized for voting minted just over the weekend and airdropped to Azuki holders. Twitter user @tytaninc highlighted the same, stating that the group could have malicious intent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s more info on where the original tweet about the AzukiDAO came from. Most Azuki holders have never heard of this group and assume it&rsquo;s either fake or a group with malicious intent. The token for voting was minted two days ago, sooo there&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;</p>

Azuki Team Addresses Backlash&nbsp;
<p>The Azuki team addressed the backlash on Twitter, stating that it had missed the mark with the collection and that the mint process was extremely hectic. The team tweeted on their official handle,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time, we missed the mark,&rdquo; and acknowledging that &ldquo;the [profile picture NFTs] feel similar and, even worse, dilutive to Azuki. Azuki&rsquo;s vision is to build a decentralized brand. Doing so requires great communication and execution, both of which were lacking with the Elementals sale. We know that we lost a piece of trust today, but nothing gets us more motivated to make things right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The CEO of NFT gaming studio MyMetaverse, Simon Kertonegoro also criticized the project, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is absolutely the project&rsquo;s responsibility to create real products that can generate real revenue from outside markets. We need to normalize crypto and NFT projects as having real business models. They need to serve the wider market.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>McDermott Will &amp; Emery, the law firm representing Voyager&rsquo;s committee of unsecured creditors, has sent the group a staggering bill of over $5 million for the work it has done between the months of March and May.</p>
<p>The latest bill reinforces the perception in crypto circles that legal firms are raking in the money at the expense of the creditors they are representing.</p>
A Hefty Legal Bill
<p>The bill for legal services provided by the law firm was revealed in a legal filing submitted to the United States Bankruptcy Court of New York&rsquo;s Southern District on the 3rd of July, 2022. The latest bill brings the total compensation charged to the group of creditors to over $16 million, significantly above the $11.2 million initially budgeted as part of the restructuring process. The creditors have so far paid $8.9 million in legal fees to the firm. According to the filing, the blended hourly rate for all timekeepers stands at $1026.76.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest areas of billing from attorneys of McDermott Will &amp; Emery for the stipulated months in question include $1 million billed for nearly 917 hours of work on plan and disclosure settlement. This includes discussing sale options with debtors, meeting potential buyers, and examining objections that other stakeholders have presented. In previous fee periods, significant work was carried out on plan and disclosure settlement during a potential sale of Voyager assets to FTX. However, this deal collapsed when FTX itself filed for bankruptcy. This legal bill comes over, and above a $1.1 million bill that Voyager paid to the law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis for work it completed when representing the exchange.</p>
Law Firms Make Merry
<p>The market downturn has led to many crypto firms going bankrupt, something that has been highly profitable for law firms. Voyager itself had filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after the firm revealed it had considerable exposure to Three Arrows Capital, the collapsed crypto hedge fund. Voyager then tried to broker deals with several entities, including FTX and Binance. However, the FTX deal fell through after the Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The FTX bankruptcy was the largest bankruptcy in the crypto industry thus far.</p>
<p>Following these developments, Binance backed out of the potential deal in April 2023, citing a hostile regulatory climate prevailing in the United States, thanks to the position taken on crypto by current United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved a liquidation plan for Voyager which would see its customers being reimbursed $1.33 billion in digital assets.</p>
<p>The entire legal process has resulted in Voyager having to spend a fortune on legal fees. Last week, reports emerged that Kirkland &amp; Ellis, the law firm representing Voyager, charged the company $1.1 million for work it had completed in April of this year.</p>
One Man&rsquo;s Loss Is Another&rsquo;s Gain
<p>The crypto winter, which started with the de-pegging of Terra&rsquo;s algorithmic stablecoin UST and the collapse of its entire ecosystem, set off a domino effect in the crypto space. As a result of the collapse, the contagion spread, leading to the collapse of several prominent crypto entities. This list includes Vauld, Celsius, Hodlnaut, BlockFi, Voyager, and FTX, entities that were considered leading lights in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Lawyers and legal firms have taken full advantage, making a significant amount from the beleaguered firms in the form of legal fees. In December 2022, lawyers representing bankrupt crypto lender Celsius, one of the first casualties of the crypto winter, billed the firm nearly $53 million in legal fees for the period beginning since the firm filed for bankruptcy until October of the same year. Celsius had filed for Chapter 11 in Mid-July, 2022.</p>
<p>FTX, the biggest casualty of the crypto winter, has run up a legal bill of over $200 million since the time it filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. It is also worth noting that FTX going bankrupt impacted over 130 entities that were affiliated with the exchange.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Decoding the Poly Network Exploit: Key Lessons in Smart Contract Security</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The DeFi world was rocked recently as Poly Network, a decentralized finance protocol that facilitates asset transfers across various blockchains, fell prey to its second major hack. This incident is a stark reminder of the critical role of smart contract security in the rapidly evolving DeFi and crypto industry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On July 2nd, a breach affected Poly Network, with the exploit potentially impacting as many as 57 different asset types across 10 blockchains. According to security analysts, hackers allegedly leveraged a vulnerability in the smart contract system that allowed thgem to mint an unlimited amount of tokens. An estimated $42 billion worth of tokens were minted, although only about $5 million have been reportedly cashed out.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Poly Network isn't alone in its security woes. The DeFi and Web3 space has been marred by a series of similar exploits, with millions of dollars worth of digital assets lost to hackers. Many of these attacks, like the one against Poly Network, have leveraged vulnerabilities in smart contract systems. These programmable agreements, which execute transactions automatically when predetermined conditions are met, are a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem but also a prime target for cybercriminals.</p>
Severity of the Exploit: Understanding the Consequences
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Poly Network hack underscores the severity and potential consequences of smart contract vulnerabilities. In the immediate aftermath, the total value locked on Poly Network plunged from $277 million to $176 million, a clear indication of the loss in user confidence. The ripple effects of such an incident can be wide-ranging, from an erosion of trust in the protocol to a broader negative impact on the DeFi market. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Such a hack also highlights the risks involved in the relatively new field of cross-chain transactions. As more DeFi platforms aim to enable seamless transactions across various blockchains, ensuring the security of these cross-chain protocols is a challenge that cannot be overlooked.</p>
Analyzing the Exploit: Unpacking the Technical Details
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The recent Poly Network exploit underpins the role of effective security measures in ensuring the integrity of blockchain networks, especially given the sophistication and complexity of the attack vectors involved. By forging proofs and potentially compromising private keys or executing a multi-signature service attack, the hacker was able to manipulate the LockProxy cross-chain bridge contract.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To begin with, the attacker used the lock function to lock a small amount of Lever Token. The subsequent transaction, viewed on the Poly Network explorer, indicated that the action had been validated through the relay chain. However, when the hacker moved to the BNB chain and initiated withdrawal operations via the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function, the withdrawal quantity did not match the originally locked amount. Further examination of the relay chain network did not show any records of this transaction.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At this point, two possibilities were considered: the leakage of signatures or the modification of keepers, entities responsible for signing user withdrawals. Controlling a keeper would allow the attacker to initiate withdrawals with forged signatures, leading to unauthorized transactions. Analyzing the attacker's use of the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function indicated that keepers had not been modified, directing the suspicion towards compromised keeper private keys or a multi-signature service attack.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Following the trail, three keepers were identified as potential compromise victims, underlining a significant security risk. If proven true, this would mean the attacker could initiate withdrawals and create seemingly valid transactions, bypassing the protocols' security measures.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Such an exploit demonstrates the need for advanced security strategies, including enhanced private key management and robust signature verification processes. If overlooked, these vulnerabilities can provide potential entry points for attackers to exploit and wreak havoc on blockchain networks, as illustrated by the Poly Network case. With the DeFi and crypto industry still at an early phase of developmental maturity, it's vital for protocol developers to continuously learn from such incidents, fortifying their systems against potential breaches, and upholding user trust.</p>
Addressing Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Smart contract vulnerabilities can be mitigated, albeit not entirely eliminated. An effective approach involves a combination of preventive measures and reactive strategies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Preventive measures include rigorous testing of smart contracts before deployment and regular audits by external security firms. These audits can help identify and rectify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Code review and bug bounty programs, where programmers are rewarded for discovering and reporting software bugs, can also be instrumental in fortifying smart contract security.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">From a reactive standpoint, developers can use upgradeable smart contracts that allow for the modification of the contract's code post-deployment. This feature can be crucial for responding swiftly and effectively to discovered vulnerabilities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Moving forward, it's clear that smart contract security must be at the forefront of DeFi protocol development. As the case of Poly Network demonstrates, the stakes are high, and the fallout from a breach can be devastating. By embracing rigorous security measures and continually learning from past incidents, the DeFi industry can help mitigate these risks and foster a more secure and resilient ecosystem.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Poly Network hack underscores the severity and potential consequences of smart contract vulnerabilities. In the immediate aftermath, the total value locked on Poly Network plunged from $277 million to $176 million, a clear indication of the loss in user confidence. The ripple effects of such an incident can be wide-ranging, from an erosion of trust in the protocol to a broader negative impact on the DeFi market. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Such a hack also highlights the risks involved in the relatively new field of cross-chain transactions. As more DeFi platforms aim to enable seamless transactions across various blockchains, ensuring the security of these cross-chain protocols is a challenge that cannot be overlooked.</p>
Analyzing the Exploit: Unpacking the Technical Details
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The recent Poly Network exploit underpins the role of effective security measures in ensuring the integrity of blockchain networks, especially given the sophistication and complexity of the attack vectors involved. By forging proofs and potentially compromising private keys or executing a multi-signature service attack, the hacker was able to manipulate the LockProxy cross-chain bridge contract.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To begin with, the attacker used the lock function to lock a small amount of Lever Token. The subsequent transaction, viewed on the Poly Network explorer, indicated that the action had been validated through the relay chain. However, when the hacker moved to the BNB chain and initiated withdrawal operations via the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function, the withdrawal quantity did not match the originally locked amount. Further examination of the relay chain network did not show any records of this transaction.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At this point, two possibilities were considered: the leakage of signatures or the modification of keepers, entities responsible for signing user withdrawals. Controlling a keeper would allow the attacker to initiate withdrawals with forged signatures, leading to unauthorized transactions. Analyzing the attacker's use of the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function indicated that keepers had not been modified, directing the suspicion towards compromised keeper private keys or a multi-signature service attack.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Following the trail, three keepers were identified as potential compromise victims, underlining a significant security risk. If proven true, this would mean the attacker could initiate withdrawals and create seemingly valid transactions, bypassing the protocols' security measures.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Such an exploit demonstrates the need for advanced security strategies, including enhanced private key management and robust signature verification processes. If overlooked, these vulnerabilities can provide potential entry points for attackers to exploit and wreak havoc on blockchain networks, as illustrated by the Poly Network case. With the DeFi and crypto industry still at an early phase of developmental maturity, it's vital for protocol developers to continuously learn from such incidents, fortifying their systems against potential breaches, and upholding user trust.</p>
Addressing Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Smart contract vulnerabilities can be mitigated, albeit not entirely eliminated. An effective approach involves a combination of preventive measures and reactive strategies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Preventive measures include rigorous testing of smart contracts before deployment and regular audits by external security firms. These audits can help identify and rectify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Code review and bug bounty programs, where programmers are rewarded for discovering and reporting software bugs, can also be instrumental in fortifying smart contract security.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">From a reactive standpoint, developers can use upgradeable smart contracts that allow for the modification of the contract's code post-deployment. This feature can be crucial for responding swiftly and effectively to discovered vulnerabilities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Moving forward, it's clear that smart contract security must be at the forefront of DeFi protocol development. As the case of Poly Network demonstrates, the stakes are high, and the fallout from a breach can be devastating. By embracing rigorous security measures and continually learning from past incidents, the DeFi industry can help mitigate these risks and foster a more secure and resilient ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Bitcoin (BTC) and its hard forks are captivating the market, with Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) soaring. However, amidst this frenzy, InQubeta, an AI altcoin, has piqued the curiosity of investors and is being selected as the go-to investment.</p>
<p class="s3">In this article, we will explain what makes InQubeta stand out in the crypto landscape. Join us as we delve into Bitcoin hard forks and explore why smart investors are doubling down on the AI token InQubeta.</p>
InQubeta (QUBE): The token not to miss out on
<p class="s3">Defying all expectations, smart investors are doubling down on InQubeta, despite the surge in the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV). The commitment to investment in its utility token, QUBE, is largely responsible for it being an AI altcoin and for its revolutionary idea of solving a critical problem in the industry.</p>
<p class="s3">InQubeta is the world's first crowdfunding platform built for AI businesses to raise capital as well as for investors to acquire interests in promising projects. Its marketplace will allow investors to invest in AI startups by purchasing fractionalized investment opportunities.</p>
<p class="s3">Its fractional investment model reinforced investors' commitment towards investment as its innovative idea allows ownership of fractions of AI startups and eliminates investment limits. In addition, the gains that come from being an investor and holder further bolster confidence in the project. For instance, as one of the fastest-growing industries, investors stand to gain ridiculously high profits by investing early in promising AI projects. Additionally, the coin is expected to benefit from the increasing adoption of AI, which means it will soar in the coming months, making it a more compelling investment.</p>
<p class="s3">To participate in the presale, you can click on the link below. It is currently in stage 1, and a token costs $0.00875.</p>
<p></p>
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) experiences a significant surge during Bitcoin&rsquo;s rally
<p class="s3">Bitcoin Cash (BCH) came about from a hard fork in the blockchain, aimed at increasing the block size limit to make it more scalable by enabling cheaper and faster transactions. Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s (BCH) price movement has been largely unimpressive this year, as it hovered for the most part below $146. </p>
<p class="s3">However, a price upturn on June 21 saw Bitcoin Cash trade above $200, although it has been experiencing a slight decline in price. Its rally came during Bitcoin&rsquo;s (BTC) rally, showing its dependency. However, despite Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s uptrends, investors are still keen on investing in or diversifying parts of their investments in InQubeta because of its immense growth potential.</p>
Bitcoin SV (BSV) trades in tandem with Bitcoin (BTC) as it rallies alongside
<p class="s3">Bitcoin SV (BSV) emerged after a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash blockchain, making it one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard forks even if not directly. Bitcoin SV, which stands for &ldquo;Bitcoin Satoshi Vision,&rdquo; sought to restore what is considered the original vision of Bitcoin as outlined by its creator.</p>
<p class="s3">As Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard fork, Bitcoin SV often mirrors its price movement, which is currently on a rally. After Bitcoin SV&rsquo;s bearish descent from mid-May to the middle of June, Bitcoin SV regained bullish momentum and has been on a price swing. Despite its upswing, investors are still doubling down on InQubeta.</p>
Conclusion
<p class="s3">Despite the surge of Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard forks like Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash, InQubeta has emerged as a shining star and captured the attention of investors. Its trailblazing idea that combines AI with the limitless potential of blockchain technology, as well as exponential returns on investment, has led investors to double down. As a worthwhile investment, it has been experiencing huge presale participation, which will increase further in the coming week. To participate in the presale, click on the link below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to a recent report by the FATF, more than half of all UN member countries have still not implemented the Travel Rule.</p>
<p>As of June 2023, as reported by the FATF, more than half of the UN member countries have failed to enforce the Travel Rule. According to the Financial Action Task Force, the rule is necessary in order to close a loophole in crypto assets that might be exploited by money launderers and those funding terrorism.</p>
<p>According to an article in the Business Times Online, the Travel Rule is recommendation #16 of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) which lays down that all crypto companies must &ldquo;screen, record and communicate the information of all users of their platform&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This would have the effect of destroying any anonymity for crypto users, with the exception of those who are transacting in amounts less than $1,000.</p>
What is the FATF?
<p>The FATF is a 39-member body that gives financial recommendations to all UN nations. Given that it is an unelected body, financial decisions in each country are the responsibility of that country and the recommendations can be implemented or not by each country.</p>
<p>However, should any country choose not to implement all of the recommendations then it comes under &ldquo;increased monitoring&rdquo; of its financial activities.</p>
AML and terrorist financing
<p>According to the FATF, at the heart of all the recommendations are a desire to root out any money laundering or terrorist financing that might be taking place in a country&rsquo;s financial system. This purportedly gives it the right and full authority to investigate how money is dealt with everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The FATF is of the opinion that crypto assets can be used for the aforementioned illegal activities and therefore wants all countries to enforce the Travel Rule in order to negate any of these activities.</p>
Many jurisdictions ignore recommendations
<p>The fact that nearly three quarters of jurisdictions across the world have complied only partially or not at all with the FATF recommendations perhaps says much for a feeling that this non-elected agency is maybe interfering too much in the financial affairs of sovereign countries.</p>
<p>Also, given that the FATF is closely associated with the IMF and the World Bank, it might be seen as having a more &lsquo;Western&rsquo; bias that may not be as acceptable to certain jurisdictions across the world.</p>
