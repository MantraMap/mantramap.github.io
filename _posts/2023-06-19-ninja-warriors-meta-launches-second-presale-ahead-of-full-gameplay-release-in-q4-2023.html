<p class="s3">The NWT token is the native token and core of the Ninja Warrior Meta ecosystem. Thus, the presale allows gamers to acquire NWT tokens at a discounted price before the general publicif they intend to fully participate in the full game mode upon launch at the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">The minimum investment amount is 100 USDT, while whales can only buy a maximum of 100,000 USDT. All investors must submit personal details as part of the know-your-customer (KYC) procedure.</p>
<p class="s3">It would also allow gamers and investors to enjoy a share in future developments, enhanced gameplay, immersive game modes, rewards, and an expanded gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p class="s3">The roadmap showcases a clear vision for exponential growth, and the team behind Ninja Warriors Meta is committed to continuous development and strategic partnerships with industry leaders.</p>
<p class="s3">To fund the project's roadmap and ensure widespread adoption and awareness, the NWT presale allows Ninja Warrior Meta to run a dedicated branding phase utilizing organic traffic generation on social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s3">The presale goes beyond promoting the Ninja Warrior Meta blockchain game through engaging storytelling and content like videos and gameplay showcases.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Notably, it facilitates gathering like-minded crypto game participants, influential figures, and investors, immersing them in Ninja Warriors Meta.</p>
<p class="s3">Moreover,&nbsp; Ninja Warriors Meta is set to release a move-to-earn (M2E) application for Android and iOS platforms in two months.
