<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Sei Network secured $5 million in August from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and Multicoin Capital.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>The platform plans to support 20 dApps as its mainnet launch approaches.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">MEXC, a leading Singapore-based <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrency</a> trading platform, has unveiled a $20 million fund aimed at supporting projects on Layer 1 blockchain Sei Network.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a blog post <a href="https://blog.mexc.com/sei/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a> on 4 January, MEXC said the fund will be geared towards boosting adoption across the Sei Network ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The platform, which is designed with the need to maximise trading advantages for decentralised exchanges (DEXs) users, is developed by Sei Labs &ndash; a team that counts former Robinhood developers, Cosmos OGs and ex-Goldman Sachs finance and strategy members.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Sei Network to support 20 dApps ahead of mainnet launch</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Sei Network raised $5 million in August, backed by industry players and other investors including Coinbase Ventures, Multicoin Capital, Delphi Digital and Hudson River Trading. The platform plans to use the new capital injection to support network development as it moves closer to its mainnet launch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team will also back 20 decentralised applications (dApps) that are already building on the network.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MEXC is launching the ecosystem fund through its MEXC Ventures, a comprehensive fund that looks to empower innovations within the crypto space via strategic investments. The firm also focuses on M&amp;As project incubation and multi-manager investments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MEXC Ventures currently holds over $100 million in assets under management and more than 300 portfolio investments.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ethereum</u></a> (ETH/USD) is trading at its crucial resistance zone of $1,250 after recovering 3% on Wednesday. This level has proved difficult to crack since plunging below it in mid-Dec. The new year recoveries may keep bulls on alert, although it is still too early to judge how far the price can surge.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although 2022 was a difficult year for Ethereum, fans will be delighted by&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrency news</u></a> on network activity. Data from Ycharts and Nasdaq show that Ethereum topped Bitcoin in transaction volumes last year. The network witnessed 408.5 million transactions, surpassing Bitcoin&rsquo;s 93.1 million. The higher volatility in Ethereum was connected to events such as NFT launches. Bitcoin, however, retained the crown as the most searched cryptocurrency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Data by Bitinfocharts shows that into 2023, transaction volumes are still rising for Ethereum. As of January 2, the count hit 924,614, higher than 229,191 for Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Ethereum on a short-term appreciation to the $1,250 resistance</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/04/1672847939353-04e9dc5a-a2b6-4639-9ec7-f425525c4f78.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="285"></p>
<p dir="ltr">ETH/USD Chart by TradingView</p>
<p dir="ltr">A technical outlook shows ETH trading on a short-term trendline initiated from the $1,100 bottom. The cryptocurrency trades with improved buy side volumes, although still not very significant. The MACD indicator is bearish, but momentum has improved slightly.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What to watch next for ETH</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum is a candidate for a bullish breakout at the $1,250 resistance. The bullish candlestick will be watched by the buyers.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Conversely, bears could take control of the price at the resistance zone. That could see ETH slide to the short-term ascending trendline.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are considering&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/buy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buying ETH</u></a>, it is important to watch for the price to clear $1,250 successfully. As long as the price remains below this level, ETH is vulnerable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Cardano recovered by 4% on Wednesday after hitting a two-year bottom</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Whale activity has been reported to be on the rise</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency remains on a downtrend with no confirmed bullish momentum</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cardano (ADA/USD) is taking a stride higher after hitting a two-year low of $0.24. Trading at $0.265 as of press time, ADA had returned 4% in the day. The gains in the day come amid increased whale activity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to WhaleStats data, ADA was among the top 10 most bought tokens above the biggest BSC whales on December 04. The BNB whales now hold a combined 19.9 million Cardano tokens. The portfolio, worth $5.19 million, however, represents less than 1% of the total. Nonetheless, in the last 30 days, large investors have cut their ADA positions. That potentially explains the huge decline in ADA price in December to the multi-year low.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are no clear indications for the recent surge in ADA. As CoinJournal previously&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/santiment-says-cardano-sellers-are-getting-exhausted-but-does-price-action-show-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>, sentiment data showed that ADA was undervalued as of the end of 2022. Investors could, therefore, be throwing weight on recovery as the price hits depressed levels. But we remain cautious as ADA remains on a downtrend.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>ADA recovers at the bottom of the descending channel</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/04/1672847253045-a018cefe-7e57-461a-9c61-cd8670897c86.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="286"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ADA/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">From a technical outlook, ADA is on a relief rally from the bottom edge of the descending channel. The 2-year low saw the RSI hit oversold levels meaning that investors had dumped ADA in huge proportions. The daily chart technical outlook still supports a bearish view of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Will ADA recovery continue?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cardano&rsquo;s recovery remains tied to the broader crypto sentiment. Many <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrencies</u></a> posted relief recoveries on Wednesday but were still trading at depressed levels. There is no confirmation that the recoveries will be sustained since we remain in a bear market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If ADA maintains the recovery, we need to watch how bulls play out at the upper end of the descending channel. Conversely, ADA remains vulnerable to the $0.24 bottom or lower.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Per the data, the most value was transferred in the first half of the year, with the largest chunk of these seen in March to early May.

<p dir="ltr">The network hashrate also increased despite the bear market crash that pushed multiple miners into bankruptcy. Data on total network hashrate growth for 2022 showed a 56% jump, from 175 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 274 EH/s.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Solana token has gained by almost 40% in a week as network activity surge</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The weekly gains have been inspired by the Bonk token airdrop</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">SOL faces resistance at $14</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Solana (SOL/USD) is making a strong return after a difficult spell in 2022. Frequent hacks, FTX collapse, and a prolonged crypto winter are some of the ails of Solana in 2022. In particular, the FTX crash saw SOL fall below $10. But a return of nearly 40% in a week is sending a statement that investors are not done with the proclaimed Ethereum killer.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Solana Foundation head of strategy and communications Austin Federa, SOL is defying the FTX contagion. The network has seen increasing on-chain activity for users and developers. He says no projects are migrating from the blockchain, underlining Solana&rsquo;s strengths and performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The latest gains in SOL come amid increased investor interest. That comes after the launch of the Shiba-Inu-themed Bonk (BONK) token. According to the latest <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrency news,</u></a> BONK will be airdropped for up to 50% of its supply. About 20% of the airdrop will go to Solana NFT collections. The development has seen several projects on Solana integrate bonk tokens for use in transactions on listed NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>SOL price outlook and analysis approaching resistance</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/04/1672846922441-156e3aea-547c-4365-ab20-f148aa7aa446.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="286"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SOL/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">From the technical outlook, SOL is slightly bullish but largely bearish. The indicator is approaching the neutral zone, although it shows SOL is bearish. Resistance lies at $14, slightly below the SOL price.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What next for the SOL price?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The gains in&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/solana/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SOL price</u></a> are positive after a prolonged bear market. However, $14 will be a test for bulls. A bullish scenario will be reinforced if the cryptocurrency breaks above the resistance level. That could see SOL maintain the uptrend to $18 and beyond.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the flip side, SOL will face bears at $14. Buyers may also exit at the overhead resistance to force a correction. That could see the token retest the $11 or $10 bottom.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Litecoin has gained 13% in the past week</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The network ended 2022 with record transactions</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Investors speculate further gains, although $80 is a crucial level to watch</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Litecoin (LTC/USD) began 2023 on a strong footing. The cryptocurrency is among the top gainers, with a gain of nearly 13% in the week. That comes even as trading volumes rise, with an intraday 22% surge. Does this send a bullish note?</p>
<p dir="ltr">2022 may be a difficult year for all <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrencies</u></a>, including Litecoin. However, Litecoin saw increasing growth, with 52 million new addresses. According to Litecoin&rsquo;s update on the last day of 2022, the network processed over 39 million transactions last year. This is a new record, which investors could look at to predict a bullish push in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">DeFi firm Abra CEO Bill Barhydt thinks Litecoin is &ldquo;important.&rdquo; Barhydt says Litecoin is the only p2p decentralised payment ecosystem that has outlived 10 years of uptime. He says Litecoin is also superior to Bitcoin in terms of testing new technologies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Digging deeper into 2023, analysts expect it to be a busy year for Litecoin. Galaxy Trading expects the token to return up to 100% heading into LTC&rsquo;s halving event. The price has already been reacting to these important developments.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>LTC price outlook as token retests resistance</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/04/1672844766234-74bb9837-47c7-4e4e-8fb3-8d313e59093e.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="283"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>LTC/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">On the daily chart, LTC is testing a resistance zone around $77-$80. The price has maintained along a short-term trendline after bouncing off from the $64 support. The MACD indicator has turned bullish and shifted above the neutral zone.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Is LTC attractive?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The gain by LTC is an opportunity for buyers to ride the bullish push in 2023. However, sustained gains in the cryptocurrency will depend on whether bulls will overcome resistance at $80. The cryptocurrency is retesting the resistance with an opportunity for a breakout. Investors can&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/litecoin/buy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buy LTC</u></a> on the breakout.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the flip side, investors could watch how LTC behaves at the short-term trendline. A drop below the trendline could see the cryptocurrency retest the support at $64.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Indonesia is planning to launch a national cryptocurrency exchange in 2023.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The government will transfer regulatory powers over such assets to the Financial Services Authority soon.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The country&rsquo;s central bank is also working on launching its digital currency (CBDC).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Indonesia to launch a national crypto exchange</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Indonesia plans to establish a national cryptocurrency exchange before the end of the year, according to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-04/indonesia-to-start-crypto-exchange-ahead-of-regulatory-shift?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report by Bloomberg</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bloomberg revealed that the government would launch the cryptocurrency exchange before it shifts regulatory powers over such assets to the Financial Services Authority, from a commodities agency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a> would be a huge development for the crypto industry in Indonesia. At the moment, crypto assets in the country are traded alongside commodity contracts and are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency, known as Bappebti.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bappebti acting head Didid Noordiatmoko revealed earlier today that as part of a broader financial sector reform, the FSA would be given regulatory power over the assets over the next two years, during which time the exchange would be established.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Indonesia continues to support crypto growth</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Indonesia is one of the countries in the world with a certain level of regulatory clarity in terms of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The country&rsquo;s apex bank issued a white paper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-cenbank-cryptocurrency/bank-indonesia-joins-global-c-bank-push-for-digital-currencies-idUSL2N2NC0NX?rpc=401&amp;" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>discussing its digital currency</u></a>. The central bank digital currency (CBDC) is currently in development. However, there is no timeline for its launch yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Indonesia also passed a law recognising cryptocurrency and digital assets as regulated financial securities in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The positive stance regarding cryptocurrencies comes after the Bank of Indonesia&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/indonesian-central-bank-bans-use-of-crypto-for-payments/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>banned the use of cryptos</u></a> for payments in the country in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Bonk is a meme coin launched on Solana on Christmas Day</li>
<li>It has surged close to 2,500%</li>
<li>Solana, meanwhile, has collapsed following associations with Bankman-Fried and top projects fleeing the blockchain</li>
<li>Our Analyst writes that this is not the climate for memecoin hysteria</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Woah, this is a throwback. Twitter is alive this week with talk of Bonk, a doggy token on the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/solana/buy/">Solana</a> blockchain. There is something a little nostalgic in talking about a good old-fashioned meme token. All we need is a COVID mask and some Elon Musk tweets, and we would be squarely back in 2020.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/buy/">Shiba-Inu</a> themed token was issued on Christmas Day, and has risen close to 2,500% since. The price rise in the last hour as I write this is 150%.</p>
<p>Of course, the intriguing thing here is that the token has been launched on Solana, which has been struggling mightily over the last few months. I wrote a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/is-solana-dead-top-projects-flee-the-blockchain/">deep dive</a> only yesterday analysing the demise of Solana, with multiple top projects fleeing the blockchain, repeated outages causing massive problems, and its ominous association with Sam Bankman-Fried pulling down the price.</p>
<p>But while it is still down hugely, Solana has bounced back a little in conjunction with this surge for Bonk. It jumped back <a href="https://coinjournal.net/solana/">above $13</a> Tuesday having dipped as low as $8 last week. Looking at Coinglass data, there has been close to $7 million of short positions liquidated, the largest amount since FTX collapsed in November.</p>
<p>The Layer 1 seems to be benefiting from the surge in interest for Bonk, which announced a large airdrop of 50% of its supply to drive up hype around the coin. It has worked &ndash; Bonk now has a market cap of $120 million and is following the meme coin playbook perfectly.</p>
<h2><strong>Why is Bonk rising? </strong></h2>
<p>Like any meme coin, it is difficult to ascertain how exactly bonk has pulled this off. It really comes down to marketing and luck. A number of Solana projects have even integrated Bonk as payment tokens, while $BONK has been trending incessantly on Twitter.</p>
<p>It all amounts to the same hysteria we saw over the last couple of years. As everybody knows by now, meme coins are nothing but a gamble. But what makes this so unusual is that the rise is occurring not only at a bearish juncture for Solana, but for the market as a whole.</p>
<p>The past year has seen interest rates hiked and liquidity pulled from the market, with risk assets collapsing. There is nothing further out on the risk spectrum than meme coins, and they have hence cratered as a result.</p>

            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2><strong>What next for Bonk?</strong></h2>
<p>All I will say to any investor (gambler) is that Bonk is a very dangerous game, like any meme coin. There is zero utility here and that means that in the long run, the coin is likely to drop to zero.</p>
<p>Of course, everybody knows that anyway, and these are memes we are talking about. But in the current tight monetary policy environment, the hysteria of the pandemic, where stimulus-cheque-wielding retail investors were pumping everything within sight, is long gone. This is not the climate for gambles like meme coins, and that is without even mentioning the carnage with Solana. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Near Protocol price jumped on Wednesday.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">This price was in sync with other Sam coins like Solana and Serum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/near-protocol/"><u>Near Protocol</u></a> paused its remarkable sell-off as Sam Coins staged a strong comeback. The coin rose to a high of $1.428, which was the highest level since December 16. It has rallied by more than 14% from its lowest level in 2022.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Sam Coins rebound</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Near Protocol is one of the few cryptocurrencies that are known as Sam Coins. Sam refers to Sam Bankman-Fried, the embattled founder of FTX and Alameda Research. At its peak, FTX was valued at over $32 billion, making it the second-biggest exchange in the world after Binance, as we wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/report-300m-of-ftx-debtors-transferred-without-authorization/"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sam coins are those cryptocurrencies that Bankman and his empire had invested in. As part of his investment, he often received crypto tokens that he could exchange for fiat currencies. Therefore, with his empire dead and with his legal peril increasing, most investors have decided to exit Sam Coins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other popular Sam Coins are Solana, Serum, Bonfida, and Ren. Solana has been one of the worst performers in the crypto industry after the collapse of FTX. Its DeFi ecosystem has lost billions of dollars and it currently stands at $350 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Near Protocol has also struggled in the past few months. Its popularity among investors has waned while the total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi ecosystem has crashed to $98 million. At its peak in May 2022, Near had over $800 million in assets. Most apps in its ecosystem have lost value in the past 30 days. They include Ref Finance, Burrow, Meta Pool, and Linear Network. The same is true with other apps in its network.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Near Protocol price also rose after the foundation changed how it makes grants. Going forward, the foundation will stop investing in its inbound start-up grants programs. It will also work with DAOs, with processing within 6 to 8 weeks.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Near price prediction</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/04/1672835902451-6995936e-5da6-4463-a927-60277f125ef8.png" style="width: 601px;height: 298.497px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="601" height="298.497"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NEARUSD/?exchange=BINANCE">NEAR chart by TradingView</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The four-hour chart shows that Near Protocol price has staged a strong recovery in the past few days. As it rose, it moved above the important resistance point at $1.37, which was the highest point on December 27. &nbsp;It has also moved slightly above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, Near price will likely resume the bearish trend as the momentum of Sam Coins wanes. If this happens, the next key level to watch will be at $1.30.</p>
