<h2>Peter Schiff Explains Why Bitcoin and Gold Are Rising</h2>
<p>Gold bug and economist Peter Schiff has shared his view on why bitcoin and gold are going up this year. Schiff is the founder and current chairman of Schiffgold, a precious metals dealer specializing in gold and silver bullion. He has long been a bitcoin skeptic, regularly bashing the crypto while promoting gold. He tweeted Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Both gold and bitcoin are up in 2023, but they&#x2019;re rising for opposite reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Gold is rising as a hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar, while bitcoin is rising with other high-risk assets as speculators bet that a Fed pivot will cause a rally in 2022&#x2019;s biggest losers,&#x201D; the economist detailed.</p>
<p>A number of people on Twitter disagreed with Schiff, replying to his tweet that gold is not a good hedge against inflation. Some people took the gold bug&#x2019;s tweet as a <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> buy signal.</p>
<p>Unlike Schiff, some people believe that bitcoin is a better hedge against inflation than gold. Venture capitalist Tim Draper, for example, has repeatedly said he is bullish about bitcoin due to its trait as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-bullish-on-bitcoin-due-to-its-inflation-hedge-traits/">an inflation hedge</a>. Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones has also said he prefers bitcoin over gold, expecting the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to be &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-paul-tudor-jones-expects-bitcoin-price-to-be-much-higher-than-today/">much higher</a>.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Has Outperformed Gold Since Schiff&#x2019;s Sell Recommendation</h2>
<p>Many people on Twitter also pointed out that bitcoin has hugely outperformed gold, emphasizing that the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has increased significantly since the gold bug&#x2019;s sell recommendation. In December 2018, when the price of bitcoin was around $3K, Schiff <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1074739334383919109">warned</a> that &#x201C;a lot more air yet to come out of this bubble.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Commenting on Schiff&#x2019;s Jan. 12 tweet telling investors to sell their <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> at the $18K level, bitcoin proponent Peter McCormack <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMcCormack/status/1617178256385392640">tweeted</a> Sunday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is trading around 27% up since Peter Schiff advised you to sell your bitcoin. Gold isn&#x2019;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>While admitting that the price of bitcoin has risen since he told people to dump their coins, Schiff argued that he also advised people to sell their <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> when its price was well over $60K. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $22,838.33, up about 35% over the past 30 days, while both gold futures and spot prices are up about 7% during the same time period.</p>

<h2>Big Banks to Launch a Digital Wallet</h2>
<p>Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and four other financial institutions behind the payment network Zelle are collaborating to launch a digital wallet for consumers to use at online checkout, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.</p>
<p>The wallet will be managed by fintech firm Early Warning Services (EWS), which owns and operates Zelle. EWS provides risk management solutions to financial institutions, government entities, and payment companies. It is co-owned by Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Truist, Capital One, PNC Bank, and U.S. Bank.</p>
<p>The new digital wallet, which will be linked to shoppers’ debit and credit cards for online payments, will operate separately from Zelle. The banks aim to compete with other third-party wallet providers such as Paypal and Apple Pay as they are worried about losing control of their customer relationships, the publication conveyed, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>EWS plans to begin rolling out the new wallet in the second half of this year. Visa and Mastercard are already on board, and the fintech firm has reached out to other card networks, such as Discover Financial Services, to assess their interest in adding their cards to the wallet.</p>

<p>Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat commented on the news in a note to clients Monday. She explained that the major banks have &#8220;likely always had Paypal envy,&#8221; adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>It simply takes a very long time, a killer customer experience (which needs to be better than incumbents, not just similar), and a compelling merchant value proposition to build the two-sided network effects in payments to achieve scale.</p></blockquote>

The embassy castigated Yellen&#8217;s comments in response, stressing that the U.S. has a &#8220;catastrophic debt problem.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Chinese Embassy in Zambia Denounces U.S. Debt Limit and Yellen&#8217;s Recent Comments</h2>
<p>Last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-urges-swift-action-to-increase-spending-limit-avert-default-on-us-obligations/">urged</a> Congress to increase the government&#8217;s spending limit or the country could face default on its debts. She also noted that the Treasury would have to leverage &#8220;<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3819480-treasury-resorts-to-extraordinary-measures-to-keep-the-us-from-debt-default/">extraordinary measures</a>&#8221; to keep the debt at bay until early June 2023. Federal financial data indicates that the country&#8217;s debt surpassed <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/">$31.4 trillion</a> earlier this week. Yellen also made comments about Zambia on Monday, after meeting with Chinese officials in Zurich the week prior.</p>
<p>&#8220;I specifically raised the issue with Zambia (with Chinese officials) and asked for their cooperation in trying to reach a speedy resolution. And our talks were constructive,&#8221; Yellen is cited as saying in a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/yellen-says-critically-important-restructure-zambia-debt-2023-01-23/">report</a> published by Reuters. On the other hand, Zambian finance minister Situmbeko Musokotwane said the meeting with Yellen and Chinese officials did not reach a conclusion in regard to a debt restructuring process. The Chinese Embassy in Zambia then <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/china-tells-us-fix-its-own-debt-problems-after-yellen-africa-remarks-2023-01-24/">reproached</a> the issue in direct response to Yellen&#8217;s commentary and said that the U.S. needs to fix its own debt problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest contribution that the U.S. can make to the debt issues outside the country is to act on responsible monetary policies, cope with its own debt problem, and stop sabotaging other sovereign countries&#8217; active efforts to solve their debt issues,” the Zambian-based officials in Lusaka wrote. The Chinese embassy in Lusaka further <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/international/china-slams-us-debt-limit-and-accuses-washington-sabotage">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Assuming secretary Yellen’s statements about debt were correct, the best prospect of the debt issues outside the U.S. would be the U.S. Treasury Department solving the US’ own domestic debt problem, given how well she knows about facts, her professional capacities and her team’s implementation ability.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Chinese Embassy&#8217;s criticism highlights the underlying communication issues China and the U.S. have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-takes-another-step-away-from-usd-hegemony/">dealing</a> with for years. In May 2022, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-brics-countries-told-to-consider-countering-the-dollars-global-hegemony/">reports</a> noted that Chinese experts had urged the leaders of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-us-dollar-is-toast-citing-saudi-arabias-request-to-join-brics/">BRICS nations</a> (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to end their dependence on the U.S. dollar. China was not pleased with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-say-beijing-attacking-taiwan-could-lead-to-far-reaching-economic-consequences/">visit to Taiwan</a> in Aug. 2022. The very next month, the Chinese Communist Party-backed Global Times published an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/as-biden-drains-the-spr-down-to-1984-levels-chinese-state-media-claims-us-dollar-is-once-again-the-worlds-problem/">opinion editorial</a> that insisted the rising dollar may become &#8220;the beginning of another nightmare&#8221; for other countries.</p>

Finder&#x2019;s panel of 56 specialists convened to give their 2023 bitcoin price forecast, and the panelists suggest bitcoin will peak at $29,095 this year.</strong></p>
<h2>Experts Weigh in on Bitcoin&#x2019;s Future Price: Will it Reach Six-Digit Prices by 2030?</h2>
<p>Finder.com has conducted another <a href="https://www.finder.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-2023">report</a> that aims to predict bitcoin&#x2019;s future price with 56 experts stemming from the cryptocurrency and financial technology industry. Today, on Jan. 24, 2023, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> is exchanging hands for just under $23,000 per unit, and it&#x2019;s the highest price since FTX collapsed in Nov. 2022. The latest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> predictions report published by finder.com indicates that the consensus is bitcoin will peak at $29,095 this year. However, the leading crypto asset is also predicted to end 2023 at roughly $26,844 per unit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Finder&#x2019;s panelists expect a deep plunge down to a low of $13,067 per unit. Ruadhan O, the creator and founder of Seasonal Tokens, believes bitcoin will peak at $27,000 per unit because of the worries surrounding centralized entities within the crypto industry. &#x201C;The price is low because possible imminent catastrophes are being priced in,&#x201D; Ruadhan O told Finder&#x2019;s researchers. &#x201C;By the end of the year, market sentiment will have changed, and after the fear goes away, the market will rediscover the scarcity of bitcoin.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Around 21% of the panelists expect institutional investors to leave the crypto market for different asset classes this year. Roughly 65% of Finder&#x2019;s experts, including Alexander Kuptsikevich, the senior market analyst at Fxpro, believe bitcoin is underpriced. &#x201C;The phase of the most active cryptocurrency sell-off is over. 2023 will be a year of careful price recovery. However, a real FOMO market is unlikely to come until 2024-2025,&#x201D; Kuptsikevich remarked.</p>
<h2>Finder&#x2019;s Experts Predict Dip in Bitcoin&#x2019;s Value, But See Potential for Long-Term Growth</h2>
<p>Finder&#x2019;s says 16% of the panelists believe <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is currently overvalued, but a large majority of the 56 panelists believe bitcoin&#x2019;s value will be much higher after the next halving in 2024. The panel currently predicts <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s value will rise to $77,492 in 2025, and by 2030, bitcoin will be in the six-digit zone at $188,451 per coin. Damian Chmiel, the senior analyst and editor at Finance Magnates, predicts bitcoin will be around $70,000 per unit in 2025.</p>
<p>Chmiel insists, however, that two things need to happen: the return of Wall Street excitement toward crypto assets and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/all-eyes-on-the-next-fed-meeting-market-trajectories-hinge-on-decision/">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> discontinuing the current monetary tightening policy. &#x201C;The former will not happen without the latter, and we are left to wait patiently for now,&#x201D; Chmiel detailed. &#x201C;In the long term, however, I believe bitcoin will become a popular choice among traders,&#x201D; the Finance Magnates senior analyst added.</p>

<p>The latest Finder&#x2019;s forecast from the experts gathered is a whole lot different than the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/finders-experts-predict-bitcoin-will-peak-at-94k-this-year/">predictions</a> from Jan. 2022. Last year, around this same time, Finder surveyed 33 crypto and fintech specialists and the group predicted <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> would end 2022 at $94,000 per unit. On Dec. 31, 2022, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ended the year at $16,544 per unit before entering 2023. Finder&#x2019;s experts did convene in Oct. 2022, with a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/finders-experts-predict-bitcoin-will-end-the-year-at-21k-panel-expects-btc-to-hit-79k-by-2025/">whole new outlook</a> that predicted <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> would end 2022 at $21,000 per unit. It&#x2019;s safe to say, Finder&#x2019;s crypto and fintech specialists are a lot less optimistic during the crypto winter and the current <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/top-three-macroeconomic-events-to-watch-in-2023-amid-volatile-market-conditions/">macroeconomic conditions</a>.</p>

While one U.S. dollar bought 13.10 units of the cedi on the parallel market, according to the latest Bank of Ghana data, one greenback buys around 10.36 units of the local currency. </strong></p>
<h2>The Cedi&#8217;s Short-Lived Resurgence</h2>
<p>After ending 2022 as one of the world’s worst-performing currencies, the Ghanaian currency is already one of two in Sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s top 15 currencies that depreciated by double-digit figures within the first 17 days of the new year, a <a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/year-to-date-cedi-depreciates-by-12-7-to-dollar-second-weakest-among-top-african-currencies/">report</a> has said. The Egyptian pound, which depreciated by 16.5% during the same period, is the only currency among Sub-Saharan Africa’s top 15 that has depreciated faster than the cedi.</p>
<p>Although the Ghanaian cedi’s year-to-date 12.7% drop is still lower than that of the whole of 2022 (38.86%), the latest depreciation suggests that the currency’s resurgence that started in late 2022 has dissipated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ghanaian-cedi-appreciates-by-more-than-30-in-4-days-currency-recovery-follows-imf-loan-announcement/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in mid-December 2022, the cedi rallied from around GHS14:$1 to under 9:1 in just four days. The currency’s revival had been fueled by reports suggesting the Ghanaian government had secured a $3 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Ghana needs the loan to help it stabilize its economy.</p>
<p>In addition to the IMF loan package, Ghana, one of Africa’s top gold producers, hopes to ease the pressure on the cedi through the recently launched <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ghana-takes-steps-to-operationalize-gold-for-oil-scheme-move-expected-to-help-halt-cedis-depreciation/">gold-for-oil</a> scheme.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bank of Ghana Exchange Rates <a href="https://t.co/AGI7GfW5M3">pic.twitter.com/AGI7GfW5M3</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Bank of Ghana (@thebankofghana) <a href="https://twitter.com/thebankofghana/status/1616340961465876480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, the cedi&#8217;s plunge to around GHS13.10:$1 on the forex parallel market suggests that neither the IMF loan nor the barter scheme can halt the currency&#8217;s fall. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, the Bank of Ghana&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/thebankofghana/status/1616340961465876480">data</a> showed that one U.S. dollar bought GHS10.36 on the official foreign exchange market.</p>

<h2>Quicknode Aims to Streamline Web2 to Web3 Movement With $60 Million in Series B Funding Led by 10T Holdings</h2>
<p>On Jan. 24, 2023, <a href="https://www.quicknode.com">Quicknode</a> revealed it has raised $60 million in a Series B funding round led by 10T Holdings. Other participating investors in the round included QED, Tiger Global, Alexis Ohanian&#x2019;s Seven Seven Six, and Protocol Labs. &#x201C;This latest round will be used to accelerate the company&#x2019;s global expansion and further empower the builders laying the groundwork for a decentralized, globally-connected future,&#x201D; Quicknode&#x2019;s announcement said.</p>
<p>Quicknode also raised $35 million in a Series A in Oct. 2021. That round was led by Tiger Global, and Seven Seven Six, Soma Capital, Arrington <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> Capital, Crossbeam, and Anthony Pompliano also participated. Quicknode claims to handle &#x201C;billions of blockchain calls daily with 2X faster response time than competitors.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Quicknode competitors include firms like Kaleido, Alchemy, Blockcypher, Velas, and Infura. The company detailed on Tuesday that the funds will be used to &#x201C;streamline the Web2 to Web3 movement at scale.&#x201D; The company also plans to make new hires and develop Web3 offerings for the Quicknode marketplace. Despite the crypto winter, the company added that &#x201C;QuickNode has seen remarkable growth over the past year with its revenue growing more than 300%.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;At Quicknode, we firmly believe in Web3 as the future of the Internet,&#x201D; Alex Nabutovsky, CEO and co-founder of QuickNode said in a statement. &#x201C;Blockchain adoption and development continue to increase year-over-year, and we expect continued momentum in the space. The industry is about to enter its next era, and with this raise, we are preparing for mass adoption of blockchain technology in 2023 and throughout the rest of the decade. We are proud to help our customers scale to their full potential and move the industry forward,&#x201D; Nabutovsky added.</p>

The news saw the token surge by nearly 5% today, rising for a third straight session in the process. Polygon also moved higher on Tuesday, hitting a one-week high.</strong></p>
<h2>Avalanche (AVAX)</h2>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) rose to a multi-month high on Tuesday, as prices rallied for a third consecutive session against a backdrop of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bridged-bitcoin-on-avalanche-surpasses-value-locked-on-the-lightning-network/">bullish news</a>.</p>
<p>Following a low of $17.43 to start the week, AVAX/USD moved to an intraday peak of $18.86 earlier today.</p>
<p>As a result of today’s surge in price, AVAX has risen to its strongest point since Nov. 6.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the move took place following a breakout of a ceiling at the $18.50 mark.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) neared a resistance level of its own at 72.00</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 71.11, with earlier gains fading, resulting in AVAX currently trading at $18.22.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>In addition to AVAX, polygon (MATIC) climbed higher in today’s session, following a collision with a key price floor.</p>
<p>MATIC/USD raced to a peak of $1.04 earlier in the day, less than a day after hitting a low of $0.9849</p>
<p>The move saw polygon reach its highest level since last week Monday, when price was last close to a resistance of $1.05.</p>

<p>However, like on that occasion, prices have since plunged, with momentum not strong enough to force a breakout.</p>
<p>As of writing, MATIC/USD is now trading at $1.00, which is also its long-term support point.</p>
<p>One positive is that the RSI seems to be a fair distance away from its own floor at 61.00, and is currently tracking at 63.27, with a ceiling of 65.00 a possible target.</p>

The property was purchased by Bankman-Fried&#8217;s brother&#8217;s nonprofit, Guarding Against Pandemics, for the same price it is selling for today.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX Co-Founder&#8217;s Luxury Property Suspected to Have Been Used for Wining and Dining Political Elite in the Name of &#8216;Pandemic Prevention’</h2>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/23/sam-bankman-fried-lists-dc-house-for-3-28m/">According</a> to the New York Post reporter Mary K. Jacob, a four-bedroom Washington townhome associated with the disgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), is now listed on the market. The luxury 4,100-square-foot property is selling for $3.28 million and was originally purchased by Gabe Bankman-Fried&#8217;s nonprofit, <a href="https://www.againstpandemics.org">Guarding Against Pandemics</a>. Jacob detailed that just before FTX collapsed, the Washington home hosted two parties specifically for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-prosecutors-probe-democrats-over-donations-from-sam-bankman-fried/">bureaucrat donors</a>.</p>

<p>Realtor.com also <a href="https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/washington-dc-townhouse-linked-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-for-sale/">reported</a> on a Washington townhome listing, a Victorian brownstone building crafted in 2017. The home has five bathrooms, four gas fireplaces, and all bedrooms are en suite, Realtor.com explained. The report also notes that the property was leveraged &#8220;to serve as a D.C. base for the FTX crew to wine and dine the political elite.&#8221; Interestingly, the property is selling for the same price Guarding Against Pandemics purchased it for in April 2022.</p>

<p>SBF and his inner circle of deputies reportedly purchased a great deal of real estate, most of which was located in the Bahamas. For instance, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/effective-altruism-former-ftx-ceos-alleged-40m-penthouse-listed-for-sale-report-says-firm-spent-74m-on-real-estate/">reported</a> on the so-called &#8220;effective altruist&#8221; SBF&#8217;s $40 million penthouse, which was listed for sale three days after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection. Recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-discovers-5-5b-in-liquid-assets-debtors-explore-ways-to-maximize-recovery-via-potential-sale-of-subsidiaries-real-estate/">court filings</a> indicate that SBF and the FTX group purchased a total of 36 Bahamas-based properties. Fifteen properties were located in the Albany, Bahamas, oceanside district, worth an estimated $166.1 million. Another 12 properties in the Bahamas that were not located at the Albany resort are worth $39.4 million.</p>

<p>Moreover, it has been reported that SBF and a number of high-level executives donated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-execs-gave-70-million-to-both-democrats-and-republicans-heading-into-the-2022-us-midterms/">tens of millions</a> to U.S. politicians, and it is suspected that the Washington townhome with luxury amenities was likely chosen to entertain them. FTX, the company, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-donations-to-early-covid-19-researchers-raise-questions-of-propaganda-tied-to-pandemic-prevention/">contributed a lot of money</a> to pandemic alarmists who believe the immune system can be replaced with sanitizers, masks, and mRNA gene therapy. Senior members of the Biden administration met with FTX executives to discuss the idea of so-called &#8220;pandemic prevention,&#8221; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indicted-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried-discussed-pandemic-prevention-with-biden-administration-officials/">according</a> to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.</p>

According to the police agency, nearly half of the funds processed through the platform were associated with various criminal activities.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitzlato Senior Management Targeted in Europe, Exchange Infrastructure Dismantled</h2>
<p>High-ranking executives of the recently busted Bitzlato have been apprehended as part of the international investigation against the crypto exchange with the participation of law enforcement and judicial authorities in several European countries.</p>
<p>According to a press release published by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (<a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Europol</a>) on Monday, the operation led by the U.S. and France, also involved Belgium, Cyprus, Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-registered coin trading platform is suspected of facilitating the laundering of large amounts of criminal proceeds, the agency emphasized. Last week, the U.S. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitzlato-exchange-busted-as-us-deals-blow-to-crypto-crime-arrests-owner/">announced</a> the arrest in Miami of its co-founder and majority owner Anatoly Legkodymov, a Russian national residing in China. Its France-based digital infrastructure was also shut down.</p>

<p>Besides Legkodymov, believed to be Bitzlato&#x2019;s main administrator, four more individuals have been detained in Europe so far. Among them, the CEO, financial director, and marketing director of the exchange who were arrested in Spain, and another person handcuffed in Cyprus, Europol detailed without revealing their identities.</p>
<p>Police have conducted eight home searches, half of which in Spain, at one address in the U.S., two in Portugal, and one in Cyprus. Wallets with &#x20AC;18 million ($19.5 million) worth of cryptocurrency, vehicles and electronic equipment have been seized and over 100 accounts at other exchanges frozen, involving a total of &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
<h2>Almost Half of Bitzlato Transactions Linked to Crime, Europol Claims</h2>
<p>Little-known outside the Russian-speaking market, Bitzlato operated globally, Europol said, facilitating the quick conversion of digital currencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin cash, dash, dogecoin, and tether, into rubles. According to quoted estimates, the platform received a total of &#x20AC;2.1 billion worth of assets.</p>
<p>&#x201C;While the conversion of crypto assets into fiat currencies is not illegal, investigations into the cybercriminal operators indicated that large volumes of criminal assets were going through the platform,&#x201D; the agency elaborated and highlighted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The analysis indicated that about 46% of the assets exchanged through Bitzlato, worth roughly &#x20AC;1 billion, had links to criminal activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The majority of the suspicious transactions were linked to entities sanctioned by the U.S. Justice Department&#x2019;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), with the rest associated with various crimes including scams and ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>According to Europol, 1.5 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transactions were made between Bitzlato users and the darknet market Hydra, which was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/germany-shuts-down-hydra-market-seizes-servers-and-bitcoin/">closed down</a> in April, 2022. On Jan. 18, U.S. officials described the takedown of Bitzlato as a &#x201C;blow to crypto crime&#x201D; dealt by an &#x201C;international cryptocurrency enforcement action.&#x201D;</p>

Gross domestic product (GDP) figures for Q4 2022 will be released on Thursday, followed by consumer sentiment data the day after. Ethereum also secured recent gains in today&#x2019;s session, with prices nearing a move below $1,600.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) consolidated for a third straight day, as traders continued to secure gains from Saturday, when prices rose to a five-month high.</p>
<p>Despite consolidating, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD remained above $23,000 for most of today&#x2019;s session, hitting a high of $23,134.01 in the process.</p>
<p>This comes less than 24 hours after it was trading at a low of $22,654.30, which is near a short-term support at $22,500.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is currently trading at $22,913.54, and this comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) neared a ceiling of 86.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a level of 85.09, with a floor at 80.00 another possible destination for traders.</p>
<p>The 10-day (red) moving average has also begun to show signs of peaking, which could lead to a sudden shift in momentum.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Momentum in ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) somewhat slowed in today&#x2019;s session, with price approaching its floor at $1,600.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,658.02 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,609.16 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Sentiment in the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency seems to have already shifted, with several dojis (candlesticks signaling reversal) appearing on the chart.</p>

<p>As can also be seen on the chart, the RSI is currently hovering slightly above a floor at 74.00, which is a current reading of 74.07.</p>
<p>Should a breakout take place, bearish pressure will likely increase, with traders potentially eyeing a move under $1,600.</p>
