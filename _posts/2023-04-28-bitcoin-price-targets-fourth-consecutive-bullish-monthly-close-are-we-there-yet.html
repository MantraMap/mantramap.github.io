Since the start of the trading year, Bitcoin has maintained a 3-month bullish candle close and is on a path to stealing a fourth. 2023 has been an eventful year for the crypto industry and Bitcoin price, which rallied massively to the surprise of many crypto analysts this month. The significant price movements of Bitcoin, which saw it rally past $30,000 for the first time since June 2022, triggered euphoria and awakened the interests of retail and large cryptocurrency investors. While market sentiments may seem to be positive at the moment, what could have brought about these sentiments? Bitcoin Price Takes The Spotlight Bitcoin has shown grit in its recent price movements and rallies, dragging several altcoins with it as it recorded significant gains. This positive price development of Bitcoin alongside other cryptocurrencies has led to crypto communities calling a start of a bull run and continued price movements.

According to a Reuters report, Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, made price predictions for Bitcoin, saying the alpha crypto could reach $100,000 by 2024. Also, Robert Kiyosaki, the famous best-selling author of &#8220;Rich Dad Poor Dad,&#8221; recently called a $100,000 price prediction for BTC on his Twitter handle. BTC&#8217;s sudden price rise and attention could be attributed to several market factors and happenings in the Tradfi and business world. Recent news of the collapse of bank giants such as Silicon Valley and Silvergate caused a stir in the traditional finance world, with users worried about the security of their funds. Concerns of rising inflation and de-dollarization have also resulted in financial experts and analysts looking to Bitcoin as a &#8220;Safe Haven&#8221; asset due to its decentralized nature. While the woes of the traditional finance system continue with recent news of the First Republic Bank potentially failing, Bitcoin price is seen looking to close another month in the bullish territory. Bitcoin Chart Analysis On The Weekly TimeFrame On the monthly chart timeframe, Bitcoin price is heading up to close April on a bullish note after its 3-month consecutive run.
