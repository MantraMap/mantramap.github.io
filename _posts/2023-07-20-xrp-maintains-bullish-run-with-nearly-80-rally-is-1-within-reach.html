XRP has undergone a remarkable price upsurge, surging to more than $0.80 and witnessing an impressive 77% increase over the past seven days in trading activity. This surge was predominantly triggered by Ripple’s partial victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In the court ruling, a judge acknowledged that Ripple&#8217;s institutional sales could be considered securities. However, it&#8217;s important to note that not all other sales were classified similarly. This ruling is widely perceived as a significant victory for Ripple Labs and its digital token.

Typically, after significant upward trends, crypto assets tend to undergo a consolidation or correction phase, and XRP is no exception. Therefore, it is likely that the price will enter a short-term correction phase, accompanied by higher volatility and pullback periods, before the next notable upward movement occurs.
