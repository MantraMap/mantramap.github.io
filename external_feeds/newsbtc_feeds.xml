She fervently states, &#8220;Gave a wake up call to VIP Experience members today: If you&#8217;re not investing in XRP at $0.60, XDC at $0.06, ALGO at $0.10, XLM at $0.10…don&#8217;t come crying to me when they are higher!&#8221; Drawing attention to the present market valuations, she highlighted that many of these assets are currently &#8220;selling at a deep discount&#8221;.

The least amount of risk is when prices are low, which is NOW. Could they go lower? Yes. So what, they will likely be a LOT higher in 2 years or sooner, so what are you waiting for?&#8221; XRP Price Analysis A price analysis of the 1-day chart suggests that the XRP price is at a crucial point following the summary judgement in the Ripple vs. SEC case. Related Reading: SEC Asks Court To File Interlocutory Appeal Vs. Ripple, XRP Price Stable At press time, XRP was trading at $0.59, down more than 35% from its yearly high at $0.93 following the summary judgment in the Ripple against the US Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) case. Before the verdict was announced, XRP was trading at $0.47, meaning that the XRP price has already lost most of its gains following the euphoria over Ripple&#8217;s victory. A look at the 1-day chart shows that XRP found support at the 100-day EMA at $0.5782 yesterday. Subsequently, XRP bulls managed to stage a small recovery. However, XRP is not out of the woods yet as the correction could continue unless the price shows a signal of trend reversal on the shorter timeframes. A first step would be to break above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.6340. A strong confirmation would be a spike above $0.69 where the 50% Fibonacci retracement level is located. In a bearish scenario, XRP also loses the 100-day EMA and falls towards the 200-day EMA at $0.5256. The level can be interpreted as the most crucial support at the moment. If the &#8220;bull line&#8221; fails to hold, the XRP price could face a crash to pre-Ripple ruling levels. Featured image from Outlook India, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[SEI, the native token of the Sei blockchain, appears to be gaining massive traction a day after its debut on multiple major exchanges. On Tuesday, August 15, Binance, Bybit, Bitget, Kucoin, and Kucoin jointly listed the token on their trading platforms. On the same day, Sei Labs, the company behind the network, announced the launch of the beta mainnet phase after a successful alpha phase. According to the developers, more than 7.5 million unique wallets and 400 million transactions were registered during the testnet phase. The Sei Mainnet beta, Pacific-1, is here.

SEI Breaks Into Top 100 Crypto Ranking &#8211; Price Overview  SEI experienced a surge in price upon its listing on various exchanges, notching more than a 650% gain within an hour. On Binance, the token opened trading at around $0.0639 before ballooning to a high of $0.4812.  However, SEI has since experienced a slight price correction, trading about 44% beneath the recent high. As of this writing, the token changes hands at $0.2669, with a substantial 16% price jump in the past hour. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bulls On The Horizon?

Interestingly, traders seem to have anticipated the current performance of SEI prior to its multiple exchange listings. Data from DEX Aevo’s pre-listing futures revealed that the token could reach nearly half a billion market cap upon debut on centralized exchanges. The initial circulating supply of SEI is 1.8 billion &#8211; 18% of the total supply of 10 billion tokens.

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently witnessed a gradual decline in both its price and Open Interest over the past three days. These developments have raised concerns of a bearish sentiment in the futures market. In a trend that has been unfolding over the last three days, Dogecoin&#8217;s price has experienced a steady descent, accompanied by a decrease in Open Interest. Open Interest refers to the total number of active contracts in the futures market. Its decline is often indicative of waning enthusiasm among traders and investors, suggesting a prevailing bearish sentiment.

OI is a crucial metric in the cryptocurrency market, revealing the number of outstanding contracts that have not yet been settled. A decrease in this key area can signify that traders are closing their positions, potentially anticipating further price declines.  Dogecoin Open Interest data. Source: Coinalyze DOGE Bearish Sentiment Evident Despite demonstrating some demand, Dogecoin&#8217;s price analysis points towards a further 5% drop. As of the most recent data from CoinGecko, the current DOGE price is $0.070578. In the last 24 hours alone, the meme coin suffered a 5.0% drop, while its seven-day performance showed a decline of nearly 5%. The downward trajectory intensified as the market structure of DOGE slipped below the $0.075 mark earlier in the week. The price report noted that amidst the prevailing bearish sentiment, the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) indicator exhibited an opposing trend. Over the past week, the OBV steadily climbed, suggesting an increase in buying pressure. DOGE market cap at $9.8 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com This juxtaposition underscores the complexity of market dynamics and indicates that while recent losses have been incurred, the underlying demand for Dogecoin might be stronger than anticipated. Ancient Dogecoin Whales Resurface In a surprising turn of events, the crypto community has observed the reawakening of four ancient Dogecoin whales in 2023. These whales, who had maintained a prolonged period of inactivity spanning over nine years, suddenly sprang into action. Collectively, they have transferred a staggering sum of 6,818,192 DOGE, amounting to approximately $557,157, according to data from Whale Alert. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bulls On The Horizon? Substantial Selling Pressure Seen Dropping The emergence of these ancient whales and their substantial movements raises questions about potential market impact. Their actions could potentially inject volatility into the already turbulent Dogecoin market. While the importance of these movements remains uncertain, they underscore the multifaceted nature and complexities that are deeply ingrained within the realm of cryptocurrency trading. These fluctuations, whether they manifest as sudden surges or dramatic plunges in market values, serve as a stark reminder of the volatility that characterizes this nascent yet transformative financial landscape.

<p>In a surprising turn of events, the crypto community has observed the reawakening of <a href="https://finbold.com/ancient-dogecoin-whales-move-7-billion-doge-after-9-years-of-inactivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">four ancient Dogecoin whales</a> in 2023. These whales, who had maintained a prolonged period of inactivity spanning over nine years, suddenly sprang into action. </p>
<p>Collectively, they have transferred a staggering sum of 6,818,192 DOGE, amounting to approximately $557,157, according to data from Whale Alert.</p>

<p>The emergence of these ancient whales and their substantial movements raises questions about potential market impact. Their actions could potentially inject volatility into the already turbulent Dogecoin market.</p>
<p>While the importance of these movements remains uncertain, they underscore the multifaceted nature and complexities that are deeply ingrained within the realm of cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<p>These fluctuations, whether they manifest as sudden surges or dramatic plunges in market values, serve as a stark reminder of the volatility that characterizes this nascent yet transformative financial landscape.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Another shocking discovery has rattled the crypto sector as Christian Peev, a 41-year-old US cryptocurrency investor has been found dead. Christian Peev&#8217;s Alleged Murderer Was A Friend According to Peev’s cousin, the crypto investor disappeared in early August, and growing increasingly worried, Peev’s cousin reported him missing to authorities on August 10, which prompted an investigation.  The dismembered body of the American-Bulgaria investor was found days later by plumbers called to fix a blocked drain in Sofia, Bulgaria, who eventually discovered that it was pieces of a human body that caused the blockage.  Related Reading: Institutional XRP Holdings Rise Rapidly Following Ripple’s Win Over SEC The remains were later identified to be Peev’s body, although parts of the body, like the head and bones were missing. These were found to be buried as the murderer could not flush them down the toilet. Following the discovery of the remains, a bartender, Vesco Valchinov has been named as the prime suspect in connection to the murder of Peev. Christian Peev was known to be highly recognized in top events and parties, where he met the bartender. According to sources, Vesco Valchinov and Christian Peev met at a bar about 5-6 years ago, and Peev being a formidable and knowledgeable crypto enthusiast introduced Valchinov to the world of cryptocurrency. Valchinov became the prime suspect in Peev&#8217;s demise as surveillance footage showed that both Valchinov and Peev were seen entering Valchinov&#8217;s residence on August 8, but Valchinov was the only one seen leaving his residence the following day. Forensics show that Valchinov allegedly killed Peev with a dumbbell in his residence. However, Valchinov was not the only one involved in the demise of Christian Peev.   Total market cap sitting at $1.121 trillion &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Konstantin Subotinov who was believed to be an accomplice to Valchinov was also arrested by authorities and later confessed that he helped Valchinov in disposing of the remains of Peev&#8217;s body by driving some of the parts to Vitosha to bury them. Valchinov apparently knew the authorities were onto him and he tried to lose his tail by fleeing to a hotel in Vitosha. But unfortunately for him, authorities tracked his phone and he was apprehended the following day. Could The Murder Be Money Related? Although the authorities and investigators believe that the murder of Christian Peev is money related, as Peev had amassed a considerable fortune from his crypto investments, jealousy has also been seen as a potential motivation for the murder of Peev. Related Reading: Renowned Finance Author Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $1 Million If This Happens Investigators speculate that Valchinov might have been jealous of his friend Peev and the fortune he has built for himself. However, the investigation is still ongoing, and more details will be unveiled, as authorities tend to crack the case and figure out what led to this tragedy. Peev’s death marks the second crypto investor found murdered and dismembered in less than a month. In July, crypto influencer Fernando Pérez Algaba was found dead in Buenos Aires, Argentina. According to authorities, Algaba’s remains were found in a suitcase and his death is believed to be connected to a significant debt he owed.  Featured image from How Stuff Works, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The world&#8217;s largest exchange Binance announced on Tuesday, August 15, intentions to delist three tokens from its trading platform. According to the exchange&#8217;s official statement, it regularly conducts a periodic review of all cryptocurrencies and trading products on its platform, ensuring they are of the highest standards in order to protect its customers’ interests. This review is based on certain factors, including trading volume and liquidity, network stability, network security against attacks, and the project’s team commitment, among others.  Based on the results of their latest reviews, Binance states the following tokens are lacking in compliance in relation to these factors: Sonm (SNM), Serum (SRM), and DFI.Money (YFII). Therefore, the exchange will be delisting all trading pairs related to these tokens at exactly 03:00 (UTC) on August 22, 2023. In addition, the order extends to other platforms affiliated with the exchange, including Binance Simple Earn, Binance Loans, Binance Gift Card, and Binance Pay. Albeit, the enforcement date varies for some of these platforms.  Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Similarly To 2019 And 2020? Binance Delisting Leads To Heavy Losses For Tokens Following Binance’s announcement, Sonm (SNM), Serum (SRM), and DFI.Money (YFII) have all seen their value plunged into double-digit losses. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the SNM token is the largest loser of the trio declining by 79.09% in the last 24 hours.  Meanwhile, SRM and YFII are down by 29.19% and 19.55%, respectively, over the last day. These losses are quite unsurprising, as delisting by any exchange is commonly interpreted by investors as a disapproval of the token. Considering Binance’s status as a key player in the global crypto space boasting over 150 million users, the exchange delisting a token can be quite detrimental, as seen above. At the time of writing, SNM is trading at $0.05924, while SRM and YFII are exchanging hands at $0.5053 and $584.63, respectively.  SNM trading at $0.0597 on the daily chart &#124; Source: SNM/USDT chart on Tradingview.com Binance Connect Shuts Down In other news, Binance has decided to close down its regulated buy and sell service, Binance Connect, due to the deactivation of supporting card payments on the platform by its provider.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto space is on the verge of another potentially historic moment with the first Ethereum Futures ETF in the US. Volatility Shares, a pioneer in the ETF space, has announced its intention to launch the Ether Strategy ETF (Ticker: ETHU) on October 12, 2023. If all goes as planned, this could mark the first Ether based exchange traded fund (ETF) in the United States. First Ethereum Futures ETF Is Set To Launch In The US Volatility Shares has positioned the ETF around cash-settled Ethereum futures contracts trading on the CBOE. Notably, the ETF avoids direct investment in Ether itself. &#8220;The Fund is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing its assets principally in cash-settled contracts referencing Ether&#8230; The Fund does not invest directly in Ether,&#8221; reads the SEC filing. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prints Bearish Technical Pattern, Why It Could Extend Losses Stuart Barton, the CIO of Volatility Shares, voiced his optimism, saying, “Volatility Shares successfully launched the first 2x Bitcoin-linked ETF (BITX) in July and believes that ETHU is the next logical step before turning our forces to spot markets.” Eric Balchunas, senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg, weighed in on the audacity of Volatility Shares&#8217; aggressive timeline: &#8220;VolatilityShares announcing they intend to list their Ether Futures ETF on Oct 12th (which would be a day or two ahead of the rest of pack (if the 75 days is adhered to).. they did same thing w $BITX&#8221;. When prompted on the likelihood of SEC&#8217;s approval, he remarked, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s been no withdrawals so SEC looks to be okay with them &#8230; he’s probably just pushing the envelope like he did w BITX&#8221;. While Volatility Shares leads the pack, they&#8217;re not alone in this pursuit. A total of 13 heavyweight financial institutions, including names like Bitwise, VanEck, Vakyrie, Roubhill, ProShares, and Grayscale, have sought the US SEC&#8217;s blessings for their Ether Futures ETFs. However, as of now, the SEC hasn&#8217;t given its green signal to any. Will Ether Echo BTC&#8217;s 2021 Surge? Remarkably, the first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US was launched back on October 19, 2021. At that time, ProShares won the race for the first mover effect. And this has paid off. The total assets in Bitcoin futures ETFs accounts to $1.3 billion. Of that, nearly $1.1 billion is in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). The second largest ETF is the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF with $73 million. No other ETF has more than $50 million in assets under management. Related Reading: BALD Deployer Moves Proceeds Of The Rug From Base To Ethereum When the first Bitcoin futures ETF was launched, BTC was in the midst of the 2021 bull run. In the run-up to the futures ETF launch, BTC put on a 60% rally from Oct. 1 to Oct. 19, rising 60% to $66,970. In the next seven subsequent days, BTC saw a correction of about 14% before Bitcoin continued its rally to the all-time high near $69,000. Whether the ETH price will experience a similar euphoria as Bitcoin in 2021 remains to be seen. At least the environment is different. While BTC was in a full blown bull market, the crypto market is currently in a phase of stagnation, possibly before the start of a new bull market. However, without a doubt, the first Ethereum Futures ETF has the potential to be a catalyst for the ETH price. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,826, just above the key support of the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The price action of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has encountered a significant compression, primarily attributed to substantial selling originating from a prominent institutional market participant. Data obtained from Lookonchain, a renowned on-chain analytics resource, has shed light on the ongoing selling spree by Voyager, a troubled asset manager currently navigating bankruptcy proceedings.  This selling binge over the past four days has amounted to an astonishing 1.4 trillion SHIB tokens, equivalent to approximately $14.4 million. The cryptocurrency landscape has witnessed a noteworthy development as Voyager, amidst its financial restructuring, embarked on an extensive liquidation of SHIB tokens.  Related Reading: Chiliz (CHZ) Empowers Smart Contracts With Upgrades – Positive Impact On Price?

SHIB market cap currently at $5.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com News circulating about potential downgrades within the banking sector might have inadvertently contributed to the 24-hour slump witnessed by SHIB. It&#8217;s worth acknowledging that seemingly unrelated developments can trigger ripples of uncertainty across financial markets, ultimately impacting various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies like SHIB.

As SHIB hovers around its current value of $0.00000998, investors and enthusiasts are cautiously optimistic about the prospects of a sustained price rally. Despite the recent slump, SHIB&#8217;s overall trajectory remains promising, supported by both its recent rally and the depletion of Voyager&#8217;s SHIB holdings. While the impact of institutional selling cannot be ignored, SHIB&#8217;s future gains may be bolstered by a reduced supply overhang.  SHIB&#8217;s upcoming performance will undoubtedly be influenced by a complex interplay of factors, ranging from market sentiment to macroeconomic developments.
