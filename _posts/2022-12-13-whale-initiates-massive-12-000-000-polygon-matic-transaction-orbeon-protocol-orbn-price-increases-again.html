<p>Polygon is showing bullish signals after crypto whale moved $12 million.</p>
<p>Last week, crypto tracking platform Whale Alert reported a massive $12 million Polygon (MATIC) transaction. The whale moved the funds from cold storage to a wallet managed by Coinbase.</p>
<p>This is likely in preparation for some larger transactions. The news comes after Polygon rose 10% the week prior. Polygon has been showing bullish signs recently, and could surge in the following weeks.</p>
<p>At the same time, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has seen its price increase again. ORBN is up 655% since its presale, and is projected to rise even more in the following weeks.</p>

<p class="s9">What is Polygon (MATIC)</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) started out as a way to enable faster, cheaper, and more decentralized transactions for Ethereum.</p>
<p>The Layer 2 scaling solution allows large-scale DApps to be more efficient and affordable. It uses a highly optimized form of proof of stake consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>By focusing on scalability, Polygon enables developers to build high-throughput applications. These include DeFi, NFTs, non-fungible tokens and games.</p>
<p>As an upgrade to Ethereum's ecosystem, Polygon is taking some load away from the largest DeFi network. It also benefits from Ethereum's huge development infrastructure and vibrant community.</p>
<p>This helps boost MATIC, Polygon's native currency. MATIC has the function of validating transactions and settling fees on the network.</p>
<p>As Ethereum's ecosystem grows, Polygon is set to benefit. This is especially true since some of Ethereum's smaller competitors were hit by the recent FTX crash.</p>
<p>Ethereum's surge will benefit not just Polygon, but also other projects in its ecosystem. One of these projects is Orbeon Protocol.</p>

<p class="s9">What is Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol is a decentralized investment platform that challenges the traditional venture capital model. It's a crowdfunding platform that aims to build an inclusive economy through blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Startups can use Orbeon Protocol&rsquo;s NFTs as a service (NFTsaaS) to mint equity-backed, fractionalized NFTs to issue during funding rounds, allowing them much quicker and easier access to capital. In turn, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) allows investors to support these funding rounds from as low as $1.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol offers a secure way to access investments in innovative projects. It provides investors with liquidity options and allows them to monitor their investments through the blockchain.</p>
<p>At the same time, Orbeon Protocol allows startup founders to raise funds more easily, efficiently, and cost-effectively. It also allows founders to connect more easily to their backers.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol has plans to become a multichain, metaverse-enabled platform. Right now, it is built on the Ethereum network, with plans to expand to Polygon next. That's why it could benefit from the growing interest in Polygon.</p>
<p>The Orbeon ecosystem is powered by the project&rsquo;s native ORBN token, a utility coin that provides holders with various benefits ranging from governance rights, staking bonuses and transaction fee discounts. </p>
<p>The project is making waves in the DeFi space as ORBN&rsquo;s price has been steadily increasing over the past months. Investors are optimistic, as the token has increased 655% since the presale. Experts predict ORBN will surge as high as 6000% before the presale ends.</p>
