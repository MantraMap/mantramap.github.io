<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tata-indian-iphone-manufacturer/">Tata Group Close to Seal Deal on Becoming First Indian iPhone Manufacturer</a></p>
<p>Early on Tuesday, July 11, the news spread that India&#8217;s largest conglomerate Tata Group is close to acquiring <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a>&#8216;s Indian supplier factory by August this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-11/tata-group-closes-in-on-deal-to-become-first-indian-iphone-maker" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> sources familiar with the matter, and this would be the first time that a local Indian firm is moving into the manufacturing of iPhones.</p>
<p>The sources added that the Tata Group will take over the Wistron Corp. factory in southern Karnataka state, currently valued at over $600 million. They added that the Tata Group has been negotiating for more than a year. The facility at Wistron Corp. currently employs over 10,000 people responsible for the assembly of the iPhone 14 model.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year through March 2024, Wistron Corp has shown commitment to ship iPhones worth at least $1.8 billion from the Karnataka factory. This will also make them eligible for state-backed financial incentives, the sources said.</p>
<p>The introduction of an iPhone made specifically for the Indian market is expected to boost Apple&#8217;s efforts to expand its product range beyond China and strengthen its manufacturing presence in India. Wistron, one of Apple&#8217;s key suppliers, has already exported around $500 million worth of iPhones from India in the last quarter. Other Taiwanese suppliers like Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. have also increased their local production in India.</p>
<p>A month ago and so, time cook integrated the first two Apple Stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. The Apple chief sees great potential in the Indian market and there&#8217;s a growing appetite for Apple products.</p>
<h2>India Pushing on Manufacturing</h2>
<p>India has been working on increasing its own manufacturing capabilities with the help of government programs and incentives. Apple, in particular, has been trying to reduce its dependence on China and expand its production in other countries.</p>
<p>The introduction of an Indian company manufacturing iPhones could be a big step towards challenging China&#8217;s position as the world&#8217;s factory. It may also encourage other global electronics brands to consider manufacturing in India, reducing their reliance on China.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s largest conglomerate Tata Group sells everything from salt to tech services. Now, the group is making a big push into the manufacturing of electronic devices as well as semiconductor manufacturing. The Tata Group is already producing the iPhone chassis, which is the metal frame of the device, at its factory located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ai-money-maker-funding-millionaire/">AI Will Be Largest Money Maker in History for Anyone, Says Self-Made Millionaire Exec</a></p>
<p>As artificial intelligence tools become increasingly popular, individuals and organizations scramble to take a big bite of the AI pie. Today, the general outlook on AI is disruptive, with most projecting that the technology will create new use cases and be a wealth facilitator. According to the CEO of investment company RSE Ventures, AI will be the next big money maker.</p>
<p>Speaking to CNBC’s Make It, CEO Matt Higgins believes that AI could be a fantastic way to make money if people knew how to apply the technology. He believes AI can work for everyone regardless of background or access to opportunities. Higgins said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“AI will be the greatest wealth creator in history, because artificial intelligence doesn’t care where you were born, whether you have money, whether you have a PhD. It’s going to destroy barriers that have prevented people from moving up the ladder, and pursuing their dream of economic freedom.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Higgins’ position may not be surprising as most people seem very bullish about the opportunities obtainable from applying artificial intelligence. Since OpenAI launched <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> last November, the technology has been trending at the individual and corporate levels, such that most big tech companies are developing or launching one AI tool or another.</p>
<p>According to a Precedence Research <a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/artificial-intelligence-market" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, the global AI market was valued at $69.25 billion in 2022 and would likely hit 1.87 trillion by 2032, with a 39.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2032. Another forecast gives AI a 20.1% CAGR and a value of $1.39 trillion by 2029.</p>
<h2>Experts Say Anyone Can Start Making Money Via AI</h2>
<p>Higgins is not the only stakeholder who believes it’s possible to already start making money using AI. However, the Shark Tank guest shark and self-made millionaire believes that now is the best time to begin. According to him, “it’s not that if you don’t jump on it now, you never can. It’s that now is the greatest opportunity for you to capitalize on it.”</p>
<p>CEO and founder of AI startup AIandYou, Susan Gonzales, is also blowing the AI trumpet. Through her startup, which teaches AI skills to communities in need, Gonzales also says now is the best time for anyone to learn about the technology. Anyone, including students, artists, and freelancers, can apply AI to their jobs or studies to streamline their process and improve turnaround time.</p>
<p>In addition to freelancing, AI will help entrepreneurs with optimizing business operations. Gonzales says that small businesses can use AI to gather competitive intelligence, improve advertising and marketing, and find new ways to make money.</p>
<h2>AI Regulation</h2>
<p>As AI adoption increases, governments worldwide are concerned about its abilities. Last month, the European Union (EU) Parliament <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/eu-parliament-ai-draft-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> an act to manage and supervise AI development and usage in the area. The new act enforces a few specifics, including requiring companies to label all AI-generated content. The act would also restrict law enforcement from using AI tools to predict criminal behavior or conduct unauthorized surveillance. In addition, the act covers for close examination of any other AI uses considered high risk.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-china-store-wechat/">Apple Expands Retail Reach in China with Official Store Opening on WeChat </a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a>, an American multinational technology company, has expanded its retail presence in China, the world&#8217;s second-largest economy, with the launch of an official store on the popular social media platform WeChat. According to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/apple-launches-wechat-store-in-china.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> on July 11, the latest expansion brings Apple&#8217;s products and services directly to WeChat&#8217;s vast user base of approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide.</p>
<p>The social media platform, known as a &#8220;super app&#8221;, goes beyond messaging and offers diverse services within its ecosystem. With the introduction of its Mini Program feature, users can access various services without the hassle of downloading multiple apps. The iPhone maker has leveraged the platform by launching its store on WeChat&#8217;s Mini Program, enabling users to conveniently browse and purchase Apple products, including the latest iPhone 14 models, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs.</p>
<h2>WeChat Offers Buyers Free Shipping on Orders</h2>
<p>According to the report, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tencent</a>, the parent company of WeChat, said that customers using the WeChat store could enjoy various benefits, such as free shipping on orders and an option for three-hour delivery in selected cases. Additionally, users can access more Apple services, including the trade-in program, all within the social media platform.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s decision to establish an official store on WeChat is part of its ongoing efforts to strengthen its retail channels in China, one of its most significant markets. The company already operates an official store on Tmall, Alibaba&#8217;s e-commerce site, and collaborates with JD.com, a prominent online retailer in China.</p>
<p>To further expand its retail presence in China, the American-based technology giant ventured into live commerce in May this year, aiming to connect with consumers through interactive and real-time product showcases.</p>
<p>While the Chinese smartphone market experienced a 5% decline in sales during the first quarter of 2023, Apple&#8217;s iPhone sales demonstrated resilience, growing by 6% year-on-year during the same period. This solid performance in a challenging market highlights the strength of the company&#8217;s brand and consumer demand for its products in China.</p>
<p>The Asian country remains a crucial market for Apple, extending beyond its home turf in the United States. Counterpoint Research estimated that the iPhone 13 series dominated the top three spots in the chart of best-selling phones in China for 2022, highlighting Apple&#8217;s devices&#8217; strong demand and popularity among Chinese consumers.</p>
<h2>Apple Expands Retail Presence Around the World</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, apart from China, Apple plans to expand its retail services to various regions worldwide. The technology maker said in June that it intends to open and rejuvenate its retail chain to focus on strengthening its presence in other parts of Asia and revamping established locations in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gadgets360.com/internet/news/apple-plans-major-retail-push-new-stores-india-china-us-asia-europe-4087756" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, citing people familiar with the matter, the company is currently discussing opening 15 new stores across the Asia-Pacific region and five additional locations in Europe and the Middle East. Furthermore, plans are underway to establish four new outlets in the United States and Canada. These deliberations cover the period until 2027.</p>
<p>In addition to the new store openings, Apple aims to revamp or relocate six stores in Asia, nine in Europe, and 13 in North America. These efforts are part of the company&#8217;s comprehensive strategy to enhance the customer experience and modernize its retail spaces. The proposed plans involve 53 new, relocated, or remodeled stores over the next four years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/temasek-decline-shareholder-return/">Temasek Records 5% Decline in Annual Shareholder Return</a></p>
<p>Temasek Holdings Ltd, Singapore&#8217;s state investment business noted for its strong investment portfolio and stable financial performance, has reported a 5.07% decrease in its one-year total shareholder return in Singapore Dollars for the fiscal year ending March 31. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/singapore-temasek-2023-report.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, the company’s net portfolio value also experienced a dip, totaling S$382 billion ($284.77 billion) compared to S$403 billion in the previous year. This marks the first annual shareholder negative return for Temasek since 2020.</p>
<p>This downturn comes as no surprise, considering the challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment that has impacted global markets. Lim Boon Heng, Chairman of Temasek recently highlighted the challenging nature of the global market conditions in 2022.</p>
<p>Last year, global stock markets grappled with the challenge of sticky inflation, despite central banks implementing multiple rate hikes. Intensifying geopolitical tensions, such as those between the US and China, as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, added to market volatility and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Notably, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-sp-500-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> (INDEXSP: .INX) and MSCI Asia ex-Japan benchmarks both plummeted by around 20%. This slump reflects investor concerns about the impact of rising prices on corporate profitability and economic growth. Against this backdrop, Temasek’s decline in annual shareholder return appears relatively favorable, showcasing its ability to manage risks and mitigate losses.</p>
<p>The Singapore state investment arm maintains a diversified portfolio consisting of both public and private market investments. As of March 31, unlisted assets accounted for 53% of its portfolio, generating higher returns compared to listed assets.</p>
<p>Marking the unlisted portfolio to market would result in an estimated value uplift of S$18 billion. Additionally, Temasek has delivered robust long-term returns, with three-year, ten-year, and twenty-year total shareholder returns of 8%, 6%, and 9% respectively.</p>
<h2>Temasek Cautious Investment Approach</h2>
<p>Furthermore, Temasek disclosed a reversal of gains in its global direct investments in industries such as technology, healthcare, and payments, owing mostly to value derating in the higher interest rate environment.</p>
<p>Consequently, Temasek adopted a cautious approach and slowed down its investment pace, with a net investment of $3 billion in the 12 months ending March 31. Temasek made strategic investments in payment platform Stripe and IT security provider Kaseya, facilitating the acquisition of Datto, a provider of security and cloud-based software solutions.</p>
<p>Additionally, Temasek has bolstered its investment in Mastronardi Produce Ltd., a Canadian company that specializes in the cultivation and distribution of fresh produce grown in greenhouses. This move reflects Temasek’s confidence in the growth potential of the agriculture and food sector, driven by increasing demand for high-quality, sustainable produce.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Temasek has set a limitation on early-stage investments, limiting them to 6% of its portfolio. This metric demonstrates the company&#8217;s sensible risk management approach and recognition of the higher risks associated with early-stage enterprises.</p>
<p>In November, Temasek <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/temasek-275m-investment-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote down</a> its $275 million investment in the bankrupt crypto exchange, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>. Subsequently, the company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/temasek-executives-ftx-stake-compensation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented</a> compensation cuts for the team responsible for recommending the investment and the senior management team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-wall-street/">BlackRock Edges Closer to Bitcoin ETF Launch, Here&#8217;s What It Means for Wall Street</a></p>
<p>Asset management giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock</a> is ever close to launching its exchange-traded fund (ETF). This follows after it <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec/">applied</a> with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) sometime last month.</p>
<p>Although the SEC has never approved any spot Bitcoin ETF, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1886c3a3-3fb8-411a-b95a-e4667de560d1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">crypto enthusiasts</a> are quite positive about this one. So if successful, then BlackRock will become the first asset manager to launch a fund that tracks the price of bitcoin.</p>
<p>In all of this anticipation, however, the most probable gainers would be the institutional investors. Presently, institutional investors are not legally permitted to buy cryptocurrencies. But all of that could change once BlackRock secures the approval, thereby offering Wall Street a legal and cheap way to access the token.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Anticipates BlackRock&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>The interest of Wall Street in the approval of BlackRock&#8217;s application might be understandable. Initially, BlackRock&#8217;s push appeared odd considering that the crypto industry is just recovering from what came to be a fatal 2022 for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin has managed to stage a comeback in 2023. And by gaining over 80% to hit the $30,000 mark, investors are now bracing for a potential bull run.</p>
<p>For Wall Street though, they would not want a repeat of 2021&#8217;s miss. Recall that as of early 2021, most top banks still took a somewhat hostile approach to digital assets. Their stance at the time meant that they missed out on a massive run of gains that saw Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price quadruple within a year, and brought the entire crypto industry to be valued at over $2 trillion.</p>
<p>But now, with BlackRock filing for its ETF off the back of another looming rally, Wall Street will seek to tap into the opportunity.</p>
<p>Speaking about his firm&#8217;s recent laser focus on spot ETF, CEO Larry Fink has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likened</a> the token to &#8220;digital gold&#8221;. According to Fink, Bitcoin has all the potential to &#8220;revolutionize&#8221; finance.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/circle-ceo-advocates-yuan-backed-stablecoins/">Circle CEO Advocates for Yuan-Backed Stablecoins Instead of CBDC in China</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jeremy-allaire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Allaire</a>, the co-founder and CEO of stablecoin issuer <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle Financial</a>, has recently urged Chinese authorities to consider yuan-backed stablecoins as a viable alternative to Central Bank Digital Currencies (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>s). Circle CEO&#8217;s suggestion comes amid China&#8217;s ongoing efforts to develop its own CBDC, the digital yuan.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3227171/head-crypto-firm-circle-accepts-ban-mainland-china-sees-role-yuan-backed-stablecoins?module=live&amp;pgtype=homepage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with the South China Morning Post, the Circle boss highlighted the potential benefits of yuan-backed stablecoins for China&#8217;s international trade and commerce. He emphasized that if the Chinese government aims to see the yuan being widely used around the globe, stablecoins could be the path to achieve that goal. While he acknowledged that stablecoins and CBDCs are complementary, he believes stablecoins offer unique advantages compared to the central banks-issued virtual currencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;If, eventually, the Chinese government wants to see the RMB used more freely in trade and commerce around the world, it may be that stablecoins are the path to do that more than the central bank digital currency,&#8221; he told SCMP in the interview.</p>
<p>The Circle CEO further stressed that these types of cryptocurrencies have the advantage of maintaining the stability and familiarity of a fiat currency while leveraging the benefits of digital assets. By using stablecoins pegged to the yuan, China could enhance the global usability of its money and facilitate seamless cross-border transactions.</p>
<h2>China&#8217;s Strict Policies on Yuan Convertibility Could Hinder Stablecoin Adoption</h2>
<p>While Allaire&#8217;s proposal presents an alternative approach, it is important to consider the potential challenges associated with adopting stablecoins in China. The country has implemented strict capital controls and restrictions on the convertibility of the yuan as part of its economic policies. Experts have suggested that China may prefer to maintain its existing rules and limitations rather than pursue full currency convertibility, as it would require substantial changes to its trade settlement structure. Incremental steps, such as increasing the use of the yuan in trade with commodity-exporting countries, could be more feasible.</p>
<p>Moreover, Allaire&#8217;s proposition recognizes the complementary nature of stablecoins and CBDCs. He emphasized that if central banks upgrade their systems to utilize blockchain technology, it could bring numerous benefits. However, he also highlighted the distinction between the private sector&#8217;s innovative work on the public internet and the central banks&#8217; role in developing CBDCs.</p>
<p>&#8220;If central banks are going to upgrade their own systems to move away from legacy technology into more modern distributed ledger technology, that&#8217;s great. There&#8217;s a whole bunch of useful things from that, but I view that as very different from the work the private sector does to innovate on the public internet,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Circle CEO Remains Optimistic about Web 3 Technologies in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>China has been at the forefront of CBDC development, with ongoing trials and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/digital-yuan-9-5b-spent-transactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pilot </a>programs for the digital yuan. The government&#8217;s focus on creating a centralized digital currency aims to enhance financial inclusivity, improve payment efficiency, and strengthen regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>The country banned its citizens in 2021 from engaging in any activities related to the crypto industry, including trading and mining of cryptocurrencies in the country. Allaire believes that while mainland China has maintained its stance against the emerging economy and has not shown a willingness to open up its markets to digital assets, he remains optimistic about the development of Web3 technologies in Hong Kong. He also praised Hong Kong&#8217;s local monetary efforts to regulate stablecoins.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/user-data-razer-sale-hack/">User Data of Gaming Gear Maker Razer on Sale Online after Recent Hack</a></p>
<p>As per the latest report, gaming hardware maker Razer has allegedly suffered a data breach. Last Saturday, July 8, a hacker forum had a post informing about the attack with the hacker offering the stolen data for $135,000.</p>
<p>“I have stolen the source code, encryption keys, database, backend access logins, etc,” the hacker <a href="https://www.hackread.com/razer-data-breach-database-backend-access-sold/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">declared</a>. The hacker further added that “[I] will be selling this one time” for a set price of $100,000 in privacy coin Monero (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/monero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XMR</a>). However, the hacker is open to considering lower offers as well.</p>
<p>The Strat Times has seen a sample of users&#8217; email addresses on offer, with the hacker claiming that it was from a list having a total of 404,000 entries. The publication also confirms that the data for sale includes the source code as well as the back-end access logins for Razer’s website and its products.</p>
<p>This included folders with names like zVault, which was Razer&#8217;s digital wallet launched in March 2017 and later replaced by Razer Gold in December 2018. The leaked data also supposedly contained encryption keys and files related to Razer&#8217;s reward system.</p>
<p>One sample examined by ST revealed alleged email addresses of customers who had virtual credit in their Razer Gold accounts. The seller claimed to possess 404,000 accounts, but this information could not be independently verified.</p>
<h2>Razer Is Investigating the Matter</h2>
<p>In a tweet on Sunday, July 9, Razer said that they have been investigating the potential breach. Furthermore, Razer reset all user accounts while asking them to change passwords.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have been made aware of a potential breach and are currently investigating.</p>
<p>— R Λ Z Ξ R (@Razer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Razer/status/1678212940967624705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Razer was hit by another hack, adding to the ongoing aftermath of a data breach that occurred in 2020. On July 10, a Singaporean court heard an appeal by Capgemini, an IT vendor, regarding a $6.5 million award granted to Razer in December.</p>
<p>The 2020 data breach involved the personal information of approximately 100,000 users. It occurred when a programmer from Capgemini allegedly manipulated a line of code, leaving the data exposed between June and September 2020. The breach was detected by a security consultant in September 2020.</p>
<p>Founded in 2005, Razer has offices in the US and Singapore. Back in 2017, the company launched digital currencies for rewards and credits. As per reports, the data stolen during the recent July 8 hack belongs to the old version of the system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/terra-co-founder-daniel-shin-court/">Terra Co-Founder Daniel Shin Appears in South Korean Court with Seven Others</a></p>
<p>Terraform Labs co-founder Shin Hyun-Seong, also known as Daniel Shin, reportedly had his first trial preparation hearing on Monday, July 10 for charges related to “unfair profits” from the sale of Terra (LUNA). This comes after the founder’s indictment in April on charges of fraud and violation of capital markets law.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/?5101793" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">local media</a>, Shin and seven others we summoned to appear before a Seoul Southern District Court to face charges of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement and Violation of the Capital Markets Act. Shin reportedly did not appear in person but was represented by his legal team. Prosecutors allege that the accused deceived investors by presenting the Terra project as more successful than it was in reality. The eight are accused of manipulating the prices of digital assets through transactions and inaccurate media reports starting in 2018. The groups reportedly realised about 462.9 billion Korean won (about $357 million) in illicit profits.</p>
<p>Daniel Shin, who co-founded Terraform Labs with Do Kwon, allegedly sold about $118 million in LUNA before the token crashed in May of 2022. He is accused of using similar tactics with the intention of profiting from investor funds at Chai Corporation, the fintech company he went on to create following his departure from Terraform Labs.</p>
<p>Shin’s defence has denied reports that he “sold Luna at a high point and realized profits or that he made profits through other illegal methods”. It is also worth noting that while Shin’s LinkedIn profile suggests that he had not been involved with Terraform Labs’ operations since January 2020, it is not clear if he still had any investments in the company’s shares or tokens.</p>
<p>The founder’s defence requested more time from Judge Jang Seong-hoon who granted the motion.</p>
<p>“We will check the opinions of the lawyers and reopen the trial preparation date to decide the opportunity for defence and the order of interrogation,” Judge Seong-hoon ruled.</p>
<p>A new hearing is scheduled for August 28.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, South Korean authorities are seeking extradition for Terra’s other co-founder Do Kwon who is currently serving a four-month sentence in Montenegro following his arrest in March for using forged travel documents. He was sentenced in June and faces extradition to either his home country of South Korea or the United States once his sentence is complete.</p>
<p>South Korean authorities issued an arrest warrant for Do Kwon in September 2022 following the May 2022 <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/south-korea-exchanges-terra-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">collapse</a> of Terra platform and the depegging of its USTC algorithmic stablecoin. Following the collapse, authorities decided to look into Do Kwon and Daniel Shin&#8217;s alleged illegal transactions before and during the crash.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/vara-dubai-bitoasis-license/">VARA, Dubai Crypto Regulator, Makes BitOasis License Non-Operational</a></p>
<p>Dubai cryptocurrency regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), has suspended the license of BitOasis because the exchange failed to fulfill certain conditions the regulator set within a specified timeframe.</p>
<p>BitOasis is a crypto exchange operating in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. The exchange was founded in 2014 by Ola Doudin and is one of the earliest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the Middle East and North Africa region. The VARA provides regulatory oversight to make sure exchanges operate within the scope of the law and in the best interest of the people.</p>
<p>The license VARA granted BitOasis in April was a Minimal Viable Product license, which permitted the exchange to operate if it could meet some requirements within 30 to 60 days, which the exchange failed to do.</p>
<p>VARA was not specific about the particular requirements that the exchange had failed to meet. However, as a result of the shortcoming, the exchange has become non-operational and cannot provide regulated retail or institutional services.</p>
<p>In an official statement on its website, the regulator <a href="https://www.vara.ae/en/regulations/regulatory-notices/market-alert-bitoasis-technologies-fze-bitoasis/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;VARA is exercising its authority to supervise and monitor compliance, assure fulfillment of prescribed conditions, impose remedial measures, and take necessary enforcement actions, including but not limited to holding BitOasis&#8217; License status as non-operational.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The MVP license prevents exchanges from having a full operation. Having this license shows that BitOasis met some initial requirements that allowed it to operate within specific limitations. The MVP is like an interim step in the full regulatory process. For BitOasis to have full operations, it has to meet certain conditions that will qualify it for a Full Market Product (FMP) license.</p>
<p>VARA will continue to make sure that BitOasis takes the necessary actions to comply with regulatory standards. The regulators also made it clear that the announcement is only to notify the public of what is going on and should not replace individual investors carrying out their own research when trying to choose an exchange to trade with.</p>
<h2>Dubai Remains Crypto-Friendly Despite VARA Regulations</h2>
<p>In April, Dubai regulators issued a warning to OPNX, a crypto exchange, accusing it of operating without a license and ordering the firm to immediately cease its activities.</p>
<p>Even though the regulator is doing its job and maintaining strict conditions that exchanges must meet, Dubai has remained one of the finest places for crypto and crypto exchanges. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a> are currently looking at the possibility of establishing their presence in the region.</p>
<p>Some exchanges like Bybit, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/okex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OKX</a> have gotten Dubai&#8217;s Minimal Viable Product license, which authorizes them to operate in the area.</p>
