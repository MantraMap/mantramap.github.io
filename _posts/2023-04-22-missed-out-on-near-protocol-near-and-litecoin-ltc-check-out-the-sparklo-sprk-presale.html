<p>Those who bought in early on NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and Litecoin (LTC) are now generating profits, but do not feel discouraged if you did not - meet Sparklo! Some experts even believe this presale star could yield the same or more earnings than the coins above. Let&rsquo;s find out why! </p>
<p class="s7">NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Integrates With Mailchain</p>
<p>NEAR Protocol (NEAR) recently announced its partnership with Mailchain, the Web3 communication layer. The Multichain SDK will enable NEAR Protocol (NEAR) developers to provide confidential connectivity to decentralized applications (dApps) built on its network. </p>
<p>However, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has not been performing well on the value charts recently, as it currently trades at $2.18, falling 0.86% in the past 24 hours. Not only that, the trading volume for NEAR Protocol (NEAR) also decreased by 13% in that same time, sinking to $134,378,615. </p>
<p>And with the moving averages for NEAR Protocol (NEAR) all in the red, many investors are sidestepping it for other projects with more room for growth. </p>
<p class="s7">Litecoin (LTC) Now Supported By Nabox</p>
<p>In recent news, the Nabox wallet has added support for Litecoin (LTC). With this development, the adoption of Litecoin (LTC) continues growing steadily - but its value leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has a value of $91.14, which is a drop of 4.68% overnight. Moreover, the technical analysis for Litecoin (LTC) shows that bears still have it in their palm, with its moving averages and technical indicators showing sell signals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With all of these charts in mind, experts predict that Litecoin (LTC) may continue this downtrend as it falls to its support level of $90 soon. </p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) To Become A Future Market Leader </p>
<p>Are you looking to invest in rare and precious metals such as platinum, silver, and gold? Sparklo, an upcoming decentralized alternative-investment platform, may be the perfect one for you as it brings advantages its rivals lack. </p>
<p>On this Ethereum-based platform, users may purchase or trade fractionalized NFTs backed by real-world exquisite silver, gold, or platinum bars! Not only that, if you buy a full NFT, you may also receive the asset underpinning it delivered to an address of your choice! </p>
<p>Since Sparklo is currently in Level One of its public presale, the token value is very affordable - only $0.015. We believe this is an excellent opportunity to purchase a potential blue-chip token for a meager price since some analysts have even hinted it could rise to $0.50 by October 2023!</p>
<p>Sparklo has also focused on security, with an audit by InterFi Network already complete and a KYC audit in its final stages. Moreover, liquidity will be locked for 100 years while team tokens for 1,000 days - eliminating any rug-pulls! </p>
<p>Sign up for the presale now to become an early investor in this project expected to boom by 3,200% soon!</p>
