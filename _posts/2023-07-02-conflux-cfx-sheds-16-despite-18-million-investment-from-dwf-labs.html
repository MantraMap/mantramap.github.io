As inferred earlier, the Conflux ecosystem has been experiencing steady growth since the turn of the year. Recently, the blockchain disclosed a partnership with dappOS, which promises mutual benefits for both entities. Conflux So Far In 2023 &#8211; Price Overview The price of CFX has been on an upward trajectory for most of the year, recording an 825% increase in the past six months. This price rally is consistent with the expansion and increased adoption of the Conflux ecosystem. During the peak of this rally, Conflux announced several strategic partnerships with some of China’s biggest companies. Notably, the tree-graph consensus algorithm Layer-1 network announced a partnership with China Telecom to develop a blockchain SIM (BSIM) card in February. However, we’ve watched the token’s price trend downward from its height earlier in the year. Since reaching its yearly peak of $0.4613 on March 20, the CFX token has lost more than 55% of its value, trading as low as $0.176 in mid-June. As of this writing, CFX changes hands at $0.204467, according to CoinGecko data. This represents a 1% increase in the last 24 hours. That said, the token&#8217;s price has declined in recent weeks, shedding more than 28% in the past month.
