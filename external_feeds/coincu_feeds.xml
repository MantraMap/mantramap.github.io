<p>According to the 2023 H1 trading platform data report, Binance&#8217;s public reserve stock stands at an impressive $57 billion, putting it at the top of the list of all encrypted trading platforms. The report reveals that Bitcoin and stable coins make up the majority of Binance&#8217;s reserve assets, which is not surprising given the popularity and stability of these digital assets.</p>



<p>Despite the market panic that occurred in the past 3 months, which led to the outflow of funds from Binance, the exchange has been able to maintain its position as the market leader. The report states that Binance ranks first in terms of transaction volume and market share in the first half of 2023, demonstrating the exchange&#8217;s strength and resilience in the face of market volatility.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that <a href="https://coincu.com/201695-binance-will-terminate-xrp-leveraged-tokens/">Binance</a> has been able to maintain a healthy amount of proof-of-reserve assets and has safely stored a diversified currency, despite the large outflow of funds from the exchange in the second quarter of 2023. This is a positive sign and indicates that Binance has robust asset management practices, which will help it to continue to grow and succeed in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Overall, the report highlights the exchange strong position in the cryptocurrency market and its ability to navigate market volatility while maintaining its reserve assets and storing a diversified range of coins safely. These factors bode well for the future success of the exchange and position Binance as a leading player in the global cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent statement released on July 11, blockchain intelligence company Arkham Intel addressed mounting criticisms and accusations regarding its alleged ties to US government agencies.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-675.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-675-1024x538.png" alt="Arkham Responds To Accusations Of Government Affiliation, User Privacy Concerns" class="wp-image-201776" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-675-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-675-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-675-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-675-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-675-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Arkham Responds To Accusations Of Government Affiliation, User Privacy Concerns 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>The company has been facing intense backlash following the launch of its <a href="https://coincu.com/201309-arkham-intel-on-chain-intelligence-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intel Exchange</a>, an on-chain intelligence exchange that enables users to trade information related to crypto wallets through smart contracts.</p>



<p>Upon the announcement of Intel Exchange, the platform <a href="https://coincu.com/201465-arkham-referral-links-can-leak-user-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faced</a> swift condemnation from the crypto community, with many dubbing it a &#8220;snitching-as-a-service&#8221; program. Concerns were raised regarding the potential misuse of user data and privacy implications associated with such an offering. In addition, skeptics speculated that Arkham Intel might have undisclosed connections to prominent US government entities like the CIA or FBI.</p>

<p>Seeking to clarify its position, Arkham Intel vehemently denied any association with government agencies in its Tuesday post. The company firmly <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1678761742082662401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it is not a covert government project and emphasized that it operates independently as a crypto-native team committed to the well-being of both its community and the broader industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In addition to legitimate discussion, which we welcome, there’s been a lot of inaccurate reporting, doctored images, and other misinformation circulating about our project ahead of the public launch. We’re sharing an FAQ here to answer the most common questions.<br><br>Our founder and… <a href="https://t.co/BHx4yUvTl9" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/BHx4yUvTl9</a></p>&mdash; Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1678761742082662401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 11, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Moreover, Arkham Intel countered claims made on Monday, suggesting that it had been leaking and selling confidential customer data. These allegations arose in response to the introduction of the platform&#8217;s weblink referral program. Users utilizing Arkham&#8217;s wallet tracking dashboard were able to invite others to join the platform by sharing unique referral URLs. Initially appearing as seemingly random characters, closer inspection revealed that these URLs contained Base64-encoded versions of users&#8217; email addresses.</p>



<p>Arkham Intel refuted the notion that private information was being compromised or sold, categorically denying any intentional leakage or unauthorized use of customer data. The company clarified that the characters at the end of the referral URLs hold no meaningful information and cannot be used to expose users&#8217; personal details.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/201349-arkham-airdrop-on-july-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, simultaneously with the launch of Intel Exchange, Arkham Intel also announced the initiation of its native token, ARKM, through Binance Launchpad. The company scheduled an initial coin offering (ICO) for ARKM from July 11 to July 18. Priced at $0.05 per token, Arkham Intel aimed to raise $2,500,000 through the ICO. According to data provided by ICO Drops, a total of 1,000,000,000 ARKM tokens were offered for sale during this period.</p>



<p>The company also <a href="https://coincu.com/201349-arkham-airdrop-on-july-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on July 8 that the ARKM airdrop had been snapshotted, and Sybil attackers and other users trying to manipulate the system had been identified as ineligible for the airdrop.</p>



<p>As of now, Arkham Intel&#8217;s response has shed light on its disassociation from government agencies and addressed concerns regarding user privacy. Nevertheless, the company continues to navigate the repercussions of the backlash and strives to regain the trust and confidence of its users and the wider crypto community.</p>

<p>The Shiba Inu development team worked on many different plans over the entire year of 2022, including the release of the game Shiba Eternity and the construction of the metaverse. The team will carry on with the layer-2 Shibarium solution introduction until the year 2023. The launch of Shibarium has been delayed as a result of several challenges; however, the popularity of the product has not diminished.</p>



<p>Shibarium Puppynet Testnet was successfully established on March 11 of this year. Since then, Puppynet has had a tremendous amount of expansion. Puppynet has accomplished a great feat by surpassing 25 million transactions as of June 28. This is a noteworthy accomplishment for the network.

<p>Since its inception on March 11, the Puppynet testnet for <a href="https://coincu.com/200955-shibarium-plans-to-launch-mainnet-on-august/">Shibarium </a>has exhibited impressive transaction processing, and it has now handled a total of 28,445,126 transactions so far. In addition, Puppynet produced 1,634,449 blocks with an average block duration of 6.2 seconds, demonstrating a satisfactory level of performance. In addition, the number of wallet addresses has reportedly reached 17,061,397, which indicates that SHIB&#8217;s user base is expanding, as indicated by the data provided by Puppyscan.</p>



<p>The SHIB community has taken notice of these accomplishments on the testnet, and many members of the community have expressed that they cannot contain their excitement for the introduction of the mainnet.</p>



<p>Because the use of Shibarium has the potential to greatly boost the SHIBs&#8217; burning rate, a number of industry observers predict that it will become &#8220;an important milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Deputy Governor of the RBI provided an update on the usage of CBDC as of June, revealing that 1.3 million customers and 300,000 merchants had already started using it. This is a huge milestone for the Indian payment industry and signifies the potential for a cashless digital economy.</p>



<p>The RBI&#8217;s plan to introduce CBDC as a digital currency as well as a payment tool is a move that is likely to make it more attractive to users. The RBI&#8217;s strategy for inducing customers to use this currency is still being developed, and this is an essential aspect of the digital currency&#8217;s success. The RBI is studying technical alternatives to CBDC to ensure that it is inclusive and efficient, providing a seamless experience for users.</p>

<p>One of the greatest advantages of CBDC is that it will come from cross-border transactions. CBDC will provide a faster, cheaper, and more secure means of payments, making it more attractive to businesses that engage in international trade and remittances. The RBI is working towards integrating CBDC into the global payment system to facilitate international trade and remittances.</p>



<p>It is important to note that cryptocurrencies are neither currencies nor assets, and the <a href="https://coincu.com/95210-cbdcs-will-kill-cryptocurrencies/">RBI</a> has made this clear. Cryptocurrencies lack the essential qualities of a currency, such as stability and legal tender status. Additionally, they do not generate any cash flows like assets. The RBI&#8217;s focus on developing a CBDC is a clear indication that they are committed to providing a secure and efficient payment system for the Indian economy.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the RBI&#8217;s development of a CBDC is a significant milestone for the Indian payment industry. With over 1.3 million customers and 300,000 merchants already using it, the potential for a cashless digital economy is becoming more of a reality. The RBI&#8217;s plan to introduce CBDC as a digital currency as well as a payment tool is a move that is likely to make it more attractive to users. With the RBI&#8217;s focus on developing a secure and efficient payment system, the future of the Indian economy looks bright.</p>

<p>Joe Lubin, the founder and CEO of Consensys, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Ethereum layer 2 networks are set to play a crucial role in making great advances in scalability and usability. Linea’s zkEVM is the catalyst we’ve been waiting for to empower developers to shape the future of decentralized applications and encourage the builder in everyone.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Linea is a Layer 2 chain that is interoperable with Ethereum applications and uses ZK-Rollups for scalability.</p>



<p>Its launch follows a successful testnet period in which Linea got tremendous user interest, becoming one of the biggest active projects on the Goerli testnet. 5.2 million distinct wallets participated during this period, completing almost 41 million transactions in only three months, but many of them may be considered airdrop farmers.</p>

<p>The alpha mainnet stage of Linea delivers a better user experience as well as an ecosystem of over 100 protocols, partners, and decentralized apps. The network will be used by the Consensys-owned self-custody web3 wallet MetaMask, as well as additional developer tools such as Infura, Diligence, and Hyperledger Besu.</p>



<p>Linea will first be available to the project&#8217;s testnet partners. It will thereafter be available to the public during the EthCC conference, which takes place from July 17 to July 20. Consensys announced the Linea Ecosystem Investment Alliance (EIA) at the launch of Mainnet Alpha, an effort sponsored by over 30 prominent venture capital companies that intend to empower builders by offering financing and resources.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/temasek-says-its-not-looking-to-invest-in-crypto-firms-right-now.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/temasek-says-its-not-looking-to-invest-in-crypto-firms-right-now.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a>, Singapore&#8217;s Temasek Holdings is cautious about investing in crypto companies due to regulatory uncertainty.

<p>Singapore&#8217;s Temasek Holdings, one of the world&#8217;s largest sovereign wealth funds, is cautious about investing in cryptocurrency companies, citing regulatory uncertainty in the industry. Temasek&#8217;s Chief Investment Officer, Rohit Sipahimalani, recently stated in a CNBC interview that the fund is not currently looking to invest in cryptocurrency exchanges or other companies operating in the sector due to the challenges posed by the regulatory landscape.</p>



<p>The uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulation has been a major issue for the industry in recent years, with different countries and regulatory bodies taking different approaches to the issue. In the United States, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged several large cryptocurrency exchanges with securities violations, alleging that they have violated local laws by selling tokens or operating as unregistered securities exchanges. This regulatory uncertainty has made it difficult for many investors to feel comfortable investing in cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, Sipahimalani indicated that Temasek remains open to cryptocurrency investment opportunities, provided that the right regulatory framework and investment align with the fund&#8217;s overall strategy and risk tolerance. The fund&#8217;s recent investment in FTX, an exchange that allows the fund to earn fee-based revenue without taking on trading risks, is an example of its cautious approach to cryptocurrency investment.</p>



<p>In addition to regulatory challenges, Temasek has faced macroeconomic and geopolitical difficulties, impacting its returns. However, the fund remains committed to investing in new and innovative projects, including those related to cryptocurrency, as long as they align with its overall investment goals.</p>

<p>Additionally, BIFI has been ported from Anyswap through the Bridge Fantom, while USDC, USDT, DAI, and WBTC have been transferred through the Multichain: Moonriver Bridge.

<p>In an interesting twist, certain assets, such as WBTC, USDT, and ETH, were moved from the address marked as Fake_Phishing183873 by Etherscan. However, it is believed that this labeling may be inaccurate, and the address could have previously belonged to the official Multichain account.</p>



<p>The significant outflow of funds from <a href="https://multichain.xyz/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://multichain.xyz/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multichain</a> raises questions about the motives behind these transactions. The involvement of frozen funds and burned tokens adds another layer of complexity to the situation. The community and stakeholders will undoubtedly closely monitor these developments and investigate the origins and implications of these outflows.</p>

<p>Poloniex Customer Support hinted at network maintenance on the same day of the event. The maintenance began at 7:00 a.m. UTC and lasted around two hours, during which the site was offline and trading was suspended. The markets were later reopened for trading, but it is unclear if the maintenance had any bearing on the sudden plunge of the XRP/USDT pair on Poloniex.</p>



<p>This is not the first time <a href="https://ripple.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ripple.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP</a> has experienced such an event. In April, the XRP/USDT perpetual trading pair flash crashed to zero on the Bitrue crypto exchange. While these events may be isolated incidents, they raise questions about the overall stability of the crypto market and the exchanges that facilitate trading.</p>



<p>What caused the Poloniex incident, and whether the exchange will take any measures to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. As crypto trading continues to gain popularity and more investors enter the market, it is crucial that exchanges uphold the highest standards of reliability and security.</p>

<p>Algofi, the largest DeFi protocol in the Algorand ecosystem, announced that it would be shutting down. The platform will go into &#8220;withdrawal-only mode&#8221; and close all of its social media accounts except for its Discord. Algofi raised $2.8 million in 2021, with participation from Coinbase, Y Combinator, Jump Crypto, and others. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1) Hey Everyone, <br><br>We have some unfortunate news to share regarding the Algofi protocol.<br><br>After a lot of reflection, the team has recently come to the unfortunate decision to begin winding down the protocol.</p>&mdash; Algofi (@algofiorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/algofiorg/status/1678536751969718272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The team has recently made the decision to begin winding down the protocol due to the inability to provide the necessary support to maintain the protocol at the high standards which they believe the community deserves. The team will begin sunsetting the platform and put the platform in withdrawal-only mode shortly. </p>



<p>The primary objective in the future is to ensure that these steps are carried out safely, clearly communicated, and timely. The Algofi team encourages anyone with questions about the plan to reach out to the community Discord, where they will be active. They will sunset other social media platforms to ensure seamless, unified communication.</p>



<p>The Algofi platform was <a href="https://blog.algofi.org/algofi-community-update-3cc989962d57" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed </a>to improve existing decentralized finance infrastructure using Algorand’s strong technology stack to build fast, scalable, and affordable products. The team achieved this goal by building alongside the community, who provided invaluable feedback. A confluence of events has no longer made building and maintaining the Algofi platform to the highest standards a viable path for the company. Due to this, the team has decided to begin sunsetting the platform.</p>

<p>In addition to Algofi&#8217;s shutdown, V1 and V2 Lending will be reducing collateral factors of the ALGO, vALGO, STBL, USDC, goBTC, and goETH markets over several months to ensure liquidity migrates off. Governance Protocol&#8217;s current Liquidity Mining programs will be halted, and no future proposals will be enacted. Further announcements on handling the voting escrow/locking mechanism are forthcoming.</p>
