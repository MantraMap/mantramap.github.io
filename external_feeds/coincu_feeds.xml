<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Mantle Governance considers proposals for Mantle Economics Committee to manage LSD and ETH Staking proposals.</em></li>



<li><em>MEC would make conservative allocation decisions for the treasury assets and operate independently from asset custody.</em></li>



<li><em>The committee would evaluate strategies, negotiate terms, and prioritize risk management, strengthening governance within the ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mantle Governance, an entity responsible for overseeing treasury management within the <a href="https://coincu.com/164751-mantle-network-layer-2-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mantle</a> ecosystem, is <a href="https://forum.mantle.xyz/t/discussion-mantle-economics-committee-and-eth-staking-strategies/7548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">engaging</a> in significant discussions regarding the management of LSD and ETH Staking proposals.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-1024x535.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="535" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-1024x535.png" alt="Layer 2 Mantle Plans To Invest 200,000 ETH In LPs To Grow Profit Realized" class="wp-image-201868" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-1024x535.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-768x401.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-750x392.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702-1140x596.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-702.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Layer 2 Mantle Plans To Invest 200,000 ETH In LPs To Grow Profit Realized 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>In an effort to streamline decision-making processes and address time-sensitive matters, a proposal has been put forth to establish a specialized sub-governance body known as the Mantle Economics Committee (MEC). This committee would operate under the guidance of the governance, focusing on minor details and making conservative allocation decisions for Mantle Treasury assets.</p>



<p>The primary objective of the proposed MEC would be to assess and determine the allocation of treasury assets in a risk-averse manner. This committee would serve as a dedicated decision-making body, separate from asset custody responsibilities. By creating this specialized committee, proponents aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making processes, facilitate commercial negotiations, and uphold checks and balances among existing entities.</p>



<p>The proposal encompasses several key aspects that will be voted upon by the community. Furthermore, it seeks to authorize the Mantle LSD and <a href="https://coincu.com/197517-lido-proposes-a-40k-eth-from-mantle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido ETH</a> staking strategies, allowing a combined allowance of up to 200,000 ETH. The committee would be empowered to engage in commercial negotiations, determine the timing and scale of strategy entries and exits, and prioritize risk management and principal protection.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-703.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="563" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-703-1024x563.png" alt="Layer 2 Mantle Plans To Invest 200,000 ETH In LPs To Grow Profit Realized" class="wp-image-201869" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-703-1024x563.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-703-300x165.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-703-768x422.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-703-1536x845.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-703-2048x1126.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-703-750x413.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-703-1140x627.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Layer 2 Mantle Plans To Invest 200,000 ETH In LPs To Grow Profit Realized 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>The MEC would hold several responsibilities, including periodic review of strategies, making recommendations for modifications to approved strategies and allowances, and making decisions on strategy entries and exits within the approved limits. The committee will evaluate strategies based on factors such as Mantle product synergy, technical risks, commercial risks, and economic risks, with a preference for battle-tested on-chain applications.</p>



<p>Additionally, the committee would negotiate commercial terms for strategies, emphasizing principal protection mechanisms, lower fees, and flexible commitment durations. Risk management and the protection of the treasury assets would remain paramount in all committee actions and decisions.</p>



<p>The approved strategies and allowances, as outlined in the proposal, would focus on ETH Staking and LSD. Specific positions include Lido stETH and/or wstETH, Mantle LSD mntETH, direct staking with Tier-1 node operators for Mantle LSD during the ramp-up phase, and the construction of (w)stETH-ETH and mntETH-ETH LP pairs on Ethereum L1 and Mantle L2 DEXes.</p>



<p>To ensure sound internal governance, the proposed Economics Committee would adopt a highly conservative approach to risk management. Its membership, internal governance rules, and authorized strategies and allowances could be modified at any time by the governance.</p>



<p>The proposal highlights the community&#8217;s ongoing commitment to robust governance and risk management within the ecosystem. By establishing the MEC, stakeholders aim to foster informed decision-making, ensure responsible allocation of treasury assets, and further strengthen the foundations of the network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Russia has passed a law introducing a digital ruble.</em></li>



<li><em>Once approved by President Vladimir Putin, the law will come into force in less than a month, on August 1, 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>If passed, it would be the largest country to adopt a central bank digital currency (CBDC) officially.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1645423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopted </a>in the second and third readings a law that creates the basis for the introduction of the digital ruble and the implementation of non-cash payments using the digital ruble.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-699.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-699.png" alt="Russia Became The Largest Country To Adopt CBDC After Effective August 1" class="wp-image-201861" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-699.png 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-699-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Russia Became The Largest Country To Adopt CBDC After Effective August 1 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The law defines the terms &#8220;digital ruble platform,&#8221; &#8220;digital ruble platform rules&#8221;, &#8220;digital ruble platform participant&#8221;, &#8220;digital ruble platform user&#8221;, and &#8220;digital account wallet.&#8221;</p>



<p>The law sets out requirements for the operation of the digital ruble platform, the procedure for opening, maintaining, and closing a digital account, and access to the digital ruble platform.</p>



<p>Features of digital ruble account agreements, and digital ruble transfers are also clearly regulated. According to the document, attracting digital rubles in contributions (deposits) is impossible. Non-residents have access to the digital ruble platform through the digital ruble platform participants who are authorized banks or foreign banks who are the coin platform participants&#8217; digital rubles.</p>



<p>By law, the<a href="https://coincu.com/191810-russian-bank-launches-cryptocurrency-cross/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bank of Russia </a>will be the operator of the digital ruble platform. The law will go into effect on August 1, 2023, and is currently awaiting the approval of President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>If Putin signs the law, it will officially make Russia the largest country to adopt a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>



<p>Driven by technological advancements and the growth of contactless payments, Central Bank Digital Currencies &#8211; CBDCs &#8211; a form of the official cryptocurrency of a country &#8211; promise to become the next factor in changing the landscape of the banking and payment industry worldwide. Now 93% of central banks have expressed interest in exploring CBDCs of some kind, according to a 2022 survey by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>



<p>Eighty-six banks responded to that survey, but 130 countries have launched, are exploring, or have canceled CBDC programs as of June, according to the Atlantic Council&#8217;s CBDC tracker.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Aptos network to vote on upgrade for fungible asset standards and improved functionality.</em></li>



<li><em>The upgrade aims to support tokenized real estate and other asset classes on the blockchain.</em></li>



<li><em>Backend improvements and a reduction in staking rewards are included in the proposed upgrade.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Aptos network, a promising Layer 1 blockchain facilitating decentralized infrastructure for internet-based economies, is set to undergo a crucial vote on a significant upgrade. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="560" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-1024x560.png" alt="Aptos Considering New Upgrade With Staking Rewards Will Fall 1.5% Annually" class="wp-image-201847" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-1024x560.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-300x164.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-768x420.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-750x410.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697-1140x624.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-697.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aptos Considering New Upgrade With Staking Rewards Will Fall 1.5% Annually 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://governance.aptosfoundation.org/proposal/26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposed upgrade</a>, known as v1.5, encompasses a series of new features and enhancements that will shape the future of the <a href="https://coincu.com/183135-aptos-launches-new-delegated-staking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aptos</a> blockchain and its capabilities.</p>



<p>One key aspect of the upgrade, outlined in <a href="https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-21.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIP-21</a> (Aptos Improvement Proposal), focuses on the creation of new standards for fungible assets. This development is deemed essential for handling on-chain asset classes such as tokenized real estate and tokenized securities. While Aptos already supported on-chain token issuance, the existing standards were insufficient to accommodate innovative features like ownership restrictions. </p>



<p>AIP-21 aims to establish a standard for Fungible Assets (FA) using Move Objects. This framework allows any on-chain asset represented as an object to be expressed as a fungible asset, enabling the representation of a single object through multiple distinct yet interchangeable units of ownership.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-1024x457.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="457" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-1024x457.png" alt="Aptos Considering New Upgrade With Staking Rewards Will Fall 1.5% Annually" class="wp-image-201848" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-1024x457.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-300x134.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-768x343.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-1536x685.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-750x335.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698-1140x508.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-698.png 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aptos Considering New Upgrade With Staking Rewards Will Fall 1.5% Annually 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The upgrade encompasses other advancements as well, targeting backend services to enhance node behavior tracking, enable node restoration from cloud backups, and filter out duplicate transactions from blocks. Furthermore, a developer-focused proposal within the upgrade aims to facilitate the development of cryptographic applications using Move, the coding language specific to the Aptos blockchain.</p>



<p>As part of the upgrade, there will be a reduction in staking rewards, decreasing by 1.5% annually. This adjustment will slightly limit the payouts to token stakers who contribute their assets to ensure the network&#8217;s security.</p>



<p>The vote on the v1.5 upgrade represents a crucial moment for the Aptos network, signifying its commitment to evolving and meeting the demands of the burgeoning decentralized ecosystem. By introducing robust standards for fungible assets and implementing various functional improvements, Aptos aims to foster the seamless integration of tokenized real estate, securities, and other asset classes within its blockchain infrastructure.</p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange has officially launched its customer claims portal. According to the website information, individual customers can access their account information and then submit an application to be included in the crypto exchange&#8217;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The site will be open to customers with accounts at FTX.com, FTX US, Blockfolio, FTX EU, FTX JP and Liquid.</p>

<p>A screenshot of the website shows that the person who wants to claim assets on FTX must provide evidence to prove that they own money on the exchange, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Account holder identification information and identity verification;</li>



<li>Information about transaction history;</li>



<li>Verify account balance by submitting proof to FTX takeover &#8211; with balance as of 09:00 PM on 11/11/2022 (when this exchange announced bankruptcy).</li>
</ul>



<p>According to information from users, the website seems to be limited in the geographical area that can be accessed or is overloaded, so there is an access error condition.</p>



<p>Previously, the exchange had planned to <a href="https://coincu.com/199738-ftx-announces-to-launch-customer-claims-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open</a> a website for users to provide information proving their possession of money on the exchange, with the intention of launching on July 3 and 4. However, the exchange suddenly reversed the above decision and did not provide a specific time anymore.</p>



<p>Faced with the news that the portal requires the asset to be opened, the FTT native token once skyrocketed from $1.43 to $1.79 and is now at $1.60, up 15% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>The exchange also issued a warning to users about fraudulent links and noted that the deadline for customers to file complaints has been set at 4 p.m. ET on September 29, 2023. No preference is given based on when the request was submitted and the request must be submitted by the deadline.</p>

<p>Last month, a US court said this exchange&#8217;s customers had until September 29 to file lawsuits. The deadline for calculating a customer&#8217;s account balance is November 11, 2022.</p>



<p>In the past time, there have been many signals showing that FTX is about to reopen the trading platform under a new name, just waiting for a unit to take charge of this activity. FTX Japan, which is an almost stable branch during the bankruptcy process of the head office, has also <a href="https://coincu.com/200607-ftx-postponing-sale-ftx-japan-reboot-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stopped selling</a> plans to try to reopen.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Tim Draper stands by his $250,000 BTC price prediction, possibly by 2025.</em></li>



<li><em>Recent SEC actions driving entrepreneurs away from the U.S. are seen as a factor impacting BTC&#8217;s price.</em></li>



<li><em>Draper emphasizes BTC&#8217;s value as a future mainstream currency with transparent blockchain operations.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Renowned investor Tim Draper remains resolute in his belief that Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually reach $250,000, albeit with a revised timeline.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-1024x614.png" alt="Tim Draper Still Very Optimistic On Bitcoin With $250,000 Price Target" class="wp-image-201832" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-1024x614.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-750x450.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691-1140x684.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-691.png 1340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Tim Draper Still Very Optimistic On Bitcoin With $250,000 Price Target 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>Although Draper&#8217;s <a href="https://coincu.com/149257-tim-draper-predicts-bitcoin-reach-250000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous prediction</a> for June 2023 did not materialize, the billionaire venture capitalist asserts that BTC&#8217;s ascent to the target price might take a bit longer, potentially happening by 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-07-11/bitcoin-is-here-to-stay-tim-draper-says-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg TV</a>, Draper reaffirmed his optimistic outlook, emphasizing that BTC is here to stay despite recent regulatory actions against crypto companies by the <a href="https://coincu.com/201434-paradigm-sec-exceeds-statutory-jurisdiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>. According to Draper, these enforcement measures have forced entrepreneurs out of the United States, resulting in a negative impact on BTC&#8217;s price.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“I wasn’t really expecting for the U.S. bureaucracy to be this aggressive and I thought that maybe they would be recognizing that they got to compete with the rest of the world. They&#8217;ve got to provide a platform from which entrepreneurs can flourish, and by having this regulation by enforcement that the SEC has been professing and driving, it&#8217;s really driving all the great entrepreneurs out, and I think that that has hurt the Bitcoin price,” he admitted.</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693.png" alt="Tim Draper Still Very Optimistic On Bitcoin With $250,000 Price Target" class="wp-image-201834" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-693-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Tim Draper Still Very Optimistic On Bitcoin With $250,000 Price Target 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>While Draper expressed surprise at the aggressive stance of U.S. bureaucracy, he believes in the long-term value of <a href="https://coincu.com/201568-bitcoin-price-plummets-below-31k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> and its underlying technology. He envisions a future where BTC becomes a mainstream currency, facilitating business operations, employee payments, supplier transactions, and even tax payments, all conducted on the blockchain. Draper highlights the benefits of a decentralized and transparent system, eliminating the need for traditional accounting and auditing practices.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;It&#8217;s a great system, it&#8217;s great currency, it&#8217;s a great way to operate. I can&#8217;t wait until I can raise a fund all in Bitcoin, invest it all in Bitcoin, have my portfolio companies all pay their employees and suppliers all in Bitcoin and have taxes all paid in Bitcoin, and have the waterfall all fall into people&#8217;s Bitcoin wallets. Because then there&#8217;s no accounting, there&#8217;s no auditing, there&#8217;s no bookkeeping, it&#8217;s all done on the blockchain. It&#8217;s all honest and it&#8217;s all straight,&#8221; Draper said.</p>

<p>Draper&#8217;s early recognition of the significance of Bitcoin dates back to 2013 when he purchased 30,000 BTC following the infamous collapse of the Mt. Gox crypto exchange. Despite the market challenges faced during the recent crypto winter, Draper remained steadfast, urging industry participants to persevere and continue working towards the realization of blockchain&#8217;s potential.</p>



<p>While the specific timeline may have shifted, Draper&#8217;s conviction in BTC&#8217;s future resilience and ability to reach new price heights remains steadfast. With a target of $250,000 by 2025, Draper stands as one of the prominent voices advocating for the continued growth and adoption of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The exchange emphasizes its commitment to the security and integrity of customer assets while dispelling any misinformation or fear which has been circulating in the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We take the security and integrity of all customer assets seriously and want to address some recent FUD regarding <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BCH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$BCH</a>. <a href="https://t.co/gM6e3xb9BX" target="_blank">https://t.co/gM6e3xb9BX</a> maintains 1:1 reserves, which means for every BCH you hold on our platform, we maintain a BCH in reserve.<br><br>The temporary pause we…</p>&mdash; Binance.US Customer Support (@BinanceUShelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceUShelp/status/1678853356989587457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 11, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In an official statement released today, Binance.US reassured its users that the platform maintains a 1:1 reserve for BCH holdings. This means that for every BCH held by customers on the exchange, an equivalent amount is kept in reserve by Binance.US.</p>



<p>The recent temporary pause in BCH withdrawals was attributed to a technical issue within the deposit sweeping system. Under normal circumstances, the system automatically transfers funds from customers&#8217; individual deposit wallets to the exchange&#8217;s hot wallets and eventually to the secure cold wallets. However, leading up to the past weekend, these automated sweeps were not occurring for BCH deposit addresses, unlike any other token.</p>



<p>To rectify the situation, Binance.US promptly suspended <a href="https://coincu.com/199044-bitcoin-cash-bch-price-skyrockets-to-325-driven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BCH</a> withdrawals until the technical fix was implemented and the deposit, hot wallet, and cold wallet processes resumed their normal flow. The exchange expresses gratitude to its technical team for working diligently over the weekend to address the issue, resulting in full restoration of BCH withdrawals on all networks since late Sunday night.</p>

<p>Cinneamhain Ventures CEO Adam Cochran <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1678523611559149569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began</a> it all by accusing Binance of being a &#8220;Ponzi&#8221; scheme with an evident hole across multiple assets. When compared to the largest exchange, Cochran claimed that although all assets have not yet vanished, users do not entitle to pay for CEO <a href="https://coincu.com/186874-binance-us-sell-changpeng-zhaos-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a>&#8216;s mistakes.</p>



<p>According to a screenshot Cochran shared on June 29, the exchange announced BCH/TUSD and CFX/TUSD trading pairings with no fees. He continued to provide updates. Binance&#8217;s motive for the upgrade is Binance&#8217;s motivation for the unbacked publishing of BCH while providing the idea that Sun&#8217;s unbacked shell business currency is supporting that volume.</p>

<p>The recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notification that the Bitcoin ETF applications were insufficiently robust or thorough thrust US-based crypto exchange into the spotlight.</p>



<p>Cboe, a US options exchange, filed revisions to five proposed spot bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday, stating that it had reached an agreement on conditions with <a href="https://coincu.com/199820-nasdaq-named-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> to join into surveillance sharing arrangements.</p>



<p>According to the latest filing, Cboe and Coinbase struck an agreement on June 21, 2023, based on which the two parties would complete and sign an agreement. Previously, <a href="https://coincu.com/199918-blackrock-chooses-coinbase-surveillance-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blackrock</a>, the world&#8217;s biggest wealth manager, and the exchange established a surveillance sharing agreement (SSA). Several firms, including <a href="https://coincu.com/199344-coinbase-support-valkyrie-bitwise-btc-spot-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valkyrie</a>, Bitwise, Invesco, and WisdomTree, have also filed for Bitcoin ETF clearance.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;On June 21, 2023, the Exchange reached an agreement on terms with Coinbase, Inc., an operator of a United States-based spot trading platform for Bitcoin that represents a substantial portion of US-based spot trading platform for Bitcoin that represents a substantial portion of US-based and USD denominated Bitcoin trading, to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement (“Spot BTC SSA”) and executed an associated term sheet,&#8221; according to the filing.</p>

<p>As a result, the Coinbase stock price increased sharply on Tuesday, despite the fact that the broader financial markets remained essentially flat ahead of the consumer price index (CPI) report. The company&#8217;s shares jumped 14.5% after it was revealed that trading giant Cboe would depend on the crypto exchange to monitor market manipulation for proposed exchange-traded funds to be listed on its platform.</p>

<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Senior security engineer arrested for $9 million cryptocurrency fraud on a decentralized exchange, according to the DOJ.</em></li>



<li><em>Exploited smart contract vulnerability to obtain inflated fees and user funds.</em></li>



<li><em>Law enforcement tracks and recovers stolen cryptocurrency, showcasing commitment to combating fraud.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A former security engineer was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-security-engineer-international-technology-company-arrested-defrauding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detained</a> on Tuesday morning in connection with the first criminal case involving an assault on a smart contract maintained by a decentralized exchange, according to DOJ.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-681.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="659" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-681.png" alt="DOJ Arrests Senior Security Engineer For Stealing Over $9 Million In Crypto" class="wp-image-201802" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-681.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-681-300x198.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-681-768x506.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-681-750x494.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="DOJ Arrests Senior Security Engineer For Stealing Over $9 Million In Crypto 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>Shakeeb Ahmed, 34, was charged with wire fraud and money laundering after the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York said he cheated an undisclosed decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, taking around $9 million in cryptocurrency.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;In July 2022, Ahmed carried out an attack on the Crypto Exchange by exploiting a vulnerability in one of the Crypto Exchange’s smart contracts and inserting fake pricing data to fraudulently cause that smart contract to generate approximately $9 million dollars’ worth of inflated fees that Ahmed did not legitimately earn, which fees Ahmed was able to withdraw from the Crypto Exchange in the form of cryptocurrency,&#8221; according to a DOJ press release.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the DOJ, the disputed DEX runs on the <a href="https://coincu.com/200894-solana-has-managed-to-regain-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana</a> blockchain. Ahmed reportedly took out tens of millions of dollars in flash loans, put them in the DEX&#8217;s liquidity pool, withdrew the cash, and claimed a big percentage as fees. According to a copy of the indictment, he took out at least twenty-one flash loans.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="612" height="408" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-683.png" alt="DOJ Arrests Senior Security Engineer For Stealing Over $9 Million In Crypto" class="wp-image-201804" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-683.png 612w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-683-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" title="DOJ Arrests Senior Security Engineer For Stealing Over $9 Million In Crypto 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to the indictment, after stealing the cash, Ahmed spoke with the Crypto Exchange, proposing to restore all of the stolen assets, except $1.5 million, in exchange for the attack not being disclosed to law authorities. Yet, the inquiry continued, eventually resulting in Ahmed&#8217;s imprisonment.</p>



<p>Although the DOJ did not specifically identify the DEX, the description fits the theft from <a href="https://coincu.com/106416-hacker-crema-finance-returns-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crema Finance</a>, a Solana-based Exchange, last year. In July, the attacker stole more than $9 million from the DEX, returning around $8 million while keeping about $1.7 million.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-682.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="480" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-682.png" alt="DOJ Arrests Senior Security Engineer For Stealing Over $9 Million In Crypto" class="wp-image-201803" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-682.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-682-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-682-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-682-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-682-750x375.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="DOJ Arrests Senior Security Engineer For Stealing Over $9 Million In Crypto 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>United States Attorney Damian Williams underlined the necessity of uncovering fraudulent actions inside the crypto and digital asset ecosystem. Williams declared:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;This is the second case we are announcing this week to shed light on fraud in the cryptocurrency and digital asset ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Williams emphasized Ahmed&#8217;s position as a security engineer, revealing that Ahmed&#8217;s skill was critical in carrying out the assault, utilizing his understanding of reverse engineering smart contracts and blockchain audits.</p>



<p>The DOJ said Ahmed then attempted to launder the assets by converting them into multiple cryptocurrencies, transferring them across blockchains, changing into Monero (XMR), and sending them via several crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>As the case progresses, this big step serves as a sharp reminder of the continuous efforts to prevent crypto fraud. The trial&#8217;s verdict will very certainly have ramifications for future investigations involving decentralized system assaults and the unlawful usage of crypto.</p>

<p>Author: lesley@footprint.network</p>



<p>In June, the crypto markets experienced a notable upswing, with Bitcoin, in particular, surging to a 12-month high of $31.2k. However, the NFT market did not share the same momentum, as data indicates a relative stagnation in user activity and funding. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, there is an underlying stream of evolution within the NFT space. NFTs are beginning to shed their image as mere digital collectibles. A growing number of brands and industries are experimenting with NFTs, such as Louis Vuitton, leading to a diversification of their applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NFT space hasn&#8217;t been without its share of controversy. Azuki, known for its anime-style NFTs, launched its new series, Azuki Elementals, to a rocky reception. The community criticized the lack of originality and innovation in the new series, and this incident highlighted the importance of value creation and community engagement in the success of NFT projects.</p>



<p>Data of this report was obtained from Footprint&#8217;s NFT research page. An easy-to-use dashboard containing the most vital stats and metrics to understand the NFT industry, updated in real-time, you can find all the latest about trades, projects, fundings, and more by clicking <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>On June 5, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) increased its scrutiny of leading cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. As a result of these regulatory actions, bitcoin experienced a downturn, with its value dropping to $24.7k.</p>



<p>However, a significant shift occurred on June 22, when Bitcoin defied expectations and surged past the $30k milestone. By the end of June, Bitcoin closed at $30.4k, demonstrating that the $30k level is now serving as a solid support. This remarkable performance may have been influenced by positive news in the crypto space, such as Blackrock&#8217;s filing of a spot bitcoin ETF, which likely boosted market optimism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This consistent performance suggests a period of consolidation within the market, highlighting bitcoin&#8217;s resilience in the face of regulatory turbulence and a cascade of market news.</p>

<p>The market has cooled down and there hasn&#8217;t been any significant fluctuation in market cap compared to the previous month. On June 1, the market capitalization was 38.38 billion, and on June 30, it decreased slightly to 35.86 billion.</p>

<p>In terms of trading volume, the NFT market experienced fluctuations throughout the month of June. On June 1, the trading volume was 26.20 million, which dropped to 16.59 million by June 18. However, by the end of the month, on June 30, the trading volume rebounded to 35.86 million. The highest trading volume was recorded on June 27th, reaching 61.45 million, largely due to Azuki, which alone accounted for 20 million in trading volume.</p>

<p>On June 28th, a series of incidents involving Azuki Elementals led to a spike in trading volume, mainly driven by selling. The number of sellers was twice the number of buyers for the Azuki series that day. This indicates that there was a significant sell-off, possibly due to the market&#8217;s reaction to the Azuki Elementals incidents.</p>

<p>In terms of user activity, the NFT market has remained relatively stable with approximately 30k active users. However, this number represents a continued decline in user activity compared to earlier in the year. In particular, compared to the peak on January 27, when there were 129.39k active users, current user activity is approximately a quarter of that peak.</p>



<p>Indeed, despite the slowdown in the secondary market, the NFT space continues to explore and expand into different application areas, demonstrating its versatility and potential. For example, Louis Vuitton&#8217;s launch of a high-end &#8220;Treasure Trunk&#8221; NFT collection, priced at €39,000, represents a fusion of luxury fashion and digital collectibles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the Bored Ape Yacht Club&#8217;s (BAYC) foray into the entertainment industry with an influential movie deal signifies the potential of NFTs in content creation and intellectual property. This could herald a new era in which NFTs play a central role in content licensing, royalties and creative collaborations.</p>



<p>These developments show that NFTs are not just digital collectibles, but can help revolutionize multiple industries. As more brands and industries experiment with and adopt NFTs, we can expect to see a broader range of applications and use cases beyond the traditional art and collectibles space. This diversification could be a key driver for the next wave of growth in the NFT market.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chains &amp; Marketplaces for NFTs</strong></h3>



<p>Ethereum&#8217;s dominance in the non-fungible token (NFT) market, with a significant 97.7% share of total volume in June, underscores its preeminent role as the platform of choice for NFT transactions. This dominance is not static, but constantly evolving, with Ethereum&#8217;s market share increasing slightly each month through 2023. This trend suggests that users rely on Ethereum for high-value transactions, especially during bear markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This preference may be due to Ethereum&#8217;s established reputation, proven security, and technical capabilities, all of which are essential to the functioning of NFTs.</p>

<p>Over the past three months, Ethereum has not only maintained its dominance in NFT transactions, but has also seen a gradual increase in the proportion of unique users. This is particularly noteworthy given the availability of alternative blockchains that offer lower transaction fees. Despite the cost-saving incentives of these alternatives, users continue to prefer Ethereum for their NFT transactions.</p>

<p>When it comes to daily trades, Ethereum still leads the pack, but Polygon and Solana are not far behind, taking second and third place respectively. With Ethereum accounting for 50.34% of the trades, Polygon at 28.38% and Solana at 10.92%, it is evident that Ethereum&#8217;s dominance is not as pronounced in terms of trade quantity as it is in terms of trade volume.</p>



<p>While Ethereum remains the dominant player, the significant volume of trades on Polygon and Solana suggests that these platforms are also major contenders in the NFT space. They appeal to smaller traders who are attracted by lower transaction fees and faster transaction times.</p>

<p>Despite the BNB chain&#8217;s underwhelming performance in terms of trading volume, its high wash trading rate, which was 42.14% in June, the highest among the chains, is a striking revelation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wash trading, which involves the simultaneous buying and selling of the same asset to artificially inflate trading volumes, can create a misleading perception of market activity and liquidity on the BNB chain. <a href="https://www.footprint.network/@Lesley/BNB-washtrading?date_range=2023-06-01~2023-06-30" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Specific projects</a> such as Pentas NFT, Alpaca Finance NFT, and Binance Regular NFT have wash trading rates in excess of 90%.</p>

<p>In terms of transaction value, Blur has consistently dominated the market, accounting for nearly 70% of the value in June. Another major player, OpenSea, which accounted for 22% of the value of the NFT market, launched OpenSea Pro in April, targeting professional NFT traders.

<p>However, when analyzing the market in terms of number of transactions and user base, OpenSea continues to lead with nearly 70% of the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we examine Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), which has the highest volume on both Opensea and Blur, we find a striking discrepancy. BAYC&#8217;s volume on Blur is 24.6 times that on Opensea, but the number of buyers is only 1.86 times greater. This suggests that while Blur facilitates a greater volume of transactions, the actual number of unique buyers involved in those transactions is not proportionately higher.</p>



<p>While Blur may be the preferred platform for high value transactions, OpenSea remains the preferred platform for a larger number of users and transactions.</p>

<p>In addition, a significant portion of Blur&#8217;s volume is concentrated in a small number of wallets. Specifically, less than 300 wallets account for 53.79% of Blur&#8217;s total volume. In contrast, for Opensea, the same percentage of volume is spread over a much larger number of wallets, with only 17.04% of the volume coming from the top wallets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This suggests a higher level of concentration among top buyers on Blur compared to Opensea, which could indicate that a smaller number of high-volume traders or investors are driving much of the market activity on Blur.</p>

<p>The funding market in the NFT space has cooled this month, with only two major fundraisings taking place. This significant reduction in funding activity may indicate increased caution among investors, possibly due to market uncertainties, regulatory concerns, or a realignment of investment priorities.</p>



<p>Among the funding activity announced on June 24, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/14/salesforce-leads-6m-round-for-ai-backed-web3-data-platform-mnemonic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mnemonic</a>, which specializes in AI-powered NFT data and analytics, successfully raised $6 million in a seed extension round.

<p>The financing industry related to NFT has been on a downward trend since January 2022, with June marking a particularly low point in terms of investment activity.</p>



<p>Despite the cautious approach of investors, it is noteworthy that builders and developers remain active even in a bear market. This persistence in building and innovating during a downturn is indicative of the underlying belief in the potential of the NFT space. It is this continued evolution that can lay the foundation for the next wave of opportunity in the NFT sector.</p>



<p>As history has shown, markets are cyclical and the current cooling off period could be followed by a resurgence. When the next bull market arrives, the groundwork laid by these builders during the bear market could catalyze a new era of innovation and investment in the NFT space.</p>

<p>A major point of contention was the alleged lack of originality in the Elementals collection, with community members pointing out striking similarities between the new Elementals and Azuki&#8217;s previous NFTs. For a community that likely had high expectations for fresh and innovative artwork, this was a disappointment.</p>



<p>Additionally, the minting process was marred by inconsistencies. While some holders were able to easily mint NFTs, others faced barriers that prevented them from participating. Adding fuel to the fire, the lack of minting limits during the pre-sale period allowed certain individuals to mint a unlimited number of Elementals.</p>

<p>By the end of the month, the Azuki floor price had dropped significantly to around 7 ETH. Similarly, the floor price of Azuki Elementals fell below its mintage price of 2 ETH. Elementals sparked a wave of selling that led to a sharp drop in prices. This in turn contributed to a chilling effect on market sentiment.</p>



<p>This situation highlights the importance of value creation and community engagement in the NFT space. If a project is perceived as lacking innovation or fairness, as was the case with Azuki Elementals, it can lead to a rapid loss of confidence and value.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating a former FTX executive over possible violations of campaign finance law related to his girlfriend&#8217;s congressional campaign last year.</em></li>



<li><em>The investigation focuses on whether the executive illegally avoided federal limits on contributions to support the congressional campaign, including examining money given by the executive and loans made by the candidate herself.</em></li>



<li><em>This investigation is separate from the case against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and highlights the seriousness of potential campaign finance violations in the political sphere.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-ftx-executive-linked-to-campaign-finance-probe-of-new-york-gop-race-c2b50252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, federal prosecutors in Manhattan are currently investigating a former FTX executive named <a href="https://coincu.com/152169-court-filing-discloses-the-alarm-raised-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Salame </a>for potential violations of campaign finance law. The investigation is related to his girlfriend Michelle Bond&#8217;s congressional campaign during the Republican primary for New York&#8217;s 1st congressional district last year.</strong></h5>

<p>Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that the investigation focuses on whether Salame unlawfully evaded federal limits on campaign contributions in support of Bond&#8217;s campaign. Specifically, investigators are examining both the money Salame contributed to Bond&#8217;s campaign and the loans she made to her own campaign. This examination has led to scrutiny regarding the legality of these financial transactions under campaign finance regulations.</p>



<p>The investigation dates back to at least April when authorities executed a search warrant at the couple&#8217;s residence in Maryland and seized their cell phones. These actions indicate the seriousness and depth of the investigation being conducted by federal prosecutors.</p>



<p>During the time of Bond&#8217;s campaign, she held the position of CEO at the Association for Digital Asset Markets, a trade group. Additionally, Bond worked as a consultant for FTX, earning an annual salary of $200,000. These roles raise questions about the potential connections between Salame&#8217;s activities, Bond&#8217;s campaign, and her professional engagements.</p>

<p>It is important to note that this investigation is separate from the ongoing case involving FTX founder <a href="https://coincu.com/198247-bankman-fried-pretrial-motions-denied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>. He was charged in December with allegations of embezzling billions of dollars from FTX customers. However, Salame has not been charged in relation to the <a href="https://coincu.com/200757-taylor-swifts-alleged-partnership-with-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX case</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> previously identified Salame as an unnamed co-conspirator mentioned in Bankman-Fried&#8217;s indictment. The indictment suggests Salame&#8217;s involvement in a campaign-finance scheme unrelated to Bond, where he allegedly utilized FTX customer funds to make donations to Republican causes and candidates under the direction of Bankman-Fried.</p>



<p>The investigation into Bond and Salame&#8217;s activities has been ongoing, and its scope has expanded since the initial search warrant execution in April. As new evidence is gathered and analyzed, federal prosecutors will continue their efforts to determine whether any campaign finance laws were violated. The seriousness and potential implications of this investigation highlight the significance of adhering to campaign finance regulations and ensuring transparency in political contributions.</p>
