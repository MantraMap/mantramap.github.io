According to local reports, LPS has acquired the capacity to trace cryptocurrency transactions, enabling them to ascertain the locations where the funds have been deposited.</strong></p>
<h2>Lethbridge Police Service Embraces Blockchain Surveillance Technology</h2>
<p>Police in Lethbridge, Canada have told the press that investigators at the station utilize Chainalysis’ Reactor blockchain surveillance software. The Lethbridge Herald <a href="https://lethbridgeherald.com/news/lethbridge-news/2023/08/04/new-program-giving-lps-more-ability-to-investigate-crypto-scams/">discussed the situation</a> with sergeant Kevin Talbot of the Lethbridge Police Service (LPS) Economic Crimes Unit. Talbot has been trained in blockchain analysis, which is considered a significant advancement for a smaller force like the LPS, the report said.</p>
<p>The report notes that technology allows the LPS to trace transactions, identify suspects, and determine where funds have been deposited, even though prosecuting the scammers is still a challenge. Talbot discloses that it allows the police force to write production orders to gather information about the account holder.</p>
<p>“We’ll get to the point where we have a transaction data but we’re unable to trace it because it requires special programming to do these things and training. In Canada, we’re making headway,” Talbot explained to the Herald. “I will use the Chainalysis Reactor program to do the trace to an exchange. That information is then shared with an investigator who will then write a production order to obtain the information about the account holder, whether there’s funds in the account and where the funds may have been transferred out to,” added Talbot.</p>

<p>Sergeant Talbot acknowledged that the police force is only in the &#8220;early stages&#8221; of harnessing the Chainalysis Reactor technology, having begun to use the software just a few months ago. In the realm of tracing funds to a crypto exchange, he has enjoyed &#8220;100% success doing that,&#8221; he shared. Yet, prosecution has proven more elusive. Still, Talbot expressed optimism, believing the team will &#8220;have more success in that in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The focus when we do these investigations is two-fold,” Talbot stated. “One we’d love to prosecute someone but often though individuals involved in this are out of country which makes it a little more difficult to prosecute, but not always – there are occasions where they’re local or at least in North America.”</p>

The securities regulator has put out a specific proposal to address some of the issues that could be embedded in AI models.</strong></p>
<h2>SEC Chair Gensler on AI and Financial Crises</h2>
<p>The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, outlined some of his biggest concerns regarding artificial intelligence (AI) in an interview with Dealbook’s Ephrat Livni on Monday. The rise of generative AI tools like Chatgpt indicates that the technology is poised to transform business and society.</p>
<p>The SEC chairman said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This technology will be the center of future crises, future financial crises … It has to do with this powerful set of economics around scale and networks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gensler expressed concern that certain AI models may prioritize the interests of companies over those of investors, leading to potential conflicts of interest. “You’re not supposed to put the adviser ahead of the investor, you’re not supposed to put the broker ahead of the investor,” he stressed, adding that the SEC has “put out a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-advocates-increased-ai-use-for-market-surveillance-and-enforcement/">specific proposal</a> about addressing those conflicts that could be embedded in the models.”</p>
<p>The SEC chairman is also concerned about generative AI giving faulty financial advice. He explained: “Investment advisers under the law have a fiduciary duty, a duty of care, and a duty of loyalty to their clients … And whether you’re using an algorithm, you have that same duty of care.”</p>

<p>Gensler believes that it is reasonable to request that companies establish secure mechanisms ensuring that chatbot users do not delegate responsibility to the AI technology. He emphasized that parameters are set up by humans who built the models and set the parameters.</p>
<p>Last month, the chairman of the SEC also raised concerns about the use of AI. “AI also may make it more difficult to ensure fairness. The outcomes of its predictive algorithms may be based on data reflecting historical biases as well as latent features that may inadvertently be proxies for protected characteristics,” he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-advocates-increased-ai-use-for-market-surveillance-and-enforcement/">cautioned</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Gensler said that &#8220;AI is going to continue significantly transforming science, technology, and commerce.&#8221; He believes that the securities regulator &#8220;could benefit from staff making greater use of AI in their market surveillance, disclosure review, exams, enforcement, and economic analysis.&#8221;</p>

Moreover, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has invited 67 leaders and 20 representatives of major organizations to the BRICS summit. French President Emmanuel Macron, however, is not invited.</strong></p>
<h2>23 Countries Apply to Join BRICS</h2>
<p>South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor, revealed at a briefing on the upcoming BRICS summit on Monday that 23 countries have officially applied to join the economic bloc.</p>
<p>The BRICS summit will take place on Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg. South Africa is hosting the BRICS summit this year. South Africa&#8217;s President Cyril Ramaphosa, China&#8217;s President Xi Jinping, Brazil&#8217;s President Luiz Lula da Silva, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are expected to attend. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/historic-brics-summit-to-be-held-without-putin-in-person/">will not attend in person</a>.</p>
<p>According to the South African official, the 23 countries that have applied for BRICS membership are Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belarus, Bolivia, Venezuela, Vietnam, Cuba, Honduras, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Morocco, Nigeria, State of Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Pandor noted that at the summit, the leaders of the BRICS countries will be presented with a special report on the principles of expanding the association and a list of countries that want to join the economic bloc. Noting that “BRICS leaders will discuss the expansion of the organization at the summit,” she clarified:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is the leaders who will make the final decision on this issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We remember that South Africa was the first country to be admitted to the association after its creation. As the BRICS chairman, South Africa will negotiate at the summit on the expansion model and its principles and criteria. We are gradually moving towards a consensus on BRICS expansion and we hope that it will be reached at the summit,&#8221; Pandor continued.</p>

<h2>67 Leaders and 20 Representatives Invited to BRICS Summit</h2>
<p>The South African foreign minister further revealed on Monday that South Africa&#8217;s President Cyril Ramaphosa, with consensus support from his fellow BRICS leaders, has invited 67 leaders of countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean to the summit.</p>
<p>Moreover, she added that 20 representatives of major international organizations have been invited to the BRICS summit, including the secretary-general of the United Nations, the chairperson of the African Union Commission, and the president of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank. Furthermore, invitations have been extended to the chairs and executive heads of African Regional Economic Communities and African financial institutions, as well as to the Secretary General of the African Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat and the CEO of the African Union Development Agency.</p>
<p>The South African official further shared that 34 countries have confirmed their participation. However, she noted French President Emmanuel Macron was not invited. Macron earlier expressed interest in attending the economic bloc’s summit.</p>

<h2>RFK Jr on Potential US-Russia Nuclear War</h2>
<p>U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has raised concerns about the severe consequences of a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia in a series of tweets. RFK Jr. is a son of former U.S. Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy. The presidential hopeful wrote on Sunday:</p>
<blockquote><p>How would a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia affect you?</p></blockquote>
<p>He also shared a video that outlines what the aftermath of a full-scale nuclear war between Russia and the U.S. could look like based on non-classified data. The video referenced a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00573-0#Tab1">research paper</a> published in August last year, which estimates that more than five billion people could die from a war between the United States and Russia, including around 99% of those in the U.S., Europe, Russia, and China.</p>
<p>“We obviously don&#8217;t know how many people will survive a nuclear war but if it&#8217;s even remotely as bad as scientists think then it has no winners — merely losers,” the video notes.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>“This is the future the Biden administration risks by escalating the war in Ukraine,” Kennedy asserted in a follow-up tweet.</p>
<p>Citing U.S. National Security Council official Fiona Hill and former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett, RFK Jr. stated that Ukraine and Russia agreed on the terms of a negotiated peace back in March last year. “Russia pledged to retreat to pre-invasion lines and Ukraine pledged not to join NATO in exchange for security guarantees from a number of Western countries,” Kennedy detailed. However, he noted: “Leaders from Washington and London arrived to scuttle the deal and prolong the war.”</p>
<p>Last month, Kennedy said President Joe Biden is &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-says-biden-is-preparing-for-ground-war-with-russia-as-world-war-iii-warnings-escalate/">preparing for a ground war with Russia</a>&#8221; by signing the executive order to mobilize select reserve forces in order to augment Operation Atlantic Resolve. Some people believe that World War III is either already here or is coming. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council, recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-medvedev-natos-military-aid-ukraine-brings-world-war-three-closer-2023-07-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautioned</a> that the increase in <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_217059.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">military assistance</a> to Ukraine by the NATO alliance brings World War III closer. The president of a New Delhi-based think tank said this week that he believes World War III has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-analyst-world-war-iii-already-started-brics-could-merge-with-sco/">already started</a>.</p>

This will result in hyperinflation, a spike in interest rates to compensate for the loss of purchasing power, and falling asset prices, further accelerating U.S. decline,” he described.</strong></p>
<h2>Analyst Says ‘Dollar Dominance May Be Coming to an End’</h2>
<p>Lowy Institute, an independent international policy think tank, published an opinion piece titled &#8220;De-dollarization: shifting power between the US and BRICS” on Aug. 3. The article is authored by Michael Roach, a management consultant and researcher for the institute.</p>
<p>“Will a new global reserve currency threaten the greenback’s supremacy? The short answer is yes,” Roach began. The analyst predicted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The dollar dominance may be coming to an end.</p></blockquote>
<p>He detailed that when Saudi Arabia and Russia signed a military cooperation agreement in 2021, the exclusive role of the U.S. as &#8220;the sole protector of the Saudi Kingdom” ceased to exist. In addition, he noted that at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Saudi Arabia’s Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan announced that his country was open to trading in other currencies besides the U.S. dollar. Noting that this is “something they haven’t done in nearly 50 years,&#8221; he emphasized: “The signals of de-dollarisation were emerging.”</p>
<p>The analyst also mentioned that during the 2022 BRICS summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the economic bloc was working to create an “international reserve currency.&#8221; There has been speculation that the BRICS nations&#8217; common currency will be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gofrom/most_popular/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention">backed by gold</a>. However, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, said last month that the development of anything alternative to the U.S. dollar is &#8220;a medium to long-term ambition.&#8221; The BRICS nations are Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>

<p>The Lowy Institute analyst also explained that central banks are already stockpiling gold reserves. Referencing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER), he stressed: “Countries are positioning themselves for a new international system.”</p>
<p>While pointing out that de-dollarization is occurring, he said &#8220;it is not something unique.&#8221; Roach explained: &#8220;The rise and fall of empires and reserve currencies are apparent throughout history — from the Dutch Empire and the guilder to the British Empire and the pound sterling, and now the U.S. Empire and the dollar. There will inevitably be a shift in the world order, and it may well be the BRICS’ time,” he opined.</p>
<p>The analyst concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the reliance on U.S. dollars diminishes, central banks will begin dumping their dollar reserves. This will result in hyperinflation, a spike in interest rates to compensate for the loss of purchasing power, and falling asset prices, further accelerating U.S. decline.</p></blockquote>

The raid came just days after the Kenyan government announced the suspension of Worldcoin&#8217;s activities in the country. </strong></p>
<h2>Officers Armed With Search Warrant</h2>
<p>The Kenyan police recently raided a building housing cryptocurrency and biometric ID project Worldcoin, and reportedly took away devices used for storing data. According to a local <a href="https://kahawatungu.com/police-raid-worldcoin-cryptocurrency-warehouse-in-nairobi-over-data/">report</a>, the law enforcement agents were not only armed with a search warrant but had the backing of so-called multi-agency officials.</p>
<p>The raid on Worldcoin’s Kenyan offices came barely a week after the government <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-government-says-it-has-suspended-worldcoin-activities/">suspended</a> the cryptocurrency project on grounds that it posed a threat to public safety. Before that, Kenya’s data regulating agency had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-data-regulator-issues-warning-as-residents-rush-to-get-worldcoins-free-money/">sounded</a> the alarm over Worldcoin’s activities in the East African country.</p>
<p>However, following the move by the Kenyan government, Tools for Humanity (TFH)’s Alex Blania <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-confirms-kenya-id-verification-pause/">said</a> in a tweet that his organization would use the pause in Worldcoin’s activities to address regulators’ concerns. Yet, as stated in a report published by Kahawa Tungu, Data Commissioner Immaculate Kassait is adamant that Worldcoin did not adequately explain its intentions during its registration process, hence the raid.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Eliud Owalo: At the point of registration, Worldcoin  had met all the requisite requirements for registration purposes. What Kenyans need to understand is that there is a difference between registration and operationalization <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MondayReport?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MondayReport</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TrevorOmbija?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TrevorOmbija</a> <a href="https://t.co/bUxOEc7C0d">pic.twitter.com/bUxOEc7C0d</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>User Data &#8216;Will Not Be Infringed&#8217;</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Eliud Owalo, the Kenyan ICT minister who has defended Worldcoin’s activities in the past, suggested in an interview with Citizen TV Kenya that TFH may not have been adhering to the requirements of its registration license. When asked about the fate of the data collected from over 350,000 Kenyans who had their irises scanned by Worldcoin&#8217;s &#8220;Orb,&#8221; Owalo said the Office of the Data Commissioner “has ensured that that data will not be infringed.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p>Reacting to news of the raid, Erik Voorhees, the founder of crypto exchange platform Shapeshift, lamented how the seizure of Worldcoin’s data storage devices has resulted in the transfer of users&#8217; personal data to politicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like that, all the private data (which can never be revoked) is in the hands of politicians. And also whichever regime comes into power next. Of course, raiding the orbs isn’t even necessary. Governments of any country can just demand it all with a strongly worded letter,&#8221; Voorhees said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/1688598672685121556?s=20">tweet</a>.</p>

Economists state that the uncertainty of the upcoming elections caused key bagholders to hedge their portfolios with foreign currency. However, analysts fear the effect this movement might have on retail prices.</strong></p>
<h2>Argentine Peso Bleeds as Investors Take Cover in U.S. Dollars</h2>
<p>The Argentine peso plunged to new historic lows Monday, less than a week before the PASO elections, in which parties elect their representatives for the October general ballotage. The Argentine fiat currency <a href="https://www.clarin.com/economia/escapa-dolar-blue-trepa-596-mercado-prepara-lunes-post-paso_0_nd2IiybBUw.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 597 units per dollar on its free &#8220;blue&#8221; exchange rate, jumping 22 pesos in just one day.</p>
<p>This accelerated fall is said to be related to the uncertainty in the upcoming elections, with individuals and companies seeking to hedge their savings in foreign currency. Also, economic analysts say the next meeting with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which could result in a new official devaluation scheme, might play a part in this abnormal behavior.</p>
<p>Mateo Reschini, a research analyst for Inviu, <a href="https://www.perfil.com/noticias/bloomberg/bc-traders-ponen-fecha-a-devaluacion-argentina-mercado-sin-bozal.phtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market takes note of the relevance of the date of the upcoming elections and decides to be covered against possible exchange rate jumps, hand in hand with statements from economists, the IMF statement, and media rumors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From July 7 to August 7, the Argentine peso lost 21% of its value against the U.S. dollar.</p>

<h2>Inflationary Ride</h2>
<p>This movement in the exchange rate is already wreaking havoc in retail stores, which have <a href="https://www.infobae.com/economia/2023/08/08/la-suba-del-dolar-trajo-remarcaciones-de-precios-y-elevo-el-piso-de-la-inflacion-para-agosto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rushed</a> to change prices and announce new pricing schemes for the next few days. Analysts fear that this could cause an acceleration of the inflation numbers, with some already expecting a 9%+ Consumer Price Index (CPI) for August.</p>
<p>Inflation numbers for July will be offered after the upcoming PASO elections, but consultants have <a href="https://www.bloomberglinea.com/latinoamerica/argentina/inflacion-julio-2023-que-es-el-ciclo-ganadero-y-como-afecto-al-precio-de-la-carne/#:~:text=Para%20julio%2C%20el%20%C3%ADndice%20se%20ubicar%C3%ADa%20por%20encima%20del%207%25.&amp;text=Desde%20el%20octavo%20mes%20del,con%20el%20aumento%20de%20agosto." target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> a 7.7% CPI, which would set the annual inflation rate at 114%, one of the highest in the world.</p>
<p>The country has tried to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-argentina-reduces-dollar-and-yuan-disbursement-to-importers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce</a> its disbursements to importers lately to control its dollar and yuan-based reserves, having to resort to using Chinese yuan to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-argentina-to-complete-imf-payment-with-chinese-yuan-bolivia-also-using-chinas-currency-for-international-settlements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete</a> certain payments to the IMF. However, Economy minister and presidential candidate Sergio Massa reported the government reached a new <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imf-agrees-release-7-5-162554598.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreement</a> with the IMF, which would give the country an influx of at least $7.5 billion in the coming months.</p>

In spite of the existence of more than 26 million Paypal stablecoins, the contract continues to retain a substantial 92.91% of this supply. Concurrently, the Paxos Treasury wields control over 7.08% of all the PYUSD in circulation.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Paypal&#x2019;s PYUSD: Unpacking the Smart Contract, &#x2018;Freeze&#x2019; Function, and What It Means for Centralized Stablecoins</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Over a day has passed since Paypal and Paxos <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/">announced</a> the new stablecoin PYUSD and unveiled the official <a href="https://github.com/paxosglobal/pyusd-contract">Github code repository</a> and <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8">smart contract address</a>. Before the smart contract&#x2019;s publication, several bogus PYUSD tokens <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypals-new-stablecoin-sparks-confusion-wave-of-counterfeit-tokens-flood-decentralized-exchanges/">were created</a> and introduced to decentralized exchange (dex) platforms. Currently, the token contract reveals roughly <a href="https://archive.ph/gXuiN">26,905,005.66 PYUSD</a> in circulation across eight wallets.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The leading two holders possess <a href="https://archive.ph/sHI1G">99.99% of the supply</a>, indicating that PYUSD exists but has not yet been distributed. The initial mint occurred on August 3, 2023, five days prior, and PYUSD has experienced a total of 175 transfers, presumably internal tests. One <a href="https://twitter.com/Crypto_McKenna/status/1688634220044750848?s=20">topic of conversation</a> is Paypal&#x2019;s contract containing a &#x201C;freeze&#x201D; option, which has become a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=paypal%20freeze&src=typed_query">trending subject</a> on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The <a href="https://github.com/paxosglobal/pyusd-contract/blob/master/contracts/PYUSDImplementation.sol">smart contract</a> features freeze and seizure (wipe) capabilities. The &#x201C;freeze&#x201D; function permits an appointed asset protection role to freeze a specific address; upon freezing, the address cannot transfer or receive tokens according to checks in transfer-related functions. The &#x201C;unfreeze&#x201D; function enables an assigned asset protection role to unfreeze a particular address, lifting any freeze-imposed limitations.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A designated asset protection role can utilize the &#x201C;wipeFrozenAddress&#x201D; function to clear the balance of a frozen address, effectively confiscating its tokens. The tokens are deducted from the total supply while setting the frozen address balance to zero. Although freezing features are currently under discussion, other well-known stablecoins like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, USDC, and USDP also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/centre-obliges-government-request-freezes-address-with-100000-usdc/">possess</a> address-freezing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kucoin-hacked-for-150-million-in-bitcoin-bitfinex-and-tether-freeze-33-million-of-the-stolen-funds/">capabilities</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Many dollar-pegged token providers argue that these functionalities assist in regulatory compliance management or responding to suspicious activities. Additionally, the PYUSD contract employs an outdated Solidity version 0.4.24. Like most popular stablecoin assets presently, PYUSD&#x2019;s contract can raise or lower the total token supply. Moreover, the PYUSD contract owner can also pause/unpause it, blocking transfers and approvals during a halted state.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The PYUSD smart contract shares similarities with today&#x2019;s notable centralized <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/top-stablecoins-see-steady-decline-over-past-month-as-dollar-pegged-token-economy-shrinks/">stablecoin assets</a> in terms of control and minting capabilities. It shouldn&#x2019;t be confused with decentralized stablecoin assets or censorship-resistant cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypals-latest-report-1-billion-in-crypto-assets-holdings-are-predominantly-btc-and-eth/">Paypal</a> enjoys a substantial position in the financial world, and while PYUSD doesn&#x2019;t pose a significant threat to decentralized and permissionless crypto assets, it could challenge centralized and regulated stablecoins.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

These traders lucratively capitalized on early investments in esteemed blue-chip NFT collections such as Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Art Blocks.</strong></p>
<h2>Navigating the NFT Gold Rush: Coingecko Uncovers Strategies of Top 15 Profitable Traders</h2>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/top-nft-traders">latest NFT analysis</a>, Coingecko details that the top traders in the NFT arena have earned between $3.3 million and $101.6 million individually, cumulatively exceeding $300 million. The report explains the strategic investment choices and collections that have fueled the success of the foremost NFT traders.</p>
<p>Delving into the profits of the top 100 Ethereum NFT traders, Coingecko&#8217;s study discloses the most significant victors of the market thus far. This analysis focuses on traders&#8217; realized profits, meaning the tangible earnings secured through NFT sales. To qualify for this elite list of 100, traders were required to exhibit consistent activity over the past half-year and possession of no fewer than two collections.</p>
<p>The study illustrates that the leading NFT traders predominantly wagered on blue chip NFT collections at an early stage, an investment that has subsequently skyrocketed in value. Notably, Larva Labs&#8217; Cryptopunks constitute an astonishing 70.6% of total profits for the top 15, followed by Art Blocks&#8217; generative art at 12.2% and Bored Ape Yacht Club at 5.5%.</p>
<p>Occupying the zenith of the rankings, the NFT trader dubbed “Seths” boasts $101.6 million in realized gains to date. This vast fortune was cultivated across nine distinct addresses brimming with valuable Cryptopunks and other sought-after blue chip NFTs. Trailing in prestige, “Punks OTC” and “Mr.703” secure the next upper echelons with profits of around $29 million and $27 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Of the 15 top earners, 11 have extracted millions solely from Cryptopunks. For instance, trader 0x7eb2..3f6b clinched fifth place chiefly by selling one specific Cryptopunk to a renowned buyer. Conversely, some elite traders, such as Akira, directed their focus more towards Art Blocks.</p>
<p>Though these NFT moguls have reaped monumental wealth, the report underscores that this prosperity hinged substantially on early bets on the correct collections. Without astute identification of the upcoming blue chip collections, replicating such returns appears highly improbable.

The move came as cryptocurrencies rebounded, following a slow start to the week. Solana was another big mover, as it headed towards the $24.00 level.</strong></p>
<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) was one of Tuesday’s biggest movers, as price surged by as much as 4% during the session.</p>
<p>LINK/USD hit an intraday peak of $7.42 earlier in the day, following a low of $7.00 to start the week.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s bottom was also a long-term support point, with bulls choosing to reject a breakout on this occasion.</p>
<p>This comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to move away from a floor at the 48.00 mark.</p>
<p>As of writing, price strength is tracking at 52.20, close to a resistance zone of 53.00.</p>
<p>In the event this level is breached, there is a strong possibility that LINK could move towards $7.50.</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) also made strong gains on Tuesday, with bulls pushing price towards the $24.00 level.</p>
<p>After starting the week at a low of $22.49, SOL/USD raced to an intraday peak of $23.68, earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Momentum seems to have shifted in favor of the bulls, with solana now trading at its highest point since last Wednesday.</p>
<p>This is now the third consecutive day that SOL has edged higher, resulting in the RSI nearing a collision with a ceiling at 53.00</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is tracking at 51.87, with a move to the aforementioned target likely to result in SOL moving above $24.00.</p>
