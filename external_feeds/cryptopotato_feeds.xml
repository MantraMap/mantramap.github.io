			            <description><![CDATA[Can ETH's price flip BTC? Will Ethereum overtake Bitcoin in the next 5 years? Let's find out what ChatGPT has to say. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A topic as old as time, if time was a few years old &#8211; will Ethereum flip Bitcoin in terms of total market cap? Will ETH overtake BTC?</p>
<p>This has been the &#8220;to be or not to be&#8221; in the cryptocurrency industry, and it pins communities against each other like no other. It&#8217;s true that BTC has been the predominant market leader ever since it has been created, but a few years ago, who would have thought that another cryptocurrency would have a market cap worth over 40% of Bitcoin&#8217;s? Well, that&#8217;s the case for Ethereum today.</p>
<p>So, we decided to do what any sane person in 2023 would do &#8211; ask an AI language model what it (?) thinks. ChatGPT is all the rage in 2023, so who better to ask?</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ethereum_v_bitcoin_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-251248" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ethereum_v_bitcoin_cover.jpg" alt="ethereum_v_bitcoin_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ethereum_v_bitcoin_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ethereum_v_bitcoin_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ethereum_v_bitcoin_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ethereum_v_bitcoin_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ethereum_v_bitcoin_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Can Ethereum Flip Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>First things first, we prompted ChatGPT with this exact question: &#8220;Do you think Ethereum&#8217;s price can flip Bitcoin&#8217;s price in the next 5 years?&#8221;</p>
<p>The AI came back to us, explaining that this is an outcome that&#8217;s &#8220;uncertain and depends on various factors.&#8221;</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adoption Rates</li>
</ul>
<p>According to ChatGPT, Ethereum&#8217;s robust ecosystem and use cases, such as DeFi, NFTs, and whatnot, could help it flip Bitcoin.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ethereum&#8217;s broader use cases, such as DeFi (Decentralized Finance), <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-nft/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)</a>, and smart contracts, could potentially drive wider adoption and thus increase its value relative to Bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s where it got kind of interesting. You see, ChatGPT&#8217;s most recent knowledge cut-off on this topic was in September 2021. This means that it was before Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake.</p>
<p>That said, the second factor, according to the AI, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Upgrades</li>
</ul>
<p>ChatGPT argues that &#8220;the successful completion of Ethereum&#8217;s planned upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0, could significantly affect its price. This upgrade plans to improve the scalability, security, and sustainability of Ethereum, which could increase its attractiveness to investors and users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Ethereum&#8217;s transition to proof-of-stake, otherwise known as <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-the-merge-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-transition-to-ethereum-2-0/" data-wpel-link="internal">&#8220;The Merge,&#8221;</a> is already a fact in our timeline, and so far, it hasn&#8217;t really helped it get there.</p>
<h2>What Else Could Help ETH Flip BTC?</h2>
<p>The flippening can also take place under a few more conditions, according to ChatGPT. Regulation, for once, is among the factors.</p>
<blockquote><p>Changes in cryptocurrency regulation could impact prices. More restrictive regulations could lower prices, while more accommodating ones could raise them.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it does sound like an answer from Captain Obvious, it is true. Favorable regulation could push ETH&#8217;s price, but so far, the US government has taken a predatory approach, calling many of the projects built on Ethereum securities.</p>
<p>Going forward, the AI believes that market sentiment is also important. If enough investors believe Ethereum to be the better form of investment, it would inevitably lead to the flippening.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the broader economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and overall changes in the financial sector, could also have an impact.</p>
<p>In conclusion, ChatGPT took a more cautious position and didn&#8217;t provide a straightforward yes or no answer. This was somewhat expected, but it what arguments would an AI use to structure a response to a question of this kind.</p>
<p>Of course, none of the above should be construed as financial advice. The content is solely for educational and entertaining purposes, and we do hope you had fun with it.</p>

<p>Finblox, a leading crypto superapp backed and supported by behemoths like Dragonfly and Sequoia, is delighted to announce the remarkable success of its recent token launch, defying current market conditions and generating a trading volume exceeding 2 million USD in the first 12 trading hours.</p>
<h2>Preparation for the ICO</h2>
<p>Leading up to the listing, Finblox witnessed impressive participation from the crypto community across various partner launchpads, with more than 3,000 unique addresses who purchased FBX during the pre-sale period from PoolZ, Decubate, Spores, and from Finblox’s own launchpad: FinLaunch.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/finblox3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-251455" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/finblox3.jpg" alt="finblox3" width="624" height="416" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/finblox3.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/finblox3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/finblox3-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<p>As part of its comprehensive community strategy, Finblox conducted a series of compelling online and offline activities, including social media campaigns, learn-and-earn activities, and interactive ask-me-anything sessions.</p>
<p>The culmination of these efforts took shape in the form of highly successful offline meetups called Finblox Summit held in Manila, Philippines, and Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam last May 8 and 16, respectively, which brought together power users, partners, and media from the local communities.</p>
<p>FBX has further achieved a significant milestone by being listed on major exchanges, including Gate.io, MEXC Global, BTSE, starting May 18, 2023. The token&#8217;s all-time high during the ICO peaked at an astounding 500% above the listing price, demonstrating the market&#8217;s strong support for Finblox despite the volatility.</p>
<h2>Building a Sustainable Roadmap</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Finblox2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-251456" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Finblox2.jpg" alt="Finblox2" width="624" height="351" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Finblox2.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Finblox2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Finblox2-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Ripple is this week's market frontrunner. Here are a couple of possible reasons why. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple (XRP) is this week&#8217;s frontrunner as the rest of the market continues to either consolidate or trade in a ruthless chop. The cryptocurrency has defied expectations and is trending upwards with little signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>Here are a few possible reasons why and whether this rally could go any further.</p>
<h2>Case Against SEC Tilts in Ripple&#8217;s Favor</h2>
<p>It seems that the major reason for the increase in XRP&#8217;s price is that investors seem to be leaning bullish on Ripple winning the case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Recall that the SEC filed a lawsuit alleging that Ripple conducted an unregistered sale of securities, essentially claiming that XRP is a security.</p>
<p>This week, Judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-vs-sec-judge-denies-the-sealing-of-hinmans-speech-once-again/" data-wpel-link="internal">denied</a> the Commission&#8217;s request to seal documents pertaining to a speech by Bill Hinman &#8211; the director of the agency&#8217;s corporate finance division. This is the third time this specific request has been denied, so the question is &#8211; why is it so important for the SEC to seal these records? Well, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>William Hinman is a former director of the SEC&#8217;s Division of Corporation Finance. The speech in question refers to when he indicated that the agency didn&#8217;t consider ETH security at the time, and Ripple layers have fought to find out more about how he came to that conclusion. They hope it could impact XRP&#8217;s own classification.</p>
<p>Judge Torres says the documents should be accessible based on the common law principle of public access to judicial documents:</p>
<blockquote><p>Documents are considered &#8220;judicial documents&#8221; if they are &#8220;relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process. [&#8230;] The relevance of a specific document does not depend on which way the court ultimately rules or whether the document ultimately in fact influences the court’s decision. Rather, what is important is whether a document “would reasonably have the tendency to influence a district court’s ruling on a motion.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>$250M Metaco Deal Finalized</h2>
<p>Another positive development for Ripple, and thereby &#8211; XRP, is that the company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-enters-a-250-million-deal-to-acquire-metaco/" data-wpel-link="internal">entered</a> into a $250 million deal to acquire Metaco. The latter is a cryptocurrency custody provider based in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The deal aims to expand Ripple&#8217;s position in the world of crypto by also expanding its services toward crypto custody.</p>
<p>Speaking on the deal, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Metaco is a proven leader in institutional digital asset custody with an exceptional executive bench and a truly unmatched customer track record. Through the strength of our balance sheet and financial position, Ripple will continue pressing our advantage in the areas critical to crypto infrastructure. Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The above can finally explain XRP&#8217;s price surge in the past few days, but the question is &#8211; will it continue? This is a question that only time can answer, but if the positive developments surrounding the case against the SEC continue, then this might also have a somewhat positive impact on the price. After all, crypto is known for being news-driven, where announcements, be it good or bad, tend to influence the price.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Optimism, and Pepe.</p>
<h2>Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p>The market leaders turned flat this past week, and ETH booked a modest 2.6% price increase. The volatility has remained low, and the price continues to sit below the key resistance at $1,820.</p>
<p>The PA and momentum indicators show indecision from market participants. With decreasing volume, both bulls and bears seem absent from the market. There is no conviction on either side, and the price failed to move in a decisive manner. The current support is $1,660.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, it seems that this consolidation under the key resistance could continue. It seems unlikely that sellers will attempt to test the key support level since the market is waiting for a trigger to bring back volatility.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251355" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251355" style="width: 1813px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-251355" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43.png" alt="ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43" width="1813" height="861" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43.png 1813w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43-300x142.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43-1024x486.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43-768x365.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43-1536x729.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251355" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Ripple (XRP)</h2>
<p>XRP rallied by 8.5% in the past week, and the price has now arrived at the 47 cents resistance. This impressive rally is atypical, considering that ETH and BTC failed to rally this week.</p>
<p>Thanks to this renewed interest from buyers, the momentum indicators for this cryptocurrency have turned bullish. With decent volume on the way up and five consecutive daily candles closing in green, bulls dominate at this time.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, sellers may make a stand at the key resistance and stop this uptrend, at least for a while. If a pullback happens, then XRP has good support at 44 cents which could be tested before the next leg up.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251354" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251354" style="width: 1813px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-251354" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19.png" alt="XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19" width="1813" height="803" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19.png 1813w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19-1024x454.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19-768x340.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19-1536x680.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19-50x22.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251354" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Cardano (ADA)</h2>
<p>This past week, ADA failed to break above the key resistance at 38 cents but still managed to book a modest 2.8% price increase. At the time of this post, the price appears to be compressing between 36 and 38 cents, and a decisive move could happen soon.</p>
<p>The most significant level of support is found at 34 cents. It is unlikely for this level to be tested, considering that buyers appeared eager to buy this cryptocurrency whenever it had a pullback. Despite this, bulls were unable to break the key resistance to date.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2b2b2b;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead</span></span>, Cardano could be positioning for a major breakout similar to XRP, which could see the 38 cents resistance quickly falls but it remains to be seen if this would be the case.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251353" style="width: 1813px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-251353" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44.png" alt="ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44" width="1813" height="803" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44.png 1813w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44-1024x454.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44-768x340.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44-1536x680.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44-50x22.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251353" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Optimism (OP)</span></p>
<p>Optimism had a volatile week and managed to book a price increase of almost 10%, which took it to the key resistance at $1.8. This performance came after bulls found good support at $1.6.</p>
<p>Since touching the key resistance, the price has entered into a pullback. This could see OP retest the key support if buyers are not eager to return soon. Nevertheless, this price action has put a stop to a major downtrend that started in April.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Optimism seems well-positioned to attempt a breakout above $1.8 and seek a higher valuation. If successful, then the next major target will be found at $2, which is also a key psychological level.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251352" style="width: 1813px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-251352" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06.png" alt="OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06" width="1813" height="861" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06.png 1813w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06-300x142.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06-1024x486.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06-768x365.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06-1536x729.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251352" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Pepe (PEPE) </span></p>
<p>After finding good support at $0.0000011, PEPE managed to rally hard in a short amount of time and booked a 24% price increase compared to last Friday. However, the price is now correcting, and buyers are showing a lack of interest.</p>
<p>The momentum on the 4-hour timeframe appears bearish at the time of this post, with the MACD having completed a bearish cross. This indicates that the price may continue to fall in the short term until buyers return.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, PEPE continues to draw a lot of volatility not seen in many altcoins. This attracts traders that are likely to become active whenever the price reaches a critical level, like the key support. The current resistance is at $0.0000018.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the ever-evolving crypto market capturing the attention of global investors, a remarkable trend has emerged in recent times: crypto presales.</p>
<p>These exclusive offerings, often shrouded in anticipation, have garnered significant traction as traders seek the potential to generate market-beating returns.</p>
<p>This article delves into the captivating realm of crypto presales, shedding light on five eagerly-awaited coins poised to soar when they debut on major exchanges in the coming months.</p>
<h2>AiDoge (AI) – Revolutionizing the Meme Coin Niche Using the Power of AI, Over $9m Raised</h2>
<p>AiDoge breaks new ground as it uniquely fuses the viral appeal of memes with the rapidly expanding sphere of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>Using AiDoge&#8217;s &#8220;meme generator,&#8221; users can instantly create memes without having to come up with a caption or have any prior photo-editing experience – making it easy to upload hilarious images to sites like Reddit and Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-251382" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-1.png" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="204" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-1.png 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-1-300x102.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-1-50x17.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Users can also earn AI, AiDoge&#8217;s native token, by posting their memes on the &#8220;public wall.&#8221; The memes that garner the most votes each month will earn their creators additional AI tokens.</p>
<p>AI has been attracting attention from the broader crypto community – leading to over $9.1 million being raised through the ongoing presale phase.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-251383" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-1.png" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="156" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-1.png 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-1-300x78.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-1-50x13.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>AiDoge’s remarkable early success has caught the eye of several prominent crypto influencers. My Financial Friend, who boasts over 236,000 subscribers on YouTube, recently released a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp9j_aKKfAU&amp;ab_channel=MyFinancialFriend" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> video</a> speculating that AiDoge could be &#8220;the new king of meme coins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, AiDoge’s blend of memes and AI technology, along with its recognition from prominent crypto influencers, positions it as a promising contender in the presale market.</p>

<p>To sum up, the project looks primed and ready to blast off once listed on centralized exchanges (CEXs) as the demand for objective crypto analytics becomes more significant than ever.</p>

<p>Ecoterra even has a trackable &#8220;Impact Profile,&#8221; which allows individuals and businesses to easily track their positive environmental actions and practices.</p>
<p>Like the projects noted above, Ecoterra has captured the market’s attention through its presale phase, raising over $3.9 million – and counting.</p>

<p>Ultimately, by incentivizing recycling and providing a transparent marketplace for used materials and carbon offsets, Ecoterra is positioning itself as one of the go-to crypto projects for those looking to make an impact in the fight against climate change.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[OpenAI also provided more details concerning Android users. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American artificial intelligence research laboratory OpenAI announced the launch of an iOS app for ChatGPT. Similar to the original web model of the chatbot that was released around six months ago, the app is also a free-to-use version that is built on GPT-3.5.</p>
<p>The existing subscribers of ChatGPT Plus will be able to have exclusive access to GPT-4&#8217;s capabilities, early access to features as well faster response times on iOS.</p>
<h2>ChatGPT on App Store</h2>
<p>OpenAI revealed in a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">blog post</a> that the new mobile app will sync the user history of chats with its bot across devices. It also features voice input, supported by the company&#8217;s open-source speech recognition model Whisper.</p>
<p>At the launch, the app will be available only in the US and will expand to other countries &#8220;in the coming weeks.&#8221; Next up in its roadmap for OpenAI is Android device expansion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the ChatGPT app for iOS, we’re taking another step towards our mission by transforming state-of-the-art research into useful tools that empower people, while continuously making them more accessible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the company failed to provide a precise date, it said Android users will be next in line.</p>
<h2>Rise to Prominence</h2>
<p>While OpenAI did not hint at a new mobile incarnation, the move is not surprising since ChatGPT&#8217;s popularity has skyrocketed in a very short span of time. The popular artificial intelligence chatbot <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/02/chatgpt-100-million-users-open-ai-fastest-growing-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">attracted</a> 100 million users just two months after launching. In January, it had nearly 590 million visits.</p>
<p>OpenAI, which is a private company backed by Microsoft, made it available to the public for free last November, just 5 days after which ChatGPT acquired a million users. To put things into perspective, it took Instagram nearly 2.5 months to reach a million downloads. Whereas popular streaming service Netflix had to wait more than 3 years to reach one million users.</p>
<p>Recently, ChatGPT also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/chatgpt-predicts-8-things-that-will-happen-to-crypto-by-2033/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">came up</a> with several scenarios on what could happen in the digital asset space within the next decade.</p>
<p>The roaring success of ChatGPT has ignited a frantic rush to release new AI products to market. This hysteria has consumed some of the biggest tech behemoths and startups as they fight for space in the burgeoning sector.</p>
<p>Google, for one, is working on its own AI chatbot, Bard, which has so far failed to woo investors after giving an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">incorrect</a> answer in a promotional video. Chinese tech giant Baidu has also doubled down on plans to integrate its AI chatbot Ernie into its search engine services this year.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[XRP is the only larger-cap alt in the green today. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin dropped by over a grand in the past 24 hours and registered its lowest price tag in about a week earlier today.</p>
<p>The altcoins are also slightly in the red now, with LDO dumping the most (over 6%).</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Slips Under $27K</h2>
<p>Last week&#8217;s unfavorable market conditions culminated on Friday when BTC slumped to a two-month low at $25,800. However, the asset bounced off during the weekend, and spent most of it at around $27,000.</p>
<p>Monday began on a more positive note as BTC jumped to $27,600. However, it failed there and quickly lost all daily gains. Another <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-pushes-past-27k-render-rndr-explodes-20-daily-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">leg up came</a> on Wednesday, but the bears intercepted the move once again, and BTC was unable to challenge $27,500.</p>
<p>The subsequent rejection was a lot more violent than the previous one. It took bitcoin south by a grand, and it plummeted to a weekly low of $26,400. Despite regaining several hundred dollars since then, bitcoin still trades under $27,000 as it&#8217;s 2% down on the day.</p>
<p>As a result, its market capitalization has slumped back down to $520 billion, while its dominance over the altcoins sits tight at 46.3%.</p>

Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>XRP Defies Market Sentiment</h2>
<p>Most of the altcoins have also followed suit with minor daily declines. Ethereum, for one, has retraced by around 1% and is close to breaking below $1,800 once again. Binance Coin is back below $310 after a similar daily decline.</p>
<p>Cardano, Solana, Litecoin, Polkadot, Shiba Inu, and Avalanche have produced drops of around 1-2%. More daily losses come from the likes of Chainlink, ATOM, and TONCOIN &#8211; all of which are down by around 3%.</p>
<p>Lido DAO&#8217;s native token has dropped the most from the larger-cap alts with a 6% nosedive. Yet, LDO still trades above $2.1.</p>
<p>Ripple is the only top 10 alt with a minor daily increase. XRP, perhaps fueled by the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-vs-sec-judge-denies-the-sealing-of-hinmans-speech-once-again/" data-wpel-link="internal">positive developments</a> around the blockchain company&#8217;s legal case against the SEC, is up by around 3% and trades above $0.45.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap erased yesterday&#8217;s gains and is down to $1.120 trillion.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[America’s largest crypto exchange is trying to increase its customer base with the lure of zero-fee trading but all is not what it seems.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On May 18, the company announced upgrades to Coinbase One, a membership account that offers zero trading fees, boosted staking rewards, and priority support.</p>
<p>However, the catch is that users will have to stump up $30 a month for the privilege.</p>
<p>Coinbase has often been criticized for having some of the highest trading fees in the industry. It makes the lion’s share of its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-posts-79m-net-loss-but-beats-expectations/" data-wpel-link="internal">profits</a> from these often extortionate fees, so the model obviously works.</p>
<p>Paying a monthly fee to eliminate these fees would only be of benefit to whales and heavy traders. Furthermore, those that do trade a lot are unlikely to trade on Coinbase and would favor a decentralized exchange (DEX) where the fees are a fraction.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">2/ The best of Coinbase just got <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />better<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Unlock zero trading fees, a dedicated support team, boosted staking rewards, and exclusive benefits from partners with Coinbase One — all for $29.99/month.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Coinbase One Catches</h2>
<p>Coinbase is offering a 30-day free trial for its new service, which includes priority support. Aside from its hefty fees, the firm has also been heavily criticized for its lack of customer support.</p>
<p>It appears that Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-decentralization-claim-draws-fury-from-its-customers/" data-wpel-link="internal">customers</a> now have to pay to get a timely response through support channels. Members will also be able to receive support with crypto tax filing, it <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/new-updates-to-coinbase-one-zero-trading-fees-boosted-staking-rewards-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">added</a>.</p>
<p>The firm stated it was expanding access to Coinbase One in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Ireland in addition to the United States.</p>
<p>Moreover, the firm is offering perks with partners, including Messari, CoinTracker, and Lemonade.</p>
<p>Coinbase already offers premium accounts and stated that the zero trading fee offer does not apply to Advanced Trade, Coinbase Pro, or Coinbase Prime.</p>
<p>The crypto community&#8217;s reaction was mixed with a fair bit of skepticism over the service. “Nebraskangooner” said to his 300,000 followers:</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Followinng today's transaction, Ripple will become the sole shareholder of Metaco.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple announced the acquisition of Swiss-based crypto custody provider Metaco, marking the blockchain firm&#8217;s expansion across the growing institutional crypto custody market.</p>
<p>The deal, worth $250 million, surfaces as Ripple continues to defend against the long-drawn lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<h2>Ripple Acquires Metaco</h2>
<p>Ripple is expected to ramp up its enterprise offerings providing customers the technology to custody, issue, and settle any type of tokenized asset. At the heart of the deal, the two companies look to tap the growing institutional crypto custody market, which is forecasted to reach $10 trillion by 2030.</p>
<p>Metaco, on the other hand, will be able to leverage the San Francisco-based company&#8217;s established base of hundreds of customers and capital to address new demand and resources for its banking and institutional clients.</p>
<p>According to the official press <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230514005055/en/Leading-Enterprise-Crypto-Company-Ripple-Acquires-Custody-Provider-Metaco-for-250M" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">release</a>, Metaco will continue to operate as an independent brand and business unit, while its founder and CEO, Adrien Treccani, will lead its operations.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Metaco is a proven leader in institutional digital asset custody with an exceptional executive bench and a truly unmatched customer track record. Through the strength of our balance sheet and financial position, Ripple will continue pressing our advantage in the areas critical to crypto infrastructure. Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Reports also suggest that Ripple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/ripple-buys-swiss-startup-metaco-as-sec-lawsuit-conclusion-looms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">invested</a> $250 million of cash off its own balance sheet to fund the acquisition, despite challenging market conditions as a result of higher interest rates and tighter funding conditions to mass layoffs and falling company valuations.</p>
<p>In a call to CNBC, Garlinghouse said the deal would help Ripple increase its presence overseas at a time when the SEC is taking stringent actions against major players in the digital asset industry.</p>
<h2>Ripple Vs. SEC: Another Breakthrough</h2>
<p>The lawsuit contested by Ripple has been dragging on for years. But in a significant development, a federal judge <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-vs-sec-judge-denies-the-sealing-of-hinmans-speech-once-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ruled</a> that the SEC cannot seal documents connected to former official William Hinman&#8217;s 2018 speech on crypto and securities.</p>
<p>The documents in question consist of drafts and emails that indicated the agency did not consider Ether a security at the time. The lawyers representing Ripple have been fighting to learn more about how Hinman came to the conclusion a claim could impact XRP&#8217;s own classification.</p>
