<p>A respected voice on Crypto Twitter has recently shared his opinion on the potential growth trajectory of Bitcoin. Dan Gambardello suggested that the dominant cryptocurrency appears ready to make a big move soon, leaning toward the bulls&#8217; side.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-another-mega-btc-rally-coming"><strong>Another Mega BTC Rally Coming?</strong></h2>



<p>Strategist Dan Gambardello is expecting a massive Bitcoin (BTC) bull run in the near term.</p>



<p>The Crypto Capital Venture founder and YouTuber recalled in a recent tweet that on a day like today in 2019 (May 16), bitcoin was changing hands at around $8,000 per coin. Many people doubted whether the flagship cryptocurrency would ever recover above $10k, especially after the infamous Black Thursday market crash. The price of Bitcoin was nearly slashed in half within a matter of hours at the time, dropping to as low as $4,600.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, however, regained the losses incurred on that epic Black Thursday within a month and a half or so. After that, the analyst noted, bitcoin continued climbing higher, and in November 2021, it hit a record high of over $69,000. As such, Gambardello is convinced that Bitcoin is on the cusp of a parabolic rally.</p>



<p>The crypto market has recently taken a turn for the worse as a combination of large-cap coins and hyped-up meme-based coins have headed south. After <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-pierces-30000-for-first-time-since-june-as-bernstein-calls-btc-faster-horse-compared-to-gold/">rocketing past $30,000 </a>for the first time in 10 months in April, Bitcoin has struggled to remain at such highs this month.</p>



<p>The largest digital asset by market cap was trading at $27,097.31 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap. Its market cap currently stands at $524 billion, way down from the $1 trillion it surpassed back in November 2021. Bitcoin’s fall comes as investors&#8217; fear over a more stringent crypto regulatory crackdown lingers amid the unfolding debt crisis in the United States. These grave macro headwinds indicate that volatility in crypto is likely to remain.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, some investors are still feeling bullish, according to data from crypto analytics provider Glassnode: individual bitcoin wallets holding one whole BTC or more passed the millionth mark on Monday, showing long-term sentiment for the crypto stays intact even as prices retrace.</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of wallets that own up to 1 whole BTC has topped the 1 million mark for the first time.</li>



<li>Centralized exchanges remain king holding over 1.89 million of the circulating 19 million supply of BTC in the market.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The adoption of digital assets, specifically the two market leaders <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ancient-bitcoin-wallet-comes-back-to-life-after-12-years-owner-rakes-millions-in-profits/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and Ethereum (ETH), continues to grow with gains recorded this year and a potential pause in interest rate hikes.</p>



<p>According to recent data from on-chain analytics firm, Glassnode, the number of wallets with at least 1 BTC has surged past the 1 million mark for the first time. This is a huge milestone as the top cryptocurrency attempts to reclaim $28,000 after losing that mark earlier this month.</p>



<p>The market downturn of 2022, which saw BTC lose over 55% of its value, lured many investors to add to their holdings. Wallets holding more than 1 Bitcoin surged in mid-June and November after the crash of FTX. Overall, 190,000 wallets grew their portfolio above 1 BTC from Nov 2021 till date.</p>



<p>It should be pointed out that the fact that 1 million addresses own over 1 BTC does not represent 1 million users, as several big investors have more than one crypto address, and digital asset exchanges also hold large amounts of assets. Data from CoinGlass show that of the 19 million BTC in circulation, about 1.89 million are held on major exchanges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-glassnode-sees-a-bull-run-on-the-horizon"><strong>Glassnode sees a bull run on the horizon</strong></h2>



<p>Glassnode’s co-founder @Nengentropic urged his followers on the best time to acquire cryptocurrencies in the wake of the new statistics. According to him, users should accumulate “<em>when there is blood in the streets,” </em>signifying a bearish market on the brink of a surge. </p>



<p>Glassnode also estimated BTC to hit $35,000 in summer as bulls look to capitalize on the current banking sector woes and the signal from the Feds to pause the hike in interest rates, a move which has repeatedly hurt the market as investors move on from risky assets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81000" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-16-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>On the other hand, BTC seeing fresh dives below $26,700, marking two months&#8217; lows, have left pundits pointing to a correction below $25,500. Despite last week&#8217;s fall, BTC already looks stronger after reclaiming $27,300.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens are not new yet and have not been very popular in the past. Modelled after ERC-20 on Ethereum, this protocol lets participants mint fungible and non-fungible tokens on Bitcoin. But, according to JAN3 CEO Samson Mow, it seems its days are numbered; in a recent interview, he doubted its longevity, saying, <em>&#8220;These guys are basically paying massive amounts of fees that go directly to Bitcoin miners, and there is no way this can be sustained.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>However, there is another standard that is emerging. On May 9, the DRC-20 tokens were launched, and they share a similar technical structure to BRC-20 tokens.</p>



<p>Inspired by the BRC-20 standard, Dogecoin developers appear eager to revitalize interest in the original meme coin this meme coin season. After the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-whales-amassing-millions-in-pepe-coin-even-as-prices-plunge-is-a-larger-upsurge-on-the-horizon/">success of $PEPE</a>, which left <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shibarium-the-project-set-to-propel-shiba-inu-beyond-predictions-of-a-0-001-shib-price/">Shiba Inu</a> and the most significant meme coin by market cap, namely Dogecoin, in the dust, activity on the Dogecoin blockchain has increased to overtake that on Litecoin briefly.</p>



<p>Like the BRC-20 standard, the DRC-20 tokens can be engraved on each indivisible unit of DOGE, which is called an &#8220;Elon,&#8221; there are 100,000,000 elons in a Dogecoin. These engravings can include arbitrary content, producing Dogecoin-specific digital artefacts that can serve as fungible or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) without relying on a separate token or sidechain.</p>



<p>The Doge Labs account tweeted, <em>&#8220;Allow us to introduce $MOON, the first-ever dogecoin token following the official DRC-20 standard! Capped at a max supply of 21,000,000, it&#8217;s primed to take off!&#8221;</em></p>



<p>As a nod to Bitcoin Ordinals, this standard was humorously dubbed &#8220;Doginals&#8221; by Cheems, a meme project based on Solana launched on the new DRC-20 standard. Some of the up-and-coming meme coins are said to be DRC-20 tokens in Cheems, Dogewow, Misu, Pepe, and Meme.</p>



<p>Some Twitter users appear to push for the next 100X coming out of DRC-20, but as always, investors should do their due diligence before going in on any meme coin. While crypto is a volatile space by any definition, meme coins are notorious for pumping and dumping in short bursts leaving token holders with assets with little to no value.</p>



<p>By their very nature, Meme coins are frequently influenced by speculative trading, social media excitement, and trends rather than conventional fundamental analysis. Moreover, meme coins often don&#8217;t have underlying assets, revenue streams, or a clear use case, making it difficult to assess their prognosis using conventional financial criteria.</p>

<ul>
<li>SHIB is on the verge of another uphill run as bulls set their gaze on $0.001 in the coming months as new updates and use cases are expected on the mainnet.</li>



<li>Massive token burns, the Shiba Inu metaverse, and partnership with Alpha Mobile among others remain key in SHIB’s resurgence.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Despite the delayed launch of Shibarium, developers maintain that the layer 2 network will hit the platform, opening up new possibilities for users.</li>
</ul>



<p>Meme coins are <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-and-doge-killer-pepe-coin-eyes-monstrous-highs-despite-already-gaining-2000-in-a-week/">gaining traction</a> once more amidst an imminent market rebound, leaving users leaning towards Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Elon Musk-backed Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-shibarium-renews-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib-shiba-inus-metaverse-sees-major-developments/">Shiba Inu</a>, the popular dog-themed cryptocurrency, hit the markets in Aug 2020, gaining massive popularity in 2021 and hitting an all-time high. Currently ranked the 15th largest digital asset by market capitalization, the meme coin plunged 50% in value in 2022 but has bounced back by 19% this year with the broader market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent days, bulls&#8217; appetite has begun to ignite following positive indicators for a massive run. At the center of these are the ongoing burn schemes, Shibarium, and new updates on the network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mammoth SHIB Burns</strong></h2>



<p>The SHIB community pushed in favour of burning tokens, and so far, 410,637,982,069,024 SHIB has been burned. In the past 24 hours, over 12 million tokens have been burned across two transactions, with a massive burn rate of 60%.</p>



<p>In the last seven days, 1,748,403,277 SHIB have been burned across 20 transactions, to the community&#8217;s delight. The burn scheme has yielded results so far, as the price of SHIB has held steady.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shibarium-is-still-a-game-changer"><strong>Shibarium is still a game changer</strong></h2>



<p>In 2021, Ryoshi, the anonymous founder of Shiba Inu, unveiled plans for Shibarium, sparking off interest from within and outside the community. The project is a layer 2 blockchain built on Ethereum, transforming Shiba Inu into a comprehensive ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-shibarium-renews-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib-shiba-inus-metaverse-sees-major-developments/">launch</a> of Shibarium, the ecosystem will include decentralized exchanges (DEXs), a unique metaverse, and several blockchain games. The network would also record increased transaction speeds, lower fees, and added token utility and better-decentralized application (Dapps) development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-devs-push-shib-for-partnerships-and-a-metaverse"><strong>Devs push SHIB for partnerships and a metaverse&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The developers of Shiba Inu continue to build support in a bid to make the asset get more adoption. SHIB has just been integrated with Alpha Mobile to serve its existing customer base. Users can now use the assets to make online purchases from their mobile phones.</p>



<p>”<em>Greetings from the future of payments with AlphaTopup and Shibtoken. The hottest meme coin of the year may now be used for powering up your phone or making online purchases in AlphaTopup. Don’t miss out on the chance to join the AlphaTopup with SHIB and be part of the revolution,” </em>the statement read.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Courtesy of the partnership, Shiba Inu has opened up to 150 million users and 1,200 mobile operations in a bid to drive up more adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developers of Shib have announced a metaverse project set to launch in Dec 2023, which will feature 100,595 plots of land with an engaging user experience. According to the announcement, Rocket Pond is set for launch and will visually display the history and development of Shiba Inu. Users can win land through contests and earn passive income on their virtual property creating added utility for the asset.</p>



<p>“<em>While all development takes time, the MV team is confident that by the end of 2023, users will have the opportunity to explore some of the areas in this fantastic world, build, design, play, and develop within it. However, it should be noted that not all areas of the Metaverse will be fully completed as it is an ongoing project. The world will continuously evolve and develop, but there will be several optimized Hubs and all necessary tools for users to start building and creating,” </em>the publication reads.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Satoshi-era Bitcoin holder transfers 139 BTC after 12 years, making a staggering $3.5 million in profit with recent prices. </li>



<li>Over 3000 BTC from ancient supply has been reintroduced to the market this year, spurring the community&#8217;s curiosity. </li>



<li>BTC trades at $27,388, rising 2% in the past 24 hours as the top asset seeks to reclaim $28,000 despite wider economic uncertainty.</li>
</ul>



<p>The massive uphill run of Bitcoin (BTC) this year has led to several hodlers being active once more in a bid to make profits after many years in silence.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-billionaire-paul-tudor-jones-now-believes-bitcoin-has-become-less-attractive/">Bitcoin</a> holder has transferred 139 BTC from address <a href="https://mempool.space/address/1H1Ab6Jkpx2ZtMbBZ9ctxaXPMDmf6k3JvK">1H1Ab6</a> to a new Segwit address bringing the dormant wallet to life after 12 years. The coins were purchased in June 2011 for $2,250 without any form of activity until last week.</p>



<p>At the present market, the assets are worth about $3.5 million making another crypto millionaire from hodling this year. This year has seen a new spark in the number of Ancient Supply coming trickling into the market.</p>



<p>Assets referred to as Ancient Supply are cryptocurrencies purchased at least seven years ago although this year has seen much older coins make their return. According to a Glassnode report, 3,200 ancient BTC has made a return and of that number, 1,100 are over a decade old.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason for hodlers taking profits this year isn’t far-fetched. After a bearish market outlook in 2022, with BTC shedding over 55% in value, the top asset has gained over 72% year to date, making it a perfect time to make trades.</p>



<p>Despite assets making their way back to circulation, several analysts feel the majority of ancient supplies totalling over 3 million BTC have been lost.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-re-circulation-out-of-the-question">Is re-circulation out of the question?</h2>



<p>While over 3000 BTC have been reintroduced into the circulating supply, some will just never trade hands again due to the nature of digital assets. Several commentators have cited the Satoshi stash, lost private keys, and burned Bitcoin as key reasons.</p>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous Bitcoin founder, is speculated to have mined about 1.1 million BTC in the first few months of creation and has left the scene without transferring these assets to the circulating supply. This has reduced the asset’s circulating supply by 5.9%. </p>



<p>Users losing private keys also accounts for a decline in the circulating supply because of the nature of cryptocurrencies. Although lost keys only amount to little assets, in some cases, users have lost a huge number of coins. A typical example was the unfortunate <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/bitcoin-value-james-howells-newport-landfill-hard-drive-campbell-simpson-laszlo-hanyecz-a8091371.html">incident</a> where a man discarded a hard drive with 7,500 BTC.</p>



<p>As the value of BTC rises, whales with large stashes will reintroduce their assets to the market; however, some will never be traded anymore.</p>

<p>Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor-Jones — who previously touted bitcoin&#8217;s allure as an inflationary hedge — now thinks the benchmark cryptocurrency is less attractive, suggesting it has lost some of its luster.</p>



<p>Jones cited the challenging regulatory environment in the U.S. and the inflation slowdown as fundamental headwinds for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Regardless, the billionaire American investor — whose company controls approximately $40 billion in assets under management — said he still has a minor allocation in Bitcoin even though it has lost its appeal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-has-a-real-problem"><strong>“Bitcoin Has A Real Problem”</strong></h2>



<p>One of the all-time great investors, Paul Tudor-Jones, told <em>CNBC’s Squawk Box</em> today that Bitcoin has a grave problem amid regulatory challenges in the United States.</p>



<p>“Bitcoin has a real problem because, in the United States, you have the entire regulatory apparatus against it,” Jones said during the interview.</p>



<p>In recent months, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indeed stepped up its enforcement actions against crypto startups and platforms in the country, alleging wide breaches of securities laws. The multi-billion dollar implosion of crypto exchange FTX initiated a particularly intense wave of crypto regulatory clampdowns, including those on well-known exchanges, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-goes-offensive-against-the-sec-with-lawsuit-targeted-at-regulatory-clarity/">Coinbase </a>and Kraken. Coinbase has even <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-ceo-is-considering-relocating-company-outside-of-the-u-s-due-to-unfavorable-regulation/">threatened </a>to move away from the U.S. if legal and regulatory certainty does not come forth.</p>



<p>Jones further said he thinks inflation will continue to cool off, adding to the less-bullish picture for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is far and away the most famous cryptocurrency. Crypto propounders consider Bitcoin a store of value asset like gold, owing to the programmed code that reduces its pace of supply expansion by 50% quadrennially. Back in 2020, when central banks started money-printing sprees in a bid to keep the economy and financial system afloat in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns, Jones <a href="https://zycrypto.com/paul-tudor-discloses-he-has-1-2-of-his-assets-in-bitcoin-calls-it-a-great-speculation/">wrote </a>a compelling investor letter, generally viewed as a logical case for hedging one’s portfolio against inflation with the OG crypto.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tudor-Jones Still Has Bitcoin Exposure</strong></h2>



<p>While Jones&#8217;s recent remarks weren’t exactly an endorsement of Bitcoin, given his major bullishness roughly three years ago, the hedge fund manager is not ready to completely cut ties with the number one cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>For Jones, Bitcoin remains intriguing, with its appeal mainly coming from the fact that a single individual or company cannot manipulate its supply.</p>



<p>“It is the only thing that humans can&#8217;t adjust the supply in, so I am sticking with it, and I am always going to stick with it,” the billionaire emphasized, adding that bitcoin accounts for a “small diversification” in his portfolio.</p>

<p>RBZ Governor Dr John Mangudya announced in a statement on May 12 that the central bank had received 135 applications from the participating lenders, of which 132 of the bids were submitted in local currencies, while three were in USD.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gold-backed-crypto-as-a-solution-to-hyperinflation"><strong>Gold-Backed Crypto as a Solution to Hyperinflation</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/cbdc-or-bitcoin-zimbabwe-sways-both-sides-as-conflicting-reports-emerge/">Zimbabwe</a> is turning to gold-backed digital currency to address hyperinflation and the diminishing value of its local currency. According to Mangudya, the digital currency aims to expand value-preserving instruments, enhance investment divisibility and expand public access.</p>



<p>‘‘The issuance of the gold-backed digital tokens is meant to expand the value-preserving instruments available in the economy and enhance divisibility of the investment instruments and widen their access and usage by the public,’’ he said, adding that the depreciation of the local currency because of the increase in demand for the US dollar was causing volatility in exchange rates.</p>



<p>RBZ Gold-backed Digital Token, whose first sale was backed by nearly 140 kilograms of gold, fetched a minimum price of $10 for individuals and $5,000 for corporations, with a minimum vesting period of 180 days.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrencies, held in e-gold wallets or e-gold cards, are tradeable through person-to-person and person-to-business transactions. Further, users with physical gold exchange them for gold-backed digital tokens through commercial banks, according to the report, allowing their use as a payment and a store of value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-imf-s-objection"><strong>IMF’s Objection</strong></h2>



<p>The IMF has warned the southern African country against adopting the gold-backed crypto, saying that conventional means of addressing the pressing macroeconomic challenges should be considered instead.</p>



<p>‘‘A careful assessment should be conducted to ensure the benefits from this measure outweigh the costs and potential risks including, for instance, macroeconomic and financial stability risks, legal and operational risks, governance risks, cost of foregone FX reserves,’’ said IMF representative who spoke to Bloomberg.</p>



<p>The IMF has raised similar concerns against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-senators-reintroduce-bill-to-investigate-bitcoin-adoption-in-el-salvador/">El Salvador</a> and the Central African Republic, which adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender in their respective jurisdictions.</p>

<p>In a move that thrilled the members of the #PEPEARMY, the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange announced the listing of the $PEPE meme token for trading on its platform.

<p>As per the tweet by @Gemini, $PEPE is now available for trading on their platform. This announcement comes as a major development for the rapidly growing cryptocurrency, which has already amassed a significant online following.

<p>Gemini is a well-respected cryptocurrency exchange platform with a reputation for listing only high-quality digital assets. Its decision to list $PEPE clearly indicates the growing importance of meme coins in the crypto world.

<p>The $PEPE token has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binances-listing-of-pepe-and-floki-in-its-innovation-zone-strikes-further-eruption/">making waves</a> in the cryptocurrency space since its launch. It is a community-driven project that aims to create a decentralized platform for creators, artists, and influencers to showcase their work and monetize their content.

<p>With the listing on Gemini, $PEPE holders can now trade the token on one of the most respected cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. This listing also adds to the growing number of platforms where $PEPE can be traded, which includes other major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<p>The $PEPE token has shown impressive growth in the past few weeks, with its price rising by over 300% in just a month.

With the listing on Gemini, the $PEPE token is set to gain even more momentum and could potentially reach new all-time highs.</p>



<p>The listing of $PEPE on the Gemini exchange shows a significant development for the meme token and its growing community.

<p>The U.S. Justice Department is planning to increase its scrutiny of crypto trading platforms to target illicit behaviour.</p>



<p>According to Eun Young Choi, director of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), the DOJ is targeting cryptocurrency exchanges that engage in crimes themselves or allow “other criminal actors to easily profit from their crimes and cash out.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-doj-on-the-hunt-for-crypto-bad-actors"><strong>DOJ On The Hunt For Crypto Bad Actors</strong></h2>



<p>In a <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5aac457e-cc80-44ae-ac40-9b51d9b601a3">report </a>on Monday, National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team director Eun Young Choi noted that crypto crime has grown &#8220;significantly&#8221; in the last four years. As such, the department will be going after crypto exchanges that skirt anti-money laundering or know-your-customer laws or who do not invest in comprehensive compliance and risk mitigation processes.</p>



<p>“And so we hope that by focusing on those types of platforms, we’re going to have a multiplier effect,” Choi remarked.</p>



<p>The DOJ also aims to focus on crimes in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, specifically relating to chain bridges, where users are vulnerable to hacks and thefts. Notably, cross-chain bridges have been a prime target for hackers in recent years, with billions worth of cryptocurrencies lost in a slew of exploits and attacks. Choi, who was announced as the first director of the NCET in February 2022, acknowledged that this was a critical issue for the DOJ, given North Korean state-sponsored hackers have emerged as “key actors” in the crypto sector.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Companies Are Fleeing The U.S. Amid Regulatory Tensions</strong></h2>



<p>The United States has notably taken a short-sighted and enforcement-heavy approach that is extinguishing innovation and entrepreneurship in the crypto space.</p>



<p>The DOJ crypto enforcement unit under the Biden Administration has become one of the government bodies with the most stringent stance on crypto globally. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have also ramped up their scrutiny on cryptocurrency exchanges following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire last November.</p>



<p>The predictable consequence of the brutal crackdown on the nascent sector is that more crypto companies are leaving the U.S. in search of friendlier jurisdictions. For instance, Binance.US <a href="https://zycrypto.com/voyager-legal-team-left-shell-shocked-as-binance-us-walks-away-from-1-billion-acquisition-deal/">canceled </a>its $1B asset buy deal with Voyager, while Coinbase <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-debuts-offshore-exchange-with-bitcoin-and-ethereum-perpetual-futures-amid-regulatory-challenges-in-the-us/">opened </a>a crypto derivatives exchange in Bermuda as a prescient measure in response to the regulatory uncertainty in the U.S.</p>



<p>American policymakers should just allow crypto innovation to flourish by providing a realistic registration rulebook for centralized exchanges to operate within the country and letting permissionless competition deliver the perks of decentralized exchanges. Regulators should not be wary of U.S. markets’ innovative potential. They should instead fear killing it with impossible rules.</p>

<p>Just ahead of an <a href="https://zycrypto.com/what-a-ripple-sec-possible-settlement-could-mean-for-xrp-as-game-changing-ruling-nears/">expected ruling</a> in the ongoing court case between the SEC and Ripple, Stuart Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer at Ripple, said: &#8220;The Revak case exposes yet another SEC sleight of hand. Without a [common enterprise], it matters not whether [the fortunes of investors] are tied to the efforts of others. The Howey test is not [so easily satisfied].&#8221;</p>



<p>By broadly interpreting &#8220;common enterprise,&#8221; the SEC&#8217;s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies enables the agency to avoid tying the term to specific transactions and instead concentrate on the adjective &#8220;common.&#8221; The legal counsel for Ripple has recognized this and is contending that all that is required is a common interest in opposing the SEC&#8217;s attempt to extend the Howey test.</p>



<p>Australian Crypto Law commentator Bill Morgan added his views. &#8220;To put this and Stuart&#8217;s tweet in context, the starting point is to recognize that the SEC is trying to massively stretch the Howey test to cover crypto on the grounds the Court intended to be flexible.&#8221; He said in a tweet.</p>



<p>The SEC has cited evidence showing that Ripple boasted about the alignment of its interests with those who have XRP, but Ripple&#8217;s attorneys have refuted this claim by arguing that this is just a common interest using the example of gold. Nevertheless, other cryptocurrencies may be affected by the SEC&#8217;s attempt to reduce common enterprise to common interest.</p>



<p>The use of the Howey test by the SEC has been a source of controversy in the crypto industry, as the agency has attempted to apply the test to cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs). As a result, many in the industry have argued that the test does not apply to crypto and that the SEC has been overreaching in its attempts to regulate the space.</p>



<p>The decision in Revak raises the bar for the SEC to establish the existence of a common enterprise, which is considered a victory for those who disagree with the agency&#8217;s expansive interpretation of the Howey test. However, it also emphasizes the necessity of a more sophisticated strategy for regulating the cryptocurrency market, one that takes into consideration the unique features of cryptocurrencies and ICOs.</p>



<p>The SEC vs Ripple case is ongoing, and a ruling from district judge Analisa Torress is expected anytime now.</p>



<p>The SEC alleges that Ripple raised $1.3 billion by selling XRP as an unregistered security. Ripple denies the allegations and argues that XRP is not a security. The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/how-the-outcome-of-sec-v-ripple-case-could-shape-crypto-markets-as-xrp-army-eagerly-awaits-verdict/">case outcome</a> could significantly impact the cryptocurrency industry, as it could clarify the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, XRP was traded at $0.42, up 0.45% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>In a May 9, 2023 letter to the United States House Appropriations Committee, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry outlined the Committee Republicans’ priorities for fiscal year (FY) 2024 appropriations. Among the priorities listed is nurturing innovation for digital assets and blockchain technology in the United States (U.S.).</p>



<p>In his letter, McHenry requested the House Appropriations Committee to prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from continuing to regulate by enforcement. McHenry said that establishing clear rules for all players will ensure that innovation remains within the United States.</p>



<p>McHenry requested the Committee to prevent a budget increase for the SEC Enforcement Division. He also requested the House Appropriations Committee to prohibit funding for the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which precludes banking organizations from serving clients seeking digital asset safeguarding services. </p>



<p>McHenry further called upon the House Appropriations Committee to prohibit funding for enforcing the custody rule. The custody rule requires investment advisers to hold client assets only with “qualified custodians”, such as a bank, broker-dealer, or futures commission merchant. McHenry said that the proposed custody rule would limit the number of qualified crypto custodians and hence offer less consumer protection.</p>



<p>On May 10, 2023, the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology &amp; Inclusion held a joint hearing with the House Agriculture Committee’s Subcommittee on Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development. The Committees discussed measuring regulatory gaps in the digital asset markets.</p>



<p>In his remarks, Chairman French Hill pointed out the need to provide a functional framework for digital assets in the U.S. Hill said that failure would result in digital asset frameworks developing offshore rather than in a regulated U.S. environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hill acknowledged that there is no workable framework by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate digital asset issuers and intermediaries. He called upon both federal agencies to work with the House Committees to develop digital asset legislation.</p>



<p>“That’s why we’re here today. No one here is claiming that crypto should be exempt from the rules or that we should create an entirely new regime for it”, Hill said.</p>



<p>Hill said that the goal is to bring consumer protections seen in the current financial regulatory structure to digital asset-related activities and intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hill stated that the decisions taken in Congress this year will determine how the digital asset ecosystem will develop in the U.S.</p>

<p>The second-largest cryptocurrency platform in the world, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-whale-population-sinks-post-shapella-what-does-it-mean-for-long-term-eth-holders/">Ethereum network</a>, experienced two failures in the span of just 24 hours, severely disrupting its users. The platform&#8217;s stability was scrutinised after the first outage on May 12, when the network failed to complete transactions for 25 minutes. The second outage, which happened the next day, lasted for roughly 45 minutes and caused a sizable lag in transaction processing.</p>



<p>Apparently, a flaw in the Ethereum blockchain stopped nodes from executing transactions, which led to the first downtime. Due to the network&#8217;s decentralized architecture, which allowed nodes to continue running independently of one another, the network was able to escape a full-blown outage.</p>



<p>The second outage was caused by a problem with the Ethereum software&#8217;s transaction finality mechanism. In response to these outages, the Ethereum development team quickly released a patch to fix the transaction finality issue. Ethereum developer Superphiz stated on Twitter:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;No transactions were halted. The network continued as expected. While the chain did not halt, this is more technical, finalization wasn&#8217;t reached. Finalization is a novel concept in Ethereum that prevents chain re-orgs. This had zero impact on chain activity.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Although the root cause is still unknown, Superphiz stated that a lack of diverse clientele may have contributed to the problem. In addition, he claimed that because no client had a supermajority, the blockchain avoided forking.</p>



<p>The recent outages highlight decentralized networks like Ethereum face challenges in maintaining stability and reliability. While the decentralized architecture of the network makes it more resistant to attacks and censorship, it also makes it more vulnerable to bugs and other technical issues.</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, Ethereum remains a key player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with a market capitalization of over $220 billion and a wide range of applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the Ethereum development team is working on several upgrades to the platform, including cheaper transactions, extra security, better user experience and future-proofing.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the recent outages on the Ethereum network serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a robust and reliable infrastructure for decentralized systems. While the Ethereum development team has taken steps to address these issues, it will be crucial for the network to continue evolving and adapting to meet the needs of its users and the wider cryptocurrency community.</p>

<p>During the 42nd Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Labuan Bajo, Indonesia, from 10-11 May 2023, the ASEAN leaders committed to promoting the use of local currencies to deepen regional financial integration and strengthen financial stability in the region.</p>



<p>Per the Chairman’s statement, the 42nd ASEAN summit adopted the “Declaration on Advancing Regional Payment Connectivity and Promoting Local Currency Transaction” to foster bilateral and multilateral economic integration and enable more affordable cross-border payments across the region.</p>



<p>The promotion of local currencies for trade and payments and the calls for an alternative international reserve currency less dependent on the US dollar are increasing. The recent wave of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to fight inflation has led to other central banks raising interest rates to stem capital outflows and depreciation of their currencies.</p>



<p>The emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) are reported to be increasing the use of their currencies in trade. They are also exploring an international reserve currency less dependent on the US dollar. Similarly, other economies in the Middle East, North Africa, and South America are considering their options.</p>



<p>Does the de-dollarization debate provide an opportunity for cryptocurrencies? Looking at the economies exploring de-dollarization poses several questions and issues that must be assessed.</p>



<p>Do these economies give up their national currencies for one another currency, or do they adopt a new common currency? Could these economies consider adopting private money as a cryptocurrency or a stablecoin or opt for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)?</p>



<p>One thing for sure is that some of the economies exploring de-dollarisation belong to different regional blocs. Pursuing regional bloc economic objectives could conflict with adopting a different currency outside the bloc. Other challenges lie within the agreement, the management, and the distribution of the adopted currency.</p>



<p>Another issue is crypto regulation. The regional blocs are at different levels of developing crypto regulatory frameworks. Some of the economies only have country-specific positions regarding crypto legislation. Adopting a cryptocurrency, stablecoin, or CBDC whilst having different or no crypto legislation would pose challenges for these economies in pursuing a de-dollarisation strategy.</p>



<p>It appears that there are no outright or easy solutions to de-dollarisation. The formulation of global cryptocurrency frameworks is one of the critical issues that must be addressed if cryptocurrencies offer any alternatives to de-dollarisation.</p>

<p>On May 11, Senators Bob Menendez and Jim Risch reintroduced the Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act in the United States Senate. The purpose of this act is to periodically oversee the process of Bitcoin adoption in the Latin American country.</p>



<p>According to the Senate&#8217;s <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/rep/release/risch-menendez-reintroduce-legislation-to-mitigate-risks-of-el-salvadors-adoption-of-bitcoin">statement</a>, the bill aims to assess the impact of BTC on the economic stability and governance of the Central American country. It also seeks to analyze potential risks related to cybersecurity and malicious actors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-legislation-demands-reports-on-bitcoin-s-use-and-impact-on-stability-and-remittances"><strong>Legislation demands reports on Bitcoin&#8217;s use and impact on stability and remittances</strong></h2>



<p>The reports must include detailed information about the flow of cryptocurrency remittances sent from the United States to El Salvador. This is to understand the risks associated with using BTC for illicit activities.</p>



<p>The bill was initially <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-senate-on-the-verge-of-passing-new-legislation-to-closely-monitor-the-risks-associated-with-el-salvadors-bitcoin-adoption/">introduced</a> in Congress in February 2022 by Senators Jim Risch, Menendez, and Cassidy. Risch <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/rep/release/risch-menendez-cassidy-introduce-legislation-to-mitigate-risks-of-el-salvadors-adoption-of-bitcoin">stated</a> that adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender in El Salvador &#8220;raises significant concerns about the economic stability and financial integrity of a vulnerable U.S. trading partner in Central America.&#8221;</p>



<p>On the other hand, Cassidy emphasized that if the U.S. wants to combat money laundering, it &#8220;must tackle this issue head-on.&#8221; However, it seems Congress does not share the senators&#8217; opinion, as the bill has not been discussed again until now.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The proposed plan aims to mitigate potential risks to the U.S. financial system</strong></h2>



<p>One year after introducing the bill and not receiving a favourable response, Senator Risch continues to assert that the use of cryptocurrencies &#8220;as legal tender could weaken economic and financial stability and empower malign actors.&#8221;</p>



<p>Similarly, Risch emphasized that the interests of the U.S. are to ensure prosperity and economic transparency in Central America, gaining a clearer understanding of how the adoption of BTC can affect the financial and economic stability of El Salvador.</p>



<p>However, considering the geopolitical and macroeconomic scenario of the U.S., it could be said that the senators want to study the impact of BTC in El Salvador to understand better how implementing cryptocurrencies as legal tender can affect the country&#8217;s financial stability.</p>



<p>Perhaps, having access to such data could help them comprehend the potential advantages and disadvantages of implementing a CBDC based on the dollar.</p>



<p>Currently, the President of El Salvador, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/if-el-salvador-succeeds-every-country-will-follow-asserts-president-bukele-as-bitcoins-price-soars/">Nayib Bukele</a>, has not commented on the bill&#8217;s reintroduction. This might be because he is more focused on continuing to drive <a href="https://zycrypto.com/nayib-bukele-signs-bill-to-eliminate-technology-taxes-in-el-salvador/">technological innovations</a> and the adoption of cryptocurrencies rather than responding to politicians from a country with no jurisdiction over his own.</p>
