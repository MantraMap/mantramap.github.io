<li dir="ltr">The bootcamp will look to empower women in tech as from 3rd-24th May, 2023.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Course curriculum includes fundamentals of Python coding as well as blockchain,IoT and robotics.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/bitfinex/">Bitfinex</a>, a leading digital asset trading exchange, has announced its sponsorship of an upcoming coding bootcamp dedicated exclusively to women.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/media-releases/bitfinex-collaborates-in-coding-bootcamp-in-paraguay-with-penguin-academy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> shared with CoinJournal on Tuesday, Bitfinex said it would be partnering with the Penguin Academy, to offer the three-week introductory coding course. &nbsp;The bootcamp will run from 3rd to 24th May, 2023, in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We are delighted to collaborate with Penguin Academy to introduce this invaluable academic opportunity to women in Paraguay. The power of code is evident in Latin America where it can act as a powerful tool, especially in the hands of women who are then empowered to build and deploy novel solutions to benefit their communities</em>,&rdquo; said Claudia Lagorio, the Chief Operating Officer of Bitfinex.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitfinex&rsquo;s support for the program demonstrates its strong commitment towards the use of technology to promote individual freedom across &ldquo;<em>underserved communities worldwide</em>,&rdquo; Lagorio added.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Course includes microelectronics, robotics and IoT</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The course curriculum, crafted by Penguin Academy, will feature basic Python coding, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a> and microelectronics. Participants will also benefit from invaluable workshops in web development, robotics and IoT.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students will also benefit from networking opportunities, with multiple events lined up for this &ndash; including meet and greets, career nights and speed dating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oganisers have planned for a five-day hackathon to end the bootcamp, with a demo day seeing the top three contenders awarded scholarships for the<a href="https://streaklinks.com/Be1z0rDd3aYrCWgEpgmPYBza/https%3A%2F%2Fplanb.lugano.ch%2Fsummer-school%2F%23course" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>Plan B Summer School</u></a> set for Lugano, Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The partnership with Penguin Academy is the latest Bitfinex program that champions for individual freedom and financial inclusion via technological innovation. The crypto exchange was founded in 2012.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Penguin Academy, also founded in 2012, has run its coding bootcamp in Switzerland, Germany, Bulgaria, China, and the Philippines. The bootcamp landed in Paraguay in 2019 and has seen over 2000 young people trained.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Binance.US has reportedly terminated its deal for assets of Voyager Digital.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The $1 billion deal had been approved by a US court.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The price of VGX, the native Voyager token, fell more than 10% after the news.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Binance.US has terminated its acquisition deal for the assets of Voyager Digital, according to a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/investvoyager/status/1650921887512272917" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on the bankrupt crypto lender&rsquo;s Twitter account.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Today we received a letter from Binance.US terminating the asset purchase agreement. While this development is disappointing, our chapter 11 plan allows for direct distribution of cash and crypto to customers (a &ldquo;toggle option&rdquo;) via the Voyager platform</em>,&rdquo; the announcement read.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today we received a letter from <a href="https://t.co/yG7Airmib5">https://t.co/yG7Airmib5</a> terminating the asset purchase agreement. While this development is disappointing, our chapter 11 plan allows for direct distribution of cash and crypto to customers (a &ldquo;toggle option&rdquo;) via the Voyager platform.</p>
<p>&mdash; Voyager (@investvoyager) <a href="https://twitter.com/investvoyager/status/1650921887512272917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;Voyager token VGX fell more than 10% after the news, trading to lows of $0.317.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The purchase agreement for Voyager assets has been somewhat on and off, with Binance.US first being blocked from the deal by US authorities before a court <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-us-acquisition-of-voyager-to-proceed-bankruptcy-judge-rules/">allowed it to proceed</a>. Despite the latest setback, the Voyager Chapter 11 plan team says the key is to return value to the platform&rsquo;s customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Consistent with the plan, we will now move swiftly to return value to customers via direct distributions. We will provide more information on next steps and any actions customers need to take in the coming days</em>,&rdquo; the tweet read.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voyager filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 after a market turmoil amid contagion forced it to halt withdrawals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance.US had not released a statement on the development at the time of going to press.</p>

<li>Peter Lynch reveals that he does not own any cryptocurrency.</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s sticking to his &lsquo;buy what you know&rsquo; investment strategy.</li>
<li>Lynch regrets not investing in Apple and Nvidia in recent years.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has massively outperformed equities since the start of this year but legendary investor Peter Lynch continues to prefer the latter.</p>
<h2>Lynch does not own any cryptocurrency</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, the Vice Chairman of Fidelity Management &amp; Research confirmed that he&rsquo;s not exposed to cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Lynch is familiar with the technology that powers the crypto space. Still, he said today on CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/04/25/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-legendary-investor-peter-lynch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squawk Box</a>&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>I do understand blockchain. I know how it works. But what bitcoin is going to be, I have no idea. I don&rsquo;t own any bitcoin or ether coin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lynch is keeping away from BTC even though he knows the total supply of it will be cut in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-23/bitcoin-btc-halving-in-2024-spurs-predictions-of-rally-past-50-000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half</a> next year &ndash; an event that usually translates to higher price.</p>
<h2>Lynch is sticking to &lsquo;buy what you know&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has now slipped back to the $27,000 level but is still keeping above a key support suggesting the bullish sentiment is still there.</p>
<p>But for years, Fidelity&rsquo;s Peter Lynch has recommended that investors &ldquo;buy what they know&rdquo; &ndash; and to him, that means stocks. Explaining how to pick stocks and when to pull out of them, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Look at the company, the balance sheet. What&rsquo;s the reason stock should be higher? When companies go from crappy to semi-crappy to good, stock goes up. When business gets terrific, get out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lynch expressed regret today for not investing in a number of large-cap tech companies in recent years, particularly Apple Inc and Nvidia Corporation.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Chainlink oracle nodes will power Data Feeds on Celo.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Celo (CELO), a mobile-first, EVM compatible blockchain network, has joined the Chainlink SCALE program as it looks to tap into the oracle data and services of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/chainlink/">Chainlink (LINK)</a> to accelerate Celo ecosystem adoption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a <a href="https://blog.celo.org/its-finally-here-celo-joins-chainlink-scale-27c26f6bcc2b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press announcement</a> the Celo Foundation published on Tuesday, the development comes after a community approval of a<a href="https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/88" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>proposal</u></a> that outlined the partnership. The Celo governance forum approved the proposal with 99% yes in the on-chain vote in March.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SCALE to boost Web3 mobile applications on Celo</h2>
<p dir="ltr">SCALE is a program that seeks to boost sustainable growth for L1 and L2 blockchains by providing developers access to high-quality, but low-cost oracle services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;T<em>hrough the strategic deployment of resources, Celo will cover operating costs for Chainlink oracle nodes powering Data Feeds on the Celo Network. As the Celo ecosystem expands, dApp fees can eventually cover the full operating costs of Chainlink nodes,</em>&rdquo; Chainlink<a href="https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1650894950010089472" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>announced</u></a> via its official Twitter account.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Joining the initiative does not just give Celo developers access to industry-leading oracle services; it means projects can now look to minimized gas fees, with Celo able to support development of next-generation mobile applications.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Xochitl Cazador, Head of Ecosystem Growth at the Celo Foundation, said the collaboration is a key step towards long-term sustainability for the blockchain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Developers building on Celo now have access to Chainlink&rsquo;s oracle services, enabling the next generation of highly scalable Web3 mobile applications. We welcome Chainlink to the Celo community and look forward to the continued growth and collaboration between our communities</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ql-align-justify">TinyTap launched its Web3 strategy in 2022 with two successful auctions of Publisher NFTs, which generated 243 ETH (approximately US$352,000 at times of auction). Publisher NFTs are a new concept introduced by TinyTap to better empower, reward, and incentivize educational content creators and publishers.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Each Publisher NFT represents co-publishing rights to one TinyTap Course, which is a curated bundle of educational games made on the TinyTap platform by one teacher in one specific subject. When these NFTs are sold, the proceeds are shared with the Course creators, and the NFT buyers assume the role of co-publishers. In return for promoting and marketing the associated Courses, the buyers share in the benefits generated from co-publishing efforts.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Since the TinyTap Publisher NFTs were auctioned in Q4 2022, the average income to NFT buyers resulting from their co-publishing efforts amounted to approximately 8.2% (or 19.7% annualized) of the purchase price of the Publisher NFTs*.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The Publisher NFT model is therefore able to simultaneously benefit the creators of educational content, the buyers of the Publisher NFTs, and TinyTap. This frees the creators to focus their efforts on generation of quality content, while TinyTap and the buyers of Publisher NFTs distribute and promote the content.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Misa Matsuzaki owns two Publisher NFTs and earned about $7,823 from November 2022 to March 2024 by co-publishing the associated courses. She commented: &ldquo;TinyTap helps teachers to actualize great ideas into educational content that can be accessed regardless of location &ndash; for example, one of the courses I bought was adapted for Japan. I did the first translation and voice over myself with the help of the TinyTap&nbsp; team. I look forward to seeing how Japan will welcome these exciting new possibilities in education! I would like to see more use cases like TinyTap Publisher NFTs, which are so much more interesting than just having NFTs sitting in our wallet!&ldquo;</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Yogev Shelly, CEO of TinyTap, commented: &ldquo;Our Publisher NFTs genesis auctions demonstrated that the Web3 community is well suited and willing to support educators and educational content via this new powerful and equitable incentive system. By pairing educational content creators with interested promoters, we are able to benefit all parties fairly and take a significant step in our goal to put the power of learning back in the hands of educators, students, and the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, commented: &ldquo;Teachers and educators are among the most important content creators and contributors in&nbsp; society, and yet their wages typically do not reflect their critical importance. This is why we&rsquo;re incredibly excited at the Web3 opportunities that TinyTap is exploring in the field of education. Having already succeeded in building a Web2 education platform, TinyTap is now supercharging its efforts using NFTs, making it possible for educators to better generate equity from their work and link up with co-publishers who can handle the promotion of their courses, all while offering students enhanced learning materials.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">DigiToads (TOADS) offers an innovative approach to the NFT space and a promising investment opportunity.</li>
<li dir="ltr">LDO is the native token of popular liquid staking platform Lido DAO.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Toncoin&rsquo;s TON has the potential to benefit from the massive Telegram community and the social media giant&rsquo;s involvement in The Open Network blockchain.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">From decentralised finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the crypto space is evolving rapidly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/category/markets/">markets</a> evolve and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> becomes a viable investment option, more and more investors are looking at the next big opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the more established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain top assets for any portfolio, <a href="https://digitoads.me/cjl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DigiToads (TOADS)</a>, Lido DAO (LDO), and Toncoin (TON) offer promising potential for growth and profitability.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here is an outlook for the three altcoins and why they may be well-positioned to take advantage of the latest trends.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a href="https://digitoads.me/cjl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DigiToads</u></a></h2>
<p dir="ltr">DigiToads sits on the top tier of the three altcoins that have the potential to soar in 2023. DigiToads is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project aims to provide its users with a fast, low-cost, and user-friendly trading experience while offering them unique benefits, such as liquidity provision incentives and staking rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">DigiToads also features a governance token (TOAD) that allows its holders to participate in the decision-making process of the platform and earn rewards for doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A big highlight of DigiToads is its presale. The presale of DigiToads is up and going in full swing. 86% of the total TOADS token has already been sold, and we still have time till the end date.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This presale offers a chance to buy into an exciting new project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<a href="https://digitoads.me/cjl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</u></a></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Lido DAO</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/lido-dao/">Lido DAO</a> is another altcoin on many investors&rsquo; watchlists. Lido DAO, founded in December 2020, is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that facilitates Ethereum liquid staking. The platform seeks to overcome the challenges associated with traditional staking by allowing users to stake their assets without locking them up for prolonged periods.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The LDO project has swiftly emerged as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/best-liquid-staking-tokens-for-january-2023/">one of the best liquid staking tokens</a>, attracting over $13 billion in staked assets in less than a year of its launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the platform features a referral program that rewards users with LDO tokens for introducing others to stake on the platform. Lido DAO has implemented a safelist feature for its referral program, ensuring that incentives are only distributed to Lido DAO-approved partners.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">TonCoin</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Open Network (TON) has its cryptocurrency, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/toncoin/">Toncoin (TON)</a>, and operates as a decentralized Layer-1 blockchain network. The project was initially developed by Telegram before it fully became a community-run platform following legal action by the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">After a slow start, Toncoin has been experiencing significant activity lately, largely due to Telegram&rsquo;s recent focus on creating a decentralized blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a result, Toncoin boasts one of the most extensive crypto communities, with a loyal and bullish following that believes in its potential. The community is committed to supporting the project and remains optimistic about its future success.</p>
<p>In 2023, several <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/crypto-exchange/">crypto exchanges</a> and traders are rating TonCoin highly. So, holding this coin might be a great addition to your portfolio..</p>
<h2>DigiToads (TOADS), Toncoin (TON) Lido DAO (LDO): Summary</h2>
<p dir="ltr">DigiToads, Lido DAO, and Toncoin are three altcoins investors might want to look at and consider holding for 2023. DigiToads&rsquo; innovative approach to the NFT space, Lido DAO&rsquo;s popular liquid staking platform, and Toncoin&rsquo;s potential to benefit from Telegram&rsquo;s involvement in decentralized blockchain ecosystems make them promising investments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With these features and fundamentals, and the expected growth across the market, TOADS, LDO and TON stand out as among the top cryptocurrencies to invest in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Web3 is a constantly-evolving sector of technology, and blockchains continue to grow in stature. Early-stage crypto investors are constantly on the lookout for the next 100x investment opportunity, as successful projects can post significant gains from their earliest stages of development.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Shiba Inu price prediction in 2021 led to massive returns for investors as SHIB almost flipped Dogecoin (DOGE) to become the most valuable meme coin in Web3. Investors are now eyeing Metacade (MCADE) as a similar opportunity, but there are some critical differences between the projects that could serve MCADE well over the coming years.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade continues to progress, while the Shiba Inu price prediction targets Dogecoin</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Inu&rsquo;s price prediction has declined rapidly since it reached its all-time high in 2021. However, it brings a unique set of characteristics compared with Dogecoin, as the Shiba Inu blockchain is compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine and can support the development of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the Shiba Inu price prediction may struggle to break key resistance areas during 2023, it remains the second-largest meme coin behind Dogecoin. <strong>The Shiba Inu price prediction will likely benefit from a layer-2 scalability solution called Shibarium</strong>, which means that it could overtake Dogecoin to become number one over time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade&rsquo;s token presale raised $16.4m as investors sought to gain a stake in the future of the metaverse arcade. The project is the first community-driven initiative of its kind and will bring vast play-to-earn utility onto the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu price predictions have declined since the 2021 bull market, while Metacade represents a fresh opportunity for investors. The native MCADE token has innate utility on the platform, which gives it a natural advantage over popular meme coins.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Shiba Inu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin cryptocurrency that gained a lot of attention when it took the crypto charts by storm during the last bull run. &nbsp;It is a decentralized community-led token and independent blockchain that was forked from Ethereum. It&rsquo;s often referred to as the &ldquo;Dogecoin Killer&rdquo; due to its big selling point of supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Created in August 2020, SHIB grew rapidly as an EVM-compatible alternative to Dogecoin. The token rose to prominence after half of the total supply was airdropped to Vitalik Buterin, who famously <a href="https://u.today/410-trillion-shiba-inu-shib-burn-by-ethereums-vitalik-buterin-might-be-biggest-of-all-time-details#:~:text=In%20May%202021%2C%20Ethereum%20co-creator%20Vitalik%20Buterin%20burned,been%20unwillingly%20gifted%20half%20of%20SHIB%27s%20total%20supply." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>burned at least 90% of his tokens</u></a> &ndash; an amount later worth over $6bn. Shiba Inu can support the development of decentralized applications, including DeFi services, play-to-earn games, and much more.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Inu price prediction 2023: Can SHIB reach $0.00001343?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Shiba Inu price prediction has weakened considerably since it peaked in 2021. SHIB is currently at a multi-month resistance level and may struggle to break through $0.000012, but could target higher levels before the end of the year if it successfully turns this level into support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond 2023, SHIB will likely target higher resistance levels as it seeks to reclaim its previous all-time high during the next crypto bull market. Two key resistance areas for the long-term Shiba Inu price prediction are $0.00002 and $0.00003, which SHIB could reach by 2025.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Metacade?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=48" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is a newly-launched project that aims to build the largest games arcade on the blockchain. It will contain a vast selection of different play-to-earn games on a single platform, each offering integrated financial rewards to players.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project&rsquo;s ethos is to create a central hub for the Web3 community on the Ethereum blockchain. <strong>Metacade has several ground-breaking earning mechanics that go beyond gaming</strong>, giving arcade users the chance to earn MCADE token rewards in new and exciting ways.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How does MCADE work?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The MCADE token is used for rewards in the Metaverse arcade. The platform will also be home to a range of DeFi services for the MCADE token, including staking to earn a passive income (SOLD OUT) and voting in governance proposals released by the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Metaverse arcade offers casual and competitive gameplay to players, who can earn cryptocurrency rewards while playing solo or by joining paid entry tournaments. These tournaments allow players to go head-to-head to win major crypto prizes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade&rsquo;s community hub will also reward content creators for their contributions to the platform through a novel Create2Earn mechanic. This can include posting game reviews, sharing alpha, or interacting with other users&rsquo; posts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the platform will advertise open positions at some of Web3&rsquo;s hottest start-ups through the Work2Earn feature. Metacade&rsquo;s partner projects will provide job opportunities to the best members, including full-time and part-time positions. Work2Earn will also include short-term gigs, including testing the beta version of new blockchain games in return &nbsp;for MCADE token rewards.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Can MCADE reach $1 in 2023?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The MCADE token has recently completed its presale and launched on leading digital asset exchanges, including UniSwap and BitMart. It has extensive utility on the Metacade platform and deflationary tokenomics, which could push its price up substantially over the coming years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 2023 price prediction for <a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=48" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> places the token at the $0.30 price level. This could be a whopping 50% gain from the end of the presale. Heading into the next bull market, experts are forecasting continued gains for MCADE, which could climb to $2 by 2025.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade vs. Shiba Inu price prediction: Which token is worth buying?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Both projects look set to make gains over the coming years. However, Metacade is a brand-new project which will enter price discovery during the next crypto bull market. This makes it an ideal choice for early-stage investors. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu price prediction continues to underwhelm, and it may struggle to overcome Dogecoin before 2025.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More information about Metacade is available on the project&rsquo;s website, and the native token can now be traded on the digital asset exchanges, Uniswap and Bitmart, with a listing on MEXC soon.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Other than the testnet, Venom has also released multiple decentralized applications (dApps) developed in-house as part of the L1&rsquo;s growing ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We&rsquo;re excited to announce the launch of Venom&rsquo;s public testnet, a crucial step towards our upcoming mainnet launch. With our highly scalable and reliable asynchronous blockchain, we&rsquo;re confident that developers will be able to build innovative dApps, while users will be able to experience them firsthand</em>,&rdquo; Peter Knez, the Chair of the Venom Foundation Council, said in a press release.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Users can test various dApps</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With the launch of the testnet, both ecosystem users and developers on the Venom network can now proceed to test and debug various protocols and dApps.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To access the testnet, users have to first download the Venom Wallet &ndash; which is available on mobile (in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store) and desktop as a Chrome extension. Once they claim a free <a href="https://venom.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">testnet allocation</a>, developers and other ecosystem users can begin to test-strain the network.</p>
<p dir="ltr">dApps that users on the Venom testnet can look to experience include Venom Wallet, Venom Scan, VenomPools, Venom Bridge, Venom Stake, Web3.World, WeUp, NFT Mint and Oasis.Gallery.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Venom Foundation says the program should boost community building and further innovation within the ecosystem.</p>
