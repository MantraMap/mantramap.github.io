tag: NewsBTC

Solana has been on a freefall since the collapse of FTX and has not been able to move upwards because of the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) surrounding the ecosystem and its connections with the former crypto exchange. According to recent news, Solanaâ€™s native token SOL has dropped 51.14% since the day FTX fell from grace.Â  Solana: Dead Or Not Dead?Â  The current situation might be confusing to investors. Based on data by CoinGeko, the token shot up by 5.4% in the past 24 hours which might be a signal that investor sentiment is reversing. However, the FUD still remains strong around the ecosystem itself.Â  Messari released an overview of the ecosystem back on December 15. The basic gist of the overview was that Solana is still a solid ecosystem even after the collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange. However, recent Santiment insight on the ecosystem shows that it might be already dead.Â  The most notable on-chain development for the token was the significant drop in developer activity despite a lot of projects being developed on the ecosystem. Although it is difficult to say whether Solana as a whole is dead or near it, it is easier to say that the ecosystem is struggling to keep itself afloat because of its close ties with FTX.Â  Image: Coincu News What This Means For Holders Of SOL The crypto community seems to be very bearish at the moment considering what transpired in the past weeks courtesy of some major macroeconomics news, including the spate of job cuts and bankruptcies by big crypto firms. Those who are bullish for the ecosystem point to ETHâ€™s crash back in 2018 and how SOLâ€™s movement mimics this.Â  For everyone that sold #ETH in 2018 for 88 USD and for everyone who is selling $SOL sub 10 USD!
