<p>On January 16, <strong>Korbit</strong> announced that it would also monitor the exchange accounts of executives and employees&#8217; families to strengthen internal control standards.</p>



<p><strong>Oh Se-jin</strong>, CEO of Korbit, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The implementation of monitoring the family accounts of our employees is part of our efforts to raise Korbit&#8217;s internal control standards to the level of traditional financial institutions.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the <strong>Enforcement Decree of the Specified Financial Information Act (Special Act)</strong>, executives and employees of virtual asset exchanges <strong>cannot trade virtual assets on the exchange they are working for</strong>. However, <strong>the law does not apply to the family members of executives and employees.</strong></p>

<p>In response, Korbit decided to control the accounts of employees&#8217; families, including brothers and sisters, to strengthen internal control, even though <strong>it is not mandatory</strong>. In the future, family members of the company executives and employees must report their accounts to Korbit.</p>



<p>In addition, the exchange has strengthened overall internal control standards, such as the prohibition of unfair trade and conflicts of interest. Reflecting on this, the <strong>Code of Ethics </strong>was revised, and employees pledged to abide by it.</p>



<p>Previously, <strong>Dunamu</strong>, the South Korean company that runs the <strong>Upbit</strong> <strong>exchange</strong>, also <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147505-upbit-parent-company-prevents-staff-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prohibited</a> family members of its executives and employees from trading cryptocurrencies in <strong>August</strong>. </p>



<p>The measure, according to the company, is being implemented as part of an effort to promote ethical management in the crypto industry. To fulfill its social responsibility, <strong>Dunamu</strong> expanded the ban to include the families of its executives and employees, which was previously limited to its staff and employees.</p>

<p>Solana experienced its biggest trading volume since the week of FTX&#8217;s stunning collapse, which rocked Solana and the rest of the crypto market in November.</p>



<p>Solana has made an incredible comeback. <strong>SOL was ending out the year down 94% less than a month ago</strong>, hitting a two-year low of $8.17 and sliding out of the top twenty currencies, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinmarektcap </a>statistics.</p>



<p><strong>Solana has now momentarily pushed Polygon MATIC out of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization</strong>, which reached $9 million on Saturday afternoon. Its price has also reached a new high since FTX collapsed. </p>

<p>It can be seen clearly that BONK, a Solana-based meme token, sparked a flurry of excitement around Christmas and pushed the price of SOL to a seven-day high at the turn of the year, boosting Solana&#8217;s recent run of positive news. Coin collectors appeared to be excited about a new dog-themed entry into the market, joining Dogecoin (DOGE) and the Ethereum-based currency Shiba Inu (SHIB).</p>



<p>As Coincu reported, BONK had a 1000% increase in the first week of the year. While a subsequent five-trillion token burn could not maintain BONK on an upward trend, with its price falling 69% last week, <strong>it still has a market valuation of $60 million</strong>. In fact, its value has increased by <strong>27.1%</strong> in the last 24 hours, pricing at <strong>$0.0000014</strong>.</p>

<p>According to the on-chain sleuth <strong>ZachXBT</strong>, one transaction was confirmed by <strong>Lazarus Group</strong> with a transaction amount of up to <strong>$63.5 million (~41000 ETH)</strong>. The stolen funds were transferred from the <strong>Harmony</strong> <strong>bridge</strong> <strong>hack</strong> through <strong>Railgun</strong> before consolidating funds and depositing them on three different exchanges. </p>

<p>Previously, in June, Harmony&#8217;s Horizon cross-chain bridge was <a href="https://news.coincu.com/101875-harmonys-horizon-bridge-hacked-181m-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> to have been hacked by hackers, with initial damage estimated at up to<strong> $100 million</strong>. Horizon asserts that the attacker has <strong>only penetrated the bridge to Ethereum</strong> while the <strong>bridge to Bitcoin is still safe. </strong></p>



<p>Despite this, the project suspended Horizon to investigate the vulnerability, as well as notify exchanges to prevent hackers from laundering money. Because of many defects in the working mechanism, Ethereum founder<strong> Vitalik Buterin</strong> once said that cross-chain solutions should not be trusted.</p>

<p>After much tracking information about the stolen funds, sources <a href="https://news.coincu.com/104240-lazarus-group-behind-100m-theft-harmony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">identified</a> <strong>Lazarus Group</strong> as the organization behind the hack. Mixers such as <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160951-can-tornado-cash-save-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tornado Cash</a> are used to hide the transaction trail.</p>



<p>The team behind the Harmony blockchain project has <a href="https://news.coincu.com/112391-harmony-community-strongly-opposes-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposed</a> the minting of up to <strong>4.97 billion </strong>worth of its native token <strong>ONE</strong> to compensate victims of the hack. The proposal has been met with a significant amount of backlash from members of the community, with many highlighting concerns that such a large issuance of new tokens would result in inflationary pressure on the asset and bring its value down.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">OFAC targets Tornado Cash</h2>



<p>Since its launching in <strong>August 2019</strong>, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/145402-tornado-cash-developer-sentenced-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tornado Cash</a> has mingled over<strong> $7.6 billion</strong> worth of ether. It can be a workable solution for users who have a valid need for financial privacy, such as those who want to donate to political causes without disclosing their donation amounts or those who want to keep their wealth information private. However, cybercriminals looking to launder money find it appealing as well.</p>



<p>In particular, Tornado Cash&#8217;s role in the laundering of over. <strong>$455 million</strong> in cryptocurrency taken from<strong> Axie Infinity&#8217;s Ronin Bridge</strong> protocol by the. <strong>Lazarus Group </strong>hacking group, as well as its receipt of funds taken from<strong> Harmony Bridge</strong> and. <strong>Nomad Bridge</strong> in June and August of this year, were highlighted in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/140716-us-treasury-designate-tornado-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treasury</a>&#8216;s press release announcing the sanctions against the crypto mixer. The <strong>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea</strong> has been one of its main beneficiaries since. <strong>2019</strong>, with roughly<strong> 30% </strong>of the monies sent through it being linked to illegal entities.</p>



<p>Since <strong>OFAC</strong> announced sanctions against <strong>Tornado Cash</strong> in <strong>August</strong>, some middleware providers that provide services for Tornado Cash, such as Infura and Alchemy, have also been scrutinized, resulting in users being unable to access their assets normally, and can only complete the interaction by manually setting the node configuration of the wallet, but there is a threshold for such manual configuration, which severely limits the number of Tornado Cash users. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-985.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="764" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-985-1024x764.png" alt="Can Tornado Cash &quot;Save Itself&quot; After 4 Months Of Santraction?" class="wp-image-160958" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-985-1024x764.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-985-300x224.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-985-768x573.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-985-750x559.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-985-1140x850.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-985.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Can Tornado Cash &quot;Save Itself&quot; After 4 Months Of Santraction? 26"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">      </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In addition, the official website of Tornado Cash has also been offline. Users who want to access the website now need to use the method of direct access based on the <strong>IPFS</strong> <strong>protocol</strong>. Ordinary users who do not understand the technology are likely to give up using it.</p>



<p>Along with Tornado Cash, OFAC sanctions also include all Tornado Cash developers and code contributors. Tornado Cash’s GitHub has been deleted, Tornado Cash developer <strong>Alexey Pertsev</strong> <strong>has been jailed</strong>, and <strong>founder</strong> <strong>Roman Semenov’s GitHub account has been deactivated</strong>. Therefore, while users still have access to Tornado Cash, they cannot make code updates to it, nor can new developments be made. Deposit addresses, routing addresses, proxy addresses, and more are among the Tornado Cash addresses that OFAC listed in the designation.</p>



<p>Moreover, OFAC has also made it clear that all applications similar to Tornado Cash will be sanctioned by the United States, which undoubtedly extinguishes the enthusiasm of most engineers to develop privacy protocols and inevitably makes people worry about the future of privacy applications.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does the platform &#8220;save&#8221; itself?</h2>



<p>Before the sanctions, Tornado Cash used to be a central hub for crypto mixing services with great liquidity. However, weekly deposits and withdrawals to the protocol have both <strong>fallen by more than 90%</strong> since the sanctions were imposed.</p>

<p>It can be said that the current Tornado Cash is at a watershed. Whether to<strong> take legal risks to continue development</strong> or to <strong>&#8220;stay&#8221; for the time being, </strong>is a multiple-choice question that the Tornado Cash community is facing.</p>



<p>Recently, <strong>gozzy</strong>, a member of the Tornado Cash community, initiated a proposal, saying that he will assume the responsibility for the subsequent development of Tornado and continue to maintain related components of Tornado to promote community building and product development. But given gozzy&#8217;s lack of assistance at hand, the complexity of Tornado&#8217;s technology, and the high likelihood of legal risk. </p>



<p><strong>gozzy</strong> expects the community to pay him a base salary of <strong>$240,000 per year</strong>, which will be distributed at a rate of about <strong>$60,000 per quarter</strong> through the Sablier stream. The community also needs to publish a proposal every quarter to decide how much salary will be paid in the next quarter. In addition to salary information, <strong>gozzy</strong> also listed his work experience and the responsibilities he will assume. After three days of community voting, with <strong>81% support</strong>, the proposal was finally passed.</p>



<p>The day after the proposal was passed, <strong>gozzy</strong> began to update how users log in to the website using <strong>ENS</strong> and <strong>IPFS</strong> resolvers and released part of the Tornado Cash roadmap. As can be seen from the roadmap, gozzy&#8217;s current priority is to restore Tornado Cash&#8217;s front-end and repeater connections.</p>

<p>Judging from the current feedback, the community is generally optimistic about gozzy&#8217;s proposal. <strong>gozzy</strong> seems to be very interested in anonymous transfers and privacy security. He once built a censorship-resistant <strong>eth.limo</strong> (a privacy-preserving ENS gateway) replacement that can start a Tor hidden service for each ENS domain name pointing to IPFS content. </p>



<p>That is a website that protects user privacy. It’s all some pretty hardcore engineering and privacy technology that has helped <strong>Firn Protocol</strong>, an anonymous payment protocol, whose users can now use the protocol without censorship. This technology is also considered by the community to be beneficial to the entire Ethereum community.</p>



<p>In fact, this is not the first time the Tornado Cash community has rescued itself. Not long after Tornado was sanctioned, some community members suggested forking Tornado Cash and using the code of the protocol to create other variants of the service to further decentralize the privacy of users when using encrypted currency mixing services. However, this alternative version of the agreement has no way to improve liquidity, and it also cannot solve the risk of being sanctioned, so it is nothing.</p>



<p>Prior to this, an active participant in the Tornado DAO also put forward a proposal titled<strong> “Saving Tornado Cash: Formally Challenging the US Treasury&#8217;s Sanctions.&#8221;</strong> The proposal recommends that Tornado DAO raise funds on behalf of Tornado Cash and hire a legal team to fight the sanctions. It also calls on Tornado DAO to launch a legal challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. But in the end, because it was <strong>&#8220;unable to compete with the United States&#8221; and the contributors were afraid of being sued and failing,</strong> the Tornado DAO was closed to protect the safety of community members.</p>

<p>It can be seen that the first two self-rescue results of Tornado Cash were not satisfactory. Although the adoption of this proposal has received strong support from the community, developers will still face sanctions and severe legal uncertainties. Will <strong>Tornado DAO</strong> continue to operate in accordance with the wishes of the community? This will be the next big challenge for <strong>gozzy</strong> and the entire Tornado Cash community.</p>

<p>The public blockchain <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160887-cardano-vs-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano (ADA</a>) uses the <strong>Proof-of-Stake</strong> algorithm known as <strong>Ouroboros</strong>. <strong>75% </strong>of the <strong>45 billion total tokens</strong> are already in circulation. One of the key rivals of <strong>Ethereum, Tron,</strong> and <strong>Polkadot</strong> is the project. The developers would make an effort to attract new users by scaling and consuming little energy in comparison to <strong>Bitcoin</strong> for cryptocurrency mining.</p>



<p>In the past year, the Cardano network saw a number of significant upgrades that could eventually increase the value of their native token. The size of each block will expand by <strong>8KB</strong>, and the overall volume will climb to <strong>80KB</strong>, giving the blockchain greater bandwidth. A proposal to raise the <strong>Plutus</strong> <strong>Script</strong> (a platform for Cardano-based smart contracts) memory capacity per transaction was also mentioned.</p>



<p>According to the company&#8217;s announcement, this modification is a part of the developers&#8217; strategy for network optimization. <strong>Cardano</strong> is awaiting several stages of development and scaling up that will result in an increase in demand.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Cardano&#8217;s potential pieces</h2>



<h3><strong>SundaeSwap exchange</strong></h3>



<p>Early in 2022, <strong>Cardano</strong> revealed a decentralized exchange built on its own blockchain. The action was taken to give the network liquidity. Problems started to arise right away, and users started to protest loudly about the lengthy transaction processing. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-980.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="611" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-980-1024x611.png" alt="What Makes Cardano Blockchain Stronger In 2023" class="wp-image-160947" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-980-1024x611.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-980-300x179.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-980-768x458.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-980-750x448.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-980-1140x680.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-980.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="What Makes Cardano Blockchain Stronger In 2023 33"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The developers reacted by saying that while processing every purchase could take many days, they assured that every transaction would be carried out in the order that it was received. The team added that this was only a temporary situation that would soon be remedied. They themselves expected that after the protocol was implemented, there would be more work.</p>



<h3><strong>Vasil Hard Fork</strong></h3>



<p>A hard fork on the <strong>Cardano</strong> <strong>Vasil</strong> network occurred on <strong>September 22, 2022</strong>. The community claims that this event is the most complicated update ever to be implemented for <strong>Cardano</strong>. It should increase bandwidth while reducing the development costs of decentralized apps by around <strong>30%</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-979.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-979-1024x683.png" alt="What Makes Cardano Blockchain Stronger In 2023" class="wp-image-160946" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-979-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-979-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-979-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-979-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-979-1140x760.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-979.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="What Makes Cardano Blockchain Stronger In 2023 34"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">  </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Although analysts and developers agree that the hardfork does not bring about any significant improvements, there are potential and excellent prospects for the project. <strong>Basho &#8211; Epoch 4 blockchain development </strong>will therefore focus on network scaling. The blockchain will no longer be under the jurisdiction of <strong>Input Output </strong>when the <strong>Voltaire</strong> <strong>period</strong> (the last stage) arrives. This is because the network will be a self-sustaining system.</p>



<p>By the end of 2023, <strong>Voltaire</strong> will be available for purchase, marking the completion of the original roadmap.</p>



<h3><strong>The structure of government institutions</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Charles Hoskinson</strong>, the creator of the blockchain, thinks that his innovation can fundamentally alter the structure of governmental institutions by giving them a new way to operate in place of antiquated ones.</p>



<p>The network&#8217;s creator asserted at <strong>The Crypto Mile </strong>conference that his network might enhance world governance. The technology, for instance, can be used to develop a tax revenue scheme; since the code is open, everyone will be able to view the goals and sources of the funding.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-978.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="506" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-978.png" alt="What Makes Cardano Blockchain Stronger In 2023" class="wp-image-160945" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-978.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-978-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-978-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-978-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="What Makes Cardano Blockchain Stronger In 2023 35"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Blockchain will enhance connectedness as society becomes more internationalized, ensuring the safe, easy, and quick movement of information. A key component of increasing public accessibility is transparency, which the Cardano blockchain can help to increase.</p>



<p>Autonomy would make it easier to get rid of one central authority. <strong>Hoskinson</strong> thinks it is the most effective way to run any organization and get rid of fraud and waste if no one entity can handle the matter.</p>



<h3><strong>Community</strong></h3>



<p>The goal of the entire project community is to make money for its users. <strong>Input Output Hong Kong</strong> and <strong>Emurgo</strong> provided support to the <strong>Cardano Foundation</strong>. The texturing is handled by <strong>IOHK</strong>, and the commercial implementation is handled by <strong>Emurgo</strong>. They are in charge of changing the <strong>Cardano</strong> ecosystem collectively. Before the product is released to the general public, the portfolio is continuously examined and thoroughly verified by expert employees.</p>



<p>The partnership between <strong>Cardano</strong> and <strong>Emurgo</strong> aims to encourage the development of a decentralized application&#8217;s tool stack over the entire blockchain. By enhancing their own skills for Cardano solutions, creators will be able to contribute to the creation of flexible apps.</p>



<p>The community actively shares information about the native token and creates a legacy. Cardano differs from other projects because the currency has distinct goals and techniques.</p>



<p><strong>Frederic Gregaard</strong>, CEO of Cardano Foundation, believes that Cardano Foundation has the committed talent to advance the project in 2023. He believes that the project will experience a lot of beneficial developments in the future.</p>



<h3><strong>Environmental protection</strong></h3>



<p>In February 2022, Cardano entered into a relationship with <strong>Veritree</strong>, a business that aims to gain from forests by repairing them. One million trees were planted at that time. The main idea behind this collaboration is that everyone who has an ADA token can donate money through the Cardano network to help the environment. Users who contributed one million coins received certificates for planting trees in return. The document contains information regarding the plant&#8217;s location and specifics.</p>



<p><strong>Veritree</strong> can easily collect and communicate the geolocation, photographs, and other special data required for reforestation thanks to Cardano&#8217;s onchain metadata. Accessible, traceable, and permanent information is all available. It is unchangeable.</p>



<h3><strong>Scaling the blockchain</strong></h3>



<p>The network&#8217;s performance is <strong>250 transactions per second (TPS)</strong>, which is much less than that of other well-known blockchains.</p>



<p>Developers are aware of this issue, and the IOHK data offers numerous methods for speeding things up:</p>



<ul>
<li>The method&#8217;s pipeline processing and integration with the Ouroboros consensus algorithm. The method allows for faster recognition of new blocks. The goal of the developers is to increase the distribution speed to <strong>5 seconds</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Provide endorsers.</strong> By regulating new transactions with their allocation and collection into blocks, their entrance into the protocol will speed things up. The objective is to build two blocks (for transactions and consensus achievement).</li>



<li><strong>Multi-level pricing</strong>. Rather than using prioritizing at this time, all transactions are done on a first-come, first-served basis. The network will operate slowly as the load increases, and <strong>DoS</strong> <strong>attacks</strong> may occur. By adjusting how commissions are formed, the new principle&#8217;s application will assist the ecosystem as a whole is becoming more flexible. Fair, balanced, and immediate levels will all be present in each block.</li>



<li>The project has a functioning alpha version already, and a full blockchain deployment of them may happen in 2023.</li>



<li>Enables the use of additional channels to conduct transactions utilizing the main network&#8217;s smart contracts outside of the blockchain.</li>
</ul>

<p>The project&#8217;s major objective is to improve the effectiveness of information synchronization amongst software working in the ecosystem. It was first suggested in 2021. This will speed up the process of validating messages with quick multi-signature aggregation.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Promising progress in 2023</h2>



<p>Additionally, Cardano has resumed testing its <strong>Djed</strong> <strong>stablecoin</strong> with updated capabilities, and figures provided by <strong>Cardano Blockchain Insights</strong> show a sharp rise in the number of<strong> Plutus Scripts</strong>.</p>



<p>The organization&#8217;s new privacy-focused blockchain, <strong>Midnight</strong>, is being developed by Cardano inventor Charles Hoskinson, and it intends to address the problem of smart contracts&#8217; confidentiality by developing a confidentiality architecture.</p>

<p>Cardano has rapidly increased the number of new cryptocurrency wallets despite a difficult year for pricing, adding more than 22,000 new staking addresses each month for 13 months.</p>



<p>Although the technical forecast for the 1-week gauges is bleak, traders may be more optimistic in the long run if they take into account how the network is growing. In fact, for more than a year, Cardano has added more than<strong> 20,000 new staking addresses on average each month.</strong></p>



<p>Furthermore, Cardano&#8217;s wallet growth increased and added 30,000 wallets in a week despite FTX&#8217;s demise. Additionally, the number of Cardano-based smart contracts increased by over<strong> 300% </strong>and surpassed<strong> 4,000</strong> for the first time.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Cardano wasn&#8217;t the only solution to outperform <strong>Ethereum</strong>, particularly when it came to implementing <strong>PoS</strong>. This factor enables a significant speedup in transaction processing. The ecosystem expands and has a strong team with hundreds of members, funding, and other essential elements.</p>



<p>Although Cardano&#8217;s intrinsic growth is well known, the value of its underlying asset, <strong>ADA</strong>, has remained the same. However, there are typically significant relationships between the performance of asset values and holders&#8217; network activity.</p>



<p>If the market transitions into a bull market, 2023 might be a banner year for <strong>Cardano</strong>, with additional upgrades to the gaps.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What Is Cardano?</h2>



<p>Cardano is a decentralized <strong><strong>Proof-of-Stake</strong> (PoS)</strong> blockchain was created as a more effective substitute for<strong> <strong>Proof-of-Work</strong> (PoW) </strong>networks.</p>



<p>In honor of <strong>Augusta Ada King,</strong> <strong>Countess of Lovelace (1815–1852)</strong>, widely regarded as the first computer programmer, Cardano&#8217;s cryptocurrency is called <strong>ADA</strong>. The blockchain&#8217;s PoS consensus algorithm uses <strong>ADA</strong>. It is awarded to users who take part in a stake pool as compensation for their contributions to the blockchain.</p>



<p>Cardano was developed by <strong>Charles Hoskinson</strong>, an Ethereum co-founder, in 2015, and the platform was released in <strong>2017</strong>.</p>



<p>The Cardano ecosystem was created by academic and engineering experts with extensive blockchain and cryptography knowledge. <strong>Cardano</strong> is a multi-layer blockchain that uses <strong>Proof-of-Stake</strong> to validate transactions and was founded by the co-founder of <strong>Ethereum</strong>. The <strong>Ouroboros</strong> algorithm, which aims for a high level of security with efficiency, is the heart of the Cardano consensus.</p>

<p>Cardano has established itself as an Ethereum substitute. Both platforms aim to create a connected, decentralized system and are utilized for similar applications like smart contracts.</p>



<p>Comparing its<strong> &#8220;third-generation&#8221; platform</strong> to<strong> Ethereum&#8217;s &#8220;second-generation&#8221; label</strong>, Cardano sees itself as an upgraded version of the latter. The blockchain platform aims to offer banking services to unbanked people worldwide.</p>



<p>After <strong>Bitcoin</strong> and <strong>Ethereum</strong>, it is a third-generation blockchain that emphasizes scalability, interoperability, and sustainability. Cardano also emphasizes rising expenses, energy use, and transaction times.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Bitcoin?</h2>



<p>The first crypto token that allowed the globe to access the crypto ecosystem was Bitcoin, which was originally introduced to the world in 2009 by the mysterious <a href="https://news.coincu.com/111327-15-theories-about-satoshi-nakamoto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>. The two most intriguing features that Bitcoin brought to the table were designed to make peer-to-peer transactions possible without the use of a third party.</p>



<p>Briefly stated, Bitcoin is a <strong>peer-to-peer (P2P)</strong> online currency that enables transactions to be carried out directly between two identical and independent network users without the involvement of a third party. According to Nakamoto, the purpose of Bitcoin was to make it easier for two people to transact online without the need for a drawn-out and arduous process involving a financial institution.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-972.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-972.png" alt="Cardano vs. Bitcoin: Which Network Has The Advantage And Potential To Be Stronger?" class="wp-image-160935" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-972.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-972-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-972-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-972-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Cardano vs. Bitcoin: Which Network Has The Advantage And Potential To Be Stronger? 42"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">  </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>With the aid of Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet software, users broadcast messages that are cryptographically signed to the network. These messages contain proposed transactions and ledger updates. The whole transaction history of the ledger is replicated on each node. A transaction is disregarded if it disobeys the Bitcoin protocol. Only when the entire network concurs do transactions take place. Each node on the network checks the outcomes of a proof-of-work activity called mining to reach this &#8220;full network consensus.&#8221;</p>



<p>The process of mining generates a hash code that complies with the specifications of the Bitcoin protocol and bundles groups of transactions into blocks. This hash needs expensive energy to generate, yet a network node may check the hash&#8217;s validity with a very small amount of energy. The block and the ledger updates it contains are added to the blockchain if a miner submits a legitimate block proposal to the network, at which point the network moves on to the next batch of unprocessed transactions. In the event of a disagreement, the longest chain is taken into account. On average, a new block is made every ten minutes.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What makes Bitcoin and Cardano different?</h2>



<p>Without employing expensive or powerful computers and mining rigs, users can mine <strong>Cardano</strong> using the Proof-of-Stake method. To receive rewards, miners must have a stake in the Cardano blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>Due to the Proof-of-Work algorithm used by Bitcoin, users must be actively mining the currency. The miner who contributes the highest proportion of mining power has a higher chance of winning the mining rewards, which are distributed at random to all miners. Participants must spend more on processing power and energy to mine Bitcoin because to its difficult and competitive mining process. In contrast, despite Cardano&#8217;s lower value, it is frequently more economical for miners.</p>



<p>In terms of transaction times, the enormous demand for Bitcoin makes transactions take longer to complete. Verification of some transactions can take up to an hour. Bitcoin is a highly trafficked blockchain with an average daily volume of <strong>$50 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>Compared to Bitcoin, Cardano is less well acknowledged and known. However, with a <strong>$6 billion</strong> <strong>daily</strong> <strong>volume</strong>, activity is relatively high. Cardano transactions may frequently be validated in under a minute.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Carnado or Bitcoin?</h2>



<h3><strong>The potential of Cardano</strong></h3>



<p>Due to the fact that it is a <strong>Proof-of-Stake</strong> cryptocurrency, <strong>Cardano</strong> employs a unique method for token generation. To distribute incentives to miners, it makes use of the Ouroboros consensus system. In this configuration, the platform selects the slot leaders. During each slot, the leaders will validate blocks for the chain. Each stage of Cardano requires a small number of slot leaders, thus using more potent or expensive elements is not as necessary.</p>



<p>Cardano likewise has a two-layer development process. The <strong>ADA</strong> token is used as a cryptocurrency at the first layer, much like how individuals use Bitcoin. People can trade assets via smart contracts and decentralized apps, or <strong>dApps</strong>, in the second layer. Through <strong>Cardano</strong>, users have more discretion over how they can manage various assets and payments. The smart contract technology also guarantees that parties will only carry out their obligations when all of the conditions outlined in the contract are satisfied.</p>



<h3><strong>The potential of Bitcoin</strong></h3>



<p>Bitcoin is the gold standard when it comes to cryptocurrencies, as it has been in operation since <strong>2009</strong>. Bitcoin is a Proof-of-Work currency that focuses on the transfer of funds. People can use Bitcoin to pay for many items online. The design of Bitcoin ensures it can work anywhere.</p>



<p>The main selling point of Bitcoin is its <strong>decentralized design</strong>. Instead of going through a central bank, Bitcoin is run by many nodes that link to a blockchain network. The nodes will confirm transactions worldwide. The network is always open, and it can handle transfers of all sizes. The design ensures people can move funds to anyone without worrying about exchanges or other physical barriers for work.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is a speculative currency, as only <strong>21 million tokens will be mined within its lifespan</strong>. The rewards people receive when mining Bitcoin will also drop over time, potentially boosting its value after a while.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p><strong>Cardano</strong> has advantages to be able to outperform other networks, but comparing to <strong>Bitcoin</strong> is still a long way off. However, with the integration of new innovations, the blockchain is confident to become one of the leading networks today.</p>

<p>The two largest meme coins in market capitalization attempt to outpace a new Solana-based challenger.</p>



<p>Bonk has had a spectacular ride since its inception late last month,<strong> rising nearly 800% since then</strong>. However, when Bitcoin and the larger market began to recover, <strong>BONK fell 56%</strong>, from a seven-day <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157828-bonk-soars-up-1000/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/157828-bonk-soars-up-1000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high </a>of <strong>$0.000002</strong> on January 8th to a low of <strong>$0.00000088</strong> on January 13th.

<p>Especially since the successful The Merge in September 2022, Ethereum is predicted to have great developments in the coming years. As early as 2023, the network will update the Shanghai upgrade. After the upgrade, it will make it possible for investors to cancel staking ETH. As such, <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/160712-ethereum-will-have-achievements-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitwise</a> has predicted the volume of ETH staking could increase by at least 50%</strong>.</p>



<p>In this post, we will explain to you what ETH staking is, how to stake ETH, and what staking platforms are available.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>What is ETH staking?</strong></h2>



<p>Staking is the act of holding and locking a certain amount of coins in order to receive rewards from them. These coins can be locked in the wallet or nodes of a Blockchain project for a period of time. The reward will be based on the user&#8217;s effort, including: stake amount and stake duration.</p>



<p>Proof of Stake is the consensus algorithm in Blockchain. In it, participants will stake their coins (staking coins) into the Blockchain network to validate transactions and generate new blocks. Rewards (including block rewards and transaction fees) will be given to PoS participants as an incentive for their contributions.</p>



<p>After The Merge, <strong>you stake ETH and get extra ETH to validate transactions on the blockchain</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Binding when ETH Staking </strong></h2>



<p>As we all know, the birth of ETH 2.0 will convert to using PoS consensus algorithm instead of PoW as before. To get started with PoS, users need to staking ETH on the network to gain the right to become validators. However, depending on the form you join, there will be different requirements. But in general, it is easy to see that there are two main factors that you should pay attention to.</p>



<h3><strong>Lock the amount of participating ETH</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-958.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="562" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-958.png" alt="ETH Staking: All You Should Know Before It Breaking " class="wp-image-160911" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-958.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-958-300x165.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-958-768x422.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-958-750x412.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ETH Staking: All You Should Know Before It Breaking 54"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Staking ETH will lock ETH from 1-2 years. It is common sense that ETH staking can happen at any time. And of course, when you no longer need to participate, you can withdraw as you please. However, in this Phase 0, your ETH will be &#8220;locked up&#8221; until at least the end of Phase 1.5. Simply put, you will have almost nothing to do with the amount of ETH participating in the ETH staking during that time.</p>



<p>Although you still receive interest as well as transaction validation fees, etc. during that time, it is not without risk. What I want to talk about here is the issue of Ether price fluctuations. What if it suddenly increases in price and you want to take profits? Or it suddenly fell deeply and you want to cut your losses? There&#8217;s definitely nothing you can do about it.</p>



<p><strong>Think of it as a savings. And after 1-2 years you can take it out</strong>. At that time, the price increase or decrease will depend on the market. So if you intend to ETH staking in the short term, make sure you think carefully about this issue.</p>



<h3><strong>Validator activity on the network</strong></h3>



<p>You must have heard many stories of you staking ETH on the network and getting rewards. But the interesting thing is that if you don&#8217;t perform well, you also have to pay a penalty from the network. This is mainly to eliminate validators who are against the network or participate in a superficial way that makes the network not work as expected.</p>



<p>Participating in staking ETH, the validator may be penalized if it is against the network. There are two things that you need to keep in mind when you want to become a validator of the network. Specifically:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>You may get a slash for a number of reasons such as Attestation Violation, Proposer Violation:</strong> As a result, not only do not receive income for the day, but also have money deducted. If the condition persists, you may be forced out of the network.</li>



<li><strong>You may be penalized for being offline:</strong> Being a validator means you have to be online all the time to keep the network up and running. However, in case you are not able to go offline often, you will also incur a small penalty. It will directly affect the amount of daily profit you get. The higher the level of offline commitment, the greater the profit, and vice versa. For example if same amount 32 ETH, if online time is 100%, validator can get $12.22/day. But if it&#8217;s only 50%, you&#8217;ll even be charged.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, you do not need to worry too much about this. There is still a way for you to participate in staking ETH 2.0 without the penalty mentioned above. For details on this, please refer to the risk reduction section in this article.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>How to stake ETH?</strong></h2>



<p>You have several options when it comes to ETH staking.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Staking on your own:&nbsp;</strong>You need at least 32 ETH to activate Ethereum validator software. That ETH will be locked up until withdrawals are enabled with Ethereum’s Shanghai update (expected in 2023). You’ll also need a dedicated computer with a 24/7 internet connection and some technical skills.</li>



<li><strong>Staking as a service:&nbsp;</strong>You still need 32 ETH but the staking service will take care of running the validator node. Some of the services even let you use your own keys.</li>



<li><strong>Pooled liquid staking:&nbsp;</strong>You can stake any amount in the staking pool. The pool operator runs validators and distributes staking rewards proportional to everybody’s contribution. Some of the staking pools issue ‘liquid’ tokens that represent your staked ETH.</li>
</ul>



<p>For any active Web3 user, pooled liquid staking is arguably the most interesting option because it gives the greatest flexibility.</p>



<p>You can sell these tokens and effectively exit staking. Or you can use these liquid tokens in DeFi: to provide liquidity on DEXes, earn with Yearn vaults, deposit on Aave, and more. Alternatively, you can use these liquid tokens as collateral and borrow other tokens.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Where can you staking ETH?</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Lido</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-959.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="500" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-959.png" alt="ETH Staking: All You Should Know Before It Breaking " class="wp-image-160912" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-959.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-959-300x188.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-959-768x480.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-959-750x469.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="ETH Staking: All You Should Know Before It Breaking 55"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Lido is a set of staking protocols on several networks, most important on Ethereum.</p>



<p>When you deposit ETH into Lido&#8217;s smart contract, you get stETH, an ERC-20 token that represents your staked ETH, rewards, and any penalties. This token is freely transferable and you can use it in any DeFi application. Besides, ETH you can also stake MATIC with Lido.</p>



<p>Lido applies a<strong> 10% fee on all rewards</strong>. The fee is split between the node operators, the Lido DAO, and a coverage fund for any slashings. <strong>Volume of staked ETH is about 4,600,000. Rewards will be accumulated in liquidity tokens.</strong></p>



<p>Lido relies on a curated list of node operators, which includes mostly large operators. <strong>stETH is by far the largest liquid-staked ETH token</strong>. It&#8217;s widely used in DeFi applications.</p>



<h3><strong>Rocket Pool</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-960.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="517" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-960.png" alt="ETH Staking: All You Should Know Before It Breaking " class="wp-image-160913" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-960.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-960-300x194.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-960-768x496.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-960-750x485.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="ETH Staking: All You Should Know Before It Breaking 56"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Unlike Lido, Rocket Pool lets anyone to run a validator.</p>



<p>Instead of providing 32 ETH, a validator with Rocket Pool needs 16 ETH and 16 ETH worth of RPL, the Rocket Pool token. Besides earning a yield on their own ETH, validators also earn commissions and rewards in RPL. This leads to a higher yield than staking solo.</p>



<p>The rest of the required ETH comes from liquid stakers. Like with Lido, you can stake any amount of ETH and get a liquid staked rETH token.</p>



<p>Rocket Pool charges a <strong>fee of 5-20%</strong>, which is set by the protocol and goes to validators. <strong>Volume of staked ETH is about 360,000. Rewards will be accumulated in the liquid token.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>StakeWise</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-961.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-961-1024x576.png" alt="ETH Staking: All You Should Know Before It Breaking " class="wp-image-160914" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-961-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-961-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-961-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-961-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-961-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-961.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ETH Staking: All You Should Know Before It Breaking 57"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>StakeWise is a pool where anyone can apply to become a node operator.</p>



<p>You can deposit any amount of ETH with<strong> StakeWise and get 1:1 sETH2</strong>, the protocol’s liquid-staked ETH token.</p>



<p>Unlike in other protocols, the staking rewards accumulate in a separate token, rETH2. The two tokens make it easier to calculate your rewards. You can also reinvest the rewards by selling them for more sETH. Both tokens can be supplied in Uniswap pools to farm SWISE, the platform&#8217;s governance token.</p>



<p>StakeWise charges a<strong> fee of 10%</strong>, which is split between the protocol and node operators. <strong>Volume of staked ETH is about 83,000. Rewards will be accumulated in a separate liquid token.</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Notes when participating in ETH staking service</strong></h2>



<p>Firstly, you should choose a reputable staking service: Participating in staking ETH 2.0 in this form is your assignment of your money to others. So choose a reputable partner that is well-reviewed. There are many services of this type open in the market. Do not be greedy for high profits but ignore the risk factor it brings. However, we recommend choosing service providers as suggested by Ethereum&#8217;s own baconcha platform.</p>



<p>Second, the investment should be evenly distributed: There is no guarantee of absolute safety at all times. So, to limit your risk, you can split your investment among many staking service providers. Thus, if the risk of having a certain supplier affected, you do not lose everything. But in return, it will directly affect your profit. So please consider this issue carefully.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p><strong>ETH staking earns a diversified yield of at least 4% a year</strong>. Profits are paid in ETH, so if you are calculating profits in USD or other fiat currencies, the actual return will depend on the price of ETH. However, ETH staking is arguably the least risky source of profit in Web3. Therefore, this can be a great opportunity for investors.</p>

<p>The financial organization revealed in a report that the coin was utilized throughout the testing in transactions between buyers and sellers.</p>



<p>The bank <a href="https://tascombank.ua/files/Electronic_hryvnia_Pilot_TASCOMBANK.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">considers</a> its electronic payment system to be a commercially feasible application of blockchain technology.</p>



<p>The bank noted in the paper that operations with the new digital asset were completed in compliance with the current <strong>know-your-customer </strong>and<strong> anti-money laundering</strong> policies.</p>



<p>Additionally, Tascombank underlined that its research showed a number of benefits of using blockchain, including transparency between all participants in the transactions and at all stages of circulation, improved security and confidentiality for user data, low costs, and high capacity.</p>

<p>The bank also stated that<strong> it intended to keep researching the creation and use of electronic money based on blockchains</strong>. The potential application of such currency in retail non-cash payments will be one of the topics covered by its future research.</p>



<p>An economically sound business model for utilizing blockchain technology is the electronic money circulation system that was investigated during the pilot.</p>

<p>Tascombank also disclosed that the <strong>National Bank of Ukraine (NBU)</strong> thinks experts at commercial and central banks can use the outcomes of their pilot, which was launched at the end of <strong>2021</strong>, to conduct more analysis.</p>



<p>The project is implemented under the supervision of the NBU and with the support of the <strong>Ministry of Digital Transformation</strong>, according to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ukraine-electronic-hryvnia-pilot-launched-by-tascombank-and-bitt-on-stellar-301443773.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> in <strong>December</strong> <strong>2021</strong>.
