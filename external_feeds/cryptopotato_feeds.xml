			            <description><![CDATA[XRP is the only larger-cap alt in the green today. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin dropped by over a grand in the past 24 hours and registered its lowest price tag in about a week earlier today.</p>
<p>The altcoins are also slightly in the red now, with LDO dumping the most (over 6%).</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Slips Under $27K</h2>
<p>Last week&#8217;s unfavorable market conditions culminated on Friday when BTC slumped to a two-month low at $25,800. However, the asset bounced off during the weekend, and spent most of it at around $27,000.</p>
<p>Monday began on a more positive note as BTC jumped to $27,600. However, it failed there and quickly lost all daily gains. Another <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-pushes-past-27k-render-rndr-explodes-20-daily-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">leg up came</a> on Wednesday, but the bears intercepted the move once again, and BTC was unable to challenge $27,500.</p>
<p>The subsequent rejection was a lot more violent than the previous one. It took bitcoin south by a grand, and it plummeted to a weekly low of $26,400. Despite regaining several hundred dollars since then, bitcoin still trades under $27,000 as it&#8217;s 2% down on the day.</p>
<p>As a result, its market capitalization has slumped back down to $520 billion, while its dominance over the altcoins sits tight at 46.3%.</p>

<h2>XRP Defies Market Sentiment</h2>
<p>Most of the altcoins have also followed suit with minor daily declines. Ethereum, for one, has retraced by around 1% and is close to breaking below $1,800 once again. Binance Coin is back below $310 after a similar daily decline.</p>
<p>Cardano, Solana, Litecoin, Polkadot, Shiba Inu, and Avalanche have produced drops of around 1-2%. More daily losses come from the likes of Chainlink, ATOM, and TONCOIN &#8211; all of which are down by around 3%.</p>
<p>Lido DAO&#8217;s native token has dropped the most from the larger-cap alts with a 6% nosedive. Yet, LDO still trades above $2.1.</p>
<p>Ripple is the only top 10 alt with a minor daily increase. XRP, perhaps fueled by the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-vs-sec-judge-denies-the-sealing-of-hinmans-speech-once-again/" data-wpel-link="internal">positive developments</a> around the blockchain company&#8217;s legal case against the SEC, is up by around 3% and trades above $0.45.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap erased yesterday&#8217;s gains and is down to $1.120 trillion.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[America’s largest crypto exchange is trying to increase its customer base with the lure of zero-fee trading but all is not what it seems.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On May 18, the company announced upgrades to Coinbase One, a membership account that offers zero trading fees, boosted staking rewards, and priority support.</p>
<p>However, the catch is that users will have to stump up $30 a month for the privilege.</p>
<p>Coinbase has often been criticized for having some of the highest trading fees in the industry. It makes the lion’s share of its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-posts-79m-net-loss-but-beats-expectations/" data-wpel-link="internal">profits</a> from these often extortionate fees, so the model obviously works.</p>
<p>Paying a monthly fee to eliminate these fees would only be of benefit to whales and heavy traders. Furthermore, those that do trade a lot are unlikely to trade on Coinbase and would favor a decentralized exchange (DEX) where the fees are a fraction.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">2/ The best of Coinbase just got <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />better<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Unlock zero trading fees, a dedicated support team, boosted staking rewards, and exclusive benefits from partners with Coinbase One — all for $29.99/month.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Coinbase One Catches</h2>
<p>Coinbase is offering a 30-day free trial for its new service, which includes priority support. Aside from its hefty fees, the firm has also been heavily criticized for its lack of customer support.</p>
<p>It appears that Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-decentralization-claim-draws-fury-from-its-customers/" data-wpel-link="internal">customers</a> now have to pay to get a timely response through support channels. Members will also be able to receive support with crypto tax filing, it <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/new-updates-to-coinbase-one-zero-trading-fees-boosted-staking-rewards-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">added</a>.</p>
<p>The firm stated it was expanding access to Coinbase One in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Ireland in addition to the United States.</p>
<p>Moreover, the firm is offering perks with partners, including Messari, CoinTracker, and Lemonade.</p>
<p>Coinbase already offers premium accounts and stated that the zero trading fee offer does not apply to Advanced Trade, Coinbase Pro, or Coinbase Prime.</p>
<p>The crypto community&#8217;s reaction was mixed with a fair bit of skepticism over the service. “Nebraskangooner” said to his 300,000 followers:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your support team told me to cancel my membership because the zero trading fees is misleading and only for up to $10,000 worth of trading a month and you still take advantage of people with slippage on basic trading anyway.”</p></blockquote>
<p>COIN shares slipped 1.28% on the day in a fall to $60.35 in after-hours trading.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Crypto markets dropped 1.5% on the day, with total capitalization falling to $1.16 trillion.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> lost 2% in a fall to $26,782, while <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a> dipped 1.3% to just below $1,800 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Markets have remained sideways for the past couple of months and are still cooling from their mid-April high for the year.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Followinng today's transaction, Ripple will become the sole shareholder of Metaco.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple announced the acquisition of Swiss-based crypto custody provider Metaco, marking the blockchain firm&#8217;s expansion across the growing institutional crypto custody market.</p>
<p>The deal, worth $250 million, surfaces as Ripple continues to defend against the long-drawn lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<h2>Ripple Acquires Metaco</h2>
<p>Ripple is expected to ramp up its enterprise offerings providing customers the technology to custody, issue, and settle any type of tokenized asset. At the heart of the deal, the two companies look to tap the growing institutional crypto custody market, which is forecasted to reach $10 trillion by 2030.</p>
<p>Metaco, on the other hand, will be able to leverage the San Francisco-based company&#8217;s established base of hundreds of customers and capital to address new demand and resources for its banking and institutional clients.</p>
<p>According to the official press <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230514005055/en/Leading-Enterprise-Crypto-Company-Ripple-Acquires-Custody-Provider-Metaco-for-250M" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">release</a>, Metaco will continue to operate as an independent brand and business unit, while its founder and CEO, Adrien Treccani, will lead its operations.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Metaco is a proven leader in institutional digital asset custody with an exceptional executive bench and a truly unmatched customer track record. Through the strength of our balance sheet and financial position, Ripple will continue pressing our advantage in the areas critical to crypto infrastructure. Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Reports also suggest that Ripple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/ripple-buys-swiss-startup-metaco-as-sec-lawsuit-conclusion-looms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">invested</a> $250 million of cash off its own balance sheet to fund the acquisition, despite challenging market conditions as a result of higher interest rates and tighter funding conditions to mass layoffs and falling company valuations.</p>
<p>In a call to CNBC, Garlinghouse said the deal would help Ripple increase its presence overseas at a time when the SEC is taking stringent actions against major players in the digital asset industry.</p>
<h2>Ripple Vs. SEC: Another Breakthrough</h2>
<p>The lawsuit contested by Ripple has been dragging on for years. But in a significant development, a federal judge <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-vs-sec-judge-denies-the-sealing-of-hinmans-speech-once-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ruled</a> that the SEC cannot seal documents connected to former official William Hinman&#8217;s 2018 speech on crypto and securities.</p>
<p>The documents in question consist of drafts and emails that indicated the agency did not consider Ether a security at the time. The lawyers representing Ripple have been fighting to learn more about how Hinman came to the conclusion a claim could impact XRP&#8217;s own classification.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[FTX is accusing its former management team of conducting no due diligence before acquiring Embed.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency entities FTX, FTX.US, and Alameda Research have filed a lawsuit against former executives Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), Nishad Singh, and Gary Wang for lavishly spending FTX Group’s assets on the acquisition of stock clearing firm Embed Financial Technologies.</p>
<p>The move is the first formal action from FTX CEO John Ray against the company’s former management. The lawsuit, <a href="https://t.co/U4nXh9qhVu" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed</a> in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, seeks to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-attempts-3-9-billion-clawback-from-genesis/" data-wpel-link="internal">claw back</a> the funds spent during the acquisition.</p>
<h2>FTX Sues SBF and His Inner Circle</h2>
<p>According to the court document, the plaintiffs accused the former management of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-us-discovers-another-90-million-missing/" data-wpel-link="internal">taking advantage</a> of FTX Group’s lack of controls and recordkeeping to inflate the valuation of Embed and deliberately purchasing the platform for more than it was worth.</p>
<p>The defendants, addressed as FTX Insiders, performed little to no due diligence on Embed, as they prioritized speed above everything else in the transaction. They accepted all the terms proposed during the negotiation by Michael Giles, Embed’s founder and CEO, who was also the sole representative.</p>
<p>Giles walked away from the deal with roughly $157 million and an “extravagant and unwarranted retention bonus” as an incentive to quickly complete the sale.</p>
<p>FTX began the acquisition negotiation with Giles at the end of March 2022. By mid-April of the same year, the parties had signed the “Memorandum of Terms,” which ascribed a $220 million enterprise value to Embed with a $75 million retention bonus to the platform’s employees, including $55 million to Giles.</p>
<p>However, when the deal was finalized in September – a few weeks before FTX Group went bankrupt – the FTX Insiders spent more than $248 million to acquire Embed. The plaintiffs allege that while the deal took about six months, the essential terms were negotiated and agreed upon within two weeks.</p>
<h2>FTX Seeks to Recover $250M</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the plaintiffs accused SBF, Singh, and Wang of causing the bankrupt entity to issue Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs), which could be converted into common stock in the event of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>Through his lawyers, Ray <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/john-ray-says-reviving-ftx-is-on-the-table-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">seeks</a> to revoke the SAFEs and recover the funds spent during the acquisition of Embed. The plaintiffs have also asked the court to order the defendants to bear the legal costs of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the plaintiffs also <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTUwNDgyOQ==&amp;id2=-1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed</a> an adversary lawsuit against Giles, the employees, and former equity holders of Embed. Some former equity holders include Silicon Valley venture capital firms like Y Combinator, Bain Capital Ventures, and 9Yards.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Lido Finance currently owns 31% of total Ether staked. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lido Finance &#8211; which is the largest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum &#8211; upgraded to version 2 earlier this week. The move essentially enabled liquid staking users, meaning, the holders of staked ether (stETH), to withdraw stETH to ETH from Lido at a 1:1 ratio.</p>
<p>The latest data suggest that only 0.42% of the withdrawals have been processed so far.</p>
<h2>Aftermath of V2 Upgrade</h2>
<p>According to Switzerland-based 21Shares&#8217; <a href="https://twitter.com/21Shares/status/1659118810111287297" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">estimates</a>, Lido Finance currently owns 31% of the total ETH staked. There are around 6.7 million stETH in supply. Of which, 448.04k stETH has been sent to Lido for request withdrawals.</p>
<p>Celsius Network, the insolvent CeFi lender, accounts for the vast majority with approximately 448.04 stETH in withdrawal requests, as per on-chain analytics provider, Dune.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lido has 470k ETH Buffer for handling the withdrawals which come from execution layer reward (Priority Fees/MEV), partial withdrawals, as well as daily ETH deposits from new stakers through the staking platform. With only 0.42% of the withdrawals processed so far, the analysis by 21Shares noted that Lido may not require to exit any validator from the network to honor all the withdrawals.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the current amount of $stETH requested to withdraw, Lido will not need to exit any validator from the network to honor all the withdrawals and still have 20k $ETH left as a buffer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Lido Finance Activating Withdrawals</h2>

			            <description><![CDATA[PEPE coin mania is fueling intense rallies across the altcoin landscape in May. SNX is soaring Thursday after a proposal to add support for PEPE to the Synthetix blockchain.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Synthetix (SNX) is trading 10% up over the 24-hour period. The recent spike in price comes amid a new proposal.</p>
<ul>
<li>SNX bulls likely have PEPE madness to thank for the market bump. The classic meme frog cryptocurrency <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pepe-but-on-solana-and-other-web-3-0-frogs-got-a-bump-on-pepe-coin-mania/" data-wpel-link="internal">is adding</a> value to every market it touches. Volumes surged 150% in the wake of Synthetix Improvement Proposal (SIP) 2014. That would add PEPE coin markets to the L2 blockchain.</li>
<li>Synthetix is a decentralized exchange for trading &#8220;synthetic&#8221; crypto assets. It operates in the blockchain ecosystem as both a Layer-2 scaling solution and DEX.</li>
<li>The project was launched in Sept 2017 by Kain Warwick. Synthetix lives on the Ethereum and Optimism mainnets.</li>
<li>SNX <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/reasons-why-synthetix-snx-skyrocketed-by-over-100/" data-wpel-link="internal">skyrocketed</a> last year when the network introduced atomic swaps.</li>
<li>This week, the crypto got a big price bump out of a proposal to add eight new markets. Among them, most notably, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defi-token-synthetix-soars-10-100310269.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">was this</a> year&#8217;s memecoin darling, PEPE coin:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Synthetix Improvement Proposal (SIP) 2014 and 2015, if passed, would open eight new markets for synthetic versions of several notable cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The most notable market is likely the community’s interest in integrating the mega-popular meme coin Pepecoin (PEPE).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>SIP 2014 would open trading for PEPE, SUI, and BLUR. SIP 2015 would add XRP, DOT, TRX, FLOKI, and INJ. The proposals <a href="https://twitter.com/synthetix_io/status/1658127407906447360" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">were currently</a> up for voting this week.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has been trapped in a tight range recently, showing little intent to move significantly to either side. However, changes could be expected shortly.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has been oscillating between the 50-day moving average located around the $1900 mark and the $1800 static support level, during the past 7 days.</p>
<p>From a classical PA point of view, the market is likely to reach lower levels, as it has made a lower high and a lower low recently. In this case, $1800 could break, and ETH could test the critical 200-day moving average, which is trending around the $1600 level.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if ETH climbs above the 50-day moving average, it would likely rally higher and eventually test the $2200 resistance area in the short term.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251261" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251261" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSDT-Daily-May-18-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-251261 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSDT-Daily-May-18-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_1805231" width="2560" height="1441" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSDT-Daily-May-18-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSDT-Daily-May-18-2023-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSDT-Daily-May-18-2023-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSDT-Daily-May-18-2023-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSDT-Daily-May-18-2023-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSDT-Daily-May-18-2023-2048x1153.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSDT-Daily-May-18-2023-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251261" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the price has formed a large falling wedge pattern below the $2000 mark. A breakout above this pattern would be a classical continuation pattern, which would probably result in a run toward the $2200 resistance zone.</p>
<p>Even so, the price still has a long way to reach the higher boundary of the pattern, as it is currently testing the $1800 support area. The RSI indicator also provides minimal insight, as it has been running relatively flat around the 50% mark, pointing to an equilibrium in momentum.</p>

<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<h3>Ethereum Funding Rates</h3>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price was rejected below the $2,000 mark over the last few weeks and has been consolidating ever since. The indecisiveness on the chart can also be witnessed by evaluating the futures market sentiment.</p>
<p>This chart demonstrates the funding rates metric, which indicates whether the futures market sentiment is relatively bullish or bearish. Positive values are associated with bullish market sentiment, while negative ones show bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>It is clear that following a period of consistently positive funding rates during the price rally since early 2023, this metric has been showing small positive and negative values with no particular consistency.</p>
<p>It could be interpreted that neither the bulls nor the bears have established their dominance in the futures market, and the price could still move rangebound until things change in the derivatives.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple’s price has found support at the significant 200-day moving average at around $0.41, leading to a robust uptrend. Should it continue its surge, Ripple&#8217;s next destination will be the resistance zone at $0.56, but what if the bears take control?</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Analyzing the daily chart reveals that following several weeks of rejection, the price has finally found support at the 200-day moving average of $0.41, initiating an upward trend. Consequently, the recent rejection phase can be described as a mid-term consolidation correction stage, which is vital for a healthy bullish rally.</p>
<p>This indicates that XRP could attempt to breach the $0.56 barrier. If the price manages to surpass this critical zone, it is likely to enter a long-term bullish rally.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251267" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Daily-6-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-251267 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Daily-6-scaled.jpg" alt="xrp_price_chart_1805231" width="2560" height="1386" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Daily-6-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Daily-6-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Daily-6-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Daily-6-768x416.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Daily-6-1536x832.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Daily-6-2048x1109.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Daily-6-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251267" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Turning to the 4-hour chart, XRP initially dropped to the static resistance region of $0.42, which coincides with the 200-day moving average. However, the price found support and began rallying toward the mid-trend line of the channel.</p>
<p>There is a significant resistance region at $0.4675, which currently serves as the primary barrier on the 4-hour timeframe. Should the price surpass this resistance, its next target will be the channel’s upper boundary, approximately at $0.6.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This contradicts a claim from the company’s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1592551225970548736" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">main account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> last November, in which Ledger claimed that user private keys cannot be extracted from a wallet’s secure element chip through a firmware update. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the time, Ledger and other wallet manufacturers were recording record sales in the aftermath of FTX’s collapse, as crypto investors sought the security of self-custody and cold storage for their crypto assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Thursday, Ledger </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Ledger_Support/status/1659218986314366976" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that it decided to delete its Wednesday tweet due to its “confusing wording.” However, Ledger’s CTO Charles Guillemet published a follow-up thread explaining that wallets, in general, have “many ways” to implement a backdoor, and that some level of trust is required with any third-party wallet purchase. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">22/ <br />If you want to be completely trustless, you&#39;ll have to learn electronics to build your computer, learn ASM to build your compiler, then build a wallet stack, your own node and synchronizer, you&#39;ll have to learn cryptography to build your own signature stack.</p>
<p>&mdash; Charles Guillemet (@P3b7_) <a href="https://twitter.com/P3b7_/status/1659187097071132673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">May 18, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Open source doesn’t really solve this,” he added. “It’s impossible to have guarantees that the electronic itself is not backdoored, nor that the firmware that runs inside the wallet is the one you audited.”</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>Ledger Recover</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Criticism around Ledger swelled on Wednesday after the company announced its new hardware wallet service “<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ledger-under-fire-for-allegedly-exposing-user-seed-phrases/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ledger Recover</a>.” With user permission, the service breaks a wallet’s private keys into three shards, encrypts them, and stores them with three separate centralized providers – one of which is Ledger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The subscription service requires users to provide personal identifying information before using it. In return, users are granted a method of recovering their private keys in case they lose both their hardware device and seed phrase paper backup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crypto community blasted the service and its associated firmware update for adding a code path that can send private keys to third parties. Many experts including developer and auditor “foobar” recommended that followers stop using the company’s devices.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you have a ledger, your keys are not compromised (yet). But if you upgrade to the latest firmware, it’ll stick in a code path that can send your private key to third parties. Given ledger doxxed their own customers in the past, it’s unlikely that they’ll keep this info safe</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Garlinghouse says countries like Europe and the UAE are beneficiaries of the regulatory confusion in the U.S.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive officer of blockchain company Ripple, believes more crypto firms and businesses will leave the United States due to confusing regulations in the country.</p>
<p>During an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/18/ripple-ceo-says-more-crypto-firms-may-leave-us-due-to-confusing-rules.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">interview</a> with CNBC, the CEO said the confusion in the country would push crypto entrepreneurs and investments into other friendly regions like Europe, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom, and even Singapore.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Confusion in the U.S.</h2>
<p>Garlinghouse noted that Europe, the UAE, and the U.K. are providing clarity and leadership on regulating digital assets, and their efforts allow founders and investors to engage constructively with watchdogs and authorities. He asserted that Europe is a beneficiary of the current situation in America.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think it’s fair to say the U.S. has made it as confusing as possible as to what the rules of the road are for the crypto industry. As you described, the U.S. SEC has really been at the forefront of that confusion. Unfortunately, that has encouraged companies like Ripple to invest more outside of the U.S.,” the Ripple CEO said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Garlinghouse’s comments come as U.S. regulators, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are cracking down on crypto companies. The SEC is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-vs-sec-judge-denies-the-sealing-of-hinmans-speech-once-again/" data-wpel-link="internal">currently</a> in a legal tussle with Ripple over alleged securities laws violations in the offering and sale of XRP – the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network.</p>
<p>The securities regulator has also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-moves-to-block-coinbases-request-for-clarification-in-court-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">asked</a> a U.S. court to deny a petition from digital asset exchange Coinbase to establish comprehensive rules for the nascent industry, insisting that existing regulations are clear but crypto firms have refused to consider them.</p>
<h2>Ripple in a Strong Financial Position</h2>
<p>Regarding the recent <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-takes-on-the-crypto-custody-market-with-metaco/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">acquisition</a> of Swiss-based crypto custody firm Metaco, Garlinghouse believes the firm perfectly fits Ripple’s expansion plans. The investment, which has made Garlinghouse’s company the sole shareholder of Metaco, will expand Ripple’s suite of products and give it access to an attractive clientele.</p>
<p>The Ripple CEO further disclosed that the company is in a solid financial position as it funded the $250 million Metaco purchase from its balance sheet. He added that Ripple is currently leaning in and playing offense, and the acquisition is an example of that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ripple is neither in a hurry to become a publicly traded company nor raise more capital, according to Garlinghouse.</p>
<blockquote><p>“So if we were to consider [to list], it would be at a time and place that made sense,” he added.</p></blockquote>
