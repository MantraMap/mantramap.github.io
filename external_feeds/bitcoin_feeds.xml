<h2>BIS Economists Discuss Crypto Policies</h2>
<p>The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) published a bulletin last week titled &#8220;Addressing the risks in crypto: laying out the options.&#8221;</p>
<p>Authored by BIS economists Matteo Aquilina, Jon Frost, and Andreas Schrimpf, the report discusses the risks associated with cryptocurrencies and the various options available to regulators and central banks for addressing these risks.</p>
<p>The authors outlined &#8220;three potential lines of action.&#8221; The first is to &#8220;ban specific crypto activities.&#8221; Another option is to &#8220;isolate crypto from tradfi [traditional finance] and the real economy.&#8221; The third is to &#8220;regulate the sector in a manner akin to tradfi.&#8221; However, the report clarifies that the three options are not mutually exclusive and could be &#8220;selectively combined to mitigate the risks emanating from crypto activities.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bis-3-options.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230117%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20230117T113953Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Signature=e85ee3eb6c6c5447b9b1f77a7f6447dbedb1ced55a75da30708a609110ef9177"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-569133 aligncenter" title="BIS Economists Recommend 3 Regulatory Policies to Deal With Crypto Risks" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bis-3-options.jpg" alt="BIS Economists Recommend 3 Regulatory Policies to Deal With Crypto Risks" width="1234" height="652" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bis-3-options-300x159.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bis-3-options-1024x541.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bis-3-options-768x406.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bis-3-options.jpg 1234w" sizes="(max-width: 1234px) 100vw, 1234px" /></a></p>

<p>While noting that crypto markets &#8220;have experienced a remarkable series of booms and busts, often resulting in large losses for investors,&#8221; the BIS economists concluded that &#8220;these failures have so far not spilled over to the traditional financial system or the real economy.&#8221; Nonetheless, they cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no assurance that they will not do so in the future, as defi (decentralized finance) and tradfi become more intertwined.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Authorities can now consider a variety of policy approaches and at the same time work to improve the existing monetary system in the public interest,&#8221; the BIS report concludes.</p>

<h2>&#8216;SEC Regulatory Onslaught Is Just Beginning&#8217;</h2>
<p>Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark has warned the crypto industry of an escalating &#8220;regulatory onslaught.&#8221; Stark founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years where he led cyber-related projects, investigations, and enforcement actions.</p>
<p>Stark explained in a tweet Thursday that the SEC &#8220;hit Blockfi for failing to register its crypto-lending program, stopped Coinbase from launching its crypto-lending program, and Just hit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/">Gemini/Genesis</a> for its Earn crypto-lending grift.&#8221; He warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Buckle up: An SEC regulatory onslaught is just beginning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week, the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/">charged</a> crypto exchange Gemini and crypto lender Genesis &#8220;for the unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Gemini Earn crypto asset lending program.&#8221; In February last year, the regulator took action against cryptocurrency lending platform <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/first-for-sec-crypto-lending-platform-charged-blockfi-agrees-to-pay-100-million-penalties/">Blockfi</a> which filed for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-lender-blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-to-maximize-value-for-all-clients/">bankruptcy</a> in November. Moreover, the securities watchdog also threatened to sue <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-abandons-plan-launch-lend-program-after-sec-threatens-lawsuit/">Coinbase</a> if the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange proceeded to launch a lending program in September 2021. Coinbase subsequently shelved its plan.</p>

<p>Stark is a vocal crypto skeptic, regularly commenting on social media about the danger of investing in cryptocurrencies. &#8220;In crypto-land, the Ponzi shell game continues &amp; a death spiral may have now begun,&#8221; he said last November. &#8220;Fail not at your peril crypto investors,&#8221; he stressed, emphasizing that crypto has &#8220;no FDIC insurance, no SEC examination teams, no regulatory oversight, no licensure, and no consumer protections.&#8221; He cautioned that with crypto investing:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are 100% on your own.</p></blockquote>
<p>Citing Stark, CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer has also been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jim-cramer-urges-sec-to-do-a-big-crypto-sweep-says-i-wouldnt-touch-crypto-in-a-million-years/">warning</a> about the SEC doing &#8220;a big sweep&#8221; of the crypto industry. He has urged investors to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jim-cramer-expects-sec-to-do-a-roundup-of-uncompliant-crypto-firms-urges-investors-to-get-out-of-crypto-now/">get out of crypto now</a>.</p>

According to market data, both crypto assets saw the largest increase on Saturday, Jan. 14, 2023. The sudden spike in value caused the highest ratio of short liquidations vs long liquidations since July 2021, according to a recent Alpha report from Bitfinex.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitfinex Analysts See a Cautious Approach From Bulls as Market Remains Highly Illiquid Despite Price Surge</h2>
<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a> prices have risen significantly against the U.S. dollar, causing a cascade of short liquidations on Jan. 14. The cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex discussed the matter in its most recent <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bitfinex-Alpha-37.pdf">Alpha report #37</a>. When a trader opens a short position against bitcoin or ethereum, they expect the price of the crypto assets to decline in the future.</p>
<p>However, if bitcoin&#x2019;s price climbs quickly, short traders either get liquidated or must buy back the bitcoin at a higher price. When the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> rises too much, short sellers are liquidated, meaning their short position is closed by the crypto derivatives exchange. According to Bitfinex researchers, a significant number of liquidations took place on Jan. 14.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Short liquidations fueled the entire increase in bitcoin and ethereum,&#x201D; Bitfinex analysts said in the Alpha report. &#x201C;Short liquidations at $450 million outweighed long liquidations by a ratio of 4.5. On Jan. 14, the market saw the highest ratio of short liquidations vs long liquidations since July 2021,&#x201D; the analysts added. They also mentioned that the liquidation figures and short vs long liquidation ratio was even more severe among altcoins.</p>

<p>Bitfinex analysts further detailed that a retraction in bitcoin&#x2019;s price still remains probable. &#x201C;While it is typical for bear markets to have a complete wipeout of shorts,&#x201D; the analyst noted. &#x201C;The entire rally has been built on the backbone of continuous market shorts keeping funding low and prices being pushed up by forced liquidations and running stops. So, a pullback in bitcoin price remains a possibility.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Alpha report adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although the move might be interpreted as organic, it is entirely engineered by limited traders in the market, which is evident from the market depth remaining the same week-on-week. The price impact from market orders is also the same as last week for [bitcoin], and there is little change for altcoins. This means that even with the leg up, the market remains highly illiquid, and with the sharp fall in open interest over the weekend, a pullback might be expected with a cautious approach from bulls.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Crypto Supporters Debate the Gartner Hype Cycle Position and &#x2018;Disbelief&#x2019; Phase</h2>
<p>When the liquidations took place three days ago, Bitfinex reported that Bybit experienced the largest short open interest wipeout since its inception. &#x201C;The negative funding rates below $16,000, followed by increasing aggregated long-side open interest for [bitcoin], were the driving force behind the price surge,&#x201D; the researchers explained.</p>
<p>The recent rise in bitcoin and ethereum prices has caused many people to speculate whether the crypto bottom is in. On Jan. 16, 2023, bitcoin analyst Willy Woo shared an illustrated image of the Gartner Hype Cycle and <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1615162906538303489?s=20&t=BOft3CCZrjGdo4wDKfV5fA">said</a>, &#x201C;I suspect we are in the &#x2018;disbelief&#x2019; phase of the cycle.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A number of people disagreed with Woo&#x2019;s opinion about being in the &#x2018;disbelief&#x2019; phase of the cycle. Crypto proponent &#x201C;Colin Talks Crypto&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinTCrypto/status/1615312012476665859?s=20&t=BOft3CCZrjGdo4wDKfV5fA">replied</a> to Woo, saying, &#x201C;No way.&#x201D; Colin further stressed that it would &#x201C;mean the typical bear market got massively shortened, (which is highly unlikely, especially in today&#x2019;s poor macro climate).&#x201D; The crypto supporter and Youtuber added:</p>
<blockquote><p>It would mean a bitcoin 4-year cycle somehow magically became a 2-year cycle or something.</p></blockquote>

The market capitalization of the smart contract platform token economy has swelled by $78 billion over the last 30 days, increasing from $243 billion to the current $321 billion. Furthermore, the total value locked in decentralized finance (defi) has risen by $5.39 billion in the same time frame.</strong></p>
<h2>Smart Contract Tokens Experience Double-Digit Gains, Led by Oneledger, Harmony, and Waves</h2>
<p>It&#x2019;s been a rough crypto winter, to say the least, and after numerous insolvencies and bankruptcies within the industry, crypto assets have been hit hard. The latest, and one of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">most tragic blowouts</a> last year, took place 67 days ago when FTX was found to be insolvent and the company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, 2022. The crypto economy took a beating during the last two weeks of November and into <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/global-cryptocurrency-trade-volumes-saw-a-significant-decline-in-december-2022/">December</a>, and the lackluster end-of-the-year holiday market action made things worse.</p>

<p>Approximately 30 days ago, on Dec. 18, 2022, the smart contract token economy was worth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221218080354/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform">$243 billion</a>, and a great deal of coins lost considerable value. Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>), for instance, was down 6.1% that week, and cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>) was down 14.4%.</p>
<p>All ten of the leading smart contract coins that week were down by double digits against the U.S. dollar. But over the last month, the smart contract platform token economy grew by $78 billion, and as of Jan. 17, 2023, the entire lot is worth <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform">$321 billion</a>.</p>

<h2>Decentralized Finance Total Value Locked Increases by $5.39 Billion in One Month</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform">Smart contract tokens</a> that have made major moves this past week include oneledger (OLT), harmony (ONE), waves (WAVES), solana (SOL), fantom (FTM), and avalanche (AVAX). The aforementioned smart contract tokens increased by 37.2% to 53.7% in value against the U.S. dollar in seven days. Other notable smart contract coin gainers this week include holo (HOT), ronin (RON), parsiq (PRQ), and immutable x (IMX). The rise in smart contract tokens over the last month has fueled decentralized finance stats as well.</p>

<p>Currently, <a href="https://defillama.com/">defi statistics</a> show that from Dec. 18, 2022, to Jan. 17, 2023, or 30 days, the total value locked (TVL) in defi increased by $5.39 billion. At the time, 30 days ago, the TVL in defi was around $39.9 billion, and it has since grown to $45.29 billion. The largest and most dominant defi protocol on Jan. 17 is the liquid staking solution Lido.</p>
<p>The defi protocol <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/lido">Lido</a> has an overall TVL size of around $7.81 billion or 17.2% of the $45.29 billion TVL. Most of Lido&#x2019;s increase is due to ether&#x2019;s 20.6% rise against the U.S. dollar. The same can be said about the entire defi TVL as the growth is highly correlated with the double-digit gains smart contract tokens have accrued over the last month.</p>

In the lending sector of defi, a lot has changed during the last 12 months as lending applications like Terra&#8217;s Anchor Protocol bit the dust, and 71.95% of the total value locked in defi lending protocols evaporated.</strong></p>
<h2>From $37 Billion to $10 Billion: The Top Five Defi Lenders Then and Now</h2>
<p>Last year around this time, decentralized finance lending protocols held $37.41 billion in total value locked (TVL), and the defi protocol Aave dominated with $12.87 billion. An archive.org <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220110020644/https://defillama.com/protocols/Lending">snapshot</a> from Jan. 10, 2022, shows that Aave&#8217;s $12.87 billion TVL was larger than the TVL the top five defi lending protocols held on Jan. 17, 2023.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230117010721/https://defillama.com/protocols/Lending">Data</a> shows that the top five defi protocols in mid-Jan. 2023 include Aave ($4.58 billion), Justlend ($3.02 billion), Compound ($1.85 billion), Venus ($813.63 million), and Morpho ($221.59 million). Currently, all five of the aforementioned defi protocols have a combined TVL of around $10.49 billion.</p>

<p>On Jan. 10, 2022, Terra&#8217;s Anchor Protocol held approximately $8.5 billion in value, but now the defi protocol is in ashes. Anchor was one of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/a-dark-day-for-crypto-a-deep-dive-into-the-obliterated-terra-token-ecosystem-and-damaged-apps/">main components</a> in the Terra ecosystem as terrausd (UST) holders deposited UST for a 20% annual percentage rate return that compounded daily.</p>
<p>But in May 2022, UST depegged from its $1 parity, and Anchor holds only around $2 million today. Compound held the third-largest TVL in terms of defi lending protocols with $8.09 billion at the time. On Jan. 17, 2023, Compound&#8217;s TVL has shrunk to $1.85 billion.</p>

<p>The second-largest defi lending protocol today is Justlend with $3.03 billion. The Tron-based Justlend moved from the seventh-largest defi lending protocol TVL to the second by jumping from $1.72 billion to the current $3 billion. Justlend is one of the only decentralized finance lending applications that saw an increase during the last 12 months.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth-largest defi lenders last year, Abracadabra and Cream Finance, are no longer in the top five standings and have been replaced by Venus and Morpho. Cream Finance is now in the 20th position, dropping from $2.14 billion to the current $42.94 million.</p>

The move comes as U.S. markets reopened following a public holiday on Monday. Polkadot also moved higher in today&#x2019;s session, snapping a two-day losing streak.</strong></p>
<h2>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>)</h2>
<p>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>) rebounded on Tuesday, as the token moved back towards a recent seven-month high.</p>
<p>Following a low of $165.77, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $173.28 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s move saw monero bounce from its support at $165.00, and climb towards a resistance of $175.00.</p>

<p>As of writing, the token remains below this ceiling, currently trading at the $172.65 level.</p>
<p>Should this hurdle be overcome, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a> bulls will likely attempt to recapture last week&#x2019;s peak of $187.20.</p>
<p>In order for this to happen, the relative strength index (RSI), which is currently tracking at 68.71, will need to move back towards the 80.00 mark.</p>

<h2>Polkadot (DOT)</h2>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) snapped a two-day losing streak on Tuesday, with prices nearing a two-month high.</p>
<p>DOT/USD hit a high of $6.07 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $5.66.</p>
<p>As a result of Tuesday&#x2019;s surge, DOT moved to a ceiling at $6.10, and closer to Saturday&#x2019;s high of $6.51.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the rebound came as the 14-day RSI also bounced from its own support point at 72.45.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at 74.88, with a ceiling at the 82.00 mark a possible target for buyers.</p>
<p>As of writing, DOT has given up earlier gains, and is trading at $5.97.</p>

It is currently valued at $993.17 billion, as many digital assets have seen double-digit gains during the last two weeks. While some of the top ten cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ethereum, are performing well, a few digital currencies have outperformed a number of the top ten coins in terms of gains this year.</strong></p>
<h2>Top Cryptocurrency Performers of the Week: Decentraland&#x2019;s MANA, Frax Share, and FTT Lead the Way</h2>
<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">Digital currency markets</a> have been in the green recently, as the leading cryptocurrency, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, has risen 23.29% against the U.S. dollar in seven days. The second-leading digital currency by market capitalization, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a>, has also gained 18.39% this week. Out of the top ten positions, bitcoin has outperformed its competitors in terms of seven-day gains. However, a large number of cryptocurrencies outside the top ten have exceeded <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s gains in the last week, with much higher increases against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>For instance, Decentraland&#x2019;s <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/MANA/">MANA</a> token has risen 88.02% this week. Over the last 14 days, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/MANA/">decentraland (MANA)</a> has gained 131.8%. While the MANA gains have been significant, at $0.721 per unit, the digital currency is still down 87% from its all-time high on Nov. 25, 2021. The second-leading cryptocurrency this week is frax share (FXS), which has gained 81.69%. <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/frax-share">FXS</a> has also increased 111% against the U.S. dollar in two weeks. The third-largest gainer this week is the <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/FTT/">ftx token (FTT)</a>, as the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-exchange-token-ftt-sees-mysterious-pump-amid-bankruptcy-case-sbf-fraud-charges/">exchange token</a> has climbed 62.82% higher during the last seven days.</p>

<p>FTT managed to gain 160.5% against the U.S. dollar in 14 days. Another big gainer over the last seven days is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/helium">helium (HNT)</a>, which jumped 59.53% during the week and 92.8% higher in two weeks. <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aptos">Aptos (APT)</a> has increased 57.21% in seven days and 114.5% in 14 days. Other digital assets that have outperformed bitcoin&#x2019;s and ethereum&#x2019;s gains so far this year include solana (SOL), compound (COMP), optimism (OP), convex finance (CVX), the sandbox (SAND), and gala (GALA), respectively.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, as there were a large number of gainers over the last two weeks, there have also been a number of losers. According to seven-day statistics against the U.S. dollar, the biggest loser is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/flare">flare network (FLR)</a>, which has lost 16.76% this past week. The coin is newly launched and has only been around for just over seven days. Other losers against the U.S. dollar this week include nexo (NEXO) and unus sed leo (LEO). After a significant rise on Jan. 16, the cryptocurrency economy as a whole is up 1.47% during the last 24 hours.</p>

The economic release comes as U.S. traders also returned to action, following the observation of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration. Ethereum rose briefly above $1,600 earlier in the session.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rose back above the $21,000 mark on Tuesday, as markets reacted to the latest GDP figures from China.</p>
<p>Figures from the world&#x2019;s second largest economy showed that gross domestic product rose by 3% last year, higher than the 2.8% expected.</p>
<p>As a result of this, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to a high of $21,360.87 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom at $20,715.75.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s rebound in price has pushed bitcoin closer to its long-term resistance level of $21,400.</p>
<p>This ceiling has been in place for the past two months, and was marginally broken over the weekend.</p>
<p>The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continues to hover close to a ceiling of 90.00, and should <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> bulls intend to climb above $21,400, this ceiling on the RSI must first be broken.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) climbed higher in today&#x2019;s session, with prices briefly moving beyond the $1,600 level</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,529.57 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD surged to an intraday peak of $1,603 in the early hours of this morning.</p>
<p>Prices have since slipped, and as of writing, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency is trading at $1,569.75.</p>

<p>Overall, with prices significantly overbought, and with bullish momentum seemingly at its peak, many expect a reversal could be on its way.</p>
<p>Currently the RSI of 14 days is tracking at 83.84, which is its highest level since August 2020, when price was trading below $1,200.</p>
<p>Although there are still long-term bulls, it is likely that ethereum could move into consolidation up until price strength is in more neutral territory.</p>

The company enlisted the aid of Criptan, a registered Spanish cryptocurrency exchange, and aims to open this payment option for users by Q3 2023.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Vueling to Collect Payment in Crypto</h2>
<p>Vueling, one of the Spanish budget airlines that has <a href="https://cincodias.elpais.com/cincodias/2023/01/10/companias/1673372950_172699.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown</a> after the Covid-19 travel restrictions ended, is taking its first steps to accepting crypto as payment for its services. The company <a href="https://www.hosteltur.com/155103_vueling-ofrecera-a-sus-pasajeros-la-opcion-de-pago-con-criptomonedas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Jan. 14 it was examining the usage of blockchain and NFT technology in order to allow customers to acquire plane tickets with crypto.</p>
<p>For this task, Vueling has partnered with Criptan, a national exchange that has already registered with the Bank of Spain, to serve as a payments company, processing and completing customers&#8217; orders using crypto.</p>
<p>Vueling states this move will turn it into the first low-cost airline to accept crypto as a means of payment in Europe. On this, Jesus Monzo, Vueling&#8217;s alliances and distribution manager, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This agreement places us at the forefront of new technologies and innovation, further reinforcing our commitment to our customers and offering the best and most advanced tools and solutions on our website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jorge Soriano, Criptan&#8217;s CEO, stated the company is convinced that the introduction of crypto payments could improve user experience by showing customers the potential there is behind the implementation of such solutions.</p>
<p>The functionality is expected to be available on the website of the airline by Q3 2023, and it will be using <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/many-major-airlines-can-now-accept-cryptocurrencies-via-uatp-global-payment-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UATP</a> tech, the global payments network for airlines, although the company has not indicated which cryptocurrencies will be accepted.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Airlines and Crypto</h2>
<p>Other airlines have already introduced crypto and even NFTs as part of their retail operations. One of these is Flybondi, an Argentine airline, that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentine-airline-flybondi-to-adopt-nft-technology-for-ticket-issuance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it would be issuing plane tickets as NFTs in September 2022, allowing users to sell them on secondary markets. As part of that alliance, the company would also accept payments in stablecoins like USDC, using Binance Pay as a payment processing partner.</p>
<p>But even prior to that, the Venezuelan government <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/travelers-will-be-able-to-purchase-airline-tickets-with-crypto-in-venezuela/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> it would be accepting several cryptocurrencies as payment for plane tickets in Oct. 2021, including among these the national token, the petro.</p>

<p>Copy trading provides a good starting point for beginners to shadow their trading portfolio with a more experienced trader and increase their chance of profitability. Also, users are entitled to more transparency and flexibility as the feature discloses detailed information on the traders&#8217; ROI, buy and sell time and price, portfolio, and P&amp;L records, together with personalized Maximum Investment, Stop Loss and Take Profit options.</p>
<p>One-Click Copy Trade is Bitget&#8217;s flagship product, simplifying trading for beginners by allowing them to copy sophisticated futures trading strategies with minimal effort. As of December 2022, the company&#8217;s One-Click Copy Trade in the futures market has accumulated over 80,000 traders, and 338,000 followers.</p>
<p>The newly launched Copy Trading feature in the spot market aims to provide a seamless and convenient experience by giving users the option to copy trading strategies and own the cryptocurrency in their wallet. Users can view trader profiles provided by the platform to choose their preferred trader to follow, based on their P&amp;L, trader ranking, and portfolio as recorded in the system. One-Click Copy Trade is a win-win solution as followers&#8217; trades will be automatically executed with the subscribed traders&#8217; orders after subscription and a profit share percentage will only be charged when a profit arises from the trades. The feature also offers a passive income stream for successful and experienced traders to further increase their yield.</p>
