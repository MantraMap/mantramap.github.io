Milei noted that his team had signed an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) with unknown third parties that would provide the liquidity needed to close the Central Bank of Argentina.</strong></p>
<h2>Javier Milei Develops Dollarization Proposal in Argentina</h2>
<p>Javier Milei, a liberal presidential candidate in Argentina, has advanced his government plan to eliminate inflation in the country if elected. He stated he already has the funds to dollarize the economy at current market prices.</p>
<p>Milei, who has made dollarization a pivotal part of his government plan, <a href="https://twitter.com/JMilei/status/1673814833328791554?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While they attack, defame, operate, etc., we have been advancing in negotiations and we have already obtained the dollars to dollarize the economy at the value of the market dollar. We continue working to solve a big problem in Argentina, which is inflation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Milei <a href="https://twitter.com/MJMendezCasarie/status/1674016062738759680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that he and his team had signed a confidentiality agreement with undisclosed third parties to provide the means necessary for the dollarization process. He estimated that the nation could collect <a href="https://twitter.com/ElPelucaMilei/status/1674199176433762305?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double</a> the dollars needed to withdraw all the Argentine pesos from circulation, closing the Central Bank of Argentina.</p>
<p>Milei is also <a href="https://www.infobae.com/politica/2023/06/27/javier-milei-aseguro-que-ya-consiguio-los-fondos-para-dolarizar-al-valor-del-mercado/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1687908059" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing</a> the law project that will be presented to the Argentine congress and estimating the time for the implementation of this initiative. Milei noted that his first proposal required at least two and a half years to be adopted, while new dollarization formats currently being designed demand less time to be put into practice.</p>

<h2>Numbers and Feasibility</h2>
<p>The dollarization idea, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-debates-dollarization-in-the-midst-of-rampant-devaluation-and-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented</a> to the public in April as a way out of the inflationary and devaluation crisis, has faced criticism from all angles of the political spectrum. Some economists have spoken against it, stating that it would be impossible to cement during the current economic reality of the country.</p>
<p>However, Milei believes economists have greatly overestimated the numbers associated with this process. He <a href="https://twitter.com/JMilei/status/1674027904827523072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They said that [dollarization] was crazy impossible, $70 billion was needed. After, it was $50 billion. Someone close to them told them that although it was difficult, it was feasible. Now it&#8217;s about $35 billion. If they knew about finance a long time ago, they would have realized that it is possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Milei&#8217;s position on polls has fallen, now <a href="https://www.cronista.com/economia-politica/como-saldra-milei-en-agosto-segun-las-ultimas-encuestas-con-los-candidatos-confirmados/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing</a> him in the third position after Sergio Massa, the economy minister of Argentina and a key figure in the current economic establishment, announced he would join the presidential race.</p>

The stock has been viewed as a source of funds that can be used to compensate customers who suffered losses as a result of the coin trading platform’s collapse. </strong></p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Exchange FTX Postpones Sale of Anthropic Shares</h2>
<p>Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has decided to hold off the sale of its stake in the AI company Anthropic. The stock, worth $500 million, has been among the exchange’s most sought-after assets, Bloomberg noted in a report.</p>
<p>According to sources who chose to remain anonymous, bidders have been informed this month about the pause by Perella Weinberg Partners, the financial services firm acting as an advisor in FTX’s bankruptcy which was looking to sell the Anthropic shares.</p>
<p>The AI startup was established in 2021 by former employees of Openai, the developer of the chatbot <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/over-100000-compromised-chatgpt-accounts-discovered-on-darknet-markets/">Chatgpt</a>. In May of this year, Anthropic announced it had raised $450 million to support the development of its AI bot named ‘Claude.’</p>
<p>Anthropic has been recently valued at $4.6 billion and secondary market buyers have been seeking to acquire shares of the company. FTX’s stake in the AI firm is one of the biggest investments made by what was one the largest digital asset exchanges.</p>
<p>FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection amid liquidity issues in November 2022. The sale of the Anthropic stake was halted a day after FTX’s new CEO, John J Ray III, accused the former management of the crypto company of misappropriating assets, Forbes remarked in an article.</p>
<p>Some of the political donations and venture capital investments made by FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), its founder and former chief executive, have been partially funded by commingled customer deposits, according to a report published by the exchange’s new management this week.</p>
<p>FTX and SBF’s crypto trading firm Alameda Research made the $500 million investment in Anthropic, according to the internal documents seen by Bloomberg. At this point, it remains unclear how long the sale of the stake in the AI startup will be delayed.</p>

The news comes when the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange finds itself under pressure from regulators and banking partners in Europe and elsewhere.</strong></p>
<h2>Paysafe to Stop Euro Deposits and Withdrawals for Binance</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance, the global leader in terms of daily trading volume, will lose access to payments in the common European currency, another setback for its operations on the Old Continent that comes amid regulatory crackdown in various jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“Following a strategic review, we have taken the decision to cease offering our embedded wallet solution to Binance across the region,” its U.K.-based payment processor, Paysafe, said in a statement, quoted by Bloomberg. The company added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paysafe and Binance are now working to mutually implement an orderly and fair process to terminate this service over the next few months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paysafe will no longer support bank transfers of euros to and from Binance via the Single Euro Payments Area (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEPA</a>) network, starting from Sept. 25, a spokesperson for the exchange confirmed. Binance “will be changing the provider,” the representative pointed out and emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>All methods of depositing and withdrawing other fiat currencies as well as buying and selling crypto on Binance.com remain unaffected.</p></blockquote>
<p>The development coincides with increased pressure on Binance in some EU member states. The exchange was recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-ordered-to-cease-all-crypto-services-in-belgium/">ordered</a> to cease all crypto services in Belgium while French prosecutors are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-investigation-targets-binance-allegations-of-money-laundering-and-regulatory-violations/">investigating</a> it for money laundering violations.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-pulls-out-of-netherlands-seeks-to-deregister-cyprus-unit/">pulled out</a> of the Dutch market, after failing to obtain registration as a crypto service provider in the Netherlands, applied for deregistration in Cyprus as such, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-unit-in-britain-cancels-uk-regulatory-authorization/">cancelled</a> its U.K. authorization to focus on fewer regulated entities in Europe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the platform’s share of euro-denominated crypto trading has dropped to 13% this year, according to data from research firm Kaiko. The market share of Binance’s subsidiary in the in the U.S., where the exchange is engaged in a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-cz-agree-to-repatriate-us-customer-assets-sec-secures-court-order/">legal battle</a> with the securities regulator, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-market-share-shrinks-amid-legal-battle-with-sec/">fell</a> to 1.5%.</p>
<p>In March, Paysafe announced it would stop supporting withdrawals and deposits for Binance in the United Kingdom and did so in May, which resulted in a subsequent drop of crypto trading volume denominated in the British pound across multiple platforms. At the time, the London-headquartered company said it would continue to support transfers for Binance in Europe and Latin America.</p>

<h2>Mastercard Unveils Multi-Token Network</h2>
<p>Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard&#8217;s head of crypto and blockchain, announced in a blog post on Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, we are taking the next step on our journey with the introduction of Mastercard Multi-Token Network, a tailor-made solution for the industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Our vision for MTN is to provide a set of foundational capabilities designed to make transactions within the digital asset and blockchain ecosystems secure, scalable, and interoperable — ultimately enabling more efficient payment and commerce applications,” he explained.</p>
<p>The new Multi-Token Network is an “app store powered by blockchain technologies for building regulated financial applications,” the executive told Fortune. The platform will provide developers with access to a range of tools that Mastercard has been developing in recent months, the publication conveyed, adding that these tools include a private version of the Ethereum blockchain, which Mastercard will promote for developers to build innovative applications.</p>
<p>The beta version of MTN will be released in the U.K. this summer, which will serve as a testing platform “for developing live pilot applications and use cases with financial institutions, fintechs, and central banks,” Dhamodharan&#8217;s blog post adds.</p>
<p>“The first phase of the applications will be powered by tokenized bank deposits. Over time, we plan to make MTN available in additional markets around the world,” the executive noted, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>MTN represents one of Mastercard’s most ambitious projects in the digital asset space to date … Our goal is to support the wider digital asset industry and interested parties to help fortify confidence in its future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dhamodharan explained that Mastercard believes that one day, digital asset and blockchain technologies will become &#8220;critical infrastructure for storing and moving value.&#8221;</p>
<p>The payment giant has actively engaged in multiple crypto, blockchain, and central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects, including crypto cards, CBDC pilots, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mastercard-debuts-blockchain-surveillance-tool-for-banks-and-crypto-centric-card-issuers/">Crypto Secure</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mastercard-to-help-banks-offer-crypto-trading-executive-says-crypto-is-on-the-cusp-of-really-going-mainstream/">Crypto Source</a>, and <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/latin-america/en/newsroom/press-releases/pr-en/2023/april/mastercard-launches-mastercard-crypto-credential-bringing-more-trust-to-the-blockchain-ecosystem/">Crypto Credential</a>. The company also recently filed a new <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hsbc-mastercard-file-more-crypto-related-trademark-applications/">trademark application</a> covering a range of crypto products and services.</p>

<h2>North Carolina Explores Holding Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The U.S. state of North Carolina has advanced House Bill 721 (HB721) titled “State Precious Metals Depository Study.” The bill appropriates $50,000 from the state’s general fund, which is made up of tax revenues, excluding transportation, to the state treasurer to conduct a study that examines three key areas. The first area involves:</p>
<blockquote><p>The process of acquiring, securely storing, insuring, and liquidating … virtual currency, such as bitcoin, that may be held on behalf of the state.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second area is the “expected impact of allocating a portion of the general fund” to “virtual currency to hedge against inflation and systemic credit risks, reduce overall portfolio volatility, and increase portfolio returns over time.”</p>
<p>The third is the “costs, benefits, and security of utilizing a privately managed depository or another state&#8217;s depository or creating a state-administered depository in North Carolina to serve as the custodian, guardian, and administrator of … virtual currency that may be transferred to or otherwise acquired by this state or an agency, a political subdivision, or another instrumentality of this state and to provide a repository for investors to use for such assets.”</p>
<p>Dan Spuller, senior director of Industry Affairs at Blockchain Association, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanSpuller/status/1674136730847399943">tweeted</a> Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a very important step to a more formal acknowledgement of bitcoin in North Carolina.</p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, HB721 did not include digital assets or bitcoin. Spuller <a href="https://twitter.com/DanSpuller/status/1669335062821629952">tweeted</a> on June 15 that he testified at the NC House Standing Committee in support of adding digital assets custody and bitcoin to the bill.</p>
<p>HB721 requires the NC Department of State Treasurer to report on the results of the study and provide recommendations to the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations by Jan. 1, 2024. The NC House passed the bill on the third reading on Wednesday. On Thursday, the bill passed the NC Senate&#8217;s first reading and is now referred to the Committee on Rules and Operations of the Senate.</p>

On social media, it has called out companies like Fidelity, Blackrock, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs, stating their actions propping up climate-destroying technologies are &#x201C;unacceptable.&#x201D;</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Change the Code Rails Against Wall Street Incumbents</h2>&#13;
<p>Change The Code, a campaign that seeks to change Bitcoin&#x2019;s consensus algorithm to &#x201C;fix&#x201D; its energy consumption, has called out Wall Street companies for their support of Bitcoin activities. The initiative, backed by Greenpeace and EWG, has criticized the recent push of financial incumbents toward Bitcoin-related investments.</p>&#13;
<p>Change The Code <a href="https://twitter.com/CleanUpBitcoin/status/1674106138877411330?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that Fidelity, Blackrock, Vanguard, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citi held shares in 24 mining companies valued at over $1.35 billion, <a href="https://twitter.com/CleanUpBitcoin/status/1674106138877411330?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accusing</a> Wall Street of &#x201C;going all in on Bitcoin&#x201D; and directly supporting these activities.</p>&#13;
<p>It <a href="https://twitter.com/CleanUpBitcoin/status/1673474473150885888?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The climate movement has worked to hold financial institutions and banks accountable for their fossil fuel investments. Propping up and profiting from industries destroying our climate is unacceptable.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Furthermore, Change the Code called on these incumbents to <a href="https://twitter.com/CleanUpBitcoin/status/1673836859754164224?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answer</a> for their &#x201C;dirty investments&#x201D; and &#x201C;support a code change to help <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> achieve near 100% efficiency.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>Change the Code Objectives</h2>&#13;
<p>The campaign to change the code of Bitcoin was launched in March when a group of so-called green organizations and crypto groups started to create awareness of the energy requirements of the Bitcoin network and its possible effects on the environment.</p>&#13;
<p>However, the recent barrage of bitcoin-related projects backed by established financial companies, including the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-backed-by-fidelity-schwab-citadel-launches-with-trading-of-4-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of EDX, a cryptocurrency exchange backed by Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, Paradigm, Sequoia Capital, and Virtu Financial, and the filing of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ran-neuner-believes-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-could-double-price-next-year-dismisses-malicious-intent-speculations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> ETF proposals by more incumbents, has taken the campaign to the offensive, <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/sharing-in-climate-chaos-asset-managers-and-banks-investment-prop-up-climate-polluting-bitcoin-mining-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> that &#x201C;these companies are turning a blind eye to these investments like other fossil fuel investments perpetuating climate chaos.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>The campaign advocates for Bitcoin to switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus that would reduce its energy consumption by almost 100%.</p>&#13;
<p>Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, completed a similar change in September as part of an update event called &#x201C;The Merge,&#x201D; which changed its network dynamics, leaving some miners out of business. The energy footprint of the protocol&#x2019;s entire operation was reduced by 99.99%, going from an <a href="https://zerocap.com/insights/articles/ethereum-energy-consumption-reduced/#:~:text=verify%20the%20transaction.-,Why%20Ethereum%20Energy%20Consumption%20Dropped%20by%2099.9%25,this%20falls%20to%20just%202%2C600." target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> 23 million megawatts of energy per year to just 2,600.</p>&#13;

The obligation will be introduced under a deal to implement globally agreed regulatory standards meant to improve the resilience of the financial institutions.</strong></p>
<h2>Deal Reached to Finalize EU Reforms of Banking Rules Addressing Crypto Risks</h2>
<p>Representatives of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission reached a provisional agreement to amend EU regulations on capital requirements for banks. The changes seek to make EU banks more resilient to economic shocks by implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III">Basel III</a> global standards while taking into account European specifics.</p>
<p>The third Basel Accord was agreed by the European Union and its G20 partners in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It represents a framework of international standards for bank capital adequacy, stress testing, and liquidity requirements which was first announced in late 2010 but its implementation was repeatedly postponed until 2025.</p>
<p>The negotiators also agreed on a transitional regime for crypto assets. To address specific, associated risks, banks in the European Union will be required to disclose their exposure to cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.</p>
<p>“Given the ongoing work of the Basel committee, it was decided that the Commission should come up with a relevant legislative proposal to implement these future Basel standard and specify the prudential treatment of such exposures during the transitional period,” the European Parliament said in a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230612IPR97201/deal-reached-to-finalise-reforms-of-banking-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Also, by Dec. 31, 2028, the European Commission is expected to assess the overall state of the banking system in Europe’s single market, working closely with the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB). The executive body in Brussels will then report to the European Parliament and the Council on the “appropriateness of the Union regulatory and supervisory frameworks for banks.”</p>
<p>In January of this year, members of the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/econ/home/highlights">ECON</a>) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/prohibitive-capital-rules-for-banks-holding-crypto-win-support-in-eu-parliament/">supported</a> a bill designed to enforce the global bank capital rules, including strict regulations meant to cover crypto-related risks for banking institutions keeping digital assets. ECON must also approve the latest agreement.</p>
<p>The deal comes after in April European lawmakers <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-parliament-greenlights-markets-in-crypto-assets-law-tracing-rules/">greenlighted</a> the EU’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law which introduces comprehensive regulations for the crypto industry in Europe. The legislation was also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-council-adopts-new-rules-for-europes-crypto-markets/">adopted</a> by the EU Council in May and will be implemented across the European Union by 2025.</p>

CEO John J. Ray III and other FTX executives have reportedly engaged in preliminary discussions with prospective investors, who could either acquire full ownership of the business or establish a joint venture.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX Aims for Resurgence: CEO and Executives Enter Discussions to Bring Back Crypto Exchange</h2>
<p>Over the past few days, FTX&#8217;s native exchange token, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/FTT/">FTT,</a> has experienced a substantial surge in value. In the last 24 hours alone, the crypto asset has seen a 40% increase. Furthermore, within the past week, FTT&#8217;s value has soared by over 100%, as it surpassed the $2 threshold on Thursday, June 29, 2023. This recent spike in FTT&#8217;s price is attributable to renewed speculation surrounding the potential reboot of FTX. The latest speculation originated from a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ftx-begins-talks-on-reboot-as-managers-uncover-past-misconduct-38ad7e3c">report</a> in the Wall Street Journal, which cites sources familiar with the matter stating that FTX management is actively seeking investors for the concept of FTX 2.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-continues-to-explore-potential-relaunch-court-records-reveal/">Court filings</a> and the current CEO of FTX, John J. Ray III, have confirmed these efforts on several occasions, stating, FTX “has begun the process of soliciting interested parties to the reboot of the FTX.com exchange.” According to insiders cited by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), FTX has entered into discussions with potential investors to explore the possibilities of a comprehensive relaunch, either independently or through a collaborative endeavor. It is worth noting that the revamped exchange would likely undergo a rebranding process, and discussions are underway regarding granting stakeholder positions to customers with outstanding claims, the report’s sources say.</p>
<p>Investors interested in participating in a joint venture or providing financial backing are encouraged to express their interest to FTX management within this week, as disclosed by the individuals familiar with the matter interviewed by the WSJ reporters. The recent surge of FTT has sparked a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/twitter-divided-as-speculations-swirl-around-ftx-2-0-reboot-supporters-rally-for-revival-opponents-skeptical/">heated debate</a> among social media users regarding the prospects of an FTX reboot. While some enthusiasts eagerly support relaunching the cryptocurrency exchange, others dismiss the idea as a futile endeavor. Lawyers had already <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-finds-7-3-billion-in-liquid-assets-lawyers-consider-rebooting-shuttered-crypto-exchange/">entertained</a> the notion of a reboot in mid-April 2023, and CEO Ray <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ftx-ceo-discusses-possibility-of-rebooting-defunct-crypto-exchange-in-first-interview-since-taking-over/">broached the topic</a> of re-establishing the exchange during his first interview after FTX collapsed.</p>
<p>Each time such announcements circulate, FTT&#8217;s price skyrockets. However, as the initial excitement dissipates, the token&#8217;s value against the U.S. dollar plunges significantly. The abysmal fundamentals of the token remain unchanged, even in the event of a relaunch, as the main deployer address distributed the entire supply after FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy. Moreover, <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/ftx-token/richlist/">statistics</a> from FTT&#8217;s rich list reveal that the top ten wallets hold a staggering 93.61% of the total supply, while the top 20 wallets account for 96.24%.</p>

Following accusations of insolvency and breaches of fiduciary responsibilities, Nevada&#x2019;s financial regulators mandated the closure of Prime Trust. Despite these challenges, Coinbits maintains confidence that the custodian &#x201C;still has enough bitcoin to honor our members&#x2019; balances.&#x201D;</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Investment App Coinbits Hit by Prime Trust Crisis, Halts Operations</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In light of the <a href="https://business.nv.gov/News_Media/Press_Releases/2023/Financial_Institutions/Nevada_Financial_Institutions_Division_files_court_petition_to_place__Prime_Trust_LLC_in_receivership/">financial difficulties</a> faced by the cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust, the bitcoin investment app Coinbits and its team have decided to suspend certain operations as a result of their association with the company. Coinbits made the <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbitsApp/status/1674071709635297283?s=20">announcement</a> in a Twitter thread, expressing that it was an unfortunate message they had never anticipated sharing.&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is thread that we would never have wanted to write. We&#x2019;ve been posting updates on our website and in email, but we think it&#x2019;s important to communicate directly to Bitcoin Twitter about what the Prime Trust meltdown means for Coinbits.</p>
<p>&#x2014; Coinbits | DCA into bitcoin (@CoinbitsApp) <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbitsApp/status/1674071709635297283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Coinbits insisted customers have been duly notified about the ongoing concerns through the platform&#x2019;s website and email communications. In essence, the Twitter thread provides insights into Coinbits&#x2019; utilization of Prime Trust as a custodian.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, due to regulatory challenges in Nevada, Coinbits has been <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbitsApp/status/1674071728190881794?s=20">compelled</a> to temporarily suspend the majority of its services. Despite this setback, the team remains optimistic that Prime Trust possesses sufficient <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> to settle customer balances.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Coinbits stated, &#x201C;The petition from the Nevada Department of Business and Industry seems to indicate that Prime Trust still has enough bitcoin to honor our members&#x2019; balances. We are pursuing these assets on behalf of our members.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to a court filing submitted to the Eighth Judicial District Court in Las Vegas, the Nevada Financial Institutions Division <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nevadas-financial-watchdog-seeks-receivership-of-crypto-custodian-prime-trust-amidst-insolvency-concerns/">disclosed</a> that Prime Trust had a debt of $85.67 million in fiat currency to its clients. However, the company only possessed $2.90 million to cover this amount.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Additionally, Prime Trust owed $69.50 million in crypto to its clients, but only possessed $68.64 million, leaving a shortfall of $83.63 million between both crypto and fiat. The court filing further explains that the company incurred these losses due to wallets becoming inaccessible following a management transition.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In line with the court filing, blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1674082493765656581?s=20">tweeted</a> that it had potentially located a wallet containing $45 million, with 90% of the funds consisting of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a>. The Prime Trust issue has gained significant attention across social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Wow &#x2013; Prime Trust receivership will be a mess [and] it&#x2019;s *EXACTLY* what the State of Wyoming enacted its laws to avoid,&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1673759457933664284?s=20">remarked</a> Caitlin Long, the founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, on Tuesday. Long also raised important inquiries, stating, &#x201C;[Big questions]: Who will pay the legal bills&#x2014;[Nevada] taxpayers or Prime Trust customers? Some Prime Trust customers are IRAs/ERISA plans&#x2014;can these even be bailed in?&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The exact extent of the impact still remains uncertain, but it is known that both Coinbits and Stably have been affected by Prime Trust&#x2019;s problems. The number of other firms affected has yet to be determined.&#13;<br />

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Solana (SOL) was a notable mover in today&#x2019;s session, as the price rose by over 10%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $15.75 during Wednesday&#x2019;s session, SOL/USD jumped to a peak of $18.20 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This resulted in the world&#x2019;s ninth largest cryptocurrency climbing to its highest point in the past 20 days.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of the rally, the 10-day (red) moving average is now on the cusp of an upward crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) appears to be nearing a breakout of a resistance point around the 51.00 level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index is currently tracking at 50.87, with SOL at $17.35, after giving up earlier gains.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>) was in the green on Thursday, racing to a fresh multi-month high in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>/USD surged to an intraday high of $247.64 earlier in the day, a day after dropping to a bottom at $223.50.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this latest rally, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> moved to its strongest point since May 11 last year, when price peaked at $249.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This latest move comes as the RSI once again broke out of a ceiling at the 80.00 level, after dropping below this point the day prior.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, the index is tracking at 81.72, which remains deep in overbought territory, and could prompt bears to reenter the market.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite this, traders will likely attempt to reach a target at $250.00 first, before any inevitable sell-offs.&#13;<br />
