										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Montenegro court has accepted a bail <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2023-05-12/montenegro-court-agrees-to-release-founder-of-cryptocurrency-firm-terraform-labs-on-bail" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">payment on behalf</a> of Do Kwon, the disgraced crypto executive behind fallen digital currency firm Terraform Labs. The company established the crumbled algorithmic stable currency known as Terra USD.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon is Out on Bail</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Kwon – along with another detained South Korean man believed to have been involved in the project – is out of prison after presenting $435,000 to court officials to ensure he would not have to await his upcoming trial behind bars. He is now confined to a nearby apartment, and he and his associate are not allowed to leave the domicile until the trial has been concluded.</p>
<p>The court has put out the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>They promised&#8230; they will not hide until the end of the criminal procedures, that they will regularly answer court summons, and that they will be available [at] the address submitted by their attorney. If the defendants run away or violate the surveillance measure, the bail will fall through and will be added to the special budget for court work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kwon was a fugitive for some time <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-executive-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro/" data-wpel-link="internal">after his company</a> completely collapsed and (figuratively) burnt to the ground. Organizations such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged him with fraud, and it wasn’t long before his own country of South Korea issued a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>Kwon remained active on social media for a while after the warrant was issued. He said he was not on the run, and that he was willing to cooperate with police authorities in any way possible. He also said he wasn’t going anywhere, and that he was busily coding in his living room, thus practically inviting police to come knock on his door and question him in his company’s failings.</p>
<p>However, the social media activity didn’t last forever, and it wasn’t long before Kwon shut his accounts down and proceeded to make his way across the globe allegedly to hide himself from those who would see him behind bars. His plight didn’t last long, however, as it was in the nation of Montenegro (where he possessed multiple fake passports) that he was finally caught.</p>
<h2>A Rug Pull, Perhaps?</h2>
<p>At the time of his detainment, authorities in that nation put out the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Montenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs. The former ‘cryptocurrency king’, who is behind losses of more than 40 billion dollars, was detained at the Podgorica airport with falsified documents, and South Korea, the USA, and Singapore are demanding [his extradition].</p></blockquote>
<p>Kwon has been accused of initiating a rug pull given he and his fellow executives switched several of their Terra assets out for BTC prior to the collapse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ohio law enforcement agencies are telling residents about <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ohio-agencies-warn-of-cryptocurrency-scams-targeting-older-ohioans/ar-AA19AS7D" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">several growing crypto</a> scams in the area that are targeting members of the elderly community.</p>
<h2>Ohio Is a Center of Crypto Fraud</h2>
<p>There are many <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto scams</a> out there that seek to take advantage of older generations given they don’t always understand how computers or modern technology work. For this reason, they’re less likely to question things that might appear suspicious to others. Many of them also have heavy retirements saved up that make them “richer” than other individuals in scammers eyes.</p>
<p>The Ohio Narcotics Intelligence Center (ONIC) is claiming that it became aware of these scams against elderly citizens through a string of recent drug-related investigations. Andy Wilson – director of the Ohio Department of Public Safety – explained in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, ONIC has assisted several local law enforcement agencies with their cryptocurrency scam investigations. Our agencies issued this bulletin to raise awareness about the dangers of these new scams targeting older Ohioans. We are working closely together to make resources available for consumers who believe they have been a target.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further mentioned that several of the scammers are in regular contact with their victims as a means of guiding them through the process of sending funds via bitcoin ATMs and similar tools. It’s often very difficult to track funds that are delivered this way, and about 90 percent of the time, once crypto is gone, it’s gone for good.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission is now warning residents of Ohio – and the general U.S. population – about the growing number of scams and telling them about things to watch out for. For example, it said no legitimate business will ever ask that you forward crypto funds, as many of these companies are likely to operate through cash and even then, they’ll only ask you for payments if transactions occurred and you’ve bought products or services.</p>
<p>In addition, meeting people on dating sites or applications that request to show you how to invest in digital currency sites usually means they’re not who they say they are, and they’re looking to carry out theft.</p>
<p>Also, no business will engage in texting, emailing, or messaging on social media to try and get you to part with money, nor will they ever ask that you purchase anything with digital assets. Lastly, if you do wind up getting a social media message, text, or email from an entity you don’t recognize, and it contains a link of some sort, it’s best to avoid clicking on it.</p>
<h2>Going After Old People Ain&#8217;t Cool</h2>
<p>Ohio Department of Aging Director Ursel J. McElroy said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the fact that older adults are more likely to report suspected fraud than younger adults, scammers are finding new and sophisticated ways to deceive people, like these emerging cryptocurrency scams.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many people out there that simply associate blockchain with crypto and digital currencies, but it works quite well when <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blockchain-real-estate-more-accessible-153618572.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">performing transactions and other</a> activities pertaining to real estate.</p>
<h2>Real Estate Is the Way to Go</h2>
<p>In America, real estate has always been king. It’s often said that if you can buy your own house, you’re pretty much set for life. In addition, while everyone talks about the stock market and gold and other precious metals, most of the rich people in this nation invest in real estate. From Donald Trump to Warren Buffett, having properties to your name is the way to become a billionaire.</p>
<p>Several analysts think blockchain and real estate could make a good team, and that bringing the latter onto the former would make it more accessible to everyday investors that haven’t had clear and concise access to the American dream. A new report from Citigroup states the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Traditional real estate often struggles with poor transparency, illiquidity, and multiple intermediaries. Blockchain could be a good fit as a single shared source of truth in a market with multiple players, all working with overlapping data and the need for constant reconciliation. Tokenization could also help reduce minimum investment amounts and open asset discovery.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trevor Bacon – co-founder and CEO of real estate investing platform Parcl – also threw his two cents into the mix. He said putting real estate on the blockchain could ensure its future as a yield source through decentralized means. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can tokenize a loan, a house, a building, or car loans. You can put that on the blockchain and it’s a much more efficient way to do stuff… We’re allowing people to speculate, hedge, bet, and trade on real estate prices much like they would on any other type of stock or derivative. Real world assets are a new theme. It’s a moniker for what people are doing, using the blockchain for real utility rather than NFTs or gaming… From an operational perspective, it’s more efficient. It’s all done through software. You could issue a mortgage directly instead of going through a bank. It’s governed through smart contracts and enforceable by software, not people.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Inaccessible for Over a Year</h2>
<p>For the last year and a half or so, real estate in America has been virtually inaccessible. A big reason for this is because Joe Biden – the current commander-in-chief – has instilled economic policies that have ultimately brought the nation to its knees. Inflation is at an all-time high, and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-fed-bitcoins-worst-enemy-right-now/" data-wpel-link="internal">thus the Fed has been</a> forced into a position of constantly having to hike rates.</p>
<p>These rate hikes have hurt people’s finances and made it so that many of them can no longer afford things like cars and homes, thus edging them out of major ownership opportunities.</p>

<li>The pair must clear $140 and $142 to continue higher in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is climbing above $130 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-aim-fresh-uptrend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $142 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price formed a decent support base above the $100 level. BCH started a decent increase and was able to clear the $115 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the $120 and $125 resistance levels. It even spiked above $145 and traded as high as $149.56. It is now trading above the $125 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-bulls-eye-recovery-to-115/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. The current price action is positive, suggesting high chances of more gains.</p>
<p>There is also a key rising channel forming with support near $133.00 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $140.80 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $142 level, above which the price may perhaps rise toward the $150 level. Any more gains above $150 could set the pace for a move toward the $160 level.</p>
<p>Immediate support on the downside is near the channel trend line at $133.00. The first major support sits near the $120 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $90.77 swing low to the $149.56 high.</p>
<p>The next support is near the $113 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $90.77 swing low to the $149.56 high, below which the bears might aim for $105. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $100 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Canton Network is a brand new blockchain system. Very few people appear to have heard of it at press time, but there’s a good chance this blockchain is going to be making waves soon throughout the industry given the names it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/deloitte-goldman-sachs-microsoft-among-institutional-players-partnering-on-new-blockchain-network/ar-AA1aXaVw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">attracting in terms of partnerships</a>.</p>
<h2>Canton Blockchain Network Getting Big and Bold</h2>
<p>Thus far, the company has joined hands with some of the biggest companies in both technology and finance including Goldman Sachs, Deloitte, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Behind the implementation of the Canton Network is a firm called Digital Asset, a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> startup that was once led by former JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters. Yuval Rooz – co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset – explained in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the first time, financial institutions can realize the full benefits of a global blockchain network while operating within the regulatory guardrails.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, other big companies to join hands with Cantos include BNP Paribas, CBOE, Moody’s, and even Paxos, which creates stable currencies for companies like PayPal and Binance, the biggest and most popular digital currency trading platform in the world. These firms have been experimenting with the Cantos network for some time already, though it’s not quite clear what their intentions are.</p>
<p>In any case, the news is positive in that it suggests blockchain technology is becoming more mainstream and legitimate. It has been said over the last few years that blockchain, while primarily used for crypto-based transactions and financial confirmations, can be utilized in several other industries from healthcare to manufacturing. While there is certainly <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266660302100021X#:~:text=In%20healthcare%2C%20a%20blockchain%20network%20is%20useful%20to,deception%20in%20clinical%20trials%20for%20better%20healthcare%20outcomes." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">evidence supporting this</a>, the statement has never fully been put into action given blockchain is still very much a birthing technology that some people do not trust enough to try.</p>
<p>As such, blockchain – while revolutionary – is not accomplishing all it can, and primarily remains confined to the crypto arena. However, with names like Microsoft and Deloitte now entering the picture, one can assume that blockchain is going to pick up steam and attract the attention of many other companies similar in both size and scope.</p>
<p>Regarding what her company has in mind for blockchain and Canton, Cathy Clay – an executive vice president of CBOE Global Markets – explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>By leveraging new blockchain technologies, we can potentially unlock new opportunities for market participants. Efforts like the Canton Network will help our industry further explore this frontier.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Tokenization of Assets?</h2>
<p>While unclear, it’s believed that many of the above-mentioned companies are primarily interested in the tokenization of assets such as stocks and bonds. The tokenization process of these assets would ultimately remove all middlemen and third parties required for verification, thus ensuring they’re safer for their users and that auditing is easier in the future.</p>
<p>Many of these companies also claim to have been examining blockchain for years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The popular crypto network Solana is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solana-labs-opening-25-000-164716748.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">opening a new office</a> in downtown Manhattan, New York. The office will occupy roughly 25,000 square feet in a multiple-story building.</p>
<h2>Solana and New York&#8230; An Unusual Match</h2>
<p>Solana is presently the tenth largest digital currency by market capitalization. The news is odd for several reasons, one being that several brick-and-mortar, Solana-themed locations and stores in both New York and Miami just shut down, suggesting the area hasn’t offered Solana the popularity or attention it clearly felt it deserved.</p>
<p>In addition, it’s interesting that Solana would choose New York as its place of residence given that the Empire State has proven to be quite anti-crypto over the past several years and continues to do so. Not long ago, a crypto moratorium in the region <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/some-want-the-crypto-moratorium-in-new-york-to-last-longer/" data-wpel-link="internal">was instituted as a means</a> of preventing any new digital currency mining companies from stepping in and setting up quarters within the state’s borders. It was decided that only those who chose to run fully on clean, renewable energy could gain access to New York territory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Leticia James – New York’s present Attorney General – has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-attorney-generals-office-now-suing-ku-coin-exchange/" data-wpel-link="internal">gone after every digital</a> currency company she can with full force and steam. She has sued several institutions from Celsius to Ku Coin to Coin Ex, and it doesn’t look like this string of lawsuits is going to stop anytime soon.</p>
<p>She has stated in the past that this is a measure to try and prevent further fraud and corruption in the digital currency industry but considering her actions against <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/york-ag-letitia-james-files-250m-lawsuit-trump/story?id=90240332" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">President Donald Trump</a>, as well as New York’s implementation of restrictive bills such as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitlicense/" data-wpel-link="internal">the BitLicense</a>, one can’t help but see her actions as just more attempts to end innovation in her state.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it appears – for now, at least – like New York is the spot Solana has chosen. A spokesperson for the company explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Solana Labs did not purchase the space. Solana Labs is a tenant of the 141 E Houston St. [building]. The company has a ten-year lease and occupies floors [six through nine]. 75 percent of the space is reserved for Solana ecosystem teams to co-work for free upon approval.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Allowing Entrepreneurs to Work with Each Other</h2>
<p>New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) president and CEO Andrew Kimball also threw his two cents into the mix, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>New York City has all the ingredients to be the global epicenter of Web3. It has the arts, culture, innovation, technology, and talent. It’s exciting to see the Solana community plant a flag right here in New York and let the world know the city is the place to build in blockchain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Raj Gokal – the co-founder of Solana Labs – says the new office space will be a perfect area for new entrepreneurs to build and collaborate with each other.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Neon EVM?</strong></p>
<p>Neon EVM is a low-friction solution that enables Ethereum dApps to settle transactions on Solana, eliminating the gap between these two leading blockchains.</p>
<p>Neon EVM positions Ethereum developers to enjoy the best of Solana’s network, from low fees to high transaction speeds, and parallel transaction execution capabilities.</p>
<p>While Solana is one of the fastest, organically-growing chains, its incompatibility with EVM has left several hundred million in TVL, millions of users, and an entire ecosystem untouched by EVM multichain dApp developers — until now.</p>
<p>Neon EVM’s pioneering solution is <em>the </em>anticipated innovation in the Solana ecosystem and makes Solana a viable option for multichain builders. Neon EVM brings together the best of both chains while ensuring the finality of settlements on Solana.</p>
<p><strong>What is Neon EVM closed beta?</strong></p>
<p>The launch of the closed beta version of Neon EVM, Neon EVM<sub>β</sub>, to Solana’s Mainnet is a significant milestone on the roadmap.</p>
<p>Neon EVM<sub>β</sub> is a fully-functioning Neon EVM with one major alteration: it supports fee-free transactions.</p>
<p>This means that all transactions are settled to Solana’s L1 and require payment in Sol, as per any Solana-settled transaction. However, in beta, the NEON token is not requested by the Proxy Operator responsible for accepting the transaction request and ensuring that it is finalized.</p>
<h4>Why launch in beta?</h4>
<p>The Neon EVM ecosystem includes many more players than just the Neon EVM and the Proxy Operators that accept and settle transaction requests. It includes DAO, oracles, indexers, wallets, multisigs, bridges, explorers, and more. Neon EVM<sub>β</sub> provides an opportunity for all parties to deploy and test to ensure the seamless integration of their services before the official Solana Mainnet launch.</p>
<p>While Neon EVM could have chosen to do a Shadow Mainnet launch on a fork of the Solana mainchain, launching directly to Mainnet offers significant advantages. Not least of which is that deployed and tested contracts will retain their addresses on Solana Mainnet.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-78897 aligncenter" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/06/Picture28-600x265.png" alt="" width="600" height="265" /></p>
<p><strong>Why launch in <em>closed</em> beta?</strong></p>
<p>Launching in closed beta allows the Neon EVM team to onboard and test the services of ecosystem players in controlled phases. The first phase onboarded the infrastructure components, and the second phase accepted dApps and will test the connection of wallets.</p>
<p>Operating in closed beta also controls the budget by keeping the activity limited to an invite-only list. Remember, while the Proxy Operator is not charging a fee, the Solana network still does. It simply is not possible to provide an open beta and predict the cost in Sol for such an initiative (though it is possible to predict that the Sol cost will be less than the equivalent Eth cost would be for an EVM settling to Ethereum!).</p>
<p>When the testing period ends and NEON tokens are available on the market to pay for transactions, Neon EVM will switch back to its normal operation mode. This means that independent Proxy Operators (P2P and Everstake) will resume responsibility for accepting and processing transactions. The Proxy Operator’s RPC endpoints will be made available on <a href="https://chainlist.org/?chain=245022926&amp;testnets=true&amp;search=Neon+EVM" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ChainList</a>.</p>
<h4>Want to get involved?</h4>
<p>While Neon EVM is deployed to Solana Mainnet at address <a href="https://solscan.io/account/NeonVMyRX5GbCrsAHnUwx1nYYoJAtskU1bWUo6JGNyG" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">NeonVMyRX5GbCrsAHnUwx1nYYoJAtskU1bWUo6JGNyG</a>, as this is a closed beta, unless you are on the guest list, it won’t accept your transactions yet.</p>
<p>To engage with the community, you can find us on <a href="https://twitter.com/Neon_EVM" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">Twitter</a> and join Neon EVM’s very active <a href="https://discord.gg/neonevm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Discord</a> to meet some of our long-term and loyal community builders. For a high-level overview of the technical architecture and features of Neon EVM, the whitepaper is available at <a href="https://neonevm.org/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">NeonEVM.org/whitepaper.pdf</a>. To follow the activity of the network, you can view Neon EVM transactions settled to Solana with the <a href="https://shadow.neonscan.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">NeonScan</a> dashboard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do Kwon – the disgraced crypto executive behind the Luna token and Terra USD – has pleaded not guilty to <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/05/11/disgraced-terra-cofounder-do-kwon-pleads-not-guilty-after-hes-arrested-in-montenegro-holding-3-different-passports/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">fraud and other crimes</a> after he was arrested in the European nation of Montenegro last month while holding three phony passports.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon: I Haven&#8217;t Done Anything!</h2>
<p>Kwon was a fugitive for some time <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-executive-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro/" data-wpel-link="internal">after his company</a> completely collapsed and (figuratively) burnt to the ground. Organizations such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged him with fraud, and it wasn’t long before his own country of South Korea issued a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>Kwon remained active on social media for a while after the warrant was issued. He said he was not on the run, and that he was willing to cooperate with police authorities in any way possible. He also said he wasn’t going anywhere, and that he was busily coding in his living room, thus practically inviting police to come knock on his door and question him in his company’s failings.</p>
<p>However, the social media activity didn’t last forever, and it wasn’t long before Kwon shut his accounts down and proceeded to make his way across the globe allegedly to hide himself from those who would see him behind bars. His plight didn’t last long, however, as it was in the nation of Montenegro (where he possessed multiple fake passports) that he was finally caught.</p>
<p>At the time of his detainment, authorities in that nation put out the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Montenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs. The former ‘cryptocurrency king’, who is behind losses of more than 40 billion dollars, was detained at the Podgorica airport with falsified documents, and South Korea, the USA, and Singapore are demanding [his extradition].</p></blockquote>
<p>Terra USD – prior <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">to the fall of FTX</a>, a popular digital currency exchange – was arguably the biggest shock to the crypto world. As an algorithmic stable currency, the token had no real collateral backing it up, and it was only people’s belief in the currency that kept it on sturdy legs.</p>
<h2>A Rug Pull?</h2>
<p>Sadly, this belief seemed to die off quickly as it wasn’t long before the token lost its peg and fell to zero, thus causing investors to lose billions of dollars overnight. While there were a few attempts to revive the token, all proved fruitless, and the token became the latest embarrassment of the industry.</p>
<p>However, after this occurred, evidence emerged suggesting that Kwon and his fellow executives had tried to take their Terra reserves and convert them to BTC just weeks prior to the collapse, suggesting they knew the event was coming and that a “rug pull” was potentially being initiated.</p>

<li>EOS price is trading in a bearish zone below the $0.80 support against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above $0.66 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $0.660 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to rise toward the $0.75 and $0.78 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is struggling below $0.80 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-aim-fresh-uptrend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. The price might attempt to recover if there is a clear move above $0.75.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few sessions, EOS price range moves below the $0.65 resistance against the US Dollar. The price remained stable above the $0.590 and $0.600 support levels.</p>
<p>A low is formed near $0.5987 and the price is now attempting an upside correction. There was a move above the $0.630 and $0.650 resistance levels. Besides, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.9040 swing high to the $0.5987 low.</p>
<p>There was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $0.660 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair. The price is now trading above $0.66 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-downtrend-intact-below-0-80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.75 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.9040 swing high to the $0.5987 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.780 level, above which the price might test the $0.80 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.900 level.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.675 level. The next key support is near the $0.64 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.640 support, the price could test the $0.60 support in the near term.</p>
