What Is The Lido Finance Protocol V2 Update Earlier in February 2023, an official Lido Finance announcement release introduced a V2 update proposal that brings unique enhancement features to its Ethereum liquid staking platform. Today Lido contributors are proud to present Lido V2 &#8211; Lidoâ€™s largest upgrade to date and an important step towards further decentralization. https://t.co/SDxlxCgMNq pic.twitter.com/KJewhEp8rV &#8212; Lido (@LidoFinance) February 7, 2023 Fast forward to May, the team scheduled a final on-chain voting process for its V2 update proposal to take place from the 12th-15th following the success of the Ethereum Shapella upgrade in April. According to a tweet from Lido&#8217;s official handle, if the vote on the proposal passes and is successful, the V2 update will go live on May 15th, which is today, and support direct in-protocol stETH: ETH withdrawals and staking router architecture. So far, the V2 update proposal has been approved as it got the required approval and support rating needed for the update. ðŸ‘€ https://t.co/GMrXGuLIdT pic.twitter.com/4wfk6zgJbM &#8212; Lido (@LidoFinance) May 15, 2023 The V2 update on the biggest liquid staking platform brings two new core platform features, including a Staking Router and a Withdrawal feature. The Staking Router feature on the V2 update promotes a diverse and decentralized ecosystem of validators by allowing the admission of new node operators. Using a new modular architectural design and framework, the V2 Staking Router enables anyone to develop on-ramps for node operators ranging from Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), solo stakers, and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The second feature on the update, withdrawals, will be a game changer for Lido Finance as it enables stakers on the platform who hold stETH to have access to withdrawals at a 1:1 ratio.
