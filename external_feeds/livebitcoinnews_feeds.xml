<li>Ethereum price is eyeing an upside break above the $1,760 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>ETH price is now trading above $1,720 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,725 on the 4-hour chart (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could climb further if it stays above the $1,685 support zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is rising above the $1,720 level against the US Dollar. ETH/USD could rise further if it clears the $1,760 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, Ethereum saw a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-consolidates-below-key-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bearish wave</a> from the $1,900 zone against the US Dollar. ETH price declined below the $1,800 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>The bears even pushed the price below the $1,700 level. A low was formed near $1,620 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1,680 resistance level. The price broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,898 swing high to the $1,620 low.</p>
<p>There was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,725 on the 4-hours chart. It is now trading above $1,720 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,760 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-turns-red-below-1850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">downward move</a> from the $1,898 swing high to the $1,620 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,800 zone. A clear move above the $1,800 level could send the price toward $1,850.</p>
<p>Any more gains could even send the price toward the $1,900 resistance zone or $1,920 in the near term. On the downside, initial support is near the $1,700 level. The next major support is now near the $1,680 level.</p>
<p>A break below the $1,680 support could push the price to $1,620. Any more losses could lead the price toward $1,550 or even $1,500 in the coming days.</p>
<div id="attachment_78860" style="width: 1835px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/06/Ethereum-3.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78860" class="size-full wp-image-78860" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/06/Ethereum-3.png" alt="Ethereum Price" width="1835" height="845" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-78860" class="wp-caption-text">Ethereum Price</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trade Station Group, Inc. – a company in Florida that provides self-clearing online brokerage services for trading options, futures, stocks, and digital currencies – is joining hands with the University of Miami to help the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tradestation-announces-title-sponsorship-university-130000203.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">organization launch its first</a> ever Business of Blockchain Technology Conference, an event that will be devoted entirely to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> and crypto-based initiatives.</p>
<h2>Trade Station Pushes Miami&#8217;s Crypto Agenda</h2>
<p>The event will be presented by AIS SIGBIT and the University of Miami Patti and Allan Herbert Business School. It will take place in Coral Gables, Florida.</p>
<p>For the past several years, Trade Station has been a state leader in the advancement of digital currency and blockchain education, training, and investing. With nearly four decades of experience under its belt, the company seeks to help financial investors find edges that allow them to stay ahead of the monetary game and keep competitive streaks going as long as possible.</p>
<p>John Bartleman – president and chief executive officer of Trade Station – commented in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the premier sponsor for Miami Herbert&#8217;s inaugural Business of Blockchain Technology Conference, we are thrilled to support this highly relevant gathering. This event paves the way for an insightful discourse on the obstacles presented by blockchain models that hold sway across multiple industries.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conference will also serve as a forum for international academics and policymakers to talk about the upcoming blockchain research initiatives they’re involved with. They’ll also discuss things like best practices for financial decentralization and how they can be enhanced through blockchain.</p>
<p>Ola Henfridsson – professor and associate dean of online business programs at Miami Herbert Business School – explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are proud to have Trade Station be a title sponsor of our first-ever Business of Blockchain Technology Conference. As Miami continues to flourish as a prominent tech hub, we eagerly anticipate a long-lasting and fruitful relationship with Trade Station.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conference will kick off at the hands of James Putra, the vice president and group head of product management at Trade Station Group. He will provide the opening remarks, while Meena Mani – senior vice president of brokerage and crypto product development – will take part in a panel soon after.</p>
<h2>40 Years of Experience</h2>
<p>Last year, Trade Station became an official fintech sponsor of the University of Miami’s athletics department. In its role, the company was featured across all the UM athletics ventures. The company has also provided individual or separate education programs to students, faculty, fans, and alumni to help them trade better and make more focused investing decisions.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 1982 and has won multiple awards for all the work it’s done over the last 41 years. In 2022, the company commissioned what’s come to be known as the Miami bull, a large statue in the city commemorating its growing financial arena.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mathieu Michel – the digital minister of Belgium – is <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/belgium-digital-minister-eu-crypto-blockchain-092425913.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">confident that what the</a> European Union (EU) has in store for bitcoin, crypto, and blockchain will be huge not just for the continent, but for the world.</p>
<h2>Mathieu Michel Discusses the Prospects of the EU&#8217;s Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Not long ago, the region of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/european-union-passes-heavy-string-of-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">Europe announced that</a> it was preparing a whole new string of high-end crypto regulations. Known as Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), the regulations are set to bring about a whole new level of trust in blockchain and crypto that nobody has ever seen before. These regulations will be the first of their kind and will take full shape somewhere between 2024 and 2025.</p>
<p>Michel explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new MiCA bill will boost the crypto industry in Europe because Europeans are really strong on building regulation, and the purpose of this regulation is always to build trust. There are lots of opportunities for blockchain in the way value is exchanged, but it [needs] to be done in a trusted ecosystem, which is why MiCA has the power to unleash the potential of this industry. If you think that crypto is just a currency, this is a bad way to identify crypto assets. Many people only see crypto assets as a financial tool. I see them as a way we can exchange values and a way we can protect privacy. The EU will use MiCA to bring order to crypto through regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michel further said that these regulations are not designed to give the EU a competitive advantage, but rather to expand innovation in the crypto space by ensuring it&#8217;s safe and trustworthy for all. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It will help us develop a strong crypto ecosystem because we have a lot of talent in Europe that understands the next wave of innovation will be web3.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Europe to Have Its Own Blockchain?</h2>
<p>In addition, the continent is looking to ensure it develops what Michel calls “concrete” blockchain applications within the next year or so. One of those applications will be called Europeum, a blockchain specifically built for and tailored to the European way of life. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Belgium will have the EU presidency in 2024, and one of my goals then will be to transform the European blockchain concept from a technical project into a political project, to create concrete applications for the blockchain, pioneering digital wallets and digital identity. I have suggested the idea of a European blockchain, called Europeum, for digital payments and smart contracts. The need for a European blockchain arises from concerns over the dependence on foreign technology providers and the potential risks associated with that. It would have several advantages…Additionally, a European blockchain could provide greater security and privacy for transactions, as well as offering benefits such as transparency and efficiency.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is beginning to appear bullish again in <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/bitcoin-janet-yellen-warns-us-of-cash-june-101930054.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">several technical charts after</a> Janet Yellen – the present U.S. Treasury Secretary – said it was Congress’ job to raise the debt ceiling… or else.</p>
<h2>Janet Yellen Wants the Debt Ceiling Raised</h2>
<p>Yellen warned that this could be the month in which the United States runs out of money if Congress didn&#8217;t act quickly. The problem with raising the debt ceiling was that it’s already high enough as it is. Right now, the ceiling stands beyond the $31 trillion point, and Biden isn’t helping the situation given the high number of trillion-dollar spending bills he signed his name to.</p>
<p>Actions like these have caused record inflation and placed the American economy in a very unstable place over the past year and a half. The idea that this isn’t enough for Yellen is scary, and raising the debt ceiling could lead to more problems than solutions if not handled properly, and let’s just say it… What <em>has</em> been handled properly since Biden and his group of nation-hating cronies took their present positions in the American government?</p>
<p>In an interview, Yellen stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the debt ceiling is not raised by June, the Treasury would then find itself in the position where it is unable to pay all of the bills that are due that day, and this would be the first time in the history of America that we would fail to make payments that are due. Whether this is to default on interest payments, or [a] payment for social security recipients, we would simply not have enough cash to meet all our obligations, so it is widely agreed that financial and economic chaos would then ensue. It&#8217;s Congress&#8217; job to do this and if they fail to do it, we will have an economic and financial catastrophe that will be of our own making.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the time this speech was made, bitcoin was trading in the mid-$27K range, a clear dip from where it was the month prior. The world’s number one digital currency by market cap had been slightly higher before, but endured a short period of suffering <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/binance-halted-withdrawals-in-mid-may-btc-temporarily-fell/" data-wpel-link="internal">after Binance announced</a> that it was temporarily halting all withdrawals involving the asset due to high traffic.</p>
<h2>Trying to Keep Their Holdings Secure</h2>
<p>However, analysts say the amount of bitcoin that’s been removed from exchanges and placed in cold storage over the past few weeks is a good sign. It suggests traders are confident the price of the asset could rise, and they want to keep their assets safe in the hopes that price surges will occur soon.</p>
<p>In addition, they’re pointing to data that says many long-term bitcoin holders are now suddenly working to increase their holdings exponentially, suggesting even further that these individuals are confident in bitcoin’s bullish potential.</p>

<p><em>Stellar lumen price is trading below $0.0820 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. XLM price could extend losses if it trades below the $0.0778 support.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>After a sharp decline below $0.082, Stellar Lumen price moved into a bearish zone against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair traded below the $0.0800 level.</p>
<p>There was also a spike below the $0.0765 support zone. A low was formed near $0.0752 before the price started an upside correction. There was a move above the $0.0765 and $0.0778 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0862 swing high to the $0.0752 low.</p>
<p>The price is now facing resistance near the $0.0808 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0862 swing high to the $0.0752 low.</p>
<p>There is also a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0812 on the 4-hour chart. XLM is now trading below $0.0820 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-faces-uphill-task-near-0-086/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.0778 level. The next major support is near the $0.0750 zone.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Ripple price is consolidating near $0.488 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. XRP price must stay above the $0.4820 support to start a fresh increase.</em></p>
<h2>Ripple Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ripple price saw a strong increase above the $0.520 resistance against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair even climbed above the $0.545 resistance to move into a positive zone.</p>
<p>There was a steady increase and the price climbed toward the $0.550 resistance. A high was formed near $0.5650 and the price recently corrected lower. There was a move below the $0.525 and $0.500 levels. It tested the $0.4550 zone.</p>
<p>A low is formed near $0.4550 and the price is now moving higher. It broke the $0.465 resistance zone. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5650 swing high to the $0.4550 low.</p>
<p>XRP price is now trading below $0.50 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-fresh-rally-possible-above-0-54/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.

<p>The next major resistance is near the $0.510 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5650 swing high to the $0.4550 low. A clear move above the $0.510 resistance zone might start a strong increase. In the stated case, the price could even surpass the $0.540 resistance.</p>
<p>Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5650 resistance. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.4820 level. The next major support is near the $0.475 level. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.4550 level, below which the price might even test $0.420.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin endured a bit of a dip in mid-May when it <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-slides-after-network-congestion-leads-binance-to-briefly-halt-withdrawals/ar-AA1aTPjH" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">was announced that</a> Binance would briefly halt all withdrawals and deposits due to ongoing congestion and traffic.</p>
<h2>Binance Came to a Standstill (so Did BTC)</h2>
<p>Bitcoin had been trading in the $29,000 range prior, and there were many analysts out there who felt the world’s number one digital currency by market cap was on the verge of striking $30K again like it did in April. Sadly, it appears Binance got in the way of this and set BTC back a few steps.</p>
<p>While the halts were temporary and lasted only a short while, the damage was done to BTC, which had to fall back a few steps before it could proceed with its prior trek up the financial staircase. Binance issued the following tweet after the halts came to an end:</p>
<blockquote><p>To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed. Our team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Joel Kruger – market strategist at LMAX Group – stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reports of a large bitcoin outflow and withdrawals being paused at a major exchange could be factoring into some of the weakness we&#8217;re seeing. Ultimately, however, there haven&#8217;t been any major developments as far as price action goes, with bitcoin still very much confined to a multi-day bullish consolidation. Only a break back below $25,000 would give reason for concern. Until then, we suspect dips will continue to be very well supported.</p></blockquote>
<p>The news is unusual for a few reasons, a big one being Binance is the world’s largest and most popular digital trading platform. In terms of daily volume, no exchange can say it attracts the attention or activity Binance does. Given its size and prowess, you’d think such a firm would be ready for loads of traffic, though temporary halts and shutdowns of this nature are common for Binance.</p>
<p>Such an occurrence also took <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/binance-scared-traders-in-late-march-when-it-temporarily-stopped-all-trading/" data-wpel-link="internal">place in late March</a>, though that time around, the problems were attributed – according to Ilya Volkov, CEO of You Hodler – to a technical glitch in the company’s network rather than heavy traffic. Volkov mentioned in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>These kinds of bugs could happen everywhere, and crypto exchanges are not unique.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Trying to Keep Up</h2>
<p>Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau was also quick to throw his two cents in regarding the present issues. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is an increasing demand for BRC-20 tokens, which include transferring digital collectibles on [the] bitcoin network. The bitcoin network has gradually supported more different types of tokens like NFTs. This adoption should be a positive sign in the longer term, but it looks like it has slowed down the network.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Liechtenstein – a small European nation that most people likely wouldn’t even be able to recognize on a map – is suddenly <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/liechtenstein-government-plans-accept-bitcoin-094856431.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">becoming very big in the crypto</a> community. Government regulators have recently issued a statement claiming they’re looking into accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment methods for state services.</p>
<h2>Liechtenstein Loves Crypto, Apparently</h2>
<p>The news came from Prime Minister Daniel Risch. The new program would make it so that all crypto payments delivered for government and national services would immediately be converted into Swiss francs to avoid exchange-rate risks. Right now, the franc is the primary form of currency the country utilizes to stay afloat.</p>
<p>The move is pushing the goals of bitcoin and its digital counterparts closer to being achieved. What many people likely forget is that while bitcoin and many of its crypto cousins have taken on either speculative or even hedge-like statuses in recent years, many of them were initially designed to serve as payment tools. They were built to push checks, credit cards, and fiat currencies to the side, but this has been a relatively slow journey given the volatility that continues to drag them down.</p>
<p>It is extremely hard to understand when <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1654270452656000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bvGkqiDvhlSzR-S2K1YYe" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>bitcoin</strong></a> and its crypto family will go up or down when it comes to their prices. Many stores and companies have been reluctant to say “yes” when it comes to accepting crypto payments for this reason, and to a degree, we can’t blame them.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario: someone walks into a store and buys $50 worth of merchandise with bitcoin. For one reason or another, the store doesn’t trade the BTC into fiat right away and about 24 hours go by. From there, the price of BTC goes down and that $50 becomes $40. The customer gets to keep everything he or she bought, but the store loses money in the end. Is this a fair situation? Not everyone thinks so.</p>
<p>That’s what makes countries like Liechtenstein so important. They understand the initial purposes of bitcoin and digital currencies and are trying to transform them into usable tools that everyday people can benefit from.</p>
<p>Risch says he and his fellow constituents involved in Liechtenstein matters have long been open to the ideas and principles presented by bitcoin and its altcoin cousins. He also stated that the nation is open to investing state reserves into crypto assets like bitcoin and Ethereum at some point in the future. Liechtenstein is unique in that it’s one of the few nations that has managed to remain fully debt free.</p>
<h2>Still Too Much Risk?</h2>
<p>Despite the forward steps, Risch was quick to acknowledge that crypto is still risk heavy. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto assets like bitcoin are currently still too risky, but this assessment can change.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – a democrat who’s thrown his hat into the presidential race against Joe Biden – made his first <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/robert-kennedy-jr-to-make-campaign-debut-at-bitcoin-conference/ar-AA1aOW7z" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">appearance as a candidate</a> this month at the famed Miami Bitcoin Conference.</p>
<h2>Robert Kennedy and Bitcoin&#8230; A Solid Match?</h2>
<p>Kennedy is not your typical far-left leaning liberal. He’s a vaccine skeptic and he’s clearly standing with an industry that many of his constituents have deemed damaging to the environment. Elements like these are potentially going to get him a lot of followers in the coming weeks given there are likely to be several members of the democrat party that aren’t happy about the extreme stance their group has taken over the last five years.</p>
<p>Brandon Green – chief of staff to conference organizer BTC Media – commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>We asked him to speak after hearing his positive comments toward the bitcoin industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kennedy is not slated to be paid for making his appearance, nor is he going to earn any speaking fees for the campaign appearances he makes over the next year or so as he pursues the road to the White House, according to his spokesperson Stefanie Spear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/anthony-scaramucci/" data-wpel-link="internal">Anthony Scaramucci</a> – a bitcoin fan and the former communications director for President Donald Trump – said Kennedy’s love for bitcoin will likely endear him to the growing array of digital currency fans that appear to be getting stronger each day. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>In my mind, there’s this shadow fandom or currently invisible lobbying group — and it’s probably currently about 77 million people — of bitcoin or other cryptocurrency holders in the United States. I think it’s going to be a topical issue in 2024, and I would imagine that one of these presidential nominees will embrace bitcoin, and if they do, that’ll give them an edge… These are people who are typically agnostic [to] party.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a recent discussion, Kennedy stated that monetary freedom is just as important as all the other rights and liberties given to naturalized Americans, thus suggesting crypto could indeed be a solid tool for remaining stable against oppressive regimes. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Monetary freedom is as important as freedom of speech. Without it, we are slaves. It’s not outlandish to imagine that even here in America, your bank account could one day be frozen because of your politics or comments you’ve made on social media.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Not Everyone&#8217;s Enthused</h2>
<p>Some, like Elizabeth Moran of the environmental non-profit Earth Justice, are skeptical of his alignment with the crypto space. They believe, given the industry’s knack for overusing energy, that this could wind up hurting Kennedy in the long run. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This problem is really limited to bitcoin and maybe a couple of other smaller cryptocurrencies at this point. Energy consumption is so great in some places that utility bills are skyrocketing for consumers.</p></blockquote>
