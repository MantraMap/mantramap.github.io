            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investor uncertainty around XRP ($XRP) is ramping up again, with the token&#8217;s value dropping 4% since August 9.</p>
<p>This uncertainty has been prompted by the SEC&#8217;s decision to appeal Ripple&#8217;s recent legal victory, hinting that the back-and-forth between the two entities could be set to resume.</p>
<p>However, the excitement around the new XRP20 ($XRP20) token continues to build – with the project’s presale now nearing the $2 million milestone.</p>
<h2>Recent Price Action Hints at Trend Reversal for $XRP</h2>
<p>$XRP had been enjoying a sharp reversal until Wednesday morning, with the price soaring 11% after experiencing an extended downtrend in the previous weeks.</p>
<p>After topping at $0.665, the price turned back – falling 4% to $0.632, where it trades today.</p>
<p>This turnaround coincides with $XRP’s price tapping the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), hinting that it could be acting as a minor resistance level.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-15.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265813" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-15.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="284" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-15.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-15-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-15-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Price is now hovering just above the 50-day EMA. This means it’s essentially trapped in a range between the two indicators.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to a value of 44 on the daily timeframe, further showcasing the recent bearish momentum.</p>
<p>Notably, $XRP’s 24-hour trading volume has also sunk by 35%, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data from CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>The decreasing interest in the token may suggest that speculative crypto investors are seeking other options due to ongoing regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<h2>SEC Appeal Reintroduces Uncertainty as Ripple Legal Battle Resumes</h2>
<p>The uncertainty around $XRP stems from the SEC&#8217;s decision to appeal a ruling in its long-running lawsuit against Ripple Labs.</p>
<p>Back in July, Judge Analisa Torres delivered a partial victory to Ripple when she ruled that $XRP is not a security in the context of retail trader offerings.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/08/09/sec-ripple-xrp-security-cryptocurrency-appeal-sdny/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reported by Fortune.com</a>, the SEC is now set to appeal this decision.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-14.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265812" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-14.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="432" height="351" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-14.jpg 432w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-14-300x244.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-14-50x41.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></a></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this brought back much of the uncertainty surrounding $XRP before Torres&#8217; initial decision, dampening investor enthusiasm and demand.</p>
<p>With the SEC intent on continuing the legal battle, $XRP holders could face another extended period of doubts around the token&#8217;s status.</p>
<p>The good news for these holders is that <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1688309749610168320?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton</a> tweeted that he’s willing to bet “significant funds” that Torres’ decision does not get overturned on appeal.</p>
<p>Regardless, the lingering uncertainty poses short-term headwinds for $XRP, even as longer-term optimism still exists within the investor base.</p>
<h2>Rising Presale Traction &amp; Clean Audit Build Excitement for Trending XRP20 Token</h2>
<p>With uncertainty swirling around $XRP, the developers behind a new token called <a href="https://bs_b791c467.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=xrp-price-sinks-4-as-uncertainty-ramps-up-but-xrp20-nears-2-million-presale-raise" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP20 ($XRP20)</a> aim to make their mark on the crypto landscape.</p>
<p>The recently launched XRP20 presale has seen impressive early traction, raising over $1.9 million.</p>
<p>Branded by the developers as &#8220;the next evolution of XRP,&#8221; XRP20 aims to tap into crypto investor nostalgia and offer a &#8220;second chance&#8221; to those who missed out on the original $XRP&#8217;s 2017 bull run.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265811" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-17.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="267" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-17-300x133.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-17-50x22.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>With less than half of the allotted presale tokens remaining, the buzz around XRP20 is intensifying as investors rush to get involved at the low price of $0.000092 – 30 times cheaper than $XRP&#8217;s all-time low.</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="https://xrp20coin.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP20’s whitepaper</a>, once this presale concludes, the token will be launched on a DEX – with 10% of the total token supply used to boost liquidity for traders.</p>
<p>Moreover, the XRP20 project recently underwent a <a href="https://xrp20coin.com/assets/documents/audit.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">comprehensive smart contract audit</a> conducted by blockchain security firm 0xGuard.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-11.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265810" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-11.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="180" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-11.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-11-300x90.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-11-50x15.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>No high-risk vulnerabilities were noted in the audit, providing assurances to early investors regarding the safety of XRP20.</p>
<p>As the presale heads towards its $3.68 million hard cap, numerous crypto influencers are taking note, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBRpK8gFVDU&amp;pp=ygUFeHJwMjA%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Michael Wrubel</a> uploading a video detailing how optimistic he is about $XRP20’s prospects.</p>
<p>If XRP20’s momentum continues at this pace, there’s no doubt it’s a token to monitor closely ahead of its open market debut.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA["I think that the Fed is done hiking for this cycle," Lee stated.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tom Lee &#8211; Managing Partner and the Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors &#8211; believes there is an 80% chance that the US Federal Reserve will pivot from its aggressive interest rate hike policy. He suggested that the main reason behind such a decision could be the positive CPI numbers which recently showed that inflation in America has slowed down its spread.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Numerous experts have argued that the end of the Fed&#8217;s anti-inflationary program could potentially catalyze a new rally of the crypto market, specifically bitcoin.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">No More Hikes Expected</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/08/10/i-think-the-fed-is-done-hiking-for-this-cycle-says-fundstrats-tom-lee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">interview</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for CNBC, Lee pointed out the latest inflation report in America, calling it &#8220;very good.&#8221; He thinks the numbers will further fall in the next following months, resulting in a revival for financial markets.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I think as people peel the onion, this was a very good inflation report because it&#8217;s setting up for the next two months to see inflation slowing even further.&#8221;<br />
</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American investor believes this is an appropriate timing for the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates. The US central bank </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/federal-reserve-raises-rates-again-by-0-25-bitcoin-trades-flat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">lifted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the benchmark 11 times between March 2020 and July 2023 to tackle the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other setbacks.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I was originally in the 60% chance that July was the last hike. I think it&#8217;s now in the 80% range, I think that the Fed is done hiking for this cycle,&#8221; Lee said.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, Fundstrat&#8217;s analyst forecasted that the Federal Reserve will even start cutting interest rates at the beginning of 2024 because a high benchmark could hurt America&#8217;s economy (assuming that inflation keeps slowing its pace):</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Most people believe it&#8217;s the second half because the Fed doesn&#8217;t want to tighten rates, but if inflation&#8217;s falling, they have to cut rates. Otherwise, it&#8217;s actually stricting the economy more.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bullish for BTC?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some people have suggested that a possible pivot from the Fed could make investors turn their attention toward riskier assets, such as cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One example is Galaxy Digital&#8217;s CEO &#8211; Mike Novogratz &#8211; who </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-06/novogratz-says-bitcoin-will-go-to-the-moon-once-fed-pauses?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;in_source=embedded-checkout-banner" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">predicted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that bitcoin will &#8220;go to the moon&#8221; once the financial institution ceases the interest rate hike policy.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anthony Scaramucci – the Founder of SkyBridge Capital and former White House official &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-bull-market-to-start-once-us-inflation-drops-to-4-5-scaramucci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">shares</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the same stance. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I do believe that the Fed declares victory at 4% to 5% inflation. If I&#8217;m right, there will be a resurgence in the market. There&#8217;ll be a lot of short covering in crypto, and there&#8217;ll be a rebirth of risk assets,&#8221; he said earlier this year.</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Is an XRP ETF with the current SEC possible? An expert gives his two cents on the matter.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Filings for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have been pushed around for years with no success in the US so far. The Securities and Exchange Commission remains reluctant.</p>
<p>Ideas for ETH ETFs have also been floating around but XRP? That&#8217;s something new, but apparently, there&#8217;s some sort of interest in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The primary reason why cryptocurrency investors have been pushing for a spot Bitcoin ETF approved by the US SEC is that it will thoroughly legitimate Bitcoin as an investable asset.</li>
<li>This would, in turn, open the door for many institutions that are looking for a safe way to invest in BTC without having to necessarily worry about its safekeeping.</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s face it &#8211; storing large amounts of BTC isn&#8217;t for anyone, and it can be particularly risky.</li>
<li>With BlackRock now filing for a Bitcoin ETF, chances for approval, according to many &#8211; have improved. This is mainly because of the fact that it&#8217;s the largest asset manager in the world, and it has a tremendously successful track record in getting its ETF applications approved. Shocker.</li>
<li>But now, an asset management expert &#8211; James Seyffart &#8211; weighed in on the possibility of an XRP ETF getting approved.</li>
<li>His comments came in response to the recent <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-listed-on-gemini-following-ripples-partial-court-victory/" data-wpel-link="internal">listing</a> of XRP on Gemini.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Gemini following Coinbase and Listing XRP. Been asked a few times in last weeks about an XRP ETF. Don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s enough to launch an XRP ETF with this SEC. And there seems to be essentially zero demand from issuers to try.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin's price remains rangebound but there's one coin that's making all sorts of rounds today.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market is taking an interesting turn throughout the past few days. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been unable to make any improvements, but a coin that&#8217;s native to an online crypto casino is all the industry is talking about.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Unable to Escape $29K Range</h2>
<p>The past 24 hours failed to deliver anything interesting in terms of Bitcoin&#8217;s price development as it&#8217;s completely devoid of volatility and any kind of action.</p>
<p>The price remains in the tight consolidation range of around $29K, and if we exclude the recent attempt to break $30K, the market is completely paralyzed.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265780" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265780" style="width: 1520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/btc_price_chart_1108231.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-265780" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/btc_price_chart_1108231.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_1108231" width="1520" height="971" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/btc_price_chart_1108231.jpg 1520w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/btc_price_chart_1108231-300x192.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/btc_price_chart_1108231-1024x654.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/btc_price_chart_1108231-768x491.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/btc_price_chart_1108231-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1520px) 100vw, 1520px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265780" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>In all fairness, it&#8217;s not just Bitcoin. The entire market seems unable to produce any volatility with certain exceptions.</p>
<h2>RollBit Coin (RLB) Leads Altcoins With Massive Surge</h2>
<p>The major news throughout the past couple of days is the performance of RLB &#8211; the native cryptocurrency of the crypto casino RollBit.</p>
<p>RollBit came to prominence a few months ago, with many popular crypto-oriented influencers promoting it heavily.</p>
<p>The native cryptocurrency of the platform recently exploded following news that RollBit will be burning a considerable portion of it. This created additional hype that drove its price higher amid an otherwise stagnating market.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265781" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265781" style="width: 1481px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1108231.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-265781" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1108231.jpg" alt="cryptocurrency_heatmap_1108231" width="1481" height="753" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1108231.jpg 1481w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1108231-300x153.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1108231-1024x521.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1108231-768x390.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_1108231-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1481px) 100vw, 1481px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265781" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Quantify Crypto</figcaption></figure>
<p>Elsewhere, as seen in the heatmap above, most of the major altcoins have failed to chart any considerable gains. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the exceptions as its rally continues. The coin is up 4% on the day and it shows little signs of slowing down.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">SHIB&#8217;s breakout has turned into a significant rally that continues to gather momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.0000094</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.00000106; $0.0000012 </strong></p>
<h2>1. Buyers Dominate</h2>
<p>The breakout point at $0.0000094 has turned into support and buyers have not looked back even since they passed this level. Bulls continue to dominate with no sight of sellers at this time.</p>

<h2>2. Rally Continues</h2>
<p>The first important resistance of this rally is found at $0.00000106. If the momentum continues to pick-up, then SHIB can target $0.0000012 next. Considering the current price action, this memecoin has a good chance to reach these levels.</p>

<h2>3. Momentum Picking-Up</h2>
<p>The MACD shows that the bullish momentum took no break this week, on the contrary, it intensified. This is shown by the histogram that has been making consistent higher highs since late July.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for SHIB is bullish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for SHIB Price</h2>
<p>Keep your eyes on the resistance at $0.00000106 as sellers could appear there. If they don&#8217;t manage to push back the price in a significant way, then expect buyers to aim for $0.0000012.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The next major Bitcoin market cycle peak will come much earlier than previous ones have according to one prominent crypto analyst.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an increasing narrative among crypto market analysts that the next bull market and cycle peak could come as soon as Bitcoin halving.</p>
<p>This follows months of consolidation where BTC has failed several times to break above $30K, and volumes and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-derivatives-volumes-drop-to-new-lows-amid-volatility-crush/" data-wpel-link="internal">volatility</a> have fallen to record lows.</p>
<p>On Aug. 10, market analyst “CrediBULL Crypto” told his 344,000 X followers that the next BTC halving in April/May 2024 “will likely mark our bull cycle TOP rather than the ‘start’ like many are expecting.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Why the next <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">$BTC</a> halving in April/May 2024 will likely mark our bull cycle TOP rather than the &#8220;start&#8221; like many are expecting and why we will likely be in the depths of a MAJOR bear market by 2025:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve previously explained that the amount of time we are spending… <a href="https://t.co/lQrGSo4rRs" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/lQrGSo4rRs</a></p>
<p>— CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/CredibleCrypto/status/1689521575433760768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Bull Market Shift?</h2>
<p>The analyst noted that the amount of time markets have been consolidating will be the longest in history. Markets have been range bound for five months now and haven’t really seen any large swings since their climb in mid-March.</p>
<p>The consolidation phases before the bull markets have always been much longer than the parabolic advance, he noted.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Once we break out of this consolidation I expect that our parabolic phase will begin- and, based on the data below, would expect the parabolic phase to end somewhere around May 2024.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If this scenario plays out, 2025 will be the beginning of a multi-year bear market, he noted.</p>
<p>However, there were a large number of respondents to the tweet that saw a new all-time high in just eight months’ time as an impossibility.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the sentiment has been echoed by others, such as cryptographer Adam Back who <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/adam-back-bets-1-million-satoshi-for-btcs-price-to-reach-100k-before-2024-bitcoin-halving/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a> prices would reach $100,000 at or after the halving. He said that miners would need prices to be much higher to remain profitable as the block reward is cut in half.</p>
<p>Fellow Bitcoiner Samson Mow also predicted a new all-time high for Bitcoin “pre-halving, not post.”</p>
<h2>BTC Price Outlook</h2>
<p>For now, the consolidation continues, and markets remain in their state of torpor. A very brief kiss of $30K this week has already started to break down, with BTC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-retreats-from-30k-as-xrp-slumps-toward-0-6-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">falling back</a> towards $29K again.</p>
<p>Markets have been gradually down trending since June 21, with $29K serving as solid support and anything over $30K as solid resistance.</p>
<p>Total capitalization remains at $1.21 trillion, a level that markets have oscillated around for the past five months, so maybe a big move upward would not be that outlandish.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The exec is being accused of misappropriating $7.5 million from exchange users. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jinwook Shin, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitsonic, has been apprehended by South Korean law enforcement on August 7th. He is currently being investigated for allegedly embezzling investments and deposits from users of the exchange.</p>
<p>According to the report by South Korean news agency Chosun Biz, Shin is being accused of fraudulently manipulating cryptocurrency prices and trading volume on Bitsonic, which led to the misappropriation of approximately 10 billion won ($7.5 million) from exchange users from January 2019 to May 2021.</p>
<ul>
<li>The prosecution stated that Shin <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/topics/topics_social/2023/08/08/W2KPDGP5SZCRRPMOS36DMLS6JM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">operated</a> Bitsonic but did not purchase cryptocurrency during the same period.</li>
<li>But the CEO persisted in providing cryptocurrencies to new customers despite the onset of liquidity problems and the suspension of withdrawals on the crypto platform, Seoul&#8217;s cyber crime department alleged.</li>
<li>BitSonic announced shutting down its operations in August 2021 and attributed the decision to &#8220;internal and external issues.&#8221;</li>
<li>Shortly thereafter, the South Korean authorities closed down 11 domestic cryptocurrency platforms for alleged fraudulent activities.</li>
<li>The ensuing inquiry also claimed the involvement of the company&#8217;s vice president in orchestrating a scheme to acquire the crypto held by the CEO within the exchange system.</li>
<li>In the process of manipulation, Shin purportedly utilized a shell company established in Singapore.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the vice president of Bitsonic is also slated to face trial without being subject to preliminary detention.</li>
<li>Off late, South Korean authoritoes have taken a hardline approach against fraudulent activities within the digital asset industry.</li>
<li>Last month, Korea Securities Depository <a href="https://www.fnnews.com/news/202307261412399732" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">unveiled</a> a partnership with Code, a firm specializing in Travel Rules, to promote the issuance and utilization of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) within the virtual asset market.</li>
<li>This initiative seeks to tackle the surge in unlawful activities within the market while also fulfilling the demand for enhanced investor safeguard.</li>
<li>Besides, the Korean government was reportedly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/south-korea-to-build-a-crypto-tracking-system-to-prevent-cybercrime-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">building</a> a crypto-tracking system to prevent cybercrime.</li>
