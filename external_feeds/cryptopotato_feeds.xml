			            <description><![CDATA[One in five survey participants is not interested in Russia’s CBDC at all.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Research conducted by the information service provider Bankinform estimated that many Russians are interested in the news surrounding the potential launch of a digital ruble. However, 32% are not in favor of such a monetary product, viewing it as some sort of scam.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The world&#8217;s largest country by landmass has been among the most active on the CBDC scene. The pilot version, which will include testing with banks, businesses, and consumers, is expected to start in mid-August.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Russians not so Supportive</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The study </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://bankinform.ru/news/129875" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that 13% of the respondents closely monitor the development of the digital ruble and intend to use it once it sees the light of day. Those participants also said they see new opportunities presented by the upcoming CBDC.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Every third questioned person admitted following the news about the new digital form of Russia&#8217;s national currency but has no intention to deal with it. Over 21% are not interested in the topic at all.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The most interesting answer came from 32% of the respondents, who labeled the Russian CBDC as &#8220;some kind of fraud.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There are different reasons why one might not be in favor of that type of financial product. CBDCs will be issued and controlled by centralized authorities, meaning they could endanger people&#8217;s privacy. According to Bankinform, though, another contributing factor to the distrust in the digital ruble could be the &#8220;ignorance&#8221; and the lack of substantial information on its advancement.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scam or not, many nations (including some leading economies) have already started exploring the product. As </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CryptoPotato</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-global-race-to-cbdcs-130-countries-already-exploring-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Japan, Australia, South Korea, the UK, and many others have introduced some programs to test the pros and cons of a central bank digital currency.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Somewhat expectedly (considering the political regime there), China is leading the race. The domestic authorities have introduced multiple initiatives to popularize the digital yuan, such as allowing CBDC settlements during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games held in Beijing.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How far has Russia Gone?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The country&#8217;s officials seem determined to finalize their CBDC project in the near future. Not long ago, President Vladimir Putin </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/vladimir-putin-approves-russian-cbdc-launches-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">signed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a law that enables Russia&#8217;s Civil Code to add the digital ruble as a payment method. At the same time, the central bank was allowed to introduce the product to citizens. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We really hope that it will be more convenient and cheaper for both people and businesses, and they will start using it. This is a new opportunity,&#8221; Elvira Nabiullina &#8211; Governor of the bank &#8211; stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earlier this week, the financial institution </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.cbr.ru/press/event/?id=16991" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> plans to start experiments with the CBDC. First Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova said the operation will involve 13 banks and a limited circle of their customers. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We plan to introduce the digital ruble into mass circulation based on the results of phased testing and subject to the successful completion of piloting all scenarios for operations with the digital ruble. We expect that starting from 2025, citizens and businesses will be able to actively use the national digital currency, of course, at their own request,&#8221; she added.</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bakkt revealed it signed new custody clients and is engaged in late-stage negotiations with multiple prospects across broad client verticals.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital asset platform Bakkt Holdings is refocusing on its cryptocurrency custody solutions due to recent market events and increased client interest.</p>
<p>In a Q2 earnings report, Bakkt <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/666322591/files/doc_financials/2023/q2/20230810-2Q23-Bakkt-Earnings-Presentation-vFinal-edit.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">touted</a> its “compliant and trusted” custody platform, citing the current need for multi-custodian access and self-custodial functionality due to clients’ difficulty in storing digital assets safely.</p>
<h2>Bakkt Renews Focus on Crypto Custody</h2>
<p>Bakkt Custody was a core part of the firm’s business before its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bakkt-to-become-public-on-october-18/" data-wpel-link="internal">public listing</a> in October 2021. By May 2020, the company had <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bakkt-expands-loyalty-program-increases-insurance-coverage-and-onboards-70-new-clients/" data-wpel-link="internal">expanded</a> its institutional custody solution to serve over 70 clients and struck several partnerships with major financial institutions.</p>
<p>The platform also partnered with insurance broker Marsh to offer customers coverage of more than $500 million in addition to the $125 million already in place at the custody solution.</p>
<p>However, Bakkt shifted its focus to retail payments following several business and management changes after it went public. The company’s renewed push into custody comes months after it acquired crypto brokerage service provider Apex.</p>
<p>The digital asset platform has signed new clients to Bakkt Custody and is engaged in late-stage negotiations with multiple prospects across broad client verticals. Bakkt’s qualified sales opportunities have increased by ten times, and the custody platform generates stable recurring fees.</p>
<p>With time, Bakkt intends to introduce additional features like yield-generating opportunities, including institutional staking. The custody platform would also add new blockchain networks and create a foundation for hot wallets.</p>
<h2>Bakkt Taps Fireblocks</h2>
<p>In line with the renewed focus on custody, Bakkt entered a multi-faceted collaboration with institutional digital asset custody firm Fireblocks. Through the partnership, Bakkt’s clients will maintain control of their private keys with the Fireblocks Off-Exchange solution. On the other hand, Fireblocks Off-Exchange customers will gain access to Bakkt’s Disaster Recovery Services.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have integrated Fireblocks’ battle-tested custody technology to fortify our custody offerings, leveraging their new-to-market self-hosted keys product that enables us to control and manage all MPC key shares across multiple services in our data centers and cloud. We will continue to work closely with Fireblocks to jointly deliver additional capabilities to the market,” the firm said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Bakkt <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bakkt-q2-revenue-jumped-by-60-yoy-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">generated</a> net revenue of $13.6 million in Q2, indicating a 60% increase year over year, and trimmed its net loss by 13% from the same period last year to $27.6 million.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Ethereum prices have been in a languid state of inactivity for five months, trading sideways with volume and volatility diminishing.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>However, fundamentals for the asset and network are as strong as ever.</p>
<p>On Aug. 11, crypto industry and DeFi analyst Miles Deutscher highlighted some of Ethereum’s bullish fundamentals.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It&#8217;s hard not to be ridiculously bullish on Ethereum,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Ethereum Fundamentals Strong</h2>
<p>Firstly, some of the world’s largest companies, such as <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paypal-launches-usd-stablecoin-for-payments-and-transfers/" data-wpel-link="internal">PayPal</a>, have chosen Ethereum to launch their products. Earlier this week, Ethereum advocate Ryan Sean Adams said the network is “becoming the money layer of the internet.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-problems-with-sam-altmans-worldcoin-according-to-vitalik/" data-wpel-link="internal">Worldcoin</a> is also using Ethereum and could be a major gas consumer if the digital ID project takes off.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It&#8217;s hard not to be ridiculously bullish on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Here are 9 reasons why.</p>
<p>• The biggest new projects are choosing to launch on ETH (PayPal stable coin, Worldcoin etc.)</p>
<p>• The ETH L2 thesis only continues to gain traction: Base launch, TVL at highs + strongest funding of…</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem is also growing at an accelerated pace, with networks such as Coinbase’s Base launching on L2. According to <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">L2beat</a>, total value locked across the ecosystem has surged 150% since the beginning of the year to an all-time high of $10.5 billion.</p>
<p>Additionally, EIP-4844 is on the horizon, which will substantially reduce fees on layer-2 networks.</p>
<p>Ethereum staking continues to grow, with almost 20% of the entire supply, or $42.5 billion worth of ETH, now staked and securing the network.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ethereum’s total fee revenue is higher than all other protocols combined.</p>
<p>Ethereum issuance remains deflationary, with the total supply declining by around 303,000 ETH since the Merge in September 2022.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Visa, one of the world&#8217;s largest payment processors, continues to use Ethereum for their crypto research.</p>
<p>Yesterday they published a proof of concept that allows users to pay gas fees using credit cards by leveraging Account Abstraction (ERC4337).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it all works <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />: <a href="https://t.co/rYjTlBkdkW" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/rYjTlBkdkW</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Deutscher also pointed out that NFT collections were migrating to Ethereum, citing Degods and y00ts as examples.</p>
<p>Many layer-1 networks are pivoting back towards Ethereum, such as Fantom adding Optimism rollups and Frax launching a layer-2.</p>
<p>Ethereum has also been labeled as a commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission though Congress has yet to officially classify the asset.</p>
<p>Finally, a slew of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/eth-price-unmoved-as-ethereum-futures-etf-race-heats-up/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum-based ETFs</a> have been applied for, so it could be only a matter of time before they get approved.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>ETH Price Outlook</h2>
<p>These ten solid fundamentals should be moving ETH prices, but they’re not at the moment.</p>
<p>ETH is hovering around the $1,850 level, where it has been for the past seven weeks, aside from a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-eth-tops-2000-for-first-time-in-3-months-on-ripple-victory/" data-wpel-link="internal">brief spike</a> in mid-July.</p>
<p>The asset has mirrored Bitcoin, trading in a range-bound channel since the middle of March.</p>
<p>A larger move higher is expected when BTC finally <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/when-will-bitcoins-bull-run-start-analyst-chips-in/" data-wpel-link="internal">breaks out</a> of consolidation, and there are several factors that could catalyze this.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to be bullish about Ethereum, and a move higher seems an inevitability sooner or later.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Visa is working on a solution to eliminate the need for users to hold ETH merely for paying gas fees.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American payment goliath Visa is exploring ways to facilitate payment of on-chain gas fees through the use of a Visa card.</p>
<p>In a recent report, Visa&#8217;s Product Manager Mustafa Bedawala emphasized a challenge associated with cryptocurrency wallets faced by users which requires them to constantly manage their ETH balance to cover gas fees.</p>
<p>The company is experimenting with an option to enable users to pay their on-chain gas fees directly in fiat money through card payments, thereby simplifying blockchain transactions.</p>
<h2>Visa&#8217;s Solution for Gas Fees</h2>
<p>Under Visa&#8217;s scenario, users may no longer need to hold native tokens specific to a blockchain exclusively to cover gas fees. This resolution would leverage Ethereum&#8217;s ERC-4337 standard and a &#8216;Paymaster&#8217; contract, allowing customers to utilize a Visa card for the direct payment of gas fees.</p>
<p>This approach is not only expected to be a major relief for existing users but is also designed to help streamline the onboarding process for new ones.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our proposed solution liberates users from the need to hold native blockchain tokens or constantly engage in bridging tokens merely to cover gas fees. From a user’s perspective, this solution is appealing in its simplicity and ease of adoption.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Visa suggests a solution that involves receiving the user&#8217;s gas fee payment off-chain through a Visa card and subsequently covering the equivalent sum on-chain on their behalf. This process simplifies the gas fee experience, resembling a typical card payment transaction.</p>
<p>The setup implemented by the payments firm to permit the off-chain gas payment capability is centered around a &#8216;Verifying Paymaster,&#8217; which is essentially a smart contract that delegates all necessary checks and sourcing of information to an off-chain component.</p>
<p>The on-chain paymaster smart contract can then utilize the information and authorization provided by the off-chain component to validate and execute the payment for the gas fee.</p>
<p>The payment is processed via Cybersource, and the web service produces a digital signature. Successful verification of the signature indicates that the web service has indeed received the card payment to facilitate the operational expenses. In such a case, the paymaster contract will operate without any errors and will cover the associated gas fee accordingly.</p>
<h2>Gasless Transactions</h2>
<p>Visa has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/visa-deploys-paymaster-contracts-on-ethereum-testnest-for-gasless-transactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">experimented</a> with this idea on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, making use of accessible open-source tools like Stackup&#8217;s userop.js library. The trial transactions successfully handled fees via the Paymaster, eliminating the need for ETH in the process.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The first “crypto native degens” to use Base had a surprisingly large allocation to memecoins.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nansen – a blockchain market intelligence firm – released a report on Tuesday analyzing how the earliest whales to onboard Coinbase’s layer 2 blockchain – Base – are using their money.</p>
<p>Here’s what the company found.</p>
<ul>
<li>Early whales largely allocated to Ethereum and its layer 2 networks. As of August 7, the most value held by these whales ($19.6 million) was on Ethereum itself, followed by Base ($17.6 million), Arbitrum, and Optimism.</li>
<li>Regarding tokens, ETH was the most common holding at $11.6 million. Beneath it were relatively large memecoin allocations, including Bald at $2.7 million (skewed by the BALD deployer), UNIBOT ($284,000), and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-exploded-by-300-in-a-week-but-its-definitely-not-what-you-think/" data-wpel-link="internal">BITCOIN</a> ($273,000).</li>
<li>Some of the most common entities these whales are interacting with include commonly used decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap and 1Inch.</li>

<blockquote><p>“Most of their activity comprises DEXs, stables, L2s, and common DeFi apps,” <a href="https://research.nansen.ai/articles/what-are-early-base-whales-doing-on-chain" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">wrote</a> Nansen. Much like token and chain allocation, protocol usage tends to congregate around a few “trustworthy” DeFi apps.</p></blockquote>

<li>The analysis pertains to whales who bridged assets to Base before its official launch this week, meaning they had to access the ecosystem without a prepared front-end.</li>
<li>Based on this, Nansen assumes many of those early depositors were “crypto native degens.”</li>

<p>Binance Labs, the venture capital and incubation arm of Binance, has committed 10 Million USD to <a href="https://helio.money/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Helio Protocol</a>, a project combining over-collateralized lending of its native decentralized stablecoin, HAY, with staking-as-a-service (StaaS) and<a href="https://research.binance.com/en/analysis/lsdfi-when-liquid-staking-meets-defi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"> LSDfi</a> infrastructure, with approximately combined 300 million USD in TVL, of which 260 million USD is parked under staked assets. This strategic funding round emphasizes Binance Labs&#8217; dedication to supporting innovative projects that are set to shape the next era of DeFi.</p>
<p>In July 2023, Helio Protocol acquired <a href="https://www.synclub.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Synclub</a> to unleash the full potential of HAY by incorporating additional LSTs as collateral, thus empowering users by increasing capital efficiency for maximum rewards.

The upgrade brings a variety of product revamps, including new collateral conversion and withdrawal opportunities.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yi He, Co-Founder of Binance and Head of Binance Labs, commented: “Binance Labs is committed to supporting DeFi projects and founders driving innovation for the future of the Web3 industry. We have seen tremendous potential in the LSDfi sector, which plays a crucial role in driving the overall growth of the DeFi ecosystem. We look forward to working with Helio and Synclub, and hope to see the project grow as a leading LSDfi protocol on BNB Chain and other blockchains.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Unlocking the Complete Potential of Liquid Staking Tokens</h2>
<p>Helio Protocol will allocate the funds to expand its team, further diversify the collateral across liquid staking providers, and bolster support for future multi-chain growth. These initiatives will ensure that Helio and Synclub deliver a robust, secure, and diversified platform for the LSDfi community. The team is also set to release a development roadmap for the community and refresh the project’s branding to signal this new chapter of growth and innovation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our mission is to provide the community with access to a quality, high-security LSDfi infrastructure, helping users enhance the capital efficiency and the rewards of their on-chain assets in a secure space,&#8221; said Toru, Founder and CEO of Helio Protocol. &#8220;This investment will also bring critical resources and connections to Helio to drive further growth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The meme coins have become a hot investment option in the crypto world. Moreover, if a meme coin comes with a utility, investors are waiting to pounce on the project.</p>
<p>Such projects carry the popularity and market growth of meme coins and the stability of utility tokens. Therefore, no sooner did Pomerdoge launch its presale, it became one of the top-performing assets in the crypto market.</p>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pomerdog’s presale token is currently costing $0.007.</li>
<li>Its ecosystem is comprised of multiple initiatives to foster long-term growth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pomerdoge &#8211; A Revolutionary P2E Game</h2>
<p>The play-2-earn games are dominating the blockchain gaming space. The recent market records have suggested that P2E is one of the most exciting gaming platforms. Hence, some experts believe that Pomergame can reach the moon with its growth-oriented business roadmap.</p>
<h2>What Does <a href="https://pomerdoge.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pomerdoge</a> Consist Of?</h2>
<p>Pomerdoge has announced that it will soon launch a new P2E game. This new platform will combine the characteristics of meme coins, and P2E games. Pomerdoge will enable users to play and earn simultaneously. Its new P2E game will be called Pomergame, where users can create characters. Gamers can also use their creativity, and customize in-game items like skins. Besides, gamers can sell or trade in-game items to generate income after they get a gold status Pomer.</p>
<p>Pomerplace will be the marketplace where gamers will get to sell, buy, or trade their in-game assets. Interestingly, it will also serve as the arena where battles between players will take place. At Pomerplace, users will be able to battle against other members using their Pomerdoge. Since the arena follows the concept of “winners take all,” gamers will have to maintain their best form in the battle.</p>
<p>Pomerdoge will also release a collection of 7,777 NFTs during its presale round. Each NFT will have unique utility and value in the ecosystem. Moreover, the buying price of each NFT will be just 0.2 ETH and provide its holders with multiple benefits. However, the developers have not revealed the benefits yet. They will do so near the project’s launch date. Nevertheless, only POMD token holders will get an opportunity to purchase these NFTs.</p>
<h2>A Secure And Profitable Option</h2>
<p>The platform’s token smart contract has undergone thorough audits by Solid Proof and Cyber Scope. Moreover, its liquidity will be locked for life to make it the safest investment for buyers. Given all these benefits and use cases, Pomerdoge has emerged as the most attractive investment option.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Currently, the platform’s presale is in the first stage, and a POMD token is available to purchase at just $0.007. Since the platform’s presale follows a dynamic model, the token’s price will increase at every stage.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[SHIB continues to gain momentum, and so has done another asset from the Shiba Inu ecosystem - BONE.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price performance continues to be rather underwhelming, with the asset remaining at essentially the same spot as yesterday at just over $29,000.</p>
<p>Most altcoins are also quite stagnant today, with little-to-no movements from ETH, BNB, XRP, and others. Shiba Inu is the only exception from the larger caps.</p>
<h2>SHIB, APE, PEPE on the Rise</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s largest digital asset &#8211; SHIB &#8211; has been among the best performers lately, gaining double digits in the past week, as <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-returns-to-29k-after-failing-at-30k-shiba-inu-pumps-16-in-7-days-this-weeks-crypto-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a>. Furthermore, the past 24 hours were quite positive for the second-largest meme coin as well, as it soared by another 8%. As a result, SHIB now trades close to $0.000011.</p>
<p>The situation with ApeCoin and Pepe is quite similar, at least on a daily scale. Both have jumped by somewhere between 7-8%. Consequently, APE has returned to $2, while PEPE is up to $0.000001333 on CMC.</p>
<p>The larger-cap alts have stalled since yesterday. ETH, DOGE, and TRX are slightly in the green, while BNB, XRP, ADA, and MATIC have posted insignificant losses.</p>
<p>Expectedly, the cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has remained at the same spot at just over $1.170 trillion on CMC.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Stalls</h2>
<p>The primary cryptocurrency had a rather volatile start to the week as it dipped below $29,000 on Monday to register a weekly low. The bulls quickly intercepted the move and pushed the asset north. By Wednesday, BTC had bounced off to over $30,000.</p>
<p>Yet, that turned out to be another short-lived adventure for bitcoin above that level, and it quickly retraced to $29,500. The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-unfazed-as-cpi-for-july-increases-by-0-2-mom/" data-wpel-link="internal">US CPI numbers</a> on Thursday didn&#8217;t change the landscape all that much.</p>
<p>In fact, BTC has been quite stagnant since then and has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-stagnant-above-29k-as-rlb-skyrockets-to-0-2-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">remained</a> in a tight range between $29,000 and $29,500 for the past 48 hours.</p>
<p>Its market capitalization stands just inches above $570 billion, while its dominance is below 49% on CMC.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine making an online payment to a stranger without going through a bank and you still get a reliable and verifiable transaction history. This is how decentralization works. It is the type of process that gives cryptocurrencies the upper hand against traditional currencies. It eliminates the need for intermediaries and allows parties to engage in different transactions without relying on any third party.</p>
<p>The concept has hugely influenced the crypto space, which led the crypto community to revolutionize financial services and other markets. For example, DeFi, or decentralized finance, and DAO, or decentralized autonomous organizations are two famous offsprings of decentralization. As these ideas become more widespread, it is essential to learn what decentralization has to offer to the crypto world.</p>
<h2>Do We Need to Decentralize Our Payment System?</h2>
<p>Cash and banks have existed for decades, and everyone put their trust in this form of centralized structure until the financial crisis that occurred in 2008. This worldwide economic crisis made it evident that a single entity should not be making decisions that will affect everyone. Thus, the need for decentralized currencies became apparent.</p>
<p>In October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper, where the idea of a global currency that would be managed and owned by the people was born. More than decades later, the question still remains: should we use decentralized currencies?</p>
<p>Decentralization transfers control and decision-making to the users, enabling the system to not be reliant on a single authority and eliminating the risk of a corrupt or compromised authority. Through this, decentralized systems can ensure better protection and independence. Moreover, decentralization promotes trustless connections, wherein the verification of transactions relies on the collective wisdom of numerous devices that are working together. This prevents the system from being compromised by keeping any bad actors at bay.</p>
<p>Moreover, decentralization reduces vulnerabilities by distributing them across the network. Trustless connections prevent single bad actors from forging transactions or corrupting the system. Cooperation from more than 50 percent of the nodes is required to gain influence, making it increasingly difficult in larger systems. Distributed networks also mitigate threats, as compromising a single node does not jeopardize the entire system.</p>
<h2>Moving Forward with Decentralization</h2>
<p>Decentralization is the defining and exceptional characteristic of cryptocurrency. And as we progress, there will be new decentralized cryptocurrencies and exchanges that will preserve the benefits of decentralization and address its limitations. These will strengthen the innovative structure and revolutionize the world of finance in the future.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was reportedly sent to jail on Friday as US Judge Lewis Kaplan denied his lawyers&#8217; request to delay detention.</p>
<p>The former crypto mogul&#8217;s court date is set for October 2nd, and he could sit in a jail cell until then if the appeal is unsuccessful.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>CryptoPotato</em> reported last month the allegations presented by the New York Times that SBF had tried to intimidate one of the key witnesses in his legal battle against US authorities &#8211; the former leader of Alameda Research &#8211; Caroline Ellison.</li>
<li>Prosecutors were quick to request Bankman-Fried&#8217;s detention, claiming he could not be trusted while residing in his parents&#8217; home.</li>
<li>Expectedly, his lawyers refuted the allegations, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sbf-shouldnt-be-detained-for-leaking-details-from-ellisons-diary-lawyers-claim/" data-wpel-link="internal">indicating</a> that he didn&#8217;t try to intervene or intimidate anyone, especially his former girlfriend.</li>
<li>According to more recent <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690061503645229056" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reports</a>, though, the attorneys&#8217; requests for delayed detention were denied by Judge Lewis Kaplan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My conclusion is there is probable cause to believe the defendant tried to tamper with witnesses at least twice,&#8221; reportedly said the Judge.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interestingly, SBF will most likely be sent to a jail in Putnam, New York, and will have access to a laptop with an internet connection to prepare for his defense. The other option was sending him to Brooklyn&#8217;s Metropolitan Detention Center, where internet access is limited for prisoners.</li>
<li>SBF&#8217;s court date over his alleged involvement in defrauding investors and the massive crash of his former crypto empire is set to begin on October 2nd. He could spend the next almost two months in jail unless his lawyer&#8217;s appeal to revert Judge Kaplan&#8217;s ruling is successful.</li>
