<p>National Australia Bank joins other large Australian banks to block payments to &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; crypto exchanges to protect customers. </p>
<p>National Australia Bank (NAB) announced Monday that it had blocked some payments to &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; crypto exchanges over the past few months to protect its customers.</p>
<p>The lender said Australians lost around $151 million last year due to crypto-related scams. The NAB did not disclose which platforms it involved.</p>
NAB Halts Millions in Payments Between March and July
<p>In a statement, the NAB said it &ldquo;intervened&rdquo; in more than AU$270 million worth of payments which raised concerns over scams in the past four months between March and July.</p>
<p>The bank said it introduced several measures to protect its customers from scams. Chris Sheehan, the NAB&rsquo;s Executive for Group Investigations and Fraud, said:</p>

<p>Introducing payment prompts, taking action on spoofing and stopping the use of links in unexpected text messages are among key measures we&rsquo;ve introduced recently.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now also taking action to block some payments to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges in a further effort to stop scammers.</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;While many customers ultimately complete their payment after receiving a prompt, we&rsquo;re seeing around $290,000 worth of payments abandoned daily. This tells us that customers are taking the time to stop and think before they make a payment.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re focused on making banking simple and digital, we&rsquo;ve added this extra friction to help alert customers to warning signs. We need to do everything we can to stop the crime before it happens.&rdquo;</p>

Australian Banks Become Stricter to Prevent Customers Falling Victim to Scams
<p>The NAB joins the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to restrict customer payments to &ldquo;certain&rdquo; exchanges due to crypto-related scams.</p>
<p>The NAB further said in its statement that almost 50% of scam funds reported to the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange were linked to crypto in a recent 30-day period.</p>
<p>Mr Sheehan noted:</p>

<p>These scammers are part of organized, transnational crime groups. Increasingly, we&rsquo;re seeing them use cryptocurrency platforms to send stolen funds quickly and often overseas.</p>
