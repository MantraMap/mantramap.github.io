<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>According to the Reserve Bank of India We had 1.3 million clients and 300,000 merchants using the central bank digital currency as of June.</em></li>



<li><em>The Central Bank of India expressed optimism that the central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be introduced not only as a payment instrument, but also as a digital currency.&nbsp;</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has taken the lead in developing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that is aimed at revolutionizing the payment industry.&nbsp;</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/india-rbi-nov-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/india-rbi-nov-1-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Reserve Bank Of India Expects 1.3 Million CBDC Users And 300,000 Merchants By June" class="wp-image-201762" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/india-rbi-nov-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/india-rbi-nov-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/india-rbi-nov-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/india-rbi-nov-1-750x422.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/india-rbi-nov-1-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/india-rbi-nov-1.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Reserve Bank Of India Expects 1.3 Million CBDC Users And 300,000 Merchants By June 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The Deputy Governor of the RBI provided an update on the usage of CBDC as of June, revealing that 1.3 million customers and 300,000 merchants had already started using it. This is a huge milestone for the Indian payment industry and signifies the potential for a cashless digital economy.</p>



<p>The RBI&#8217;s plan to introduce CBDC as a digital currency as well as a payment tool is a move that is likely to make it more attractive to users. The RBI&#8217;s strategy for inducing customers to use this currency is still being developed, and this is an essential aspect of the digital currency&#8217;s success. The RBI is studying technical alternatives to CBDC to ensure that it is inclusive and efficient, providing a seamless experience for users.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RBI-1200x600-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RBI-1200x600-1-1024x512.jpeg" alt="Reserve Bank Of India Expects 1.3 Million CBDC Users And 300,000 Merchants By June" class="wp-image-201763" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RBI-1200x600-1-1024x512.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RBI-1200x600-1-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RBI-1200x600-1-768x384.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RBI-1200x600-1-360x180.jpeg 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RBI-1200x600-1-750x375.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RBI-1200x600-1-1140x570.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RBI-1200x600-1.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Reserve Bank Of India Expects 1.3 Million CBDC Users And 300,000 Merchants By June 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>One of the greatest advantages of CBDC is that it will come from cross-border transactions. CBDC will provide a faster, cheaper, and more secure means of payments, making it more attractive to businesses that engage in international trade and remittances. The RBI is working towards integrating CBDC into the global payment system to facilitate international trade and remittances.</p>



<p>It is important to note that cryptocurrencies are neither currencies nor assets, and the <a href="https://coincu.com/95210-cbdcs-will-kill-cryptocurrencies/">RBI</a> has made this clear. Cryptocurrencies lack the essential qualities of a currency, such as stability and legal tender status. Additionally, they do not generate any cash flows like assets. The RBI&#8217;s focus on developing a CBDC is a clear indication that they are committed to providing a secure and efficient payment system for the Indian economy.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the RBI&#8217;s development of a CBDC is a significant milestone for the Indian payment industry. With over 1.3 million customers and 300,000 merchants already using it, the potential for a cashless digital economy is becoming more of a reality. The RBI&#8217;s plan to introduce CBDC as a digital currency as well as a payment tool is a move that is likely to make it more attractive to users. With the RBI&#8217;s focus on developing a secure and efficient payment system, the future of the Indian economy looks bright.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Consensys is preparing to launch the mainnet alpha of its Linea network, a Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum, which enables faster transaction speeds and reduced costs through zkEVM rollups.</em></li>



<li><em>Linea aims to provide a cost-effective alternative for Ethereum developers and users, with transaction prices up to 15 times lower than Ethereum Layer 1. </em></li>

<p>On top of Ethereum, the Linea network enables <a href="https://coincu.com/194436-linea-launches-voyage-quest-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zkEVM</a> rollups, enabling developers to construct blockchain applications with quicker transaction speeds and reduced costs.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/188942-consensys-metamask-no-tax-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consensys</a> said on Tuesday that it would onboard ecosystem partners this week before launching Linea to the public at next week&#8217;s Ethereum Community Conference in Paris.</p>



<p>The network, according to Consensys, intends to provide a cost-effective option for Ethereum application developers and consumers, with transaction costs up to 15 times lower than <a href="https://coincu.com/201181-ethereum-in-q2-2023-340588-daily-active-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum Layer 1</a>.

<p>Joe Lubin, the founder and CEO of Consensys, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Ethereum layer 2 networks are set to play a crucial role in making great advances in scalability and usability. Linea’s zkEVM is the catalyst we’ve been waiting for to empower developers to shape the future of decentralized applications and encourage the builder in everyone.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Linea is a Layer 2 chain that is interoperable with Ethereum applications and uses ZK-Rollups for scalability.</p>



<p>Its launch follows a successful testnet period in which Linea got tremendous user interest, becoming one of the biggest active projects on the Goerli testnet. 5.2 million distinct wallets participated during this period, completing almost 41 million transactions in only three months, but many of them may be considered airdrop farmers.</p>

<p>Singapore&#8217;s Temasek Holdings, one of the world&#8217;s largest sovereign wealth funds, is cautious about investing in cryptocurrency companies, citing regulatory uncertainty in the industry. Temasek&#8217;s Chief Investment Officer, Rohit Sipahimalani, recently stated in a CNBC interview that the fund is not currently looking to invest in cryptocurrency exchanges or other companies operating in the sector due to the challenges posed by the regulatory landscape.</p>



<p>The uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulation has been a major issue for the industry in recent years, with different countries and regulatory bodies taking different approaches to the issue. In the United States, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged several large cryptocurrency exchanges with securities violations, alleging that they have violated local laws by selling tokens or operating as unregistered securities exchanges. This regulatory uncertainty has made it difficult for many investors to feel comfortable investing in cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, Sipahimalani indicated that Temasek remains open to cryptocurrency investment opportunities, provided that the right regulatory framework and investment align with the fund&#8217;s overall strategy and risk tolerance. The fund&#8217;s recent investment in FTX, an exchange that allows the fund to earn fee-based revenue without taking on trading risks, is an example of its cautious approach to cryptocurrency investment.</p>



<p>In addition to regulatory challenges, Temasek has faced macroeconomic and geopolitical difficulties, impacting its returns. However, the fund remains committed to investing in new and innovative projects, including those related to cryptocurrency, as long as they align with its overall investment goals.</p>

<p>In an interesting twist, certain assets, such as WBTC, USDT, and ETH, were moved from the address marked as Fake_Phishing183873 by Etherscan. However, it is believed that this labeling may be inaccurate, and the address could have previously belonged to the official Multichain account.</p>



<p>The significant outflow of funds from <a href="https://multichain.xyz/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://multichain.xyz/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multichain</a> raises questions about the motives behind these transactions.

<p>The pair rebounded shortly after and is currently trading at $0.4742. While the exact reason for the plunge is unknown, it is believed to be a glitch, as the pair recovered swiftly. However, this event has left many wondering about the stability of the exchange and its systems.</p>

<p>Poloniex Customer Support hinted at network maintenance on the same day of the event. The maintenance began at 7:00 a.m. UTC and lasted around two hours, during which the site was offline and trading was suspended. The markets were later reopened for trading, but it is unclear if the maintenance had any bearing on the sudden plunge of the XRP/USDT pair on Poloniex.</p>



<p>This is not the first time <a href="https://ripple.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ripple.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP</a> has experienced such an event. In April, the XRP/USDT perpetual trading pair flash crashed to zero on the Bitrue crypto exchange. While these events may be isolated incidents, they raise questions about the overall stability of the crypto market and the exchanges that facilitate trading.</p>



<p>What caused the Poloniex incident, and whether the exchange will take any measures to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. As crypto trading continues to gain popularity and more investors enter the market, it is crucial that exchanges uphold the highest standards of reliability and security.</p>

<p>Algofi, the largest DeFi protocol in the Algorand ecosystem, announced that it would be shutting down. The platform will go into &#8220;withdrawal-only mode&#8221; and close all of its social media accounts except for its Discord. Algofi raised $2.8 million in 2021, with participation from Coinbase, Y Combinator, Jump Crypto, and others. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1) Hey Everyone, <br><br>We have some unfortunate news to share regarding the Algofi protocol.<br><br>After a lot of reflection, the team has recently come to the unfortunate decision to begin winding down the protocol.</p>&mdash; Algofi (@algofiorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/algofiorg/status/1678536751969718272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The team has recently made the decision to begin winding down the protocol due to the inability to provide the necessary support to maintain the protocol at the high standards which they believe the community deserves. The team will begin sunsetting the platform and put the platform in withdrawal-only mode shortly. </p>



<p>The primary objective in the future is to ensure that these steps are carried out safely, clearly communicated, and timely. The Algofi team encourages anyone with questions about the plan to reach out to the community Discord, where they will be active. They will sunset other social media platforms to ensure seamless, unified communication.</p>



<p>The Algofi platform was <a href="https://blog.algofi.org/algofi-community-update-3cc989962d57" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed </a>to improve existing decentralized finance infrastructure using Algorand’s strong technology stack to build fast, scalable, and affordable products. The team achieved this goal by building alongside the community, who provided invaluable feedback. A confluence of events has no longer made building and maintaining the Algofi platform to the highest standards a viable path for the company. Due to this, the team has decided to begin sunsetting the platform.</p>

<p>In addition to Algofi&#8217;s shutdown, V1 and V2 Lending will be reducing collateral factors of the ALGO, vALGO, STBL, USDC, goBTC, and goETH markets over several months to ensure liquidity migrates off. Governance Protocol&#8217;s current Liquidity Mining programs will be halted, and no future proposals will be enacted. Further announcements on handling the voting escrow/locking mechanism are forthcoming.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OKX&#8217;s BRC20-S provides a new staking mechanism for BRC20 token or Bitcoin holders to generate income.</em></li>



<li><em>The staking mechanism of BRC20-S promotes the development of the BRC20 ecosystem and incentivizes users to hold their assets.</em></li>



<li><em>BRC20-S creates many benefits for project teams, such as reducing the liquidity of BRC20 tokens and creating rights available to project token holders.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BRC20-S, a new open standard proposed by OKX, has been officially <a href="https://www.okx.com/cn/learn/guide-of-brc20-s" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.okx.com/cn/learn/guide-of-brc20-s" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened </a>for deployment. This new staking mechanism provides a new way for BRC20 token or Bitcoin holders to generate income besides buying and selling tokens on exchanges.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-658.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="366" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-658.png" alt="OKX Launches BRC20-S: A New Staking Mechanism For Passive Income" class="wp-image-201713" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-658.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-658-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="OKX Launches BRC20-S: A New Staking Mechanism For Passive Income 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>With BRC20-S, users can earn income by staking BRC20 tokens, which greatly promotes the development of the BRC20 ecosystem. Project teams can also distribute their tokens to Bitcoin or BRC20 token holders as a way to build a community and let users stake their tokens to earn yield without having to sell tokens. </p>



<p>The staking mechanism of BRC20-S provides additional income opportunities for BRC20 token holders so that their assets can obtain passive income. Staking further incentivizes users to hold their assets, potentially reducing selling pressure in the market and contributing to a more stable token ecosystem.</p>



<p>In the BRC20-S token and staking ecosystem, the interaction process between the project team, users, and servers is crucial to the user&#8217;s participation experience. The project team can create seed users by issuing BRC20-S tokens and creating a staking pool. Users can stake Bitcoin or BRC20 tokens to earn other newly issued BRC20-S tokens. The interaction process involves integrating BRC20-S in the project and defining the parameters of the pledge pool, including specifying pledge tokens, revenue tokens, mining rate, total mining rewards, and authorizing token holders to participate in multi-mining.</p>



<p>Once the setup is complete, the user&#8217;s assets will be confirmed and recorded according to the BRC20 standard. Users can engage in various pledge operations such as deposits, casting (claiming), and withdrawals and have the flexibility to claim their mining rewards by minting tokens.</p>



<p>BRC20-S provides many benefits to project teams, such as creating demand for users to hold coins, reducing the liquidity of BRC20 tokens, and creating rights available to project token holders, such as purchasing rights and interests in DAPP, upgrading the project membership level through BRC20-S tokens, and completing the BRC20-S transfer and getting Ordinals NFT rewards. </p>



<p>The new sub-tokens introduced by BRC20-S can also bring many application scenarios, such as staking main tokens and getting sub-tokens as rewards, staking Ordinals NFTs for sub-token issuance, modifying the existing token economic model to introduce more scenarios, scaling/decreasing token supply by burning and using excess tokens, and master token revaluation.</p>

<p>Activity in the Bitcoin Ordinals world has surged since the BRC-69 token standard launch. This method of generating Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through a process called inscribing has seen a rise in new inscriptions, with over 350,000 new inscriptions on Monday. The daily tally has surged by over 250% since the launch of the BRC-69 token standard on July 3. The modified version of the BRC-20 standard reduces the cost of inscriptions for Ordinals by over 90%.</p>



<p>Luminex, the Ordinals launchpad, said, &#8220;With BRC69, we can reduce the costs of inscriptions for Ordinals collections by over 90%. This reduction is achieved through a 4-step process: (1) inscribe traits, (2) deploy collection, (3) compile collection, and (4) mint assets.&#8221;</p>



<p>The brilliance of BRC69 lies in its simplicity. Minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image. This text allows the final image to be automatically rendered on all ordinals-frontends, using solely on-chain resources, thanks to recursive inscriptions.</p>



<p>Per Glassnode, the Ordinals boom can be divided into two waves, with the first representing activity between early February and late April. The image-based inscriptions led the first wave, while high free-paying text-based inscriptions led the second wave, which began in May.</p>



<p>Despite the surge in new inscriptions, the daily fees paid for inscriptions remain stagnant, according to data tracked by Dune Analytics. Ordinals went live in January, bringing the NFT and smart contracts narrative to the Bitcoin blockchain and spurring investor interest in tokens like STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network.</p>

For users still holding these tokens after the delisting deadline, Binance will convert them to USDT based on the net asset value (NAV) at the time of delisting. The USDT tokens will be distributed to users&#8217; accounts within 24 hours, after which the leveraged token assets will be removed from the wallet.</p>



<p>At present, the tokens are no longer available on the Binance platform. However, Binance has kept the redemption service open for customers who still hold these tokens, enabling them to redeem the leveraged tokens for USDT through the dedicated Leveraged Tokens page or the wallet function.</p>



<p>The exchange had previously <a href="https://coincu.com/201599-binance-delists-these-altcoin-pairs-from-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its plans to cease trading for spot tokens against BUSD as well.</p>



<p>Leveraged Tokens are designed to amplify gains or losses in trading. For example, a 2x leveraged token would provide twice the return of the underlying asset. The XRPUP token multiplies investors&#8217; returns in the event of XRP price increases, while XRPDOWN multiplies returns in the case of XRP price declines.</p>

<p>The delisting of XRPUP and XRPDOWN tokens follows Binance&#8217;s previous actions this year, where the exchange delisted several leveraged tokens. In January, Binance announced the delisting of twenty leveraged tokens between February 14 and 18. Additionally, six leveraged tokens were delisted from May 9 to 11.</p>



<p>Earlier, the exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/201234-binance-launch-the-32nd-launchpad-arkham-arkm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> its 32nd Launchpad project with the launch of the Arkham (ARKM) token.</p>
