<p class="s5">Across the traditional financial space, many centralized banks have begun to collapse and to get close. The distrust in centralized, traditional industries, as a result, has been lowering on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="s5">Many investors and traders are turning towards cryptocurrencies as alternatives.</p>
<p class="s5">Today, we will be going over the performance of Monero (XRM) and Stellar (XMR) and see why they have stagnated in value while presale-stage projects such as Sparklo have managed to get ahead with their momentum.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Sparklo (SPRK) To Make Precious Metals Easily Accessible</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo is being developed as an alternative investment platform that will enable anyone the opportunity to make investments in and begin trading precious metals.</p>
<p class="s5">On top of the platform, every time an investor aim to make an investment in the asset class, a non-fungible token (NFT) gets minted. Then, this NFT is fractionalized. Investors have the opportunity to either buy a fraction of it or buy the entire NFT. If an investor buys an entire NFT that represents a gold bar, for example, they can get the real-world asset delivered to them at any location.</p>
<p class="s5">The platform has already been audited by InterFi Network, and the liquidity will also be locked for 100 years. At the level one presale stage, the SPRK token trades at a value of just $0.017. Analysts have predicted that its value can increase by 4,000% throughout the span of the upcoming few months, and savvy investors know that the most significant gains can be made by getting into it early.</p>
<p class="s9">Monero (XRM) Sees a Decrease of 3.2%</p>
<p class="s5">Monero (XRM) made an announcement where they celebrated their ninth birthday. This makes Monero (XRM) one of the oldest blockchain-based projects out there that is relevant to this day. Additionally, we saw the MoneroKon 2023 preliminary schedule go live.</p>
<p class="s5">As for the value of the Monero (XRM) cryptocurrency, on May 2, 2023, it traded at $154.51. In the last 30 days, Monero (XRM) saw a drop of just 1.5%, and in the last 14 days, this decrease has been at 3.2%. As such, it is clear why some investors might be interested in diversifying away from Monero (XRM).</p>
<p class="s9">Stellar (XMR) Enters Red Zone With A Drop of 14.7%</p>
<p class="s5">The team behind Stellar (XMR) took to Twitter to announce that the Stellar Community Fund is in Round 15 and is accepting submissions up until May 14. Moreover, the team also noted that Stellar (XMR) Questers, a new quest, went live, which teaches community members the power of "Muxed Account IDs."</p>
<p class="s5">As for the value of the Stellar (XMR) cryptocurrency, on May 2, 2023, it traded at $0.092464.</p>
<p class="s5">In the last 30 days, Stellar (XMR) saw a decrease in its value by 14.7%, and in the last 14 days, its overall decrease was at 11.2%. It is clear why Stellar (XMR) wants to diversify.</p>
