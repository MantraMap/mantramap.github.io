Ray III filed a motion in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Thursday to enforce an automatic stay or extend the stay orders on Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s 56 million shares of Robinhood Markets, worth $440 million. FTX investigation indicates Robinhood shares are the property of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> company and affiliates.</p>
<h2>FTX Files Motion To Seek Authority Over SBF&#8217;s Robinhood Shares</h2>
<p>According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.291.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">court filing</a> on December 22, FTX has filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The exchange claims Robinhood&#8217;s 56 million shares that SBF bought are the property of FTX and the shares must stay locked until the resolution of competing creditors&#8217; claims.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/blockfi-files-lawsuit-against-sbfs-holding-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crypto lender BlockFi </a>and individual creditor Yonathan Ben Shimon want to gain control of the shares via separate court proceedings in New Jersey and Antigua. Sam Bankman-Fried also tried to gain control of Robinhood shares in December, shortly before his arrest. SBF&#8217;s request in a court in Antigua is still pending and he may try to get control of Robinhood shares worth $440 million.</p>
<p>FTX wants the judge overseeing the bankruptcy case to enforce the shares to remain frozen while the company tries to figure out how to repay all its creditors. FTX stated that Robinhood shares are held in a brokerage account at EDFM for non-debtor company Emergent Fidelity Technologies. Emergent is 90% owned by Sam Bankman-Fried and appears to have no other business.</p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Released on Bail</h2>
<p>While FTX debtor seeks control of assets related to FTX and Alameda Research, <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-founder-sbf-released-on-250-mn-bond-placed-under-house-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBF was released on a $250 million bond bail</a> on Thursday. The bail was prearranged that saw SBF placed under house arrest in his Palo Alto home owned by his parents Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, prominent Stanford University law professors.</p>
<p>Interestingly, after SBF&#8217;s bail, FTX Token (FTT) price jumped over 15%. The FTT price is currently trading at $0.9831. The 24-hour low and high are $0.8356 and $1.13, respectively.</p>

However, the ADA price has been subject to a broader market correction and is down by nearly 14% over the last week.</p>
<p>But on-chain data provider Santiment shows that the Cardano shark addresses have been steadily accumulating even after the implosion of the crypto exchange FTX last month. This cohort of Shark Addresses now holds more than 4 Billion ADA coins. On-chain data provider Santiment <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1605996855858384896" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>:</p>

<p>As of press time, Cardano ADA is trading 2.8% up at a price of $0.26 and a market cap of $8.9 billion. This altcoin still continues to hold its position among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap.</p>
<h3>How Has 2022 Been for Cardano?</h3>
<p>On the blockchain front, the Cardano team has brought some major improvements to the blockchain. The Cardano Foundation recently published a few insights into their performance and growth this year in 2022.</p>

<p>After an incredible year, we are excited to share some of our highlights with you!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CardanoCommunity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CardanoCommunity</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CardanoFoundation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CardanoFoundation</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cardano?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Cardano</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Blockchain?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Blockchain</a> <a href="https://t.co/rQQ6Wwzn7X">pic.twitter.com/rQQ6Wwzn7X</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As per the data furnished, the Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) saw a 100% growth this year. There were around 50 reviewed proposals, 38 new CIP authors, 155 pull requests, and much more in 2022.</p>
<p>As per the Cardano Foundation, the Plutus smart contracts scripts have jumped by nearly 400% this year in comparison to 2021. The total number of Plutus scripts has surged to 4,445. The native tokens have jumped to 7.3 million with a 192% increase since 2021.</p>
<p>The number of transactions on Cardano this year jumped by 139% reaching 57 million. Similarly, the overall number of wallets has surged by 47% to 3.8 million. Overall, the blockchain is performing pretty well in terms of new developments.</p>
<p>However, as the ADA price hovers around 25 cents, the question is when shall <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-how-much-your-100-investment-in-cardano-will-be-worth-if-ada-reaches-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cardano touch $1</a>?</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wedge pattern breakout may set LUNC price for a 45% price rally </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A possible death crossover between the 50-and-100-day EMA may stall a potential price rally</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The intraday trading volume in the LUNC coin is $98 Million, indicating a 75% gain.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/dvgmLa4k.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily technical chart has revealed the last three months&#8217; downfall as the formation of a falling wedge pattern. Despite the numerous events that cost high volatility in the crypto market, the Terra Luna  Coin aggressively followed this daily chart pattern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the prices falling between the converging trendline indicate a gradual decrease in bearish momentum. Today, the LUNC price trades at the $0.000132 mark with an intraday gain of 3%. Moreover, the coin price is close to the pattern&#8217;s peak point, indicating a breakout opportunity is not far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-lunc-developers-edward-kim-zaradar-leave-terra-rebels/">bullish continuation pattern</a>, the Terra Luna  Coin is likely to break the overhead resistance trendline. This breakout would signal an early sign of price recovery and provide a near-term target of $0.0001941. Moreover, if the market sentiment improves, the ideal target for this pattern would be the $ 0.00374 mark.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the contrary note, if the LUNC price gives a daily closing candle below the support trendline, the sis will get invalidated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index</strong>: despite a lower low formation in the price action, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> shows a sideways movement. this hidden police divergence indicates a higher possibility of price recovery</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the 20 days EAM follows the same path as the resistance trendline offering additional resistance against potential. Moreover, The Other EMAs 50,  and Wma do]r00 trading above the contrast indicates the crisis has multiple resistance to work </span></p>

He will also be placed under house arrest in the Palo Alto home which he shares with his parents Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried; prominent Stanford University Law professors.</p>
<h2>SBF Released On Bail</h2>
<p>Judge Gabriel Gorenstein of the U.S. District Court approved the agreement that saw the alleged fraudster leave his place of residence at the Bahamas to stand trial for a number of offenses, including wire fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy, money laundering, and violations of campaign finance laws. A prison life of 115 years is the potential penalty for these charges.</p>

<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-to-make-1st-us-court-appearance/2022/12/22/578854e0-8201-11ed-8738-ed7217de2775_story.html" rel="nofollow">reports</a> the deal was prearranged and came after the Bahamian authorities handed over the 30-year old crypto tycoon to U.S. officials on Wednesday. Earlier, when the suspected crypto fraudster was arrested at his Caribbean island resort, his bail application got right away rejected.</p>
<h2>SBF Under House Arrest</h2>
<p>According to prosecutors, the suspect would be allowed to leave his parent&#8217;s home for exercise, mental health care, and drug abuse treatment but would not be allowed to carry out non-sanctioned transactions above $1,000. The only exception being that of legal bills and related fees.</p>

<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Nick Roos was quoted as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>If he had resisted, we would have opposed release. But his assets have diminished. This is a financial crime and he no longer works for FTX or Alameda. So risk to the community is a marginal consideration. We propose a restrictive bail package.</p></blockquote>
<p>And as per the agreement, SBF has to present himself to pre-trial services on Friday by 10 a.m. in the Northern District of California.</p>
<h2>The FTX Saga</h2>
<p>FTX&#8217;s value dropped from $32 billion to $1 billion as a result of a run on the FTT token by investors after it was discovered that the business had utilized customer deposits to finance <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research&#8217;s</a> investment bets.</p>
<p>Moreover, prosecutors and U.S. regulators allege that since the foundation of the FTX <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> in 2019, Sam Bankman-Fried has masterminded the massive fraud; where he has been found using customer funds to finance extravagant real estate purchases in the Bahamas, investments in other companies, political contributions, and a glamorous marketing campaign.</p>

<p>On Wednesday night, Manhattan US Attorney Damian Williams revealed that two of <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-alameda-ceo-caroline-ftx-co-founder-plead-guilty-cftc-sec-charges/">Bankman-Fried&#8217;s associates</a> had also been charged in connection with the alleged scam and had discreetly pleaded guilty. This was announced as SBF was being flown to the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> on a private jet.</p>

It allows manufacturers to place sensors, such as RFID tags, on their products that can then record data onto their proprietary VeChain blockchain. Initially, the VeChain token which released on the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> blockchain went by the ticker VEN, but was later forked and rebranded to VET.</p>
<h2>VeChain (VET) Use Cases</h2>
<p>The VeChain protocol aims to provide use cases such as product digitization utilizing a distinctive blockchain identity and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/supply-chain/">supply chain management</a> for the food industry among many others. The whitepaper states that VeChain creates its own procedure for integrating organizations that are not familiar with blockchain technology.</p>

<p>Digitizing goods to assist in spotting fake goods is another use case VeChain hopes to provide. The software creates a connection between the actual goods and a special <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> identity using smart NFC tags to digitize products. As a powerful tool for authentication, traceability, reporting, and digital marketing, the platform aims to give each product its own landing page with information on the product, marketing, and traceability.</p>

<p>VeChain offers a complete system that makes it simple for several participants in the food and beverage supply chain to gather crucial information about consumables. The VeChain IoT sensors gather environmental data including temperature, humidity, and acceleration. These data are then uploaded to the blockchain in real-time or via NFC (near field communication) interface at checkpoints using the VeChain ToolChain platform.</p>
<h2>VeChain (VET) Price Prediction For Long Term</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, the price of VET is $0.016, down by 3% over the previous day, according to the market monitoring portal <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>. The price of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> has fallen by over 80% since last year when VET traded at around $0.088 in December of 2021.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132665" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/22233331/WMuMgpZsY1.png" alt="" width="910" height="478" /></p>
<p>Nonetheless, if projections made by the website <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/vechain/" rel="nofollow">cryptopredictions.com</a> are to be believed, the price of VET may once again increase in the years to come.</p>

<p>Assuming no further black swan events, the data indicates that the cryptocurrency will continue to expand at a steady rate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132667" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/22234930/wcX8t7b4C1.png" alt="" width="1001" height="575" /></p>
<p>Now, if you were to invest just a nominal amount of $100 into VeChain at the current price, you would receive around 6,234 <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://br.coingape.com/tag/vet/">VET coins.</a></p>
<p>And, if the price went parabolic to hit the $5 milestone in the coming years, this $100 investment of yours would grow to become $31,170, which is over 300x return on your original investment.</p>

<h2>Binance Airdrops Terra (LUNA) Tokens To Terra Classic (LUNC) and USTC Holders</h2>
<p>In an <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-completes-second-round-of-terra-luna-airdrop-distribution-to-terra-classic-lunc-and-terraclassicusd-ustc-holders-6c9ca64a94064973a273328edc99019a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official announcement</a> on December 22, Binance has completed the second round of Terra (LUNA) airdrop distribution to eligible users who held Terra Classic (LUNC) and TerraClassicUSD (USTC) as per the snapshot. The snapshot timings are May 7 at 14:59:37 UTC (pre-attack) and May 26, 2022 (post-attack).</p>
<p>Binance will distribute the remaining Terra (LUNA) airdrop distributions from December 2022 or June 2023, as per the distribution plan. This will take 24 to 48 months for the full distribution of Terra (LUNA) tokens.</p>
<p>Users can <span class="css-6hm6tl">confirm the receipt of airdrop LUNC tokens on the <span class="css-1f5vusx">Distribution</span> page of their spot wallets. Also, users are requested to unselect “Hide 0 balances” to view LUNA tokens in spot wallets.</span></p>
<p>Moreover, Binance will not announce the completion of subsequent Terra (LUNA) airdrops after this announcement. Also, the airdrop is not valid for U.S. persons, entities, and sanctioned countries.</p>
<p>The crypto exchange completed the first airdrop in May, which was 30% of the total airdrop distribution. The remaining 70% will be distributed over 24 months.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price Jumps After Airdrop</h2>
<p>The Terra Classic price jumped over 5% in the last 24 hours as a result of the airdrop. The Terra Classic (LUNC) and USTC likely be selling Terra (LUNA) tokens to pump LUNC and USTC prices.</p>

The SEC expressed concerns over investors getting false reassurance from auditing reports, risking exposure to cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The move comes as several <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchanges</a> proposed to release <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-reserves-por/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proof of reserves</a> to reassure customers that their funds are safe and the firm is financially healthy.</p>
<h2>SEC Heightened Scrutiny of Crypto Audit Reports</h2>
<p>The SEC continues to hold its anti-crypto stance by increasing monitoring of banking and financial companies working with crypto companies. Now, the SEC is looking closely at how cryptocurrency companies are portraying their reports from audit firms.</p>
<p>Banks and auditing firms are reluctant to work with crypto companies due to regulatory pressure from regulators. Increased scrutiny over audit firms already saw France-based <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-auditor-mazars-suspends-services-for-crypto-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mazars suspending services for crypto exchanges</a> including Binance, Crypto.com, and other crypto exchanges. The auditing firm even removed Binance&#8217;s proof of reserves report from its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re warning investors to be very wary of some of the claims<strong class="css-11kxzt3-Strong e1i5tkwa1" data-type="emphasis"> </strong>that are being made by crypto companies,&#8221; SEC’s Acting Chief Accountant Paul Munter <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-heightening-scrutiny-of-auditors-crypto-work-11671681693" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> the Wall Street Journal on December 22.</p>
<p>In response to the agency&#8217;s fraud charges against former <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-alameda-ceo-caroline-ftx-co-founder-plead-guilty-cftc-sec-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang</a>, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that investors are exposed to crypto risks until crypto companies comply with time-tested securities laws. It remains a priority of the SEC to use all available tools to bring the crypto industry into compliance.</p>
<p>The SEC is sending warnings to audit firms working on crypto audits. The regulator believes crypto exchanges are using proof of reserves reports from audit firms for their benefit. Also, it contains only limited financial details to assess whether the company has sufficient assets to cover its liabilities.</p>
<h2>Binance Addresses FUD</h2>
<p>In response to increasing FUD, <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-addresses-heavy-withdrawals-amid-ongoing-fud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance on Thursday clarifies</a> to the crypto community that the crypto exchange has been fully transparent about their working and safety.</p>
<p>Binance claims Mazars stopped working with all crypto companies as the crypto community didn&#8217;t consider the audit report valid. The Big Four accounting firms have not cooperated with private crypto companies, but had audited publicly listed crypto firms.</p>

Traders expect a minor upside move near Christmas to push the BTC price above $17K.</p>
<p>Conversely, analysts believe Bitcoin price could see an upside move near Christmas, but a <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-crypto-on-chain-analysts-dismiss-santa-claus-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Claus rally for a move above $18K</a> is difficult this time. However, several experts and analysts do believe in a massive bullish rally in 2023 and BTC price hitting $100K.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is currently trading at $16,845. The 24-hour low and high are $16,755 and $16,895, respectively. Thus, the BTC price is up just 1% in the last 24 hours. However, the price shows more volatility.</p>

<p>Crypto analyst CredibleCrypto in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CredibleCrypto/status/1605663205065269248" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on December 22 predicts the Bitcoin price can move above $17K before the 2022 end. He asserts that Bitcoin is holding the 16.3K-16.5K range and BTC dominance has begun moving up.</p>

<p>Bitcoin price will move above $17K and then a rejection or bullish continuation can be seen. However, Bitcoin needs to hold the level for an upside move. <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-is-19k-still-possible-or-btc-to-fall-below-15k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CredibleCrypto earlier shared two scenarios</a> for Bitcoin (BTC) price as it tagged the $16.5K support level again. He remains bullish on Bitcoin rising over $19K in the short term.</p>
<p>Moreover, he fully agrees with BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes that the Bitcoin price can hit $100K by the 2023 end or early 2024.</p>
<h2>Why Bitcoin Price Can Hit 100K in 2023</h2>
<p>Experts believe 2023 will be a better year for the stock market as well as the crypto market as the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> shifts to buying treasuries. Felix Zulauf of hedge fund Zulauf Consulting and Arthur Hayes <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWp4fq9pH88" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> massive bullish rallies in mid-2023, possibly in April-May, will bring a turnaround of events that could reverse the cycle.</p>
<p>Technology stocks will rebound first, which saw massive selloffs in this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a>. The liquidity will be added as the economy goes bad, said Zulauf. Hayes asserts Bitcoin will hit $100K in late 2023. However, it all depends on the Fed&#8217;s pivot.</p>

Losing this support, the altcoin is poised for a longer correction which could lead to its market value to $200. However, here are three reasons why you should buy Binance coin(BNB).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/bJh7RvuB.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tradingview</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better price sustainability </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing bear trend, which tumbled the market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum by nearly 80%, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> coin has managed to hold its ground comparatively well. From the all-time high of $690.93, the BNB price tumbled by 65.07% and currently trades at the $240 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, rather than showing an evident downtrend, the weekly BNB chart resembles a sideways rally. Moreover, the chart shows later movement in support by $200 support.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth in RSI indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">Relative Strenght index(RSI)</a> projects the speed and magnitude of the coin’s recent price action indicating the underlying strength. Thus, for the last two swing lows in BNB price, the RSI slope shows a sharp rise, indicating the increasing buying pressure at lower support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, this bullish divergence increases the probability of price reversal from $200 support.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $200 level stands as strong support.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekly time chart showcase the $200 as a strong accumulation zone. The BNB price has shown several lower price rejections at this support, indicating the high buying pressure at this support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, last week the BNB price displayed a long wick rejection at $200, indicating the demand pressure persists, and the prices are likely to rebound from this support.</span></p>
<p><strong>Current price action</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Binance coin price witnessed an aggressive <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-addresses-heavy-withdrawals-amid-ongoing-fud/">outflow due to FUD</a> surrounding its Financial reports. As a result, the sudden downfall breached $250 support, offering sellers additional resistance to lead prices lower. Thus, the $250 support breakdown may encourage further downfall to $200 support in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, if the negative sentiment for Binance eased out, the BNB price should bounce higher and surpass the $250 mark to rechallenge the $360 swing high.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance Levels: $252 and $275</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support Levels: $220 and $190</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Scott Minerd&#8217;s Untimely Death</h2>
<p>Global investment and consulting financial services provider Guggenheim Partners offers investment banking, asset management, capital markets, and insurance services.</p>
<p>CEO and founder of Guggenheim Partners, Mark Walter, was quoted saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>I have known Scott for over 30 years and we were partners much of that time. Scott was a key innovator and thought leader who was instrumental in building Guggenheim Investments into the global business it is today.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Scott&#8217;s FTX Warning</h2>
<p>Scott was a proponent of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a> and frequently shared his takes and inputs about the up-and-coming <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> industry. Quite recently, the late Guggenheim CIO talked about the FTX <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> and its succeeding market turmoil in a telecasted interview.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/guggenheims-scott-minerd-warns-of-more-crypto-fallouts-due-to-ftx-collapse/">Scott Minerd Warns Of More Crypto Fallouts Due To FTX Collapse</a></em></p>
<p>According to him, the FTX saga was not over yet as he predicted further shakeouts in the crypto industry. Scott hinted at multiple crypto firms either filing for bankruptcy or winding up their operations due to the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> contagion spreading through the industry.</p>
<p>He was famously quoted saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s another shoe to drop – I can’t tell you where it is. There is going to be wash out just like the internet bubble.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Community Pays Tribute</h2>
<p>In a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/guggenheim-partners-announces-the-untimely-and-unexpected-death-of-scott-minerd-301709159.html" rel="nofollow">statement</a>, the company said their investment professionals at Guggenheim will honor Scott by carrying on his legacy &#8212; by incorporating the systems and procedures that Scott developed &#8212; in order to manage client portfolios.</p>
<p>The official announcement concluded by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will have much more to say in the next few days about Scott and his many contributions to our firm and to the communities we serve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prominent hedge fund manager Tom Hearden also expressed his sorrow on the untimely demise of Scott, on Twitter.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry for you loss Scott Minerd family and friends</p>
<p>&mdash; Tom Hearden (@followtheh) <a href="https://twitter.com/followtheh/status/1605950753843150851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Guggenheim later assured that there would be no disruption of service to their clients and also assured of no change in the daily management of client portfolios, all of which are handled by their investment professionals.</p>

With the year 2022 coming to an end, traders are hoping for a change in momentum for cryptocurrency prices. This year, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a> endured two huge spells of crashes in the form of Terra network collapse and the FTX bankruptcy. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to hover around the same range as five years ago.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Whales Selling Spree</h2>
<p>In an interesting trend, on chain activity points to increased selling among Bitcoin while the small retail traders continue to accumulate. Analysts observe that the current trend could be massively helpful in terms of reducing the wealth distribution gap. However, this could be a cause of concern for BTC holders in the shorter term as it could be a risky bet, according to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63a36e34f24d912e957f3923-Retail-buying-while-whales-are-selling-Bullish-or-not" rel="nofollow">Crypto Quant</a> data. But it makes sense in the larger perspective as it could lead to more even distribution of the top cryptocurrency.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Larger holders selling into smaller holders is really what you want to see if you believe in a longer-term Bitcoin thesis. Bitcoin becomes more distributed on the network. It is on the hands of more investors other than in the hands of a few whales.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The cryptocurrency&#8217;s price is currently at an yearly low level. As of writing, BTC price stands at $16,692, down 0.89% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>. It remains to be seen if the price would find an upward curve in January 2023 and beyond. On the macroeconomic front, challenges could remain in 2023 as the Fed suggested it could continue to raise interest rates.</p>

However, the current bear cycle has heavily discounted these tokens, and considering the increasing adoption of Web3; they may show huge potential in the near future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apecoin(APE)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/SSxgjVei.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing bear trend, the <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-why-apecoin-price-recovery-may-outperform-bitcoin-in-coming-weeks/">Apecoin price</a> tumbled 90.45% from its All-time High of $39.4. However, over the past seven months, the coin price has showcased a steady under the influence of a descending trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the APE price trades at the $3.6 mark and gradually approaches the overhead trendline. A bullish breakout from this dynamic resistance could drive the prices 150% higher to hit the $9.16 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theta Network(THETA)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/7/7MlT84PD.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Theta coin has witnessed a steady downfall since April 2021. Thus, from the All time high of $15.9, the prices have tumbled by 95.1% and currently trade at the $0.779 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for the past seven months, the THETA price has mainly traded in a sideways rally indicating the bearish momentum is getting exhausted. If the prices manage to sustain above the $0.82 or $0.575 support, a potential recovery cycle may lead this coin to the $1.7 mark by mid-2023.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sandbox(SAND)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/w/wkmjtv9N.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a V-top reversal, the SAND tokens price has dropped from an all-time high of $8.4 to $0.44, registering a 94.4% decline. However, Over the past four months, the coin price has been wobbling inside a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">falling channel pattern</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, this bullish continuation pattern may encourage a strong direction rally upon the breakout of its resistance trendline. This breakout could lead the prices to the $1.5 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axie Infinity(AXS)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/SmnaJq48.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AXS price shows a textbook example of a V-top reversal from the $165.37 all-time high. Amid the ongoing downtrend, the prices have tumbled 95.77% from the peak and currently exchanging hands at $7.05.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the price action starting to lean sideways suggests the bearish momentum is gradually fading.  Thus, If the Axie infinity coin manages to bottom around $6 or $5, a bullish recovery to $20 is plausible by mid-2023.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentraland(MANA)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/q/Qmt7p3fk.png" alt="TradingView Chart" /></strong>Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A steady downfall from November 2021, the MANA coin price turned down from an All-Time high of $5.90 and slumped 94.80%. However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI indicator</a>, which reflects the strength of price movement, is dumped to the oversold region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RSI value of 27% in the weekly chart indicates the selling activity has overextended or discounted to a large extent. Thus, if the price manages to sustain above the $0.23 mark, a possible recovery may encourage a price jump to 0.7 by mid-2023.</span></p>

The cryptocurrency received significant momentum due to the Coinbase LUNC buy news. The positive momentum is quite strong now among traders, so much so that the LUNC price rose way higher than the rest of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a>. This comes amid market challenges like more companies facing liquidity issues due to the FTX bankruptcy and the macroeconomic scene.</p>

<p>In this context, Bitcoin price continues to hover around in the $16,500 level since November 2022. Considering the current scenario and the holiday season next week, BTC&#8217;s sideways movement could continue for considerable future. Meanwhile, the Terra Classic (LUNC) price is attempting to reach the 7-day high level of $0.00016. As of writing, LUNC price stands at $0.0001352, up 4.94% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<h2>LUNC Price Already Found Bottom?</h2>
<p>In this context, the crypto community is wondering if LUNC has already found the bottom. Many LUNC holders believe the token found its bottom at $0.00012. Crypto analysts believe the token is making a good recovery at the current level. Meanwhile, Binance said it completed the second round of <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-completes-second-round-of-terra-luna-airdrop-distribution-to-terra-classic-lunc-and-terraclassicusd-ustc-holders-6c9ca64a94064973a273328edc99019a" rel="nofollow">Terra (LUNA) airdrop distribution</a> to eligible users who held Terra Classic (LUNC).</p>

<p>In a recent interview with Barron, Miller said that he expected Bitcoin to fall further after the FTX fiasco. Investors are withdrawing their coins from the market as the dust from the failed <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> is yet to settle. He went on to add that he is optimistic about Bitcoin’s performance in the future.</p>
<p>Miller said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m surprised Bitcoin isn’t at half of its current price, given the FTX implosion. People have fled the space, so the fact that it’s still hanging in there at $17,000 is pretty remarkable. But inflation is being attacked, and real rates are rising rapidly. I would expect that if and when the Federal Reserve begins to pivot, Bitcoin would do quite well.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/heres-how-much-your-1000-invested-in-bitcoin-10-years-ago-will-be-worth-today-btc/">Here’s How Much Your $1000 Invested In Bitcoin 10 Years Ago Will Be Worth Today</a></p>
<h2>Treat Bitcoin like gold</h2>
<p>Miller is a bitcoin holder, who believes that bitcoin should be treated like gold. He believes in the long term investment power of the coin.</p>
<p>He added,</p>
<blockquote><p>“First, I want to differentiate between Bitcoin, which I see as a potential store of value like digital gold, and all the other cryptocurrencies, which can be lumped together in the category of venture speculation. Most of them, like most venture investments, will fail. But I’ve never heard a good argument that you shouldn’t put at least 1% of your net worth into Bitcoin. Anybody can afford to lose 1%.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Eminently, Miller’s operator speculation ability is featured by the way that his administration of a portfolio beat the S&amp;P 500 List from 1991 to 2005 successively. Other than Bitcoin, Miller’s operator portfolio involves Amazon and Silvergate Capital.</p>
<h2>Reasons for the collapse of crypto market</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">FED</a> has announced the increase of interest rates and hinted towards more increases than expected in the future.</p>
<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, this year in the U.S. Its CEO, SBF has been arrested in the Bahamas. The grounds for his arrest are fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. He is <a href="https://coingape.com/ftxs-sbf-signs-extradition-paper-will-fly-to-us-on-wednesday/">being extradited to the U.S.</a> where further legal proceedings will take place. The failure of the leading exchange crashed the entire crypto market. The market is still not showing signs of recovery from the debacle.</p>

Also, other virtual assets over the previous five years</p>
<p>According to experts and officials, North Korea has turned to crypto-hacking and other illegal cyber activities. However, as a source of desperately needed foreign currency to support its fragile economy. Also, to fund its nuclear program in response to harsh U.N. sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h2><strong>North Korean hackers stole $1.2 billion worth of assets</strong></h2>
<p>North Korea has focused on <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-responds-to-allegations-denies-reports-on-money-laundering/">cybercrimes</a> since U.N. economic sanctions were strengthened in 2017. However, it was in response to its nuclear and missile tests, according to South Korea&#8217;s main spy agency. Also, its ability to steal digital assets is thought to be among the best in the world.</p>
<p>The United Nations sanctions were put in place between 2016 and 2017. It was to forbade North Korea from exporting important goods like coal, textiles, and seafood. They also forced member states to bring home North Koreans who were working abroad. After it enacted some of the most severe restrictions in the world to combat the pandemic, its economy experienced further setbacks.</p>
<p>North Korean hackers are thought to have stolen $1.2 billion ($1.5 trillion) worth of virtual assets worldwide. However,  since 2017, including $800 billion ($626 million) just this year. It was stated that South Korea contributed more than 100 billion won ($78 million) of the total.</p>
<h3><strong>Despite the economic crisis, North Korea conducted missile tests</strong></h3>
<p>It was stated that more cyberattacks by North Korean hackers were anticipated to take place in the coming year. However, it&#8217;s an effort to steal cutting-edge South Korean technologies as well as private data pertaining to that country&#8217;s national security and foreign policy.</p>
<p>Despite its economic woes, North Korea has conducted a record number of missile tests this year. However, some experts believe it to be an effort to modernize its arsenal. Also, to increase its negotiating power in the future with its rivals.</p>

<p>An <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a></strong> avatar is a digitally generated image that is cartoonish or pixelated in appearance. NFT avatar typically takes the form of a profile picture and includes images of the characters, typically from the shoulder up. An NFT avatar, however, stands out because it&#8217;s typically made with incredibly distinctive artistic characteristics. NFTs of an alien-like abstract character or a well-known character with an odd design are both possible. Since no two avatars are alike in appearance, yours will always be different. The most well-known NFT avatar collections are Avatars, Hashmasks, Bored Ape Kennel Club, and CryptoPunks.</p>
<p>In recent years, the market for non-fungible tokens avatars has grown significantly. You may have noticed that land sells for a premium price if you read our guide on how to purchase virtual land in the <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaverse</a>. NFT avatars do indeed follow suit and fetch millions of dollars in the appropriate market. Avatars that are compatible with the user&#8217;s platform are also purchased and displayed.</p>
<h2><strong>Why are NFT Avatars so Popular?</strong></h2>
<p>On the digital market, NFT avatars are extremely well-liked for a number of different reasons. But some of the key factors that contribute to their appeal are as follows:</p>
<h4><strong>Investment</strong></h4>
<p>These avatars can be excellent long-term investments, similar to how virtual land is. Many users bought these avatars when the price was low because they entered this market early. The same avatars are now being sold for triple their original price and even more. Therefore, if you enjoy the idea of profiting from a digital asset, an NFT avatar might be the best investment for you.</p>
<h4><strong>Avatars are rare</strong></h4>
<p>Each NFT avatar has its own individuality, as was already mentioned. Although a user can copy and paste that image anywhere, the owner is the true owner of the avatar. Similar to the art world, there are fewer sought-after avatars now because they are constantly being purchased. Depending on how old an avatar is, the price of limited NFT collections has skyrocketed. Therefore, it makes sense that a user who appreciates all of this would consider purchasing a rare and <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/most-expensive-nfts-ever-sold-heres-the-top-10-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expensive NFT</a>. This feeds this engine, which in turn propels the NFT avatar boom forward.</p>
<h4><strong>Community Benefits</strong></h4>
<p>These avatars serve a variety of functions, but that does not mean they are without advantages. Communities have grown up around some NFT collections. These communities provide extra benefits that might be unique to that group. For instance, after purchasing an avatar, some NFT communities grant access to a private Discord server and channel.</p>
<p>Additionally, a well-known NFT collection known as the Bored Ape Yacht Club has a private digital public restroom where users can write graffiti. Depending on the type of NFT you purchase, you might also receive other special advantages.</p>
<h4><strong>Metaverse NFT Avatars</strong></h4>
<p>The community, the foundation for a metaverse, is a<a href="https://coingape.com/top-5-metaverse-blockchain-projects-to-lookout-for-in-2022-heres-a-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> virtual world</a> with its own identities, audiences, and rules. However, it is at the heart of NFT avatars. The various use cases of non-fungible tokens avatar collections serve as evidence that NFT avatars are gradually reaching a stage of maturity in this regard. Royalties, character upgrades, and gamification are just a few of the additional utilities that many projects are working to implement.</p>
<h3><strong>What Are NFT Avatars Used For?</strong></h3>
<p>NFT avatars serve a variety of purposes beyond just being visually appealing. Your application may differ depending on the type of user you are. Non-fungible tokens avatars are most frequently employed for the following purposes, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collectibles</li>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Popular NFT Avatar Collections</strong></h3>
<p>There are numerous well-known <a href="https://coingape.com/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT collections available</a>, and each one has its own distinct artistic principles and style. What one user finds appealing might not necessarily be adored by another. The following are some of the top non-fungible tokens avatar collections:</p>
<h5><strong>CryptoPunks</strong></h5>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/aggregatorapps/cryptopunks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoPunks</a></strong> is the first NFT avatar project ever and consists of 10,000 different pixelated avatars that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Although CryptoPunks was initially offered without charge in 2017, that has since changed. With the passage of time, these avatars have risen in price, with a single punk fetching prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The priciest punk ever sold (#5822) fetched a record-breaking sum of nearly $24 million.</p>
<h5><strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club</strong></h5>
<p>The Ape Yacht Club was established in 2021 and consisted of 10,000 unique ape avatars that were all created on the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a>. No two apes are alike, and these distinctive assets each have their own distinct design. The Ape Yacht Club has rapidly gained popularity, and the collection&#8217;s avatars have become priceless collectibles.</p>
<h5><strong>Azuki</strong></h5>
<p>Azuki is one of the blockchain&#8217;s other distinct sets of avatars, and it&#8217;s possibly my favorite. The extremely vibrant art style of Azuki non-fungible tokens avatars only adds to their visual appeal. But owners also get access to the Garden in addition to just an avatar.</p>
<h2>Can you sell your own NFTs Avatar?</h2>
<p>Yes, you certainly can. All you have to do is post your NFT avatar on auction sites like OpenSea and watch for a bid. Additionally, you can decide on your own price and check to see if an online user is interested. Once a deal is reached, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a> will be sent to your wallet, and the user will then become the legal owner of the NFTs.</p>

<h2><strong>The Future of NFT Avatar Projects</strong></h2>
<p>NFT avatars are here to stay and will keep developing in terms of features and utility. This fact will help create a more diverse NFT ecosystem with a range of functionalities, including gamification, royalties, and staking.</p>
<p>Users can visit the Binance non-fungible token Marketplace, where we offer reasonably priced and high-quality non-fungible tokens avatar collections. However, Lucky Doge Club, Crypto Sharks, Angry Pandas, Cyber Doberman, and many more can start collecting non-fungible tokens avatars.</p>
