In this issue, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reports interest in central bank digital currencies (CBDC) in Latam and the Caribbean is picking up, Lula criticizes the current international economic system, and Venezuela integrates the Russian Mir payments system.</strong></p>
<h2>IMF Finds Interest in CBDC Picks up Steam in Latam and the Caribbean</h2>
<p>A report <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/06/22/cf-interest-in-cb-digital-currencies-picks-up-in-latam-the-caribbean-while-crypto-use-varies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revealed that interest in central bank digital currencies (CBDC) remains high in Latam and the Caribbean. According to a recent survey with governments of the region, &#8220;half of the respondents were considering both retail and wholesale CBDC options.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brazil is one of the countries experimenting with a two-tiered CBDC model, which is in its proof of concept stage. If issued, it would be connected to the &#8220;Open Finance&#8221; concept of the Central Bank of Brazil.</p>
<p>The reasons for researching CBDCs in the region are diverse, including financial inclusion, monetary sovereignty, and strengthening the access and effectiveness of payment systems.</p>
<h2>Brazil&#8217;s Lula Declares Bretton Woods Institutions &#8216;No Longer Function&#8217;</h2>
<p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva stated that the institutions driving the current global financial order derived from the Bretton Woods agreement are outdated. At the closing of the summit for a new global financial pact, Lula <a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/WB-and-IMF-No-Longer-Respond-to-the-Worlds-Interests-Lula-20230623-0007.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bretton Woods institutions no longer function and no longer meet the aspirations and interests of society. We have to be very clear about this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lula, who also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-to-push-de-dollarization-agenda-at-brics-meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> he would push a de-dollarization agenda at the next BRICS meeting, railed against the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a financing entity, accusing the institution of causing the bankruptcy of nations. He concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot continue with the same institutions that are functioning erroneously, and the same goes for the United Nations Security Council&#8230; The representatives from 1945 cannot be the same as today.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Venezuela Integrates Russian Mir Payments System</h2>
<p>The government of Venezuela <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuela-to-integrate-russian-mir-payments-system-in-de-dollarization-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it was working to integrate Mir, a Russian card and transfer payment system, into its network. According to statements of Calixto Ortega, president of the Central Bank of Venezuela, almost 40,000 point-of-sale terminals were updated to receive payments from Mir-compliant cards.</p>
<p>Ortega stated the central bank aims for 30% of the point-of-sale terminals to accept these cards and convert the payments made in rubles to national fiat currency. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro supported this development, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They tried to isolate us monetarily and financially, unfairly, with blockades and criminal sanctions, however, with the incorporation into the Russian Mir Payment System, we are building financial and monetary systems of the new world.</p>

However, she maintains a neutral stance regarding the forthcoming July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, emphasizing her desire to preserve flexibility by &#8220;maintaining optionality.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Fed’s Daly Doesn&#8217;t Want to ‘Trip the Economy up Into an Unforced Error’</h2>
<p>During the June FOMC gathering, the U.S. Federal Reserve members <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">decided to refrain</a> from raising the federal funds rate for that specific meeting. Jerome Powell, the current chairman of the Federal Reserve, informed the media that the upcoming July FOMC meeting would be a “live” one, as it would determine whether or not the central bank would increase the interest rate during that period.</p>
<p>Powell then <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-powell-signals-more-rate-hikes-this-year-as-taming-inflation-has-long-way-to-go/">testified</a> before the House Financial Services Committee last Wednesday and indicated that the benchmark bank rate is likely to rise again this year. In an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/feds-daly-two-more-us-rate-hikes-very-reasonable-projection-2023-06-23/">interview</a> with Reuters, Mary Daly, the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, expressed her belief that two more rate hikes would be a &#8220;very reasonable&#8221; projection. However, Daly also emphasized the need for caution and a gradual approach, given that the rate is currently at its highest level in 16 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, in my judgment, prudent policy &#8230; to slow the pace of policy as you near the destination,&#8221; Daly stated.</p>
<p>During an interview with CBS&#8217;s &#8220;Face the Nation&#8221; last year, Daly discussed the Fed&#8217;s response to inflation and stressed the importance of caution and a &#8220;measured&#8221; approach. “History tells us with Fed policy that abrupt and aggressive action can actually have a destabilizing effect on the very growth and price stability we’re trying to achieve,” Daly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/st-louis-fed-president-says-central-banks-credibility-is-on-the-line-as-us-inflation-surges/">said</a> at the time.</p>
<p>Now, Daly asserts that the situation is &#8220;about balanced,&#8221; and a measured approach is still necessary to navigate through the current economy. &#8220;I want to make sure that we balance those risks on both sides, of under- or over-tightening,&#8221; Daly said. &#8220;Adding another six weeks to our decision space, to me that seems optimal and prudent.”</p>
<p>Daly stated that &#8220;taking a slower pace as we approach our destination means we save many Americans from either stopping short and wishing we had done more, or going too far and wishing we had done less.&#8221; In other words, Daly insists that if the central bank proceeds at a more gradual pace, it will be less likely to make mistakes that it may regret later. Daly told Reuters that she is committed to restoring price stability, but doing so requires caution.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I want to do, while we resolutely work to restore price stability &#8211; give these people back some peace of mind, and lives and livelihoods &#8211; is make sure we are doing it as carefully as we can so we don&#8217;t end up inadvertently, in our rush to do it today, trip the economy up into an unforced error,” added the president of the San Francisco Fed branch.</p>
<p>Last month&#8217;s consumer price index indicated that inflation is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-inflation-cools-to-4-annual-rate-setting-stage-for-feds-decision-on-interest-rates/">cooling</a>, but at 4%, it still exceeds the Fed&#8217;s annual target of 2%. Americans are also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/record-high-credit-card-debt-55-of-americans-concerned-about-repayment-as-inflation-pushes-consumers-to-credit-reliance/">grappling</a> with the highest credit card debt since 1999, when the Fed began recording the figures, and a Newsweek poll shows that Americans are actively relying on credit cards to mitigate inflationary pressures. While a more restrictive monetary policy may be necessary, Daly is currently uncertain if it will achieve the desired balance.</p>
<p>&#8220;More tightening may be required to get the economy sustainably back into balance. But do I know that? No&#8230;.we are going to have to find the terminal rate by looking at the data,” concluded Daly.</p>

According to evaluations, almost three-quarters of the jurisdictions are partially compliant or non-compliant with these recommendations.</strong></p>
<h2>FATF Plenary Calls To &#8216;Close Gaps&#8217; in Global Regulation of Virtual Assets</h2>
<p>The third plenary of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global money-laundering watchdog, is calling to close the regulatory gaps in the compliance system of virtual assets. The meeting, held in Paris with the participation of more than 200 delegates, examined the adoption level of the recommendations of the institution regarding virtual assets and virtual assets service providers (VASPs).</p>
<p>According to reports and evaluations, almost three-quarters or more of the jurisdictions present were either partially compliant or just non-compliant with these recommendations. A FATF plenary publication <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfgeneral/outcomes-fatf-plenary-june-2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many jurisdictions have not yet implemented fundamental requirements, and more than half of survey respondents have not taken any steps towards implementing the travel rule, a key FATF requirement to prevent funds being transferred to sanctioned individuals or entities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The travel rule, part of the FATF recommendations, involves collecting the identities of the sender and recipient of a transaction. Also, depending on a designated threshold, the institution recommends requiring more data. This recommendation, relatively new for VASPs, calls for the organization of a set of communication rules and cross-border data-sharing protocols among participants of the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<h2>Incoming Measures</h2>
<p>The FATF plenary explained that this lack of compliance with the proposed recommendations opens loopholes for criminals to exploit and established the closure of these regulatory loopholes as an urgent priority. The institution will publish an upcoming report urging countries to implement its recommendations to avoid criminals taking advantage of these gaps.</p>
<p>The report, which will be published on June 27, will also highlight the risks of the activities of North Korea and the usage of virtual assets to finance its weapons of mass destruction program. The risks associated with decentralized finance activities and peer-to-peer transactions will also be addressed.</p>
<p>In May, FATF president Raja Kumar <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fatf-president-urges-g7-to-lead-in-shutting-down-lawless-crypto-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urged</a> the countries of the Group of Seven (G7) to &#8220;lead by example&#8221; by implementing the FATF recommendations in their respective regulations &#8220;so that no safe havens exist for illicit crypto transactions.&#8221;</p>

Although the rate hike decision was widely anticipated, the increase still fell short of the 21% that some analysts had predicted. </strong></p>
<h2>Turkish Lira Down 21% Since the Start of 2023</h2>
<p>The exchange rate of the Turkish currency — the lira — versus the greenback fell to a record low of 25.74 per dollar a day after the central bank hiked interest rates by 650 basis points to 15% on June 22. The currency’s latest fall means the lira has now depreciated by just over 27% during the first half of 2023.</p>
<p>While the central bank was widely expected to abandon the recently re-elected President Tayyip Erdogan’s unconventional policies, a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/turkeys-lira-hits-fresh-record-lows-after-rate-hike-2023-06-23/#:~:text=ISTANBUL%2C%20June%2023%20(Reuters),his%20long%2Dheld%20unorthodox%20policies.">report</a> said the hike had fallen short of analysts&#8217; prediction of 21%. According to the report, some analysts believe a higher rate hike would have signaled the that Turkish government is about combating inflation.</p>
<p>As recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/turks-turn-to-tether-amid-record-inflation-limited-access-to-dollar-report-reveals/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the lira’s fall in recent years and the subsequent price increases have forced many Turks to seek refuge in digital assets such as the stablecoin tether. Others have turned to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-turkeys-september-gold-imports-up-by-1700-as-individuals-swap-falling-lira-with-the-precious-metal/">gold</a> and the greenback which is now in short supply. While Tayyip is reported to have initially resisted calls to end his unorthodox monetary policies, the country’s deteriorating economic situation is thought to have forced the Turkish leader&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>However, before increasing the interest rates to 15%, the central bank now led by the recently appointed governor Hafize Gaye Erkan, said the rate hikes would be gradual. The same sentiments were reportedly expressed by the new Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek.</p>
<h2>The End of &#8216;Erdoğanomics&#8217;</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs suggested in a recent note that the central bank may have already started the phased adjustment of rates with the 6.5% hike.</p>
<p>&#8220;The transition appears to be more gradual than we had thought,&#8221; the financial services giant reportedly said.</p>
<p>According to the Reuters report, Turkey, whose inflation rate has continued to soar, kept interest rates pegged at 8.5% since 2021. Although the policy was widely criticized, President repeatedly defended the decision and vowed to keep the rates low as long as he was in power. However, just a few weeks after winning the elections, President Tayyip approved the policy U-turn that one report characterized as &#8220;the end of Erdoğanomics.&#8221;</p>

Numerous individuals have stepped forward over the years, proclaiming themselves as the elusive creator of Bitcoin. However, none of them have succeeded in providing substantial evidence or convincing the wider crypto community. Interestingly, it has been over four years since anyone has made such a claim, indicating that the era of self-proclaimed inventors of Bitcoin may have reached its conclusion.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>The Fading Mirage &#x2014; Self-Proclaimed Satoshis Disappear from Crypto Scene</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? The true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown, as the name is believed to be a pseudonym. The only known connection to Satoshi Nakamoto is through an <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/satoshi-archive/emails/">email correspondence</a> and <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/satoshi-archive/forum/">forum posts</a> attributed to the name. However, a birthdate of April 5, 1975, was registered on the P2P Foundation forum, where Nakamoto announced the release of the <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a> in 2008. Despite this information, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto continues to elude the public.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In 2018 and 2019, a series of individuals emerged, asserting their identity as Satoshi Nakamoto, only to fail in providing the necessary proof or swaying the beliefs of bitcoiners. As an illustration, approximately five years ago, Matthew Leising penned an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180702065614/https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-06-30/is-bitcoin-creator-writing-a-book-cryptic-note-indicates-yes?__twitter_impression=true">article</a> for Bloomberg, unveiling the plans of Bitcoin&#x2019;s self-proclaimed creator to publish a tell-all book.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, this person, known as &#x2018;Duality,&#x2019; never released the anticipated book. Instead, they left behind a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180630181615/http://nakamotofamilyfoundation.org/">website</a>, a puzzling &#x201C;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180630184523/http://nakamotofamilyfoundation.org/cryptogram.html">Cryptopuzzle</a>&#x201D; and a manuscript titled &#x201C;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180630184523/http://nakamotofamilyfoundation.org/duality.pdf">Duality: An excerpt</a>.&#x201D; Despite the initial intrigue, this incident ultimately fizzled out, fading from people&#x2019;s memories as if it never occurred.&#13;</p>
<div>&#13;</p>
<dl id="attachment_594950">&#13;</p>

&#13;

<p>&#13;
</dl>
<p>&#13;
</p></div>
<p>&#13;<br />
It is intriguing to note that in that very same month of 2018, yet another self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto sort-of made an appearance. It was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/i-am-the-real-satoshi-claims-hawaiian-man-after-filing-bitcoin-cash-trademark/">discovered</a> that a resident of Hawaii had filed trademark requests for the name Bitcoin Cash, while also engaging in website squatting, seizing control of various <a href="https://archive.fo/5EnW8">domains</a> associated with the name Satoshi and the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> ticker.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" title="End of an Era: Over 4 Years Pass Without Self-Proclaimed Satoshis" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/realsat.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230625%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230625T123300Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=20f3b45867a48f849f0979d76ce89648cec20373928e200a8c317214353d06d7" alt="End of an Era: Over 4 Years Pass Without Self-Proclaimed Satoshis" width="1280" height="325">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The person behind these actions was allegedly <a href="http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2001/May/18/br/br07p.html">Ronald Keala Kua Maria</a>, a Hawaiian individual who boldly declared themselves to be Satoshi Nakamoto. However, similar to the previous case of Duality, this person with trademarks and websites chose not to step into the limelight, allowing their initial claim to fade away, and ultimately, the tale was forgotten.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" title="End of an Era: Over 4 Years Pass Without Self-Proclaimed Satoshis" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/snblo9.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230625%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230625T123300Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=13dd93be2e93394b9b8d4b4fc331dfb1fcbbe9406f85b19dbdf7dd805845583c" alt="End of an Era: Over 4 Years Pass Without Self-Proclaimed Satoshis" width="1280" height="550">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In November 2018, a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-satoshi-message-attempts-to-sway-public-opinion-but-fails/">message</a> allegedly signed from block 9 emerged, accompanied by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181116211026/https:/twitter.com/satoshi/status/1063516638870478848">now-deleted</a> Twitter handle. However, this narrative swiftly faded away as software and blockchain developers Gregory Maxwell and Christopher Jeffrey <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9xpivk/satoshi_i_do_not_want_to_be_public_but_there_is/e9uo87m/">promptly debunked</a> its authenticity. Simultaneously, within the same month, the Satoshi Nakamoto account registered on the P2P Foundation forum left the community intrigued by posting a <a href="http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto?xg_source=activity">single word</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A month earlier, the crypto world became acquainted with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-satoshi-challenger-tells-all-but-is-he-legit/">Phil Wilson</a>, also known as &#x201C;scronty,&#x201D; who claimed to be part of the Bitcoin creation group. Despite Wilson spinning an elaborate tale, he himself admitted the lack of verifiable evidence throughout. Ultimately, Wilson&#x2019;s account became just another instance of an individual making claims without substantial proof, gradually receding into the land of forgotten Satoshi stories.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>2019&#x2019;s Trio of Self-Proclaimed Satoshis</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In 2019, the Satoshi Nakamoto saga continued with the emergence of three more claimants. The first one to step into the spotlight was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshi-nakamolto-emerges-with-great-hair-and-questionable-claims/">J&#xF6;rg Molt</a>, also known as the infamous &#x201C;hair guy.&#x201D; Despite Molt&#x2019;s appearance, the wider crypto community dismissed him as a mere joke. However, while many considered him a phony, the individual who also operated under the alias &#x2018;DJ Sun Love&#x2019; found himself <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/self-proclaimed-bitcoin-inventor-jorg-molt-arrested-for-alleged-crypto-pension-fraud/">facing arrest</a> for his alleged involvement in a crypto pension fund scam that reportedly defrauded around 50 people.&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mr. Jorg Molt, Co-Founder, BITCOIN, delivering a talk to SIMS student managers on BITCOIN and its applications. # <a href="https://twitter.com/PuneSIMS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PuneSIMS</a> # SIMSARC # BITCOIN <a href="https://t.co/BfONsKZjCl">pic.twitter.com/BfONsKZjCl</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; SIMS, Pune (@PuneSIMS) <a href="https://twitter.com/PuneSIMS/status/1074536827573293056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Then, in mid-August 2019, a Pakistani individual named <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-self-proclaimed-satoshi-fails-to-sway-crypto-community/">Bilal Khalid</a>, accompanied by his PR firm Ivy McLemore, made a grand announcement, proclaiming Khalid as the mastermind behind Bitcoin. Khalid penned a series of elaborate essays on the subject, but his claims were met with skepticism and not taken seriously. To add to the intrigue, Khalid stated that he had lost his ostensible stash of 980,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> when he sent his laptop in for repair, adding another layer of doubt to his story.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Lastly, in 2019, a Belgian individual by the name of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-satoshi-steps-out-of-the-woodwork-calls-craig-wright-a-liar/">Debo Jurgen Etienne Guido</a> made multiple claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto. Debo had been active in the crypto scene since 2015, maintaining a Twitter account where he regularly asserted his identity as Bitcoin&#x2019;s creator. Presently, the Twitter account under the handle &#x201C;<a href="https://twitter.com/realsatoshin?lang=en">@realSatoshiN</a>&#x201D; still exists, although its tweets are now set to private.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" title="End of an Era: Over 4 Years Pass Without Self-Proclaimed Satoshis" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dds.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230625%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230625T123300Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=3f43b2bd11b8d994bb18c9a755a8131ebcdd505a6ce1eb59883ee428b4c40404" alt="End of an Era: Over 4 Years Pass Without Self-Proclaimed Satoshis" width="1280" height="550">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, Debo&#x2019;s claims faced widespread skepticism, and he never managed to provide the necessary proof to convince the larger cryptocurrency community of his story. Since the occurrences involving Molt, Khalid, and Debo, no other individual has stepped forward to claim the Satoshi mantle since 2019.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
While it&#x2019;s been over four years since these individuals emerged, people recognize that the genuine brilliance of Satoshi Nakamoto lies not in their identity but in the ideas they spawned and the revolution they set in motion. Bitcoin, the brainchild of an anonymous visionary, has established a counter-economy and censorship-resistant money, which has fundamentally challenged conventional finance. For the majority of Bitcoin proponents and cryptocurrency enthusiasts today, Satoshi&#x2019;s identity holds no significance, and the accounts of those purporting to be Satoshi are mere fabrications.&#13;<br />

<h2>Crypto Economy Swells With Bitcoin Cash, Pepe, and Aave Leading the Way</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Over the past 48 hours, the cryptocurrency market&#x2019;s worth has grown by an additional $30 billion. As of June 25, among the 9,941 cryptocurrencies listed on <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">coingecko.com</a>, the market cap stands at $1.24 billion &#x2013; a 0.4% increase at 9:34 a.m. (ET) within the last day. This week witnessed bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) soar by 15.7%, while ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) jumped by 10.4%. Apart from <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>) experienced the largest weekly gains among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, amassing 11.3%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the past day alone, global crypto trade volume reached $38.62 billion; of this sum, $24 billion were paired with stablecoins. The most significant weekly gain was achieved by bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>), which rose 88.2% against the U.S. dollar. As of Sunday at 9 a.m., <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> is trading at approximately $202.35 per unit and claims the sixth-highest trade volume today with around $1.31 billion in transactions during the last day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Pepe (PEPE) also emerged as one of this week&#x2019;s market frontrunners, increasing by 64.7% within seven days. In terms of trade volume within a day&#x2019;s time frame, PEPE occupies today&#x2019;s eleventh position among top traded cryptocurrencies per coin. PEPE&#x2019;s trading volume on Sunday amounts to approximately $312 million, and the token trades for $0.00000159 per unit at 9:34 a.m. Furthermore, decentralized finance (defi) platform Aave&#x2019;s crypto asset, aave (AAVE), witnessed a 47.1% increase this week. Aave currently ranks ninth in global trade volume, reporting a substantial $559 million over the past day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Bitcoinsv (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BSV" target="_blank">BSV</a>) experienced a notable 44.8% weekly uptick against the dollar, making it the fourth-largest gainer in growth. Additionally, the kava (KAVA) token rose by 36.7%, and synthetix (SNX) leaped 28.3% within a week&#x2019;s time. Despite these gains, six cryptocurrencies incurred losses ranging from 1.2% to 6.8%. Among these are two gold-backed assets: XAUT and PAXG. Kucoin (KCS) lost 6.8% against the U.S. dollar this week, rocketpool (RPL) dropped by 5%, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> shed around 2.8% this week. Another loser was bittorent (BTT) as it lost 1.7% against the U.S. dollar over the past seven days.&#13;<br />

Garlinghouse stated that while he was a public servant, Hinman “received millions of dollars of payments from his law firm,” part of an alliance with a vested interest in his speech.</p>

This decision catapults the central bank&#8217;s rate to its highest level since 2008 and represents the most substantial surge in three months. Coinciding with this development, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) published a study on the same day, asserting that the escalated interest rates would translate into elevated mortgage payments, potentially pushing 1.2 million households in the U.K. towards insolvency in 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Bank of England&#8217;s Interest Rate Hikes Endanger 1.2 Million UK Households&#8217; Financial Stability, NIESR Researchers Say</h2>
<p>In a noteworthy announcement on Thursday, the Bank of England (BOE) unveiled its decision to increase the key bank rate by 0.5%, propelling it to a solid 5%. Shedding light on the rationale behind this move, the BOE articulated in a <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/explainers/why-are-interest-rates-in-the-uk-going-up#:~:text=On%20Thursday%2022%20June%202023,just%20%27the%20interest%20rate%27.">blog post</a> that inflation in the United Kingdom had reached a level deemed “too high.” With the annual rate hovering just below 9%, the central bank is steadfast in its objective to attain a 2% inflation rate. The BOE&#8217;s blog post divulges, “If you have a mortgage or loan, that means your payments may go up.”</p>
<p>Following the upward adjustment of the benchmark bank rate by the BOE, the release of a <a href="https://www.niesr.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Briefing-Note-Projecting-the-Consequence-of-Rising-Mortgage-Repayments-in-2023-1.pdf">study</a> by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) <a href="https://www.niesr.ac.uk/news/1-2-million-uk-households-insolvent-year-direct-result-higher-mortgage-repayments">shed light</a> on a disconcerting outcome: higher interest rates are poised to plunge millions of Britons into the depths of insolvency.</p>
<p>NIESR economist Max Mosley articulately expressed this concern, stating, “The rise in interest rates to 5% will push millions of households with mortgages towards the brink of insolvency.” Mosley further emphasized that it would be unrealistic for the government to anticipate U.K. households to weather these jolts to their financial stability.</p>
<p>The NIESR economist said:</p>
<blockquote><p>No lender would expect a household to withstand a shock of this magnitude, so the Government shouldn’t either. Some investment should be done in forbearance agreements, giving households and lenders the ability to create payment plans that work for each other.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amidst the Bank of England experiencing its most rapid rate increase since gaining independence in 1997, the NIESR research resolutely underscores the far-reaching impact that millions of households are poised to endure. Startlingly, the researchers assert that a substantial portion of the population will bear the brunt of this economic upheaval, with their hard-earned savings at risk of vanishing into thin air. Notably, residents from Wales and the North-East are anticipated to face a disproportionately heavy burden in this unfolding scenario. “6% of households are projected to be insolvent by the end of the year as a direct result of rising mortgage repayments,” NIESR detailed.</p>
<p>The BOE&#8217;s blog post on June 22 highlights an important distinction for debtors: those who opt for a fixed rate “won’t see any change until the end of [the] fixed period.” However, the central bank cautions that individuals with loans or mortgages tied to variable interest rates “might find that the cost of your repayments goes up.” Recent data from U.K. Finance in December 2022 reveals that approximately <a href="https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/mortgages/guide-to-variable-rate-mortgages/">17%</a> (equivalent to 1.4 million) of the outstanding mortgages in the U.K. operate on variable rates.</p>

<h2>Maximalist Ideology</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Veteran trader Peter Brandt recently riled altcoiners after he suggested that bitcoin will outperform and outlast what he described as &#x201C;make-believe cryptos wannabees.&#x201D; Brandt made the remarks after Mike Cautillo &#x2014; a private investor at e-Holdings &#x2014; concurred with his earlier tweet about <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s impending &#x201C;decisive breakout.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">$Bitcoin <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> is the legacy coin and will outlast and out-value all of the make-believe cryptos wannabees <a href="https://t.co/uzeuKua1qk">https://t.co/uzeuKua1qk</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1670911421117284354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Matthew Casterns, one of the Twitter users that responded to Brandt&#x2019;s remarks, said he did not understand the reasoning behind the veteran trader&#x2019;s assertions. Casterns argued that proclaiming <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> &#x201C;will forever out-value everything&#x201D; is misguided. He also urged Brandt to stay flexible.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Another Twitter user, Allicnac, reminded Brandt about the Bitcoin network&#x2019;s high transaction fees and long confirmation times and how these make the facilitation of efficient transactions impossible. The user ended the <a href="https://twitter.com/allicnac/status/1670968755831054339">tweet</a> by telling Brandt not to be &#x201C;fooled by maximalist ideology.&#x201D;&#13;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>&#13;<br />
However, in his subsequent tweets on the same subject, Brandt, who has previously clashed with the bitcoin &#x201C;laser eye&#x201D; movement, appeared to reaffirm his belief in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. In one of these tweets, the veteran trader shared a chart which seemingly points to a possible bull run.&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The burden of proof is increasing upon the bears in Bitcoin <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> <br />The retesting of the underlying H&S has been well supported<br />and a possible falling wedge is being completed on daily line chart <a href="https://t.co/fLnh31PkLA">pic.twitter.com/fLnh31PkLA</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The burden of proof is increasing upon the bears in Bitcoin $<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The retesting of the underlying H&S has been well supported and a possible falling wedge is being completed on [the] daily line chart,&#x201D; Brandt explained.&#13;<br />

The registration of Caceis, a company that specializes in offering financial services to institutional investors, allows the two major European banks to tap into the crypto market. </strong></p>
<h2>Crédit Agricole Asset Management Unit Obtains AMF Registration in France</h2>
<p>An asset servicing business owned by France’s second largest bank, Crédit Agricole, and Spain’s biggest bank, Santander, has registered with the French financial markets authority, Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) as a digital asset service provider (DASP).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/professionals/fintech/my-relations-amf/obtain-dasp-authorisation#List_of_DASPs_registered_with_the_AMF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registration</a>, granted by the AMF earlier this week, will allow the entity, Caceis, to provide custody services for digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. At the end of 2022, the firm had 4.1 trillion euros ($4.51 trillion) in assets under its custody.</p>
<p>The move adds a major traditional financial services group to the growing number of crypto companies registered by the French watchdog, Reuters noted in a report. The DASP list already includes subsidiaries of other big players in the French financial market such as Societe Generale and AXA.</p>
<p>Caceis was established in 2005 through the merger of the asset management activities of Crédit Agricole and Caisse d’Epargne, a French cooperative banking group. With a 69.5% stake, Crédit Agricole is its majority owner while Santander has a 30.5% stake.</p>
<p>France has been open towards the crypto industry. Among the companies it registered as DASPs is , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Binance has been under pressure from regulators, particularly in the United States where it’s engaged in a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-cz-agree-to-repatriate-us-customer-assets-sec-secures-court-order/">legal battle</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>In May, French officials invited crypto companies seeking to escape the current crackdown in the U.S., which also affected leading U.S. digital asset exchange Coinbase, noting that France’s legal framework offers more regulatory certainty.</p>
<p>“If American players want to benefit, in the very short term from the French regime, and from the start of 2025 from European arrangements, clearly they are welcome,” AMF Secretary General Benoît de Juvigny was quoted as saying. He was referring to France’s regulatory regime for crypto service providers known as PSAN and the EU’s recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-council-adopts-new-rules-for-europes-crypto-markets/">adopted</a> Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules which should be implemented in the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Despite the generally positive attitude, however, a press report revealed that Binance’s entity in France was recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-investigation-targets-binance-allegations-of-money-laundering-and-regulatory-violations/">targeted</a> in an investigation for suspected money laundering and illegal provision of digital asset services. A spokesperson for the exchange said the company had an “on-site visit” by regulators, clarifying this is “part of regulatory obligations to which all financial institutions must adhere.”</p>
