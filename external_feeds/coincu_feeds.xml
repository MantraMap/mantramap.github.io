<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The OpenSea NFT Marketplace has announced the launch of the &#8220;Deals&#8221; peer-to-peer NFT trading function.</em></li>



<li><em>The new feature allows collectors to trade NFTs directly with each other as well as adding WETH to simplify the transaction process further.</em></li>



<li><em>To initiate the swap, users need to connect their wallet and search for the person they want to trade NFT using their username, address, or ESN.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to official news, NFT marketplace <a href="https://coincu.com/203742-etherfis-ether-fan-nft-collection-opensea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSea </a>has launched a &#8220;Deals&#8221; peer-to-peer NFT trading function, which can help traders interact directly with other collectors.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421.png"><img decoding="async" width="567" height="337" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421.png" alt="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot;" class="wp-image-204560" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421.png 567w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" title="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot; 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>OpenSea said in a tweet that Deals will allow collectors to trade NFTs with each other &#8211; as well as include coated ether (WETH). It added that OpenSea&#8217;s native NFT protocol Seaport powers the feature to ensure smooth transactions and save gas.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Deals: offer your NFTs for theirs, securely on OpenSea.<br><br><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f449.png" alt="👉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK" target="_blank">https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK</a> <a href="https://t.co/KR2MLbi7jh" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/KR2MLbi7jh</a></p>&mdash; OpenSea (@opensea) <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1682077991029932032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With the Deals function, collectors can now connect with each other easily. To initiate the swap, users need to connect their wallet and search for the person they want to trade NFT using their username, address, or ESN. Once defined, users can select an NFT from their collection that they wish to trade and select an NFT of their choice from the other.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deals website</a>, users can enter the username, ENS name, or wallet address of the person they want to make a transaction with. They can then choose up to 30 NFTs, as well as the amount of WETH they want to add to the swap, if any.</p>



<p>Next, they choose the asset they want to offer for trading, and then they can submit the transaction for review. Currently, OpenSea requires that NFTs on both sides of the deal be on the same chain and from badged (verified) collections.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="722" height="343" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422.png" alt="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot;" class="wp-image-204561" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422.png 722w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" title="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot; 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The swap proposal could also include WETH token incentives, adding more flexibility to the process. The other party can then review and accept the agreement directly through this NFT platform.</p>



<p>An OpenSea spokesperson said Deals aims to invite more users to join the NFT community by simplifying the transaction process. This move signifies the NFT platform&#8217;s commitment to providing a superior experience for NFT enthusiasts and staying ahead in the competitive market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Uniswap founder&#8217;s Twitter account has regained control after a few hours of being hacked.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, the account was hacked, and many tweets were posted containing links to phishing websites.</em></li>



<li><em>During the hack, no damage reports were recorded.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the official announcement, the Twitter account of Uniswap founder Hayden Adams has regained control, and at the same time, the related scam tweets have been deleted.</strong></h5>

</div></figure>



<p>Earlier this morning, it was reported that the Twitter account of Uniswap founder Hayden Adams with more than 254,000 followers, had been hacked and that many of the tweets sent by this account contained links to phishing websites.&#8217;</p>



<p>Then a suspicious tweet sent from Adams&#8217; account urged UniswapX users to check if they were eligible for the donated $UNI token by visiting a website hosted in Russia. That site was registered on the day of the hack, one Twitter user noted.</p>



<p>Members of Crypto Twitter were quick to identify and warn others of a promoted scam. Therefore, during the hacking process, no damage was recorded from the user.</p>



<p>Upon receiving the information, <a href="https://coincu.com/194785-uniswap-labs-revealing-new-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniswap Labs</a> issued a warning about the account being hijacked and warned users of fraudulent links related to the airdrop and rewards.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">&#8220;@haydenzadams&#8217; Twitter account has been hacked. Please do not click on any links. There is no giveaway, airdrop, or bounty. The Protocol has not been hacked or exploited. We will let you know when the issue is resolved&#8221;</p>
<cite><a href="https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1682130018225225728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warning </a>from Uniswap Labs.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In today&#8217;s digital environment, the security of digital assets is always a top priority to avoid unnecessary risks. Therefore, in order not to become a victim of cyberattacks, users should not click on strange links sent on the Internet by themselves. In addition, users can disconnect wallets to protocols after use to ensure the safest.</p>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://coincu.com/130981-house-republicans-requested-doj-of-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US House Republicans </a>members have introduced a new digital asset regulation bill.</em></li>



<li><em>The bill aims to establish a regulatory framework to protect investors in the crypto space and outlines the authority of the SEC and CFTC over crypto.</em></li>



<li><em>The amendment bill that excludes a range of traditional securities from the &#8220;digital asset&#8221; category could signal tightening for Defi.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Thursday, US House Republicans members<a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fit_for_the_21st_century_act_of_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> introduced </a>a new digital asset regulation bill, the 21st Century Financial Innovation and Technology Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework to protect investors in the crypto industry.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1419.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="506" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1419.png" alt="US House Republicans Launch A New Digital Asset Regulatory Bill" class="wp-image-204547" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1419.png 900w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1419-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1419-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1419-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="US House Republicans Launch A New Digital Asset Regulatory Bill 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Today&#8217;s introduction of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act marks a significant milestone in the House Committees on Agriculture and Financial Services&#8217; efforts to establish a much-needed regulatory framework that protects consumers and investors and fosters American leadership in the digital asset space,&#8221;</p>
<cite>Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture Rep. Glenn &#8220;GT&#8221; Thompson (R-Pa.) said in <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=7672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The current need for clarity on digital asset management and enforcement actions is causing crypto businesses to consider leaving the United States and preventing startups from establishing in the country.</p>



<p>Thursday&#8217;s bill, drafted initially in early June, seeks to pave the way for cryptocurrency exchanges to register with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and allow them to trade digital securities, commodities, and stablecoins.</p>



<p>The bill introduced in recent years aims to create comprehensive rules for digital assets, coming at a time when both regulators and participants in the crypto market have noticed a need for regulatory clarity.</p>



<p>A wave of aggressive enforcement actions by regulators, especially the SEC and CFTC, is prompting established crypto businesses to consider leaving the US and preventing startups from forming there. In addition, the bill will clarify the powers of the SEC and CFTC in regulating crypto companies.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The crypto industry wants clarity and our collaborative bill gives both the CFTC and SEC a seat at the table. Our bill establishes clear principles to ensure financial security and certainty as digital asset developers continue to innovate,&#8221;</p>
<cite>Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) said in the statement.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The revised bill removes a range of traditional securities from the definition of &#8220;digital assets,&#8221; such as stocks, bonds, &#8220;transferable shares,&#8221; &#8220;interest certificates, or entering into any profit-sharing arrangement,&#8221; among others.</p>



<p>This is seen as a signal to watch out for in the Defi sector by Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel of Delphi Labs, noting that a range of assets found in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, such as Compound&#8217;s cToken or Liquid Collective&#8217;s Liquidity Staking Token, will be strictly regulated under this provision even if they are not under applicable law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Defendants in the lawsuit filed in Delaware bankruptcy court include former CEO of hedge fund Alameda Research Caroline Ellison, former FTX chief technical officer Gary Wang, and former FTX chief technical officer Nishad Singh. These are all key names and were an effective arm of SBF before the second-largest cryptocurrency empire collapsed.</p>



<p>This exchange said the defendants continued to embezzle funds to purchase luxury apartments, political donations, and speculative investments and conduct &#8220;one of the largest financial frauds in history.&#8221;, </p>



<p>FTX said the fraudulent transfers occurred between February 2020 and November 2022, when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p>



<p>These transfers may be reversed or &#8220;avoided&#8221; under US bankruptcy or Delaware law. US prosecutors say SBF was the mastermind behind a scam that led to the downfall of FTX, which included the embezzlement of billions of dollars in customer funds.</p>

<p>According to Thursday&#8217;s complaint, the fraudulent transactions included more than $725 million in equity that FTX and West Realm Shires, an entity controlled by Bankman-Fried, awarded &#8220;without receiving any value in exchange.&#8221;</p>



<p>The suit also states that Bankman-Fried and Wang also embezzled $546 million to buy shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD.O), while Ellison used $28.8 million to pay his bonuses. In addition, some of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s criminal defenses are being funded by a $10 million &#8220;gift&#8221; he gave his father.</p>



<p>Previously, three close associates of Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, and Gary Wang, co-founder, and former CEO of FTX, along with FTX&#8217;s chief technical officer Nishad Singh pleaded guilty to fraud.</p>



<p>However, the SBF, who is believed to be primarily responsible for 12 criminal counts, has so far pleaded not guilty to several criminal charges brought by US prosecutors. He is still out on $250 million bail, the most oversized bail ever for an individual.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Coinbase Borrow Lending Product will be shutting down over the next few months, to focus resources on Coinbase's core products.<p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com/204526-coinbase-stops-coinbase-borrow-users-repay/" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p><p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com"><strong>Coincu News</strong></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase announced it will shut down its Coinbase Borrow product in the next few months.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform says users need to repay all their loans by November 20.</em></li>



<li><em>The service outage is explained simply by a drop in demand.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/20/coinbase-to-wind-down-coinbase-borrow-lending-program-over-coming-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> CoinDesk</a>, a Coinbase spokesperson said that Coinbase will gradually shut down its Coinbase Borrow lending operation over the next few months in order to focus resources on the products that customers are most interested in.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1411.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="575" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1411-1024x575.png" alt="Coinbase Stops Coinbase Borrow, Users Need To Repay Loans Before November 20" class="wp-image-204529" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1411-1024x575.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1411-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1411-768x431.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1411-1536x863.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1411-750x421.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1411-1140x640.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1411.png 1595w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase Stops Coinbase Borrow, Users Need To Repay Loans Before November 20 8"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>“We have notified prioritizing loan holders and are taking extra measures to ensure a smooth transition for them, including providing a four-month loan repayment period and access to customer support through Coinbase One,” According to a statement sent to CoinDesk. Coinbase One is a monthly subscription product with multiple benefits for traders.</p>



<p>Coinbase Borrow customers with outstanding balances have until November 20, 2023, to repay their loans. Coinbase Borrow is a product that allows customers to borrow loans equivalent to 30% of their Bitcoin holdings, with a cap of $1 million.</p>



<p>Coinbase introduced the Borrow program in August 2020 and launched it to the masses in November 2021. The program enables users in several US states to borrow up to $1 million using their Bitcoin as collateral with an APR of 8.7%. The product helps customers avoid selling Bitcoin when they need cash for an emergency.</p>



<p>As previously reported, Coinbase <a href="https://coincu.com/185147-coinbase-to-stop-new-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in May that it would no longer allow Coinbase Borrow customers to apply for new loans as part of its regular product re-evaluation process.</p>



<p>A Coinbase spokesperson said at the time that the closure of Coinbase Borrow was simply due to a drop in demand.</p>

<p>The decision to close the Borrow program comes amid an escalating legal dispute between Coinbase and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The legal battle between the two sides broke out in early June after the SEC filed a lawsuit accusing Coinbase of violating US securities regulations regarding the trading and staking activities of the following cryptocurrencies, which were all declared securities by the SEC: SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGEXODASH, and NEAR.</p>



<p>In November 2021, Coinbase had to shelve a lending product called Lend after a similar warning from the SEC. This product offers a crypto savings account with 4% APY higher returns than most traditional banks.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Radiant Capital RDNT token is up more than 10% in the last 24h.</em></li>



<li><em>The impetus came from the announcement that Binance would invest $10 million to develop the protocol.</em></li>



<li><em>Radiant is built on the architecture of LayerZero Labs, a company in the Binance Labs portfolio.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance just <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceLabs/status/1682015281424793601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invested</a> $10 million in Radiant Capital, a decentralized finance (DeFi) borrowing and lending protocol.

<p>The grant is part of Binance Labs&#8217; commitment to supporting innovative projects that have the potential to lead the next era of DeFi and put users at the heart of Binance Labs. This lending platform aims to solve DeFi&#8217;s fragmented liquidity problem by acting as a money market where users can deposit and borrow assets across various chains.</p>



<p>With the capital poured in, the project will accelerate product development, expand oracle support and collateral options, deploy on the Ethereum mainnet, and support seamless communication with LayerZero.</p>



<p>According to DeFi Llama data, Radiant currently has about $265 million in TVL. The platform supports more than 20 collateral options and plans to add new opportunities in the future as Radiant DAO expands functionality to additional chains.</p>



<p>Radiant Capital is a lending platform developed on Arbitrum to become the first omnichain money market. The project is built on LayerZero&#8217;s cross-chain interoperability and sending infrastructure, which raised $120 million in April at an estimated $3 billion.</p>

<p>Following the news of the Binance investment, the price of the RDNT token jumped more than 10%. Currently, RDNT is trading at $0.31. This can show the community&#8217;s great confidence in the investment choice of Binance.</p>

<p>Radiant is the lending platform with the highest TVL on Arbitrum at the moment. Soon, this project will have many conditions for development as the money continues to flow to Arbitrum to find opportunities to receive Airdrop from this Layer 2 solution.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>MakerDAO&#8217;s community votes unanimously to halt lending to a tokenized credit pool on Centrifuge protocol after $2.1 million in loan defaults.</em></li>



<li><em>The credit pool managed by fintech firm Harbor Trade minted $1.5 million in DAI stablecoins from the DAO, secured by loans to a consumer electronics firm that failed to pay back $2.1 million of debt.</em></li>



<li><em>The protocol aims to decrease the Debt Ceiling for the troubled credit pool from 7 million DAI to 0 DAI to prevent further borrowing and mitigate risks.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MakerDAO&#8217;s community, responsible for the DAI stablecoin, has taken <a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmR8cYb1#vote-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decisive action</a> to halt lending to a tokenized credit pool on the Centrifuge protocol after experiencing $2.1 million in loan defaults. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1404-1024x538.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1404-1024x538.png" alt="DAI Stability Secured: MakerDAO Halts Lending After $2.1 Million Loan Defaults" class="wp-image-204511" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1404-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1404-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1404-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1404-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1404-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1404.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="DAI Stability Secured: MakerDAO Halts Lending After $2.1 Million Loan Defaults 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>The decision, reached through a governance vote, reflects the decentralized nature of MakerDAO, where those who hold MKR tokens can actively participate in crucial governance decisions.</p>



<p>The embattled credit pool in question was managed by fintech firm Harbor Trade, which had minted approximately $1.5 million worth of DAI stablecoins from <a href="https://coincu.com/203262-makerdao-dominates-with-122-million-in-mkr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MakerDAO</a>. These stablecoins were secured by loans provided to a consumer electronics firm. Unfortunately, the borrower firm failed to pay down $2.1 million of the debt that matured in April, leading to significant concerns within the MakerDAO community.</p>



<p>In the aftermath of the loan defaults, the community unanimously voted in favor of ceasing any additional lending to the credit pool managed by Harbor Trade. Although the fintech firm committed verbally to halt additional draws and voluntarily wind down the vault, community members remained worried about the existing 7 million DAI Debt Ceiling and the potential risks associated with further exposure to this particular vault.</p>

<p>To prevent additional borrowing from the problematic vault, the DAO decided to poll community sentiment for a decrease in the Debt Ceiling. The goal was to reduce the Debt Ceiling from the current 7 million DAI to 0 DAI. The poll saw 100% support for the proposed change, indicating the urgency of addressing the situation.</p>



<p>With the votes concluded and the overwhelming support received, the next steps are outlined as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>The parameter change for decreasing the Debt Ceiling will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.</li>



<li>The Executive Vote is expected to take place within 30 days after the successful poll, barring any external factors.</li>



<li>Assuming the Executive Vote passes, the change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the GSM Pause Delay period has expired.</li>
</ul>



<p>The GSM Pause Delay is a safeguard mechanism in MakerDAO&#8217;s governance process to ensure enough time for stakeholders to review and challenge changes before they become effective.</p>



<p>This incident highlights the importance of transparent governance and decentralized decision-making in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). MakerDAO&#8217;s community took swift and collective action to address the loan defaults and protect the stability of the DAI stablecoin, demonstrating the resilience of the DeFi ecosystem.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that MakerDAO has been actively expanding the assets underpinning the DAI stablecoin. In a separate move, the platform recently <a href="https://coincu.com/197005-makerdao-purchasing-700m-bonds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased</a> $700 million in US Treasury bonds as part of its <a href="https://coincu.com/121338-makerdao-co-founder-outlined-plan-save-dai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Endgame Plan.&#8221; </a>This approach, led by MakerDAO&#8217;s creator Rune Christensen, aims to diversify the underlying assets supporting the $4.5 billion dollar-pegged stablecoin, with a greater focus on conventional financial assets like government bonds to bolster long-term stability and investor confidence.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Blockchain investors Roszak and Vessenes near a $125 million deal for CoinDesk, a crypto-focused media firm.</em></li>



<li><em>The acquisition could strengthen DCG amid challenges with its Genesis unit&#8217;s bankruptcy.</em></li>



<li><em>DCG plans to retain a stake in CoinDesk&#8217;s business, and the deal is expected to be finalized soon.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blockchain investors Matthew Roszak and Peter Vessenes are spearheading a group that is close to finalizing a significant deal worth $125 million to acquire cryptocurrency-focused media firm CoinDesk, as reported by the <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investor-group-nears-125-million-deal-for-coindesk-146a6faa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a></em>.</strong></h5>

<p>CoinDesk is currently under the ownership of Digital Currency Group (DCG), a crypto conglomerate that purchased it in 2016. The impending sale could potentially strengthen DCG&#8217;s financial position amid efforts to resolve its Genesis unit&#8217;s bankruptcy.</p>



<p>The investor group, led by Matthew Roszak of Tally Capital and Peter Vessenes of Capital6, includes prominent players in the crypto and blockchain-based technologies sector. The transaction&#8217;s enterprise value is approximately $125 million. While the deal progresses, DCG is expected to retain a stake in CoinDesk&#8217;s media, events, data, and indexes business. CoinDesk&#8217;s current management is likely to remain unchanged after the acquisition.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, CoinDesk sought the expertise of investment bankers at Lazard to explore various options, including a partial or complete sale. The media company had reportedly received unsolicited offers exceeding $200 million. DCG initially acquired CoinDesk for $500,000 in 2016. CoinDesk&#8217;s revenue for the previous year amounted to $50 million, derived from online advertising, index services, and events.</p>

<p>However, DCG faces challenges, grappling with the bankruptcy of its lending arm, <a href="https://coincu.com/200865-genesis-global-2b-dispute-ftx-delay-creditor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genesis Global Capital</a>, and the shutdowns of its institutional-trading platform TradeBlock and wealth-management unit HQ. The crypto conglomerate has encountered difficulties due to industry-wide bankruptcies and declining token prices. Additionally, DCG is embroiled in a legal dispute with Gemini Trust Company, the largest creditor of Genesis, over a substantial loss the lending unit incurred in 2022.</p>



<p>Despite the hurdles, the crypto market has rebounded this year, witnessing a surge in Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies&#8217; prices. Investors&#8217; growing risk appetite has played a part in this revival, with Bitcoin experiencing an 80% increase and hovering around $30,000. However, it remains below its all-time high of nearly $69,000 achieved in November 2021.</p>



<p>Regulators have also demonstrated their commitment to stricter oversight of the crypto industry. In recent months, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against major crypto exchanges <a href="https://coincu.com/203514-binance-terminates-sponsorship-with-argentina/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/203016-coinbase-suspends-staking-services-sec-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>. Furthermore, the SEC has <a href="https://coincu.com/158824-dcg-under-investigations-internal-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> DCG&#8217;s Genesis and <a href="https://coincu.com/200998-dcg-has-responses-to-the-lawsuit-from-gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemini</a> for an alleged $900 million crypto-lending program violation, raising concerns about investor protection.</p>

<p>DCG, formerly valued at $10 billion during the post-pandemic crypto-market boom, is now facing financial pressures due to various factors. As the deal with CoinDesk nears its completion, DCG is expected to retain a stake in the media firm. The finalization of this acquisition is anticipated in the coming weeks, marking a significant development in the cryptocurrency-focused media landscape.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Aave and Harmony propose a joint recovery plan after a recent hack on Harmony&#8217;s blockchain.</em></li>



<li><em>The plan includes a Recovery Fund with both platforms contributing 10% to reimburse affected users.</em></li>



<li><em>A Decaying Oracle Mechanism will be introduced to encourage early liquidation of depegged assets and handle any remaining bad debt.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In response to the recent hack on the Harmony blockchain that resulted in substantial losses for Aave users, the Aave community has put forth a <a href="https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-and-harmony-joint-recovery-plan-following-the-harmony-blockchain-hack/14060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joint recovery plan</a> in collaboration with Harmony.

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1400.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1400-1024x576.png" alt="Aave Launches A Recovery Plan After The Harmony&#039;s Hack" class="wp-image-204494" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1400-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1400-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1400-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1400-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1400-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1400-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1400-1140x641.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aave Launches A Recovery Plan After The Harmony&#039;s Hack 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>The core element of the recovery plan is the establishment of a Recovery Fund. <a href="https://coincu.com/203057-aave-wants-to-launch-v3-on-linea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aave</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/162984-destination-of-harmony-bridge-hack-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harmony</a> will each contribute 10% of the total reimbursement funds required. This fund will enable affected users to immediately recover 20% of their pre-hack balances, providing immediate relief and laying the foundation for further recovery efforts.</p>



<p>Aave&#8217;s contribution to the fund will include writing off depreciated assets held in the Harmony DAO vault, consisting of approximately 2 million aONE and 700 aLINK tokens. The remaining contributions from both platforms will likely come from their respective reserves or other funding sources.</p>



<p>To encourage the early liquidation of depegged assets, the proposal introduces a Decaying Oracle Mechanism, suggested by service provider BGD. This mechanism will gradually reduce the value of depegged assets over time, incentivizing users to liquidate these assets sooner. This will help remove these assets from the system faster, freeing up capital and expediting the return to normalcy.</p>



<p>While the plan aims to address as much bad debt as possible, it acknowledges that some debt may remain unliquidated. In such cases, any remaining bad debt will be divided equally between Harmony and Aave.</p>

<p>The recovery process is expected to take around four years, with the timeline subject to adjustments based on market conditions and progress.</p>



<p>The joint recovery plan is a multi-faceted approach to resolving the complexities of the hacking incident, offering immediate relief through the Recovery Fund, an accelerated recovery through the Decaying Oracle Mechanism, and a plan for handling any remaining bad debt. This comprehensive strategy aims to restore user confidence in both Aave and Harmony, ensuring the platforms&#8217; sustainability and security in the future.</p>



<p>The next steps involve gauging community sentiment and preferences through the Aave Snapshot, followed by preparing the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) based on the community&#8217;s feedback and consensus gathered from the snapshot. </p>



<p>Aave previously <a href="https://coincu.com/203080-aave-unleashes-gho/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the successful launch of GHO on the Ethereum mainnet.</p>

<p>In its latest annual report, the FCA <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/financial-watchdog-cracks-down-problem-firms-and-supports-struggling-borrowers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> plans to design prudential requirements for firms involved in crypto activities, signaling a commitment to bring crypto-related businesses under its regulatory oversight.</p>



<p>As part of its role in overseeing the crypto sector, the <a href="https://coincu.com/200049-fca-announces-strict-measures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FCA</a> is responsible for maintaining a registry of approved crypto firms that comply with the country&#8217;s anti-money laundering requirements. The forthcoming prudential rules will further solidify the regulatory framework, requiring these firms to assess their capital adequacy and manage risks effectively to safeguard investor interests and mitigate potential harm.</p>



<p>The FCA&#8217;s prudential regime, which is already in place for investment firms such as fund managers, asset managers, and trading companies, serves as a blueprint for designing the new requirements tailored to the specific needs and risks posed by the crypto sector. By introducing prudential rules, the FCA seeks to instill a sense of responsibility and accountability among crypto firms and strengthen the overall resilience of the industry.</p>



<p>While the prudential requirements are still in development, the FCA has also been <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/launch-permanent-digital-sandbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proactively engaging</a> with emerging technologies and fintech innovations through its Digital Sandbox. The Digital Sandbox serves as an experimental environment, allowing companies to test their products and services at an early stage of development. This initiative not only fosters innovation but also provides valuable insights to regulators to assess the impact and potential risks associated with new financial technologies.</p>



<p>Having successfully completed two pilot stages, the FCA has decided to make the Digital Sandbox a permanent fixture starting from August 1, 2023. The sandbox will be open to a wide range of innovative businesses, startups, and data providers, enabling them to access over 200 datasets and more than 1000 APIs for testing and validating their ideas. The datasets cover various aspects, including payments, transactions, social media, and credit data, allowing participants to thoroughly evaluate their products&#8217; functionalities and security.</p>

<p>The Digital Sandbox has already demonstrated its positive impact, with more than half of the previous participants making notable developments, such as launching new products, securing funding and partnerships, and receiving industry awards or recognitions. This success showcases the sandbox&#8217;s potential as a catalyst for growth and innovation in the financial sector.</p>



<p>As the FCA embraces its role as the primary crypto watchdog in the U.K., it is well-positioned to support the country&#8217;s ambition to become a global hub for the cryptocurrency industry. According to CEO Nikhil Rathi, the FCA <a href="https://coincu.com/204151-fca-ceo-slams-largest-crypto-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains</a> steadfast in its approach to issuing regulatory licenses for crypto enterprises of all sizes.</p>



<p>The FCA&#8217;s commitment to striking a balance between regulatory oversight and encouraging innovation sets a promising path for the crypto sector&#8217;s growth in the region. By creating a robust regulatory framework and offering a supportive testing environment through the Digital Sandbox, the FCA is contributing to the development of a thriving and responsible crypto ecosystem in the U.K.</p>
