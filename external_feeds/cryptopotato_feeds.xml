            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Singaporean authorities have reportedly granted Vauld an extended period of creditor protection.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency lender has until February 28 to introduce a revival plan. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Vauld is one of the worst affected cryptocurrency entities by the prolonged bear market. It </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-backed-indian-crypto-exchange-vauld-lays-off-30-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">trimmed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the size of its team by 30% last summer, reduced its marketing campaigns, and later halted customer withdrawals. </span></li>
<li>After failing to ink an acquisition deal with Nexo, the firm <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/troubled-crypto-firm-vauld-filed-for-protection-against-creditors-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for protection against creditors in Singapore. The process, much similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the USA, aimed to provide it the necessary “breathing space” to reconstruct the crippled operations.</span></li>
<li>Initially, the Singapore High Court <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/battered-crypto-lender-vauld-granted-3-month-creditor-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ordered</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the protection to last until November 7, 2022. The authorities later extended that period to January 20, 2023.</span></li>
<li>According to a Bloomberg <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ailing-singapore-crypto-firm-vauld-gets-more-time-to-restructure-1.1871010" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">coverage</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Vauld obtained another month and has until February 28, 2023, to design a restructuring plan.</span></li>
<li>A person familiar with the matter also said the company had received offers from two fund managers who could assume control of the assets stuck on the platform.</li>
<li>Vauld stated the discussions with those finance players are at an advanced stage.</li>
<li>Subsequently, the organization assured it has no plans to renew any agreement talks with Nexo. The latter has been in the spotlight recently after the Bulgarian authorities <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/nexo-bulgarian-offices-reportedly-raided-by-authorities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">raided</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> its offices as part of a probe into suspected money laundering and tax crimes.</span></li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The number of Bitcoin and Ethereum developers has tripled since 2018, but alternative projects are more attractive.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto industry has seen a significant surge in the number of developers working on various projects, according to a new report by Electric Capital. The firm, which has invested in several early-stage Layer-1 platforms and crypto startups —like Bitwise, Gitcoin, dYdX Near Protocol, and Inmunefi— found that the number of developers in the crypto industry has doubled over the past two years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electriccapital.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Electric Capital</a> obtained its data by identifying 250 million code commits across open-source repositories, which shows exponential growth in the number of developers joining the crypto ecosystem as time goes by. Despite the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/116-billion-less-crypto-investors-and-execs-experience-harsh-winter-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">harsh crypto winter of 2022</a>, the numbers didn&#8217;t stop growing.</p>
<h2>The Number Of Crypto Developers Has Doubled Since 2020</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://github.com/electric-capital/developer-reports/blob/master/dev_report_2022.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Electric Capital</a>, the number of monthly active crypto developers closed at 23,343 in December 2022. This figure represented a nearly 100% increase from the beginning of 2020, when there were less than 10,000 active developers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_233715" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-233715" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Electric_Capital__There_are_now_23343_monthly_active_developers_in_crypto.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-large wp-image-233715" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Electric_Capital__There_are_now_23343_monthly_active_developers_in_crypto-1024x576.jpg" alt="There are now 23,343 monthly active developers in crypto" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Electric_Capital__There_are_now_23343_monthly_active_developers_in_crypto-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Electric_Capital__There_are_now_23343_monthly_active_developers_in_crypto-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Electric_Capital__There_are_now_23343_monthly_active_developers_in_crypto-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Electric_Capital__There_are_now_23343_monthly_active_developers_in_crypto-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Electric_Capital__There_are_now_23343_monthly_active_developers_in_crypto-50x28.jpg 50w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Electric_Capital__There_are_now_23343_monthly_active_developers_in_crypto.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-233715" class="wp-caption-text">There are now 23,343 monthly active developers in crypto. Source: Electric Capital</figcaption></figure>
<p>This significant growth in the number of developers working in the crypto industry is a positive sign for the future of the industry. Despite the significant drop in the bitcoin price, which plummeted more than 76% from its all-time high of $69,000, the number of monthly active developers grew by 5%.</p>
<p>The report also shows exponential growth in monthly developer builds, with over 471,000 monthly code commits for open-source cryptocurrencies. These figures represented an 8% increase in full-time developers. According to the report, this is the most crucial piece of data to highlight because they &#8220;contribute to 76% of all code commits.&#8221; For the first time in the history of cryptocurrencies, more than 61,000 programmers were working on crypto code development at the same time.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Devs Tripled Since 2018, But Alternatives Are More Attractive</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin network saw a 3x growth in monthly active developers since 2018, rising from 372 devs to 946, while Ethereum saw an exponential growth of 5x, increasing from 1,084 to 5,819 monthly active devs.</p>
<p>Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Polygon went from having less than 200 developers to more than 1,000 since 2018. This growth in the number of coders working on these projects is a positive sign for their long-term perspectives.</p>
<p>Despite the significant growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the data revealed that the vast majority (72%) of developers prefer to work on networks outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana, NEAR, and Polygon grew at 40% year over year, reaching more than 500 monthly active developers. This suggests that there is a growing interest in alternative blockchain projects and that developers are looking to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/near-foundation-introduces-a-100-million-fund-dedicated-to-web-3-developers-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">contribute to the development</a> of newer, more innovative projects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even though the NFT boom <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nearly-60-of-nft-trading-volumes-in-2022-was-wash-trading-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">seems to be fading away</a>, those projects also registered a significant increase in their technical activity, reaching more than 900 monthly active developers writing code.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mamoru Yanase &#8211; Deputy Director-General of Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency (FSA) &#8211; urged global watchdogs to impose tougher regulations on the cryptocurrency industry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He believes digital asset exchanges should be treated the same way as banks.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It&#8217;s All Because of FTX</span></h2>
<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/japan-pushes-global-counterparts-to-regulate-crypto-like-banks-1.1870854" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to Yanase, one way to prevent another collapse of a cryptocurrency platform is if regulators treat such entities as traditional financial institutions. The Japanese referred to the demise of FTX, saying its bankruptcy and alleged fraud committed by Sam Bankman-Fried have wrecked the entire blockchain sector. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the other hand, he praised the actions of Japan&#8217;s monetary watchdogs that could </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-japan-reveals-when-it-will-resume-withdrawals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">allow</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> local FTX users to withdraw funds by mid-February.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Yanase further argued that global regulators should protect consumers by enforcing more stringent anti-money laundering rules, applying enhanced governance on the crypto industry, and running internal auditing and control.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;What&#8217;s brought about the latest scandal isn&#8217;t crypto technology itself. It is loose governance, lax internal controls, and the absence of regulation and supervision,&#8221; he said.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The FSA&#8217;s director also opined that regulatory authorities should establish a multi-national resolution mechanism that could be applied in a potential collapse of another giant crypto exchange. He thinks those nations and islands which are considered blockchain hubs should be the first to introduce that program.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Exchanges Entering and Leaving Japan</span></h2>

<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida&#8217;s agenda for reinvigorating the economy under the rubric of &#8220;New Capitalism&#8221; includes supporting the growth of so-called Web3 firms.

			            <description><![CDATA[The cataclysmic finish of 2022 has prompted a $1 billion net loss for Silvergate Capital for Q4.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency-focused bank &#8211; Silvergate Capital &#8211; reported a net loss of $1 billion for the last quarter of 2022 due to the turmoil reigning in the digital asset sector.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The firm recently laid off nearly half its workforce amid massive client withdrawal requests.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Disappointing Q4</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fourth quarter of 2022, with its market decline and company bankruptcies, put a dark stamp on crypto&#8217;s legacy. The California-based Silvergate Capital said those dynamics triggered a &#8220;crisis of confidence across the ecosystem&#8221; and caused financial damage to multiple entities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The crypto bank </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1312109/000131210923000020/ex991si4q22earningsrelease.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a $1 billion net loss attributable to common shareholders in Q4, or a $33.16 loss per common share. It further revealed a net income of $40.6 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, for the third quarter and a net income of $18.4 million ($0.66 per diluted share) for Q4 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The entity saw a decrease in digital asset customers: from 1,677 on September 30, 2022, to 1,620 at the end of December. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Silvergate Exchange Network facilitated $117.1 billion of US dollar transfers during the last quarter of 2022, which is a 4% increase compared to the $112.6 billion in Q3. Still, the figures were quite more impressive in Q4 2021, when it handled $219.2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Digital asset customer-related fee income equaled $6.6 million, a 16% decrease compared to the previous quarter. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Average crypto deposits accounted for $7.3 billion during Q4, significantly less than the $12 billion registered in the third quarter of last year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the reported loss, Silvergate&#8217;s shares surged by nearly 12%. Currently, SI trade at approximately $14.70, while they hovered around</span> $13.20 yesterday.</p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Previous Issues</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Silvergate </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/silvergate-capital-reveals-its-exposure-to-bankrupt-crypto-lender-blockfi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">stated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in November last year that its financial relationship with BlockFi was limited to less than $20 million of its total customer deposits. It also asserted it has no investments in the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prior to that, CEO Alan Lane </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://ir.silvergate.com/news/news-details/2022/Silvergate-Provides-Statement-on-FTX-Exposure/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">outlined</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that the collapsed crypto giant FTX was not a custodian for Silvergate&#8217;s bitcoin-collateralized SEN leverage loans.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OSL, a Hong Kong-based digital asset exchange, is cutting roughly a third of its costs following months of turbulence in the crypto market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That includes staff cuts – though the firm did not reveal how large a portion of its workforce was laid off. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Over half a million validators are staking their ETH ahead of a crucial upgrade to enable withdrawals. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ethereum now has over 500,000 validators keeping the network secure ahead of its highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade, scheduled for March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The upgrade will allow such validators to withdraw their ETH from Ethereum’s staking contract – some of which has been locked up for years.</span></p>
<h2>Ethereum’s Surge in Validators</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to data from </span><a href="https://beaconscan.com/stat/validator" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BeaconScan</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ethereum’s validator count topped 500,000 as of January 12 2023. It registered at 501,893 as of Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A “validator” is a user within a proof of stake network that helps validate transactions and incoming blocks, while occasionally proposing new blocks. To become a validator, users must stake at least 32 ETH as an initial investment – worth roughly $50,000 at writing time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ethereum’s validator count has consistently grown since the rollout of Ethereum’s beacon chain in December 2020. However, those validators have been prevented from withdrawing their stake until now, for security purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite many delays, the beacon chain was finally merged with Ethereum’s execution layer in September 2022, changing the network’s consensus mechanism from proof of work to proof of stake. Ethereum developers have since promised to prioritize enabling withdrawals, with the function </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/liquid-staking-platforms-surging-ahead-of-ethereum-shanghai-upgrade/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">expected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to reach its public testnet in February and to roll out on the mainnet in March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under its former proof of work mechanism, Ethereum was secured through computational energy consumed by “miners” who completed complex math equations in order to construct Ethereum’s blocks. Miners that successfully mined blocks were rewarded with new ETH.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under proof of stake, miners are rendered obsolete in favor of validators, which get to create and attest to the validity of blocks in return for an ETH reward. The more ETH that a validator chooses to lock up, the more likely they are to be selected by the network to create a block – thus earning more rewards. </span></p>
<h2>Liquid Staking</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Theoretically, staking one’s ETH allows one to effectively earn a yield on their holdings at no cost – except for the opportunity cost of where that ETH could otherwise be deployed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-ethereum-liquid-staking/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">liquid staking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> options provided by staking services like Lido and RocketPool allow stakers to receive stETH or rETH in return for their staked assets. Backed by the assets that have been locked away, each of these tokens can be freely traded as ETH equivalents, giving holders the benefits of staking without sacrificing liquidity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last week, ConsenSys </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/metamasks-ethereum-staking-beta-launches-with-lido-and-rocket-pool/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that MetaMask had partnered with Lido and Rocketpool to let users stake with each service and receive stETH and rETH directly within the wallet app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken also offer staking services and provide their own ETH equivalent tokens in return to customers (ex. BETH on Binance). Such services let smaller ETH holders bypass the 32 ETH barrier required for independent staking, in return for a small fee collected by the provider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some fear that centralized stakers may gain too much control over Ethereum’s consensus over time, and could potentially conspire to compromise the integrity of the network. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has claimed that if his exchange were asked by regulators to do anything nefarious, his company would likely close down its staking service. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The leadership of CoinFLEX and 3AC wanting to give the crypto market another shot was understandably met with raised eyebrows and not much else.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to CoinFLEX leadership, “there has been media speculation” on the subject of the new exchange they are building, tentatively named GTX.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/su-zhu-and-kyle-davies-raising-25m-for-a-crypto-exchange-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> by <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the tentative exchange would specialize in crypto bankruptcy cases.</p>
<h2>Management Team Staying Onboard</h2>
<p>After lambasting the “speculation” on the subject of the leaked GTX pitch decks – speculation that allegedly took place because CoinFLEX leadership did not want to share an update “due to ongoing discussions” – the firm spokesman <a href="https://coinflex.com/blog/coinflex-update-january-16-2023/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">assured</a> users that both Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam would remain in their leadership roles.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Please note that given the nature of ongoing discussions with various parties, we have not been able to share an update about the proposed plans but aim to do so once a possible round or partnership materializes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, CoinFLEX may see “an addition in key members” in leadership roles. It’s unclear if the key members in question are Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, the 3AC founders with whom Lamb and Arumugam appear to be working in order to create what is temporarily known as GTX.</p>
<p>After all, few people have more experience with crypto bankruptcy than the founders of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/3ac-co-founders-su-zhu-kyle-davies-subpoenaed-in-bankruptcy-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">3AC</a> and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinflex-to-restart-withdrawals-but-theres-a-catch/" data-wpel-link="internal">CoinFLEX</a>. Each leadership team already has a major bankruptcy to their name.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the spokesperson hinted that CoinFLEX may be completely rebranded into this new entity – a smart move, considering the number of potential investors who have already heard of the company&#8217;s woes and may not be too keen on casting their lot with them again.</p>
<h2>CoinFLEX Creditors Will Allegedly Benefit From The Move</h2>
<p>The press release continued in an upbeat tone, informing the unfortunate investors left holding CoinFLEX’s bags that the new platform will raise creditors’ equity, with the ultimate goal of making them whole. Series B investors and CoinFLEX creditors will allegedly be the largest class of shareholders in whatever GTX will become. Besides cryptocurrencies, GTX may also deal in assets and bonds if regulators will allow it.</p>
<p>However, the wording is pretty vague. According to the press release, funds raised will be put towards “operational growth,” which Lamb and Arumugam “strongly believe” will increase value for creditors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, operational growth can mean anything. Spending obscene amounts on naming rights for sports stadiums, for instance, is a favorite trick of yet another “crypto bankruptcy expert.”</p>
<p>Somewhat expectedly, the community <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/founders-of-collapsed-crypto-hedge-fund-3ac-mocked-after-pitching-new-venture-1.1871106" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">response</a> was not in favor of the new initiative, given their history.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Alameda's liquidators could have prevented $4 million of the losses, according to Arkham Intelligence. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Liquidators of Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bankrupt trading powerhouse Alameda Research reportedly incurred a significant loss of over $11 million since the start of the year due to multiple liquidations.</p>
<p class="p2">According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-alameda-ftx-crisis-started-years-before-bankruptcy-wsj-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">Alameda</a> lost $11.5 million in liquidations, with a single loss of $4.85 million and a preventable loss of over $4 million.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Over the past two weeks being under Liquidator control, the account incurred significant losses:</p>
<p>Largest single liquidation: $4.85M<br />
Total liquidated amount: $11.5M<br />
Preventable losses: $4M+</p>
<p>— Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1615058585410732032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">January 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<h2 class="p3"><b>String of Liquidations </b></h2>
<p class="p2">In a series of tweets on Monday, Arkham said Alameda incurred a massive loss on decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/aave-v3-goes-live-on-mainnet-including-redesigned-app/" data-wpel-link="internal">AAVE</a> after the company moved $7 million in USDC stablecoins and $4 million in DAI from the platform on December 29, 2022, to an Optimism L2 account.</p>
<p class="p2">The blockchain platform explained that the movement of assets began 30 hours after the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/addresses-linked-to-alameda-research-swapping-erc20-tokens-for-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">liquidators</a> started transferring funds out of Alameda&#8217;s wallet following an attack on its mainnet.</p>
<p class="p2">According to the tweets, the removal of assets from the active position of AAVE to Optimism placed the company&#8217;s position at a &#8220;dangerously close risk of liquidation.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>A Preventable Loss</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The move eventually resulted in $11.4 million in USDC being sold off to liquidation bots on Optimism. At the same time, the AAVE treasury received $100,000 as liquidation tax, with the company losing more than $1 million on January 14, 2023.</p>
<p class="p4">Arkham further highlighted that the loss could have been prevented if the liquidators had used the call function on AAVE, which allows users to close their positions upon activation. The tool would have saved the company $15 million if applied instead of $11 million. This means about $4 million of the losses could have been prevented.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Betting Against Ether</b></h2>
<p class="p2">With Alameda losing over a million due to the movement of assets between protocols, Arkham said the January 14 liquidation was the latest in a string of liquidations spanning almost two weeks of the account being handled by the liquidators. The latest resulted in $1.2 million worth of USDC liquidated for 731 ETH.</p>
<p class="p2">Arkham also disclosed that one of Alameda&#8217;s wallets ending in 0x997 maintained a 9,000 <span class="s1">Ethereum (ETH)</span> position and was worth around $10.8 million against the collateral of $20 million in USDC and $4 million in DAI with a net balance of $15.2 million before the liquidators gained access to the account earlier this month.</p>
<p class="p2">However, the same wallet now holds crypto assets with an estimated &#8220;$1.1 million short ETH against $1.4 million in USDC: net balance of 300k.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">When taken over by Liquidators as of 2 weeks ago, 0x997 maintained a short position of 9000 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">$ETH</a> ($10.8M) against collateral of $20M USDC and $4M DAI: net balance of $15.2M.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Please Read Disclaimer]</strong></p>
<p>(Victoria, Seychelles, 17 Jan 2023) &#8211; Leading crypto derivatives exchange Bitget announces to be the first exchange to <a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/support/articles/12560603776298" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">launch copy trading in the spot market</a>.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has printed a substantial increase and finally surpassed the channel&#8217;s upper boundary. In spite of this, the cryptocurrency is approaching a critical resistance zone, and if a breakout occurs, an impulsive uptrend would become more likely.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has experienced an uptrend since breaking above the 50 and 100-day moving average lines and has currently reached the $1.6K critical resistance zone.</p>
<p>This price region consists of two crucial resistance levels; the $1.6K static resistance level, which has been serving as a robust barrier to the price for the last couple of months, and the price&#8217;s prior major high at $1680, which typically serves as resistance in an uptrend.</p>
<p>Overall, pushing the price above this vital resistance level could be quite a challenge, and if successful, the market could potentially explode.</p>
<p>However, considering the price entering the overbought zone of the RSI indicator, a short-term consolidation could be possible before the next impulsive move.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>In the 4-hour timeframe, the price has been forming higher highs and higher lows which is a typical bullish sign. However, the cryptocurrency has simultaneously entered a short-term consolidation and reached the $1.6K resistance level.</p>
<p>Ethereum seems to have gained sufficient momentum to surpass the $1.6K resistance zone. Still, the existing bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator might halt the current uptrend for the short term and result in a correction phase with low volatility.</p>

<h2>On-Chain Analysis</h2>
<p>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<h3>Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio (SMA 100)</h3>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has been significantly affected by the futures market over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>This chart represents the Taker Buy Sell Ratio with a 100-day standard moving average applied. This ratio demonstrates whether the bulls or the bears are executing their trades more aggressively, with values above 1 indicating bullish and below 1 showing bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>This metric has been rising for the last few weeks, indicating a positive shift in the futures market sentiment, followed by a price surge recently.</p>
<p>While the metric is currently above 1 and is trending higher, a reversal in its trend likely points to the possibility of a bearish reversal and should be monitored closely in the short term.</p>
