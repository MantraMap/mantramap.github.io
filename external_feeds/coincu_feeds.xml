<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Lido community is participating in voting on a new proposal to implement version 2 on Ethereum.</em></li>



<li><em>V2 is the &#8220;most significant upgrade to date&#8221; since its launch in December 2020, with 2 focuses on enabling ETH staking withdrawals and introducing the Staking Router.</em></li>



<li><em>Voting closes on May 15 with the expectation of passing.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the official announcement, the Aragon Vote to implement the<a href="https://news.coincu.com/186801-lido-v2-almost-completed-audit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Lido V2 upgrade</a> on Ethereum is currently taking place.</strong></h5>

<p>The DAO Aragon vote for the V2 upgrade of the Lido protocol is scheduled to be released on May 12 at 14:00 UTC. If you have the technical ability, please check for yourself whether the proposed initial parameters are suitable for you and in accordance with the mentioned contracts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>As mentioned earlier, Lido calls v2 &#8220;the most important upgrade to date&#8221; since its launch in December 2020, as Ethereum is Lido&#8217;s first and largest marketplace for liquidity staking tokens.</p>



<p>With two main focuses, ETH staking withdrawals and the introduction of a &#8220;Staking Router&#8221; that is supposed to boost participation from a more diverse pool of node operators, v2 on Ethereum comes when Lido leads the way as the most liquid staking platform in the DeFi space, with a total value of $11.77 billion locked on the Ethereum ecosystem, according to DefiLlama.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-549.png"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="506" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-549.png" alt="Lido Vote For Proposal To Deploy V2 On Ethereum Network" class="wp-image-187068" title="Lido Vote For Proposal To Deploy V2 On Ethereum Network 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to the protocol&#8217;s share, the withdrawal implementation along with the Staking Router proposal will contribute to the strengthening of network decentralization. The Lido protocol is healthier and allows staking and staking (withdrawal) to solidify stETH as the most useful and composable asset on Ethereum.</p>



<p>Staking routers will open the door for external developers to contribute to the protocol. Developers can recommend + no-composed implementation with their preferred characteristics and parameters (fee, security, or collateral options).</p>



<p>Voting ends on May 15. If the governance vote passes, the latest version of this protocol will come to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<p>Unisat, an open source Chrome wallet extension for Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20. In the last few weeks, BRC-20 and Ordinals have become a popular topic in recent weeks and are the reason behind the split in the Bitcoin community.</p>



<p>BRC-20 refers to an experimental token standard introduced in March 2023 by an anonymous cryptocurrency developer named “Domo”. Like the ERC-20 standards on Ethereum, the BRC-20 allows users to issue fungible tokens using Bitcoin&#8217;s Ordinals protocol.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-548.png"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="403" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-548.png" alt="OKX And Huobi Both Integrate Unisat For Easy Access To BRC-20 Trends" class="wp-image-187059" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-548.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-548-300x151.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-548-768x387.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-548-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-548-750x378.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="OKX And Huobi Both Integrate Unisat For Easy Access To BRC-20 Trends 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Since the standard was implemented, demand for Bitcoin Ordinals has reached sky-high levels, causing congestion on the world&#8217;s largest blockchain and pushing its network fees to a 2-year high earlier this month. Additionally, on May 9, Binance said it will add support for Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions on the non-fungible token market (NFT) by the end of May.</p>



<p>A large portion of the Bitcoin community welcomed the introduction of the BRC-20 standard, as many wanted to join Ethereum supporters in issuing NFTs on their favorite blockchain. On the other hand, some have loudly criticized the idea.</p>



<p>Bitcoin purists believe that the usual inscriptions enabled by the BRC-20 standard represent a departure from the original purpose of Bitcoin, which was primarily used as a medium of exchange and decentralized store of value. Furthermore, they argue that Ordinals added elements of centralization and jeopardized the idea of Bitcoin as a decentralized, value-neutral currency.</p>



<p>Due to their displeasure, some Bitcoin developers have proposed delisting the Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which are primarily responsible for the recent network congestion and mounting fees. Earlier this week, around 400,000 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions in the mempool were waiting to be added to a block.</p>

<p>Linda Yaccarino has recently been appointed as the new CEO of Twitter by the famous entrepreneur and innovator Elon Musk. This appointment has brought much excitement to the Twitter community, as many people look forward to seeing what changes Yaccarino will bring to the social media giant.</p>



<p>Speculation about Yaccarino&#8217;s interest in cryptocurrencies arose when it was revealed that she follows the official Twitter account of Shiba Inu (SHIB), a meme coin. However, it is still unknown what level of interest she maintains in the digital asset. Yaccarino&#8217;s Twitter account currently follows only 1161 accounts, some of which are the meme coin. As for other meme coins, she follows Dogecoin and the Doge team, including Sir Doge of the Coin and Doge Designer.</p>

<p>Despite this, Yaccarino&#8217;s appointment will focus on &#8220;business operations&#8221; for the platform, while Elon Musk will remain focused on &#8220;product design and new technology.&#8221; Musk expressed his excitement about bringing Yaccarino on board, stating that her hire was another effort to develop the social media platform &#8220;into X, the everything app.&#8221;</p>



<p>The official announcement arrived after Musk announced his intention to step down from the position of CEO. He stated that he intends to transition to more of an executive chair, overseeing product and software development for the platform&#8217;s growth. This move was seen as a way to allow the new CEO to have more autonomy and control over the day-to-day operations of Twitter.</p>

<p>Yaccarino&#8217;s appointment is crucial for Twitter, as the company faces increasing competition from other social media platforms. Many people hope she will bring a fresh perspective and new ideas, helping reinvigorate the platform and keep it relevant in the ever-changing social media landscape.</p>

<p>As mentioned in an earlier article by Coincu News, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange has announced its <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187008-binance-is-now-leaving-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure</a> from the Canadian market due to the uncertain regulatory environment. Binance describes the market as &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221; due to new recommendations regarding stablecoins and investor restrictions on crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>This immediately negatively impacted BTC&#8217;s price, causing it to plummet to $25,900 in the short term and quickly rallying to $26,800 afterward.</p>

<p>There are currently several issues facing the crypto market, including low liquidity, regulatory control over the industry in the US, and macroeconomic concerns.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is up about 59% this year, but price action remains volatile, and low liquidity exacerbates bullish and bearish moves. Liquidity has been a big problem for the crypto market since the closure of Silvergate and Signature Bank &#8211; the two main banks people often use in the crypto space.</p>



<p>The liquidity situation may worsen after Bloomberg reports that Jane Street and Jump Crypto, two of the largest crypto market makers, will take a step back from crypto trading in the US. as US regulators continue to push for control over this nascent industry.</p>

<p>In addition, scrutiny from US regulators over the crypto sector has increased since the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX last year. The crypto industry is battling with US regulators accusing the SEC and the US government of not making clear rules on the sector.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Bitcoin network has recently faced congestion, with Binance last week being forced to halt BTC withdrawals temporarily. Bitcoin transaction fees have also spiked this week, and although they are falling, they have remained high. The original Bitcoin network was not designed to handle high-volume transactions.</p>

<p>Texas state legislators have introduced a bill to ban the use of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the state. This comes as several global leaders have expressed concern about the threat of cyber risk to financial stability, and CBDC vulnerabilities could be exploited to compromise a nation&#8217;s financial system. </p>



<p>The bill cites that retail CBDCs are issued to the general public, establishing a direct relationship between the Federal Reserve and consumers. This could lead to unprecedented government surveillance and control over private cash holdings and transactions.</p>



<p>Introducing a government-controlled digital currency has been a hot topic among government officials, with many against the idea. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has already officially banned CBDCs within the state. At the same time, Senator Ted Cruz has also distrusted CBDCs, stating that implementing central bank-issued digital assets would be profoundly dangerous to society.</p>



<p>Those in favor of CBDCs argue that they could help reduce corruption, make transactions more transparent, and improve financial inclusion by providing access to banking services to those currently unbanked. However, the risks associated with CBDCs cannot be ignored, particularly regarding privacy and security risks.</p>



<p>The bill highlights that many CBDC proposals involve the centralized collection of transaction data, which poses major privacy and security risks, such as making it easier for intruders to access more users&#8217; data. However, proposals that include strategies to minimize those risks often reduce transparency for regulators seeking to detect money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities.</p>

<p>Some prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens are among the digital assets being delisted. A spokesperson for the exchange said that the decision was made to ensure that the clients&#8217; and their consumers&#8217; best interests were being served.</p>



<p>Bakkt agreed to purchase Apex Crypto for a maximum of $200 million, and the deal closed on April 1. The acquisition of Apex Crypto was part of the firm&#8217;s shift towards B2B after having recently shuttered its consumer crypto trading app. Despite having quarterly revenues of $13 million last quarter, the exchange has struggled to gain a foothold in the market and a critical mass of traders.</p>



<p>After considering regulatory guidance and the latest industry developments, the exchange decided to delist tokens. The company&#8217;s review process ensures that the most up-to-date regulatory guidance and industry developments are being contemplated.</p>



<p>The tokens Bakkt is delisting:</p>



<ul>
<li>Aave (AAVE)</li>



<li>ApeCoin (APE)</li>



<li>Avalanche (AVAX)</li>



<li>Bancor Network Token (BNT)</li>



<li>Basic Attention Token (BAT)</li>



<li>Chainlink (LINK)</li>



<li>Chiliz (CHZ)</li>



<li>Compound Token (COMP)</li>



<li>Cosmos (ATOM)</li>



<li>Curve DAO (CRV)</li>



<li>Enjin Coin (ENJ)</li>



<li>Fantom (FTM)</li>



<li>Filecoin (FIL)</li>



<li>GALA (GALA)</li>



<li>The Graph (GRT)</li>



<li>Internet Computer (ICP)</li>



<li>Loopring (LRC)</li>



<li>Maker DAO (MKR)</li>



<li>Republic (REN)</li>



<li>Stellar (XLM)</li>



<li>Sushiswap (SUSHI)</li>



<li>Synthetix (SNX)</li>



<li>Texos (XTZ)</li>



<li>Uniswap (UNI)</li>



<li>Yearn Finance (YFI)</li>
</ul>



<p>The delisting of tokens may impact the crypto market and traders. However, it is essential to note that Bakkt is taking steps to ensure that its clients and their consumers&#8217; best interests are being served and that it is keeping up-to-date with regulatory guidance and industry developments.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase has announced the launch of an advisory committee comprised of many former US legislators and industry professionals.</em></li>



<li><em>For the council, the crypto exchange has recruited former U.S. legislators, including a former Senator and a political strategist.</em></li>



<li><em>The Global Advisory Council will provide insights and strategic expertise to the exchange&#8217;s executive team.</em></li>

<p>After the visit of part of its leadership team to the United Arab Emirates, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced the creation of an advisory group comprised of numerous former US politicians and industry professionals.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-establishes-global-advisory-council" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase announced</a> in a blog post on May 12 that its Global Advisory Council will help company manage the increasingly complicated and dynamic crypto scene throughout the world.</p>



<p>Former U.S. Senator Patrick Toomey, as well as former U.S. Representatives Tim Ryan and Sean Patrick Maloney, will be among the first members. Chris Lehane, a venture capitalist at Haun Ventures, and John Anzalone, the founder of Impact Research Polls, will also take part.</p>



<p>Coinbase CEO <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186979-coinbase-ceo-made-million-security-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brian Armstrong </a>came to Twitter earlier today to welcome the new advisory council members. Faryar Shirzad, the exchange&#8217;s Chief Policy Officer, joined Armstrong in welcoming the new advisory team. Shirzad noted that the business plans to recruit additional executives from the US and internationally to the advisory group in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>Coinbase has increased its attempts to combat what some believe is an increasingly unfriendly regulatory environment in the United States. The exchange launched earlier this year a grassroots project aiming at influencing pro-crypto policies in all 435 House Districts throughout the United States.</p>



<p>Many speculated that the US-based crypto exchange was contemplating transferring its operations outside of the nation due to a lack of legislative certainty. After getting a Wells warning in March, the exchange filed a request to urge the SEC to explain its stance on digital assets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency trading platform in the world, is now leaving Canada.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange also said that the country&#8217;s guidelines restricted operations to the point of becoming unsustainable.</em></li>



<li><em>In February, the Canadian Securities Administrators strengthened registration requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, has stated that it would discontinue operations in Canada, citing the difficult regulatory climate.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-530.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-530-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Is Now Leaving Canada Due To Legal Difficulties" class="wp-image-187016" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-530-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-530-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-530-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-530-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-530.png 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BREAKING: Binance Is Now Leaving Canada Due To Legal Difficulties 29"></a></figure></div>


<p>On Twitter, the corporation declared its intention to stop operations in the North American country.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unfortunately, today we are announcing that Binance will be joining other prominent crypto businesses in proactively withdrawing from the Canadian marketplace.<br><br>We would like to thank those regulators who worked with us collaboratively to address the needs of Canadian users.…</p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1657099651210969088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 12, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Binance described the market as &#8220;untenable&#8221; due to new recommendations pertaining to stablecoins and investor limitations offered to crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>In recent months, Canada has tightened restrictions for crypto asset trading platforms by instituting a pre-registration procedure. Companies that do not follow the guidelines may face enforcement action, according to the Ontario Securities Commission&#8217;s website. As of 2022, Binance was already limited in Ontario.</p>



<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) issued new recommendations in February prohibiting crypto asset trading platforms in the nation from enabling users to acquire or deposit stablecoins without prior clearance from the CSA. To get clearance, the crypto trading platform would have to satisfy the CSA&#8217;s extensive due diligence requirements.</p>

<p>Among these criteria are increased expectations for the custody and segregation of crypto assets held on behalf of Canadian customers, as well as a restriction on extending margin, credit, or other types of leverage to any Canadian client.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency exchange claimed it waited as long as it could to quit the market in order to safeguard its Canadian consumers, but there was no way ahead.</p>



<p>Binance has been under heightened attention from North American authorities in the last year, and it looks to be scaling down activities in the area. Binance said earlier this year that it was contemplating cutting relations with its U.S. business partners.</p>



<p>According to the exchange, Canadian users will get an email with details on how their accounts will be impacted.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>In 2021, Ripple bought 40% of Tranglo.</em></li>

<li><em>As a result, Tranglo has increased business in critical corridors, processing more than $1 billion in ODL transactions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tranglo, a global cross-border payment processing center that also serves as Ripple&#8217;s payment partner, has exceeded $1 billion in On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) transactions for the first time since the service&#8217;s inception.</strong></h5>

<p>In 2021, Ripple, the premier supplier of corporate blockchain solutions for global payments, will purchase 40% of Tranglo. This collaboration enables Ripple to fulfill rising demand in Asia Pacific and expand its ODL service.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Tranglo has increased business in critical corridors, processing more than $1 billion in ODL transactions since ODL&#8217;s inception. Credit facilities and double network reach are two benefits of this collaboration.</p>



<p>This comes on the heels of a successful trial ODL deployment in September 2021, which saw 250,000 transactions totaling $48 million completed in the first 100 days.</p>



<p>As the blockchain company expands its ODL footprint in the Asian market, current RippleNet clients may use Ripple&#8217;s Line of Credit to free up operating cash while growing cross-border payments into additional areas.</p>



<p>The alliance sought to assist the Brad Garlinghouse business in satisfying the expanding client demand in the Asian market when Ripple purchased a share in the Asian fintech firm.</p>



<p>It was also a way to expand the ODL&#8217;s services into new countries, boosting the XRP coin, which the ODL uses for quick payment settlement. Tranglo is well-known in the industry for its quick and effective cross-border payment services.</p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s ODL service has garnered multiple accolades in various locations thus far. After the introduction of the first ODL in Japan, it will make its debut in Brazil in August 2022. This collaboration was with Travelex Bank, the first bank in South America to employ ODL.</p>

<p>According to sources close to the situation, Mashinsky aims to invest $1 billion in a new initiative called Celsius Web Service (CWS).</p>



<p>Last year, just as its main business was imploding, Celsius Network pitched deep-pocketed investors on an ambitious plan to white-label some of its services.</p>



<p>Importantly, the new initiative, which will concentrate on Yield and Custody, was proposed to Goldman Sachs and Abu Dhabi-backed firm ADQ in May and June, respectively, before declaring bankruptcy in mid-July.</p>



<p>The program would see the company provide generic versions of its products, including those focused on yield and custody, and was billed as a &#8220;web3 toolbox for a New World&#8221; in one of the decks.</p>



<p>Moreover, Mashinsky pushed the concept to his Board, which included Laurence Tosi and a representative of the Canadian Caisse de Depot et Placement du Québec until June of last year. Surprisingly, these investors paid $750 million together in Celsius in 2021 but had no interest in CWS.</p>



<p>Incidentally, a Goldman Sachs presentation from May 2022 stated that Celsius intended to study how it might partner with the bank to boost its engagement in the cryptocurrency sector.</p>



<p>Mahinsky&#8217;s effort to create a slew of new products and move Celsius away from its primary business of lending out crypto assets, on the other hand, did not happen quickly enough to prevent the loan business from drowning the whole firm. The company suspended withdrawals on June 12 and declared bankruptcy a month later, owing more than $4.7 billion to over 100,000 members.</p>



<p>According to the source, when the pressure on Celsius mounted in May, Mashinsky sought to shift his emphasis to the CWS project. Others in the sector were taken aback by the plan, considering that Celsius had just secured $750 million from outside investors.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the funds were already spent at that moment. In response to inquiries about the CWS project, Mashinsky sent a link to a blog post outlining the real tale of Celsius&#8217; death, alleging that Alameda Research, a subsidiary of the defunct FTX, was to blame.</p>
