			            <description><![CDATA[Circle is preparing to avoid potential lapse as debt ceiling crisis loom with no agreement in sight.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stablecoin issuer Circle no longer has Treasury holdings that mature beyond early June as it does not want to get tangled in a potential US debt default.</p>
<p>The development follows US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen&#8217;s warning that the government could be unable to pay its bills by June 1st and could default on its debt at a later date, sparking widespread concern.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a recent <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2023/05/10/rewriting-crypto-00096124" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">interview</a>, Chief Jeremy Allaire noted that Circle doesn’t want to carry exposure &#8220;through a potential breach of the ability of the US government to pay its debts.&#8221;</li>
<li>As such, the fintech firm has adjusted its mix of reserves that back USDC by switching to short-dated US Treasuries to avoid a catastrophic fallout.</li>
<li>Circle Reserve Fund Disclosures, which are managed by BlackRock, <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/cash/en-us/products/329365/circle-reserve-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">revealed</a> that current holdings mature no later than May 31.</li>
<li>A Treasury bill, aka T-Bill, is a short-term government debt obligation backed by the US Treasury that can have maturities ranging from four weeks to 52 weeks.</li>
<li>The Republicans and Democrats failing to reach a deal might put the country at risk of defaulting on the national debt. To avoid a default, both sides will have to raise the debt ceiling.</li>
<li>However, negotiations on raising the debt ceiling got off to a rocky start this week as White House talks concluded with no agreement.</li>
<li>As for Circle, its US Dollar-pegged stablecoin &#8211; USDC &#8211; suffered a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/why-did-usdc-depeg-circle-ceo-gives-the-inside-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">depeg</a> after the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) earlier this year. The token has since stabilized and is currently sitting at a $30.12 billion market cap.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The authorities of New York state proposed certain amendments to the law that could allow residents to settle bail bonds in stablecoins instead of fiat currency.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawmakers pointed out the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, outlining that the court might require further guarantees if the valuation of stablecoins dropped over 50% from the value when bail was posted.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;If the court directs that bail be posted as provided in paragraph (j) of subdivision of this section and the value of the stablecoins falls more than fifty percent from the value of the stablecoins at the time bail was posted, the court may in its discretion, request the posting of additional bail as provided in subdivision one of this section,&#8221; the bill reads.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies or precious metals are supposed to have a fixed price, but there have been some examples of the opposite.

			            <description><![CDATA[PacWest lost over $10 billion in deposits since the start of the banking crisis. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">California lender PacWest Bancorp (PACW) fell over 20% on Thursday after the company revealed it had lost a significant portion of its deposits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This follows a string of US regional bank failures this year that were preceded by similar red flags. </span></p>
<h2>Depositors Flee From PacWest</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Per its quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, PacWest said its deposits declined by 9.5% last week – mostly occurring on May 4 and 5. This, according to the bank, was in response to “heightened market and customer fears” surrounding the bank after First Republic Bank was closed by regulators on May 1st. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the afternoon of May 3, 2023, PacWest was featured prominently in the financial news headlines with reports that PacWest was &#8220;exploring all of its options and having talks with potential investors and partners&#8221;,” wrote the firm. “The news headlines increased our customers&#8217; fears of the safety of their deposits.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among the </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/multiple-bank-stocks-slide-while-bitcoin-pumps-after-first-republic-failure/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">many banks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> caught up in banking sector fear during First Republic’s fall, PacWest was one the hardest hit. During the week from April 28 to May 5, its stock price fell from $10.15 to $5.96, and trades for $4.70 as of Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bank clarified that it has already funded its decline in deposits with available on-balance-sheet liquidity. As of May 10, the firm held immediately available liquidity of $15 billion, against uninsured deposits of $5.2 billion, representing a coverage ratio of 288%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Much of that liquidity stemmed from having pledged $5.1 billion on Wednesday to the Federal Reserve’s discount window, giving PacWest another $3.9 billion in additional borrowing capacity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">PacWest was also hit hard during the initial string of bank failures in March that claims Silvergate, Signature Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The event caused PacWest to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/multiple-bank-stocks-stop-trading-amid-post-svb-volatility/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">plummet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> 47% the day after SVB depositors were bailed out, and to lose deposits in excess of what federal deposit insurance could cover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first quarter, PacWest’s deposits fell by $16.9% total – or $5.7 billion. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“These recent events, and the ongoing news coverage of these events, has increased certain risks and uncertainties related to our business and future prospects,” stated the bank. </span></p></blockquote>
<h2>The Current State of Banks</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Phoenix-based bank Western Alliance (WAL) also underwent significant volatility after March’s bank failures, dropping a whopping 76% on March 13. After First Republic went down, its stock </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/multiple-bank-stocks-slide-while-bitcoin-pumps-after-first-republic-failure/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">slid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> 20% on May 2 from $36.18 to $28.96. It currently trades for $28.96. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bank </span><a href="https://investors.westernalliancebancorporation.com/news-releases/news/news-details/2023/Western-Alliance-Bancorporation-Issues-Deposit-Update/default.aspx" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">appeared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to fare better than PacWest on the deposit front, however, reporting a $600 million increase in deposits between May 2 and May 9. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After First Republic’s failure, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted that PacWest would be the next bank to fall in the ongoing banking crisis. “Guess we know who is next to be deaded by the FDIC,” he </span><a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1653403052899192833" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in response to its sliding stock prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last week, US Senator John Kennedy </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-senator-calls-banks-sophisticated-ponzi-schemes/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">referred</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to banks as “sophisticated Ponzi schemes” due to their reliance on their depositors’ trust in them.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ZachXBT has accused several influencers of engaging in pump-and-dump scams and profiting from the misery of others. This time, the on-chain sleuth has targetted yet another figure who goes by the name &#8216;DannyCrypt,&#8217; for allegedly dumping on his followers.</p>
<p>The crypto influencer in question was accused of receiving 2% of the supply of a certain token to assist with marketing. However, 15 minutes after receiving the tokens, he allegedly dumped the majority of them for $57k (31 ETH) to his unsuspecting followers.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1656375551819497478" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">thread</a> by ZackXBT, DannyCrypt was actively promoting a new coin called &#8220;HODL&#8221; on social media and tweeted about &#8220;hodling&#8221; its tokens.</li>
<li>He is accused of telling his 26K Telegram channel subscribers that he believes the token&#8217;s price to have &#8220;stabilized,&#8221; but immediately after which he sold his stash.</li>
<li>DannyCrypt&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrypt/status/1656419214012436481" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">tweet</a> that appears to address ZackXBT&#8217;s claims read,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Team is not angry that I sold but cos they all couldn’t sell before me after keeping over 70% of the presale Whitelist for themselves. Same thing they do with NFT projects. That being said if you come for me, I’ll block you, go and cry on your timeline.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ZachXBT continued to maintain that DannyCrypt &#8220;made a post-playing victim&#8221; and even untagged himself from the post in an attempt to distance himself from the claims. The influencer subsequently blocked him.</li>
<li>Last September, ZackXBT accused popular crypto influencer Lark Davis of profiting over $1 million while promoting low-cap crypto projects and dumping them on his followers. The latter had <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/lark-davis-dismisses-ridiculous-pump-and-dump-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">dismissed</a> the allegations.</li>
<li>Youtuber and influencer Ben Armstrong, a.k.a BitBoy, was also accused of carrying out at least seven scams of shilling and dumping.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Lightning Network could take the pressure off Bitcoin's waiting area for new transactions. While the BTC mempool remains congested midway through the week, a lightning quick fix using the Bitcoin L2 could save the day.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Bitcoin had whittled down waitlisted transaction orders by Wednesday, network congestion remains high. Median confirmation time hovered markedly above ten minutes. The on-chain metric for Bitcoin network fulfillment sits at a high unseen since Feb 2023 and Dec 2022.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of transactions at a time sit waiting to be confirmed. That&#8217;s far above normal levels in the tens of thousands. The extent of network lag is so high that at least one longtime Bitcoin proponent says it&#8217;s a DDoS attack by BTC senders attaching BRC-20 ordinals scripts.</p>
<h2>Binance Turns to Lightning Network</h2>
<p>Processing time started looking better during the week, but the network <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/median-confirmation-time" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">hasn&#8217;t nearly recovered</a> to normal speeds. To handle long wait times and high fees, Binance had to pause withdrawals for a few hours Sunday. It restored Bitcoin withdrawals Monday but then paused them again before restoring services.</p>
<p>But Binance is hoping some quick work with Lightning Network could speed things along. The exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419624962527233" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">announced</a> over the weekend that it has a team working to enable BTC Lightning Network withdrawals.</p>
<p>Lightning Network is a &#8220;Layer-2&#8221; blockchain scaling platform that handles Bitcoin transactions. It periodically updates with the &#8220;Layer-1&#8221; or base chain to update it in a flash with what happened between updates. While waiting on the mempool to clear up, the L2 can keep track of Bitcoin orders.</p>
<h2>BTC Network Jam Sends Bitcoin Transaction Fee Soaring</h2>
<p>The memory pool of unconfirmed transactions has <a href="https://bitcoinvisuals.com/bitcoind-mempool" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">remained high</a> this week in the hundreds of thousands. That&#8217;s much higher than their normal level. It&#8217;s usually in the tens of thousands at any given time during periods of low network congestion.</p>
<p>The total backlog of BTC orders since the weekend, starting May 6, is a magnitude of network latency unseen since June 2021. That was with the Bitcoin price flying up in a cyclical crypto bull run. Order senders using the BRC-20 token standard to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-to-support-bitcoin-ordinals-in-its-ntf-marketplace/" data-wpel-link="internal">mint &#8220;ordinal&#8221; NFTs</a> using the BTC blockchain caused the current jam.</p>
<p>The blockchain has slowed very suddenly as a result of senders adding these scripts. One veteran Bitcoin supporter and software, John W. Ratcliff says that it amounts to an attack on the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>On Twitter, he cited the unnecessary data-wasting format most BRC-20 users are inserting. He says it&#8217;s a level of incompetence too staggering to believe. It would be an odd way to attack the network, though, that results in its miners earning higher fees. Regardless, necessity would appear again to be the mother of innovation.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Representatives from CryptoQuant believe Bitcoin could return to its previous all-time high by early next year. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin is up (YTD), banks are collapsing, and the Federal Reserve seems to be approaching the end of its monetary tightening mission. Does that mean the bull market is back in action?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoPotato spoke with crypto market analytics firm CryptoQuant at Consensus 2023 to discuss all things related to Bitcoin’s price – including its place in the market cycle, its correlation to gold, and its role during the ongoing US banking crisis.</span></p>
<h2>Bullish Times Ahead for Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about whether the bull market had returned, CryptoQuant’s Head of BD &amp; Strategy Benjamin Brannan told CryptoPotato that Bitcoin appears to be “out of the depths of the bear market.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he personally views corrections as “always on the table,” the business development head said he’s received word from institutional clients intending to invest in Bitcoin and crypto in Q3 and Q4 2023. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are from conversations that I&#8217;ve been having mainly with institutional allocators and also people who are fundraising core funds as well,” said Brannan during an interview. “They&#8217;ve been speaking with various institutions or high net worth individuals.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brannan added that institutions are waiting for the latter half of the year for confirmation that Bitcoin has exited the bear market, which so far is “looking to be the case.”</span></p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Gold</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trading at roughly $16,500 at the start of the year, Bitcoin has rapidly appreciated to over $27,000 in response to this year’s US banking crisis, which has seen the likes of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley Bank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Silvergate, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Republic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other banking institutions fall between the cracks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event has </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-to-gold-correlation-surges-amid-banking-turmoil-surpasses-stocks/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coincided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a falling correlation between Bitcoin and stocks, and a rising correlation with gold. This phenomenon is especially apparent in Bitcoin’s newfound resilience to Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, which pummeled stocks and crypto alike last year. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bitcoin&#39;s correlation to Gold is the highest that its been in years, surpassing its correlation to the S&amp;P</p>
<p>(h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@KaikoData</a>) <a href="https://t.co/5TDOtlm5zq" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/5TDOtlm5zq</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) <a href="https://twitter.com/WClementeIII/status/1642889074993143809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">April 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branaan said the “rush to Bitcoin” was a sign that the market was, at least for the moment, viewing the digital currency as a “safe haven asset.” In the long term, he predicted it will behave like a mixture of stocks and gold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Cryptoquant’s Head of Marketing, Ho Chan Chung surmised that Bitcoin is viewed as a commodity that performs well when the fiat system is not doing well. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the United States are only in agreement that Bitcoin is a commodity, while altcoins may be securities. </span></p>
<h2>The 4-Year Market Cycle</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin is notorious for </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-hodl-patterns-indicate-cycle-shift-to-bull-market/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moving cyclically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between bull and bears markets every four years, based on its supply issuance schedule that reduces its inflation rate within the same time intervals. While the general pattern is predictable, getting the exact timing of crypto market tops and bottoms can be tricky business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Brannan, there are some reliable indicators to identify bottoms from an on-chain perspective. One of them is Market-Value to Realized-Value ratio (MVRV), which divides an asset’s market capitalization by its realized capitalization (which values all Bitcoin based on the price each coin was last moved, and presumably sold.)</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When coins are being held at a very high unrealized loss, then I think it&#8217;s a good time to buy,” said Brannan. “If a lot of the participants are holding their coins at unrealized gains, very high unrealized gains, you can think that a lot of people are looking to sell, realize some profits.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<figure style="width: 4032px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/693983534737522688/1101159206880563272/20230426_141113.jpg" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/693983534737522688/1101159206880563272/20230426_141113.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="2268" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ho Chan Chung (Centre); Brannan (Right).</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derivations of MVRV, including Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) and net unrealized profit and loss (NUPL), can also help in identifying market tops and bottoms – especially when they pass key threshold ratios. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoQuant tracks MVRV ratios based on different age bands for when coin movements took place – including one day, one week, one month, and so on.</span></p>
<h2>Price Predictions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about price predictions for the near future, both Brannan and Chung agreed that Bitcoin likely won’t retest its $16,000 lows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If there are no such black swan events such as  Russia blowing a nuclear weapon into Ukraine, or Binance is blowing up …then we should be pretty stable in terms of meeting the low lows,” said Chung.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chung added that Bitcoin may even surpass its previous all-time high by Q2 2024 – right around the time the next Bitcoin halving takes place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the long term, Brannan said Bitcoin could realistically reach $1 million by the year 2030. Even the tightening regulatory situation in the United States could serve to benefit the asset, in his view.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think Bitcoin is difficult to regulate, compared to &#8220;crypto.&#8221; I think it can benefit,” he said. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Nexo is restructuring its operations but does not plan to leave the United Kingdom. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nexo – a popular cryptocurrency lending platform – is dissolving two business units based in the United Kingdom while it deals with regulatory issues in other parts of Europe and North America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The latest steps are part of a “restructuring” effort that will still involve Nexo continuing operations within the country. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">As reported by </span><a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-lender-nexo-takes-steps-to-dissolve-uk-units-1.1918939" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">BNN Bloomberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, filings from this month show that the lender has applied to remove both Nexo Financial Services Ltd. and Nexo Clearing and Custody Ltd from the UK companies register.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">In messages to Bloomberg, Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev explained that his company was  “doing some restructuring” and “rethinking the way we go about servicing clients.” </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides crypto trading and custody, Nexo offers a number of crypto-based financial products to its clients, including debit card services, borrowing, and savings accounts. These savings accounts can offer “up to 15% APR on your crypto,” according to its website, with yields sometimes rising as high as 7% for Bitcoin, and 12% for USDC. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Regulators in the United States have shown strong skepticism of crypto-based interest-bearing accounts, </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-chairman-warns-of-crypto-lending-platforms-with-unrealistic-returns/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> them for their unusually high savings rates compared to traditional savings accounts. Unlike chartered banks, crypto financial platforms are not covered by federal deposit insurance. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Scrutiny increased in mid-2022 after billions of dollars were lost within multiple now-bankrupt crypto lending platforms including Celsius and Voyager, and later BlockFi. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nexo </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nexos-co-founders-dismiss-insolvency-rumors-reveal-expansion-plans/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">emphasized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that it was not in the same perilous financial condition as such firms, but nevertheless faced ongoing waves of scrutiny and </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nexo-agrees-to-pay-45-million-in-fines-to-us-authorities/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the Securities and Exchange Commission over the coming months. In December, Nexo </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nexo-is-leaving-the-united-states-due-to-regulatory-difficulties/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that it was leaving the United States due to regulatory difficulties. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nexo’s Earn product is also inaccessible in Canada, where regulators have entirely </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/canadian-securities-regulators-ban-crypto-margin-trading/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> crypto margin trading. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The firm’s troubles extend to Bulgaria as well, where its offices were </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nexo-bulgarian-offices-reportedly-raided-by-authorities/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">raided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in January on accusations of money laundering, tax fraud, and computer fraud, while conducting unlicensed banking services. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Trenchev described the accusations as “ludicrous,” and his company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nexo-mulls-suing-bulgaria-for-1-billion-says-co-founder-antoni-trenchev/" data-wpel-link="internal">sued</a> Bulgaria for $1 million in response.<br />

			            <description><![CDATA[The crypto exchange wades into a controversy on whether Pepecoin is a symbol of hatred.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pepecoin (PEPE) made quite a significant upheaval in the sluggish crypto market. From less than $1 million at the launch, its market cap swelled close to $2 billion in just weeks. The frog-themed memecoin in the crypto universe dominated by dog-themed coins is bound to trigger funny memes.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And one such meme attempt by Coinbase doesn&#8217;t seem to have landed well, and the crypto exchange is at the receiving end of a &#8220;well-deserved&#8221; backlash from PEPE fans and holders.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">PEPE as a Symbol of Hate   </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apparently, Coinbase, on May 10, sent its investors an email mentioning the frenzy around PEPE and calling it the memecoin of the moment. It said, &#8220;Over time, it [PEPE] has been co-opted as a hate symbol by alt-right groups, according to the Anti-Defamation League.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto influencer Borovik.eth </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/3orovik/status/1656453389192921088?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">shared</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a screenshot of the email newsletter from May 10 with his 96,000 followers. The newsletter cited a 2016 decision made by the Anti-Defamation League to include the frog-themed character in its database of online hate symbols.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Why is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">@coinbase </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">sending out emails telling people that </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">$pepe</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is an alt-right hate symbol??,&#8221; Borovik.eth wrote. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although the memecoin has started falling and has shed at least half its market cap so far, it has secured a listing on OKX and Binance &#8211; no less! Gemini is also much impressed by its performance and has announced its support. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">PEPE Lovers Take on Coinbase   </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">PEPE continued to receive support as digital artist Beeple and crypto influencers Kenobi and Pauly highlighted the community-driven movement against VC-backed entities hijacking the Web3 movement. Beeple posted a picture of the Pepe Army laying siege to Coinbase.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The crypto exchange has not reacted to the comments it received in response to its remarks on PEPE.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meanwhile, after a massive bull run since its launch on April 17 by an anonymous creator, PEPE seems to be settling down to where it belongs. On May 9, <em>CryptoPotato</em> reported that the market cap of the most exciting memecoin was </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/pepe-pump-and-dump-from-1-8b-market-cap-to-800m-in-4-days-hype-over/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reduced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to $800 million, sliding from $1.8 billion in merely four days. A day earlier, the 4-week-old coin had ended the week with a massive 350% </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-slides-to-29k-pepe-to-end-the-week-with-350-gains-weekend-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">gain</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When listed on Binance on May 5, the coin was worth $0.000002023, but the news drove its price to $0.000004354. According to CoinMarketCap, it&#8217;s trading at $0.000001615, signaling a dip of 15.82%.</span></p>

<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>The price has been consolidating below the $30K resistance level following a failed breakout earlier in April. The 50-day moving average has also been broken to the downside around the $28K mark as a result of the bearish pressure in the last few days.</p>
<p>The $25K support area could be the next target, followed by the critical 200-day moving average, located around the $22K level. Both are significantly important, and a break below them would be disastrous for buyers seeking an upward trend.</p>
<p>On the other hand, another break above the 50-day moving average would likely sabotage the bearish scenario, and the price would probably get past the $30K level this time around.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, the recent consolidation becomes more clear as the price has evidently been oscillating between the $30K and $27,500 levels for the past few weeks.</p>
<p>The $27,500 level, which is a significant support zone that has previously held the market on multiple occasions, is currently under fire, and a breakdown would result in a deeper drop toward the $25K range in the short term.</p>
<p>The RSI also shows values below 50%, which points to the bearish momentum in this timeframe. This further boosts the probability of a lower bearish continuation in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<h3>Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio</h3>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been consolidating below the key $30K resistance level, following a rally since the beginning of 2023. The recent indecisiveness shown by the price has led many investors to wonder whether the bear market is really over or whether the price will be able to make it past the $30K mark. Therefore, analyzing the futures market sentiment could provide helpful insights.</p>
<p>This chart demonstrates the Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric, which determines whether the bulls or the bears are dominant. Values above 1 indicate that long traders are executing more aggressively, and conversely, values below 1 point to the bear&#8217;s dominance.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, it is clear that this metric has been trending below 1 over the last few months, and it could be one of the main reasons why BTC has failed to break above $30K. This aggressive selling pressure could reverse the trend and push the price lower if things remain the same.</p>
<p>So, while BTC has rebounded substantially since the beginning of the year, the bear market may still not be over.</p>
