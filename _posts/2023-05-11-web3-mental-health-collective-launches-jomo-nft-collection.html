<p class="md-end-block md-p">Peace Inside Live, a Web3 mental health collective, has launched an NFT collection to promote the joy of missing out (JOMO) over the fear of missing out (FOMO). The collection, called the JOMO Effect, features a series of digital art pieces that represent various aspects of mental health and well-being.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Primary sale profits from the NFTs will be donated to five mental health charities, such as the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Over 40 creators contributed digital art to the collection, which is available for minting on the Magic Eden marketplace via Polygon for 24 MATIC (around $21) as an open-edition for 24 hours. The "Joy List" or allow list, opened for three hours before the public mint at a price of 20 MATIC (roughly $18).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">By participating in this initiative, collectors can access various resources and benefits like Chopra's Soul of Leadership course, Peace Inside Live's mindfulness materials, and discounts for Unstoppable Domains.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We believe that the Web3 space can be a powerful tool for promoting mental health," said Shira Lazar, Emmy nominated host and co-founder of Peace Inside Live. "By focusing on JOMO, we can help people to find balance, take breaks, and focus on their own well-being."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of the JOMO Effect NFT collection is a timely response to the increasing focus on mental health in society. Efforts like these can help foster a healthier and more balanced approach to the digital world.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Web3 space is a rapidly growing and evolving ecosystem. With its potential to disrupt many industries, it's also equally important to consider the toll that Web3 could have on mental health. This writer, for instance, has struggled with the same issues on a personal level. In an effort to maintain journalistic integrity in the Web3 space, this writer has not held any amount in crypto beyond the what they are compensated for.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">One of the potential challenges of Web3 is the fear of missing out (FOMO). In the Web3 space, there is always something new and exciting happening. It can be easy to feel like you are missing out if you are not constantly connected and updated. This can lead to anxiety, stress, and even depression over financial opportunities missed.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We hope that the JOMO Effect NFT collection will spark conversations about mental health in the Web3 space," said Lazar. "We believe that by integrating mental health into the core foundation of the industry, we can bring about a disruptive change."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The JOMO Effect NFT collection is a positive step towards addressing the potential mental health challenges of Web3. By focusing on the joy of missing out (JOMO), the collection encourages individuals to find balance, take breaks, and focus on their mental well-being.</p>
