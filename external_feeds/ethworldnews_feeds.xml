<p>Cathie Wood’s asset management firm Ark Invest has sold nearly half a million <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-stock-down-9-staking-paused/">Coinbase</a> Global shares worth more than $53 million. The sale comes less than a week after the Ark Innovation ETF sold 135,152 shares of the crypto exchange after the stock rallied amid a series of spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Applications from TradFi giants like BlackRock and Fidelity named Coinbase as its surveillance-sharing partner, leading to an uptick in its share price. </p>



<h2><strong>Ark Invest Bumps Meta and Robinhood Holdings</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/239769/ark-invest-coinbase-sells-cathie-wood" rel="nofollow noopener">The Block</a>, three of Ark Invest’s leading funds were involved in the sale of the Coinbase shares. The Ark Innovation ETF sold 263,247 shares, Ark Next Generation Internet ETF sold 93,227 shares while Ark Fintech Innovation ETF sold 121,882 shares, bringing the total to 478,356 shares. The sale came on the same day when the crypto exchange’s stock rallied to a yearly high of $113. </p>



<p>The rally was prompted by the summary judgment in SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which indicated that XRP did not qualify as a security. The ruling was interpreted as a bullish event by the crypto community and triggered rallies in several crypto tokens and stocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data from <a href="https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=COIN&amp;subView=institutional" rel="nofollow noopener">CNN</a> shows that despite the considerable sale earlier, Ark Invest was the second largest holder of Coinbase Global after The Vanguard Group. Among its funds, the asset management firm held a 6.30% stake in the crypto exchange with 11.7 million shares worth a whopping $732.4 million. The asset manager’s trading desk revealed that it had bought more than 82,000 shares of Meta (formerly Facebook) and 169,116 shares of discount brokerage firm Robinhood. </p>

<p>Coinbase’s shares have lost more than 9% of their value following the pausing of its staking services in multiple U.S. states. The pause comes more than a month after ten states initiated <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-cease-desist-order-sec-lawsuit/">proceedings</a> against the crypto exchange on the same day that the Securities and Exchange Commission sued it for allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange and offering unregistered securities through its staking service.</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Says It Will Defend Its Staking Services </strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase took to <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1679951143026171905" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to share the latest development regarding the staking services with its customers. According to the crypto exchange, which happens to be the largest in the United States, regulators in California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin have required it to stop offering its staking product. The state regulators directed the exchange to prevent retail customers from staking additional crypto assets while their proceedings continue. Coinbase has stated that it disagrees with the allegations surrounding its staking services and added that it will vigorously defend the product in court. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We stand by staking. Today almost every major blockchain relies on staking because it is open, secure, and environmentally friendly. Americans in every state deserve access to the same technology and economic opportunities as people everywhere.”</p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve safely and legally offered staking for almost 4 years. We’ve  always followed legal process, and will do so here. These proceedings are just getting started &#8211; we’ll continue to defend everyone’s right to stake if and how they choose. <a href="https://t.co/vkSjiO2tjV" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/vkSjiO2tjV</a></p>&mdash; paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1679952235130765313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">July 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The latest order by state regulators led to a 9% decline in Coinbase’s share price. The stock dropped from its daily high of $113 to as low as $101 before closing at $105. Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong previously assured customers that the enforcement action by the SEC and the proceedings initiated by state regulators wouldn’t impact the staking services. “We’re not going to wind down our staking service. Coinbase’s staking product is architected and built in a way to be compliant,” he stated at the time.</p>

<p>Arkham released guidelines for bounty submissions and trading activity on its upcoming Intel Exchange following overwhelming privacy concerns from the crypto community. </p>



<p>On July 10, the blockchain intelligence provider <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-allow-users-buy-sell-intel-wallets/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-allow-users-buy-sell-intel-wallets/" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a new exchange that will allow users to buy and sell intel on wallet addresses. Arkham described the platform as a place for blockchain sleuths to monetize their skills and a hub for decentralized information sharing. </p>



<h2>Guidelines For Arkham&#8217;s Intel-To-earn Each</h2>



<p>Friday&#8217;s guideline announcement that Arkham&#8217;s Intel Exchange only supports bounties or submissions that request or offer publicly verifiable on-chain data, meaning that trading private off-chain is prohibited on the platform. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Under no circumstances whatsoever will personal physical addresses, phone numbers, confidential ID numbers, date of birth, or other sensitive PII be allowed onto the exchange, even if publicly available elsewhere.</p></blockquote>



<p>The platform&#8217;s rulebook also supports intel that helps to uncover hacks or scam behavior, identifying major players, market movement analysis, and sources of alpha. Also, the platform will support future governance changes to how bounties or submissions are reviewed. </p>

<p>The Intel Exchange was received with contrasting emotions ahead of its launch slated for July 18 along with an airdrop and public token sale of the ARKM coin on Binance. </p>



<p>While some crypto participants saluted the move to create a liquid market for information and allow sleuths like ZachXBT to earn for their work, skeptics voiced doubts about possible privacy breaches and the platform&#8217;s supposed &#8220;dox-to-earn&#8221; model&#8221;. </p>



<p>Community concerns escalated further after it was discovered that private email addresses were viewable when users generated a referral link. </p>



<p>CEO Miguel Morel <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-intel-exchange-offchain/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-intel-exchange-offchain/" rel="noreferrer noopener">assured</a> users during a Twitter space that the company will prioritize safe and public data exchange for the benefit of the participants. </p>

<ul><li>Open Exchange is now offering trading of bankruptcy claims held by customers of FTX and Celsius.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankruptcy claims trading platform is offering immediate liquidity to stranded claims holders.&nbsp;</li><li>OPNX recently partnered with Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange and received a license in Spain.&nbsp;</li><li>OPNX was co-founded by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, the men behind the defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Open Exchange (OPNX) is buying bankruptcy claims held by customers of FTX and Celsius Network. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-ecosystem-partner-3ac-ventures/">OPNX</a> rolled out claims for bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and crypto lender Celsius more than a month after it initially announced the feature for its users. The exchange’s native token OX gained more than 3% following the latest development. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.31. </p>



<h2><strong>Open Exchange Partners With Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange</strong></h2>



<p>Open Exchange took to <a href="https://twitter.com/OPNX_Official/status/1679837501601755139?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to announce that FTX bankruptcy claims were live on its claims trading platform. OPNX encouraged stranded FTX customers to onboard their bankruptcy claims and offered immediate conversion to its native token OX. This token can also be used to trade futures on the crypto exchange. FTX owes roughly $8 billion to its customers, while Celsius owes more than $4 billion. However, it is unlikely that all of these bankruptcy claims will reach OPNX. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“With claim tokenization, we are offering customers immediate liquidity, the chance to regain control over their funds and participate in market opportunities once again,&#8221; </p><cite>Mark Lamb, Founder of Open Exchange</cite></blockquote>



<p>In other news, Open Exchange <a href="https://news.opnx.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> on July 13, 2023, that it had entered into a strategic partnership with Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange, which allowed the exchange to become a licensed entity in Spain. The Cayman Island-registered firm was co-founded by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, the men behind the defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. They partnered with CoinFlex co-founders Mark Lamb and Leslie Lamb to launch OPNX earlier this year. </p>

<p>Mashinsky&#8217;s personal recognizance bond must be signed by two financially responsible persons. The first, his wife, must sign the $40 million bail agreement by today July 14. The court set a deadline of July 21 for the second FRP&#8217;s signature. </p>



<p>This bail agreement is usually issued to individuals with close ties to their community. The personal recognizance bond also considers the defendants&#8217; criminal records, whether they are a flight risk, and their employment status among other factors. </p>



<p>A personal recognizance bond means that Mashinsky will be released without actually paying any money for his bail and will be required to attend all court hearings linked to his fraud case.</p>

<p>The SEC and previously the CFTC also accused Mashinsky of falsely marketing Celsius as a path to financial freedom while he and other executives used customer funds to make risky investments, fund personal expenses, and raise billions of dollars through unregistered offerings. </p>



<p>&#8220;He looks forward to vigorously defending himself in court against these baseless charges,” Mashinsky’s lawyer Jonathan Ohring said on behalf of the Celsius founder who <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/ex-celsius-ceo-mashinsky-arrested-in-latest-doj-crypto-case-1" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/ex-celsius-ceo-mashinsky-arrested-in-latest-doj-crypto-case-1" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">denied</a> all the allegations against him.</p>

<p>XRP, the native token of digital remittance provider Ripple, has recorded staggering gains in the last 24 hours following a ruling about the token&#8217;s status as a security. </p>



<p>Ripple achieved a crucial legal victory as Judge Analisa Torres from New York ruled that XRP sold to retail users on crypto exchanges should not be classified as an investment contract. Coinbase, America&#8217;s largest crypto trading venue, swiftly <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-relists-xrp-after-court-rules-its-not-a-security/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-relists-xrp-after-court-rules-its-not-a-security/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reopened</a> trading for Ripple&#8217;s token on Thursday shortly after the news broke.</p>



<p>Following the court&#8217;s ruling, prominent exchanges such as Crypto.com and <a href="https://twitter.com/krakenpro/status/1679631565721149445?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/krakenpro/status/1679631565721149445?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kraken Pro</a> wasted no time in announcing the resumption of XRP trading, following in Coinbase&#8217;s footsteps. <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1679550388272283649" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1679550388272283649" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gemini</a> is also considering listing the coin in spot and derivatives pairs, said co-founder Cameron Winklevoss.</p>



<p>The price of XRP exploded after the ruling, recording massive gains for holders. At press time, the token was up over 68%. <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xrp/historical_data#panel" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xrp/historical_data#panel" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Coingecko</a> data showed that XRP&#8217;s daily trading volume lept from around $600 million to over $11 billion between July 13 and July 14.</p>

<h2>XRP Holder In Euphoria As SEC vs Ripple Goes To Trial</h2>



<p>The ruling issued by Judge Analisa Torres constitutes a partial win for both Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>



<p>According to court documents, Judge Torres <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-leaders-ripple-xrp-sec-judgement/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-leaders-ripple-xrp-sec-judgement/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruled</a> that Ripple&#8217;s tokens sold on exchanges to retail customers do not qualify as an investment contract and is therefore not a security. While this has paved the path for Ripple token&#8217;s token to resume trading on crypto exchanges like Coinbase, and perhaps beacons hope for other cryptos like SOL, ADA, and MATIC that were labeled as securities by the SEC, the same cannot be said for institutional sales. </p>



<p>Indeed, the ruling in New York said that Ripple&#8217;s token sales to institutional buyers qualified as unregistered securities offerings. </p>

<p>Multichain team&#8217;s said the cross-chain protocol will shut down after confirming that CEO Zhaojun was indeed <a href="https://twitter.com/multichainorg/status/1679768407628185600?s=46&amp;t=TMI07H21nqgKjjcESnhqEQ" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/multichainorg/status/1679768407628185600?s=46&amp;t=TMI07H21nqgKjjcESnhqEQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">arrested</a> by police in China. The team&#8217;s Friday announcement comes weeks after rumors about Zhaojun&#8217;s arrest first circulated in May. </p>



<p>News about the CEO&#8217;s arrest gripped the Multichain community following a sudden halt of the protocol&#8217;s operations, leaving transactions and user funds hanging in the air. </p>



<h2>Multichain&#8217;s Multimess</h2>



<p>&#8220;On May 21, 2023, Multichain CEO Zhaojun was taken away by the Chinese police from his home,&#8221; the team said today. Authorities seized Zhaojun&#8217;s computers, phones, hardware wallets, and mnemonic phrases, Friday&#8217;s thread from the team noted. This means that local police now has custody of investor funds and project funds managed directly managed by CEO Zhaojun.</p>



<p>The team was unable to repair technical issues after his arrest since Zhaojun&#8217;s personal server had sole access to project nodes and all operations funds.</p>



<p>On June 4, the Multichain team used historical information from Zhaojun&#8217;s home computer to log into the cloud server with the help of the CEO&#8217;s family. The team had <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/multichain-transactions-resume-polygon/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/multichain-transactions-resume-polygon/" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited access</a> and could only fix issues on two servers.</p>



<p>Over a month later on July 7, tens of millions in user assets were strangely transferred to unknown addresses. Zhaojun&#8217;s sister said the cloud server login which authorized the transactions came from an IP address in Kunming.</p>



<p>The team said Zhaojun&#8217;s sister supposedly moved to preserve the remaining assets and transferred $220 million in user funds to wallets under her control two days later. </p>



<p>Four days after, Zhaojun&#8217;s sister was detained by China police and the team lost contact with her. It&#8217;s also unclear whether or not local authorities took custody of the assets she moved days prior to her arrest.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Due to the lack of alternative sources of information and corresponding operational funds, the team is forced to cease operations. If there are any further notifications and developments, the team will update the community accordingly.</p></blockquote>



<p>The team is now seeking the help of domain name marketplace GoDaddy to take down the front end of its website, multichain dot org. Multichain&#8217;s native token MULTI slumped 14% in the last 24 hours. </p>

<p>In welcoming news for crypto fans, crypto exchange Coinbase has made the announcement today that it will be relisting XRP (XRP) on the XRP network subject to liquidity requirements being met. Trading of XRP is expected to commence later today. </p>



<p>Coinbase has planned to launch trading on its XRP USD, XRP USDT, and XRP EUR trading pairs in stages following the establishment of a suitable supply of this asset. The resumption of XRP trading on Coinbase comes after an absence spanning almost two years.</p>



<p>In January 2021  Coinbase had decided to delist $XRP from its platform due to concerns surrounding the security and regulatory status of this cryptocurrency. However, a recent ruling by a U.S. District Court judge has altered the landscape by asserting that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lacked authority in initiating enforcement action against Ripple Labs, the entity behind XRP.</p>



<p>This court ruling effectively paved the way for Coinbase to reinstate trading activities for XRP as it clarified that XRP does not meet the definition of a security according to the SECs guidelines. The SEC defines a security as &#8220;an investment contract,&#8221; which involves an arrangement facilitating investor anticipation for returns arising from others&#8217; dedicated efforts. The court established that there is no investment contract inherent in XPR therefore rendering it outside this classification.</p>



<p>Coinbases decision to relist brings about a significant triumph since it signifies their success in contesting the SECs position and clarifies that categorically, XRP should not be considered as a security</p>



<p><strong>For Ripple Labs.</strong></p>



<p>This positive development bears potential implications relating to increased adoption by mainstream investors moving forward. What does this signify for users of XRP?</p>



<p>The reinstatement of XRP trading on Coinbase brings forth constructive prospects for this cryptocurrency. Its return is predicted to enhance liquidity levels along with fostering more robust trade volume.</p>



<p>This outcome also contributes towards greater legitimacy within investor and regulatory circles.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it remains imperative to bear in mind that XRP remains a highly fluctuating form of cryptocurrency. The cost of XRP may experience significant fluctuations in the near future. It is important for investors to carefully consider the associated risks before deciding to invest in XRP.</p>

<ul><li>The judge overseeing the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple has ruled that XRP cannot be considered an investment contract.&nbsp;</li><li>Crypto leaders including Gemini’s Cameron Winklevoss and Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson congratulated Ripple for its victory.&nbsp;</li><li>XRP has gained more than 55% following the highly anticipated summary judgment by Judge Analisa Torres.&nbsp;</li><li>The judgment paves the way for crypto assets like ADA, MATIC, and SOL to be identified as non-security tokens.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The judge overseeing the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple handed a major victory to the latter earlier today after she ruled that XRP couldn’t be qualified as an investment contract. The summary judgment by New York Judge Analisa Torres cleared up the long-standing debate on whether XRP was a security. According to Judge Torres, none of XRP’s sales barring the institutional ones, can be considered securities. </p>



<h2><strong>Charles Hoskinson, Justin Sun &amp; Cameron Winklevoss Celebrate Ripple’s Victory</strong></h2>



<p>The landmark <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1679514554433257474" rel="nofollow noopener">judgment</a> by federal judge Analisa Torres prompted the most high-profile stakeholders in the crypto industry to celebrate Ripple’s victory. Congratulations poured in from leading crypto personalities, including Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and Tron founder Justin Sun. The crypto leaders highlighted the positive implications of Judge Torres’ summary judgment in the closely watched lawsuit. </p>



<p>SDNY Judge Analisa Torres ruled earlier today that Ripple’s Programmatic Sales and other distributions of XRP did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts. However, the federal judge did point out that the institutional sales of XRP constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. Hoskinson took to Twitter earlier today to acknowledge the impact of Ripple’s victory in crypto space and referred to it as a “giant leap for cryptocurrencies”. Tron founder Justin Sun also congratulated Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and his team. Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss was also among the joggers. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The sale of XRP on exchanges is NOT a security.

</div></figure>



<p> The summary judgment by Judge Torres also led to a 73% rally in XRP’s price. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.80. The summary judgment also set a key legal precedent for the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paradigm-amicus-brief-in-sec-v-bittrex/">SEC</a>’s ongoing lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, which identified several tokens including ADA, SOL, and MATIC as securities.&nbsp;These tokens had a visible uptick in their prices following the summary judgment in SEC v Ripple. </p>

<ul><li>Bitget’s monthly proof of reserves showed that it had a reserve ratio of a whopping 223%.</li><li>The crypto exchange claimed that it had no outstanding debts or liabilities and had a reserve of $1.4 billion.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange’s reserve ratios have reportedly exceeded 200% for the past seven months.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Singapore-based Bitget recently published its proof of reserves (PoR) which showed a total reserve ratio of 223%. The crypto exchange claimed that this was a new industry benchmark, with the current industry standard at 100%. The exchange also highlighted its debt-free status, claiming that its operations did not rely on loans or users’ funds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Bitget’s Reserve Ratio Exceeded 200% For Seven Months</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/13/2704386/0/en/Bitget-s-Latest-Proof-of-Reserves-Sets-New-Industry-Benchmark-with-223-Ratio.html" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by Bitget, the latest proof of reserves reflected its commitment to “radical transparency”. The crypto exchange further revealed that it was proudly debt-free and didn’t have to rely on debt or users’ funds for the platform’s transactions or investments. As per the PoR breakdown, the reserve ratio for USD Coin (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-layoffs-focus-on-core-activities/">USDC</a>) was a whopping 2604%. Bitcoin (BTC), Tether USD (USDT), and Ether (ETH) had reserve ratios of 454%, 135%, and 171%, respectively.  The exchange claimed to have consistently maintained a reserve ratio of over 200% for seven months. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Bitget has no outstanding debts or liabilities and is not listed as a creditor for any recently bankrupt companies. This enables us to efficiently cover users’ assets without depending on external bureaucracy or policy changes.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Bitget clarified that the high collateralization of certain crypto assets was due to the profit from transaction fees as well as returns on investments and acquisitions. The crypto exchange completed its registration in Lithuania in April this year. In the interest of transparency and consumer protection, the exchange plans to tap multiple audit firms to maintain the integrity of its reserves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitget also has a $300 million user protection fund, which makes up for the lack of external insurance for the platform’s users. Managing Director Gracy Chen stated that the exchange would continue to release proof of reserves and prioritize financial and technical stability to set higher standards for the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>
