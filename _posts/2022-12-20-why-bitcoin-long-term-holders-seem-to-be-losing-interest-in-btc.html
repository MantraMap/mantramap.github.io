Current market conditions hinder bullish market movements even for Bitcoin, which is arguably the king of cryptocurrencies. Recently, a crypto analyst named nino released an analysis showing that long-term Bitcoin positions are being liquidated.Â  As this develops, experts in the cryptocurrency market have warned that the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s efforts to rein in inflation through monetary tightening are unlikely to ease any time soon, thus has the potential to impact on BTC price. Warming Up For The Crypto WinterÂ  Nino used the Long Term Output Profit Ratio indicator. This measures whether long-term holders who sold their holdings are taking profit.Â  As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $16,855, down 1.9% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Nino found that after the CPI and FOMC announcements, Bitcoin values saw significant fluctuation. Soon after this occurred, the LTOPR skyrocketed. Many long-term Bitcoin holders may have cashed out their holdings at this time.

But this might increase in the next few days or months as Russia looks on the cryptocurrency market to circumvent sanctions.Â  According to a report by Newsweek, Russia is contemplating the use of cryptocurrency as the war-weary nation seeks to bolster its coffers in the face of severe Western sanctions imposed in reaction to President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s war in Ukraine.

A price close above the 50% Fib level would secure positive investor sentiment. Meanwhile, CoinGlass data also shows that investors who bought BTC are in it for the long-term with long positions are outnumbering short positions.Â
