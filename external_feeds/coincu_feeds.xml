<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Venture capital fund DWF Labs announced that it had acquired an additional $18 million in Conflux CFX tokens.</em></li>



<li><em>Conflux plans to leverage the funds raised further to drive its ecosystem growth in Asia and Hong Kong.</em></li>



<li><em>Prior to that, DFW Labs purchased $10 million worth of CFX tokens in March 2023.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DWF Labs, a Web3 venture capital organization, has announced that it recently purchased the<a href="https://coincu.com/174922-conflux-exceeds-1-2-b-token-grows-150/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> CFX token</a> of Conflux, an $18 million public chain project, cementing a long-term partnership.</strong></h5>

<p>DWF Labs, a global digital asset market maker, and multi-stage Web3 investment firm, has further strengthened its commitment to support Conflux&#8217;s growth. This investment brings DWF Labs&#8217; total investment to $28 million. The previous investment was $10 million in March of this year.</p>



<p>Since then, Conflux has established ecosystem partnerships with Floki, Worldcoin, Blockbank, Luganodes, AirDAO, Mask, and OpenEden, with a growing list of partnerships under discussion. Conflux and DWF Labs have also co-organized many events, including those held in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Paris.</p>



<p>DWF Lab is one of Conflux&#8217;s principal backers. This funding not only strengthens our relationship, but also serves as a catalyst for our shared ambition to expand the Conflux ecosystem.</p>



<p>Conflux previously said it would build a blockchain-based SIM card in partnership with China Telecom, the second-largest wireless carrier in China with an estimated $390 million subscribers. Recently, &#8216;Ethereum China&#8217; Conflux attracted attention as Hong Kong welcomed retail traders.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this year, Conflux&#8217;s market capitalization has grown from $46 million to nearly $650 million currently &#8211; making CFX one of the best performing tokens.</p>



<p>Some Asia-focused investors argue that Conflux&#8217;s indirect links to the Chinese market could position CFX as a proxy bet on the broader Asian market.</p>



<p>More recently, Conflux joined the Web3 Institute of Hong Kong, participated in the Singapore Digital Economy Roundtable hosted by the Singapore Government, and led the drafting of IEEE P3217, an international blockchain standard by the Singapore Government Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[TrueUSD's endorsement news causes a negative impact, trading at a disadvantage compared to Tether on Binance.US.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>TrueUSD&#8217;s endorsement news causes a negative impact, trading at a disadvantage compared to Tether on Binance.US.</em></li>



<li><em>Concerns arise over the audit of TrueUSD conducted by The Network Firm (formerly Armanino), which discontinued its crypto audit business.</em></li>



<li><em>Stablecoin volatility affects the market, but Bitcoin remains unaffected, trading above $30,000.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The fact that endorsement news of TrueUSD (TUSD), a dollar-pegged stablecoin, is causing a negative effect when it is trading at a disadvantage to Tether (USDT) on Binance.US, the Binance exchange&#8217;s US subsidiary.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The TUSD/USDT pair was trading at 90 cents on Binance.US at press time, having touched a low of 80 cents on Wednesday, according to data from TradingView. The pair was trading at approximately $0.9985 on Binance.</p>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/trueusds-reserves-were-attested-by-former-ftxus-accounting-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a></em>, The Network Firm, previously known as Armanino and working with former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for FTX US, audited the reserved certificate of the unstable stablecoin TrueUSD. According to the publication, The Network Firm sprang from the digital asset division of the accounting firm Armanino.</p>



<p>Armanino, an accounting company, said in December of last year that it was discontinuing its crypto audit business and leaving customers. Other industry customers thought that Armanino&#8217;s reputation risk would cast doubt on its audit findings, putting Armanino under pressure. </p>



<p>Armanino also serves as an accounting company for cryptocurrency exchanges, including Gate, OKX, and Kraken. According to reports, the audit company started providing assistance to the crypto company in 2014, offering proof of reserve audits and proof of stablecoins.</p>

<p>After the FTX affair, US investors sued Prager Metis and Armanino, FTX&#8217;s auditing company, accusing them of extortion conspiracy.</p>



<p>Stablecoin volatility, which has emerged as a financing currency over the last three years, often flows into the larger market. TUSD, with a market capitalization of $3 billion, offers less of a systemic risk to the larger market than Tether, which has a market capitalization of more than $83 billion.</p>



<p>At the moment, Bitcoin is not reacting to the news, the price of BTC is still trading above $30,000.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The NFT market showed little sign of renewed optimism in May, despite $43 million raised, the highest amount of funding since November 2022.</strong></h5>



<p>However, the amount raised outpaced actual market volume and user growth, suggesting that enthusiasm remains concentrated among venture investors. Mainstream collectors have yet to match the interest. Unique users and trading volume continue to decline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The market needs to move beyond temporary hype and speculation and attract broader participation and success across projects.</p>



<p>Data of this report was obtained from Footprint&#8217;s NFT research page. An easy-to-use dashboard containing the most vital stats and metrics to understand the NFT industry, updated in real-time, you can find all the latest about trades, projects, fundings, and more by clicking <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong>Chains &amp; Marketplaces for NFTs</strong></h3>

<li>However, in terms of unique active wallets, about 40% are on Ethereum, 34% on Polygon and 16% on Solana.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Over 70% of wash-trading takes place on x2y2, indicating that their systems and policies allow manipulative behaviour with fewer barriers.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong>NFT Investment &amp; Funding   </strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>The total amount raised in May was $43.2 million, the highest since November 2022.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Crypto Macro Overview</h1>



<p><a href="https://www.footprint.network/@KikiSmith/BTC-ETH-Decentralized-Stablecoin-Market-Analysis?date_filter=past35days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC</a> opened the month of May at $28,074, peaked on May 5 at $29,528, and turned down to $27,223 on May 31. For the month as a whole, bitcoin was down slightly by 0.5%. </p>

<p>However, BTC as a marketing indicator,  is still up more than 64% year-to-date, compared to its price of $16,605 on Jan. 1. ETH is following the same trend, down less than 1% in May, and up 58% year-to-date in 2022.</p>



<p>Market players shouldn&#8217;t have a false feeling of security as a result of the current quiet in the volatility of Bitcoin and ETH. Specifically, BTC saw a significant 13.3% drop in on-chain volume, indicating a decrease in trading activity on Bitcoin Network.</p>

<p>The Milady Maker collection was mentioned in a tweet by Elon Musk on May 10, 2023, which caused trading volume to spike to $13.95 million, sending prices soaring. The mid-month spike shows how young the NFT market is. The bigger picture can be skewed by &#8220;hot&#8221; new collections or sales that come and go quickly in terms of popularity.</p>

<p>At the beginning of May, there were more NFT buyers than sellers, with the ratio being 2:1, mostly because of some projects on Polygon as below, with a bunch of buyers and only several sellers on the secondary market.</p>

<p>According to the data of <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/nft-market/market-overview?series_date=past30days" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daily buyers &amp; sellers</a>, there are still more NFTs listed for sale than active buyers interested in buying them, indicating a potential oversupply of NFTs, not necessarily subpar collections.</p>



<p>While the NFT market has experienced fluctuations, it is still a growing industry with the potential for long-term growth and acceptance.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Chains &amp; Marketplaces for NFTs</h1>



<p>Ethereum dominates NFT volume with over 95% of the total market. However, in terms of unique active wallets, about 40% are on Ethereum, 34% on Polygon and 16% on Solana.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While still small compared to traditional markets, growing unique participation across multiple chains is a healthier sign for the NFT space than if the large majority remained concentrated on Ethereum alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/nft-market/market-overview?series_date=past30days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Footprint Analytics</a>, over 70% of wash-trading takes place on x2y2, indicating that their systems and policies allow manipulative behavior with fewer barriers &#8211; whether intentional or not, this highlights the speculative nature of the current NFT market and the need for continued progress towards transparency, trust and genuine mainstream interest.</p>

<p>After a brief period of euphoria caused by the Blur airdrop, the NFT market has now returned to a bearish state, characterised by a marked decline in speculator enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Footprint Analytics has conducted an analysis of the top 50 volume collections. This shows a decrease in the prevalence of wash trading, which can be primarily attributed to two key factors:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Speculation-driven projects</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Projects such as <em>MineablePunks</em> and <em>Terraforms by Mathcastles</em> initially gained significant trading volume based on speculation. However, these projects were based solely on hype and lacked substantial underlying value. As traders and investors realised the limited utility and long-term potential of these collections, interest waned, resulting in a loss of sustained trading activity.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Wash trading during the hype</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Wash trading played a significant role in certain collections at the height of their hype. However, as the excitement and frenzy around these collections subsided, speculators no longer found it advantageous to engage in such activity. As a result, both wash trading and overall trading volume declined. This trend was particularly evident for collections hosted on the Opensea platform(<em>Opensea collections</em>).</p>



<p>As speculators reduce their trading activity, it is expected that the prices of certain collections may take a hit. However, this period of lull in the NFT market actually fosters a healthier environment, paving the way for future prosperity.</p>



<p>In addition, the market slowdown is lowering barriers to entry, providing opportunities for genuine users and game developers to participate. With less speculative trading dominating the market, project teams can now focus on their project. This strategic shift allows them to lay the groundwork for a potential recovery in the next market cycle and attract long-term investors who value the sustainable growth and utility of NFT projects.</p>



<p>When it comes marketplaces, according to <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/nft-market/marketplaces?series_date=past30days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest data</a>, Blur is currently the leading NFT marketplace with a monthly value share of around 60%. This is followed by OpenSea with around 20% and x2y2 with around 10%.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">NFT Investment &amp; Funding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>



<p>The total amount raised in May was $43.2 million, the highest since November 2022. However, there were only 7 funding rounds, which is a relatively low number.</p>

<p>In May, two significant NFT funding with the most amount are Pudgy Penguins and AlienSwap. Pudgy Penguins raised a $9 million seed round led by 1kx to build the next great IP company.

<p>The higher amounts invested in May are a positive signal of renewed optimism, despite a slowdown in actual market activity and participation. However, sustainability depends on broader success across more projects.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Hot Topics of the Month: Bitcoin Ordinals</h1>



<p>Ordinals are a unique category of NFTs that are based on the Bitcoin network. Ordinals have seen insane growth in the few months. A <a href="https://twitter.com/Footprint_Data/status/1664320477446406144?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter Space from Footprint Analytics</a> talked about this topic.</p>



<p>It begins on January 21, 2023, when programmer and crypto enthusiast Casey Rodarmor launched the Ordinals protocol on the Bitcoin network. The innovation allows for the minting of Bitcoin NFTs. Ordinals caused a high number of Bitcoin transactions in May.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>They introduce a new dimension to digital collectibles and asset ownership by allowing users to add arbitrary data to a Bitcoin transaction and tie that data to an individual satoshi, creating a unique asset known as an ordinal. For now, it has minted over 10 million according to Footprint data.</p>



<p>The Ordinals protocol is still in its infancy, with lightweight wallet applications, NFT trading markets, and other &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; yet to be built. People still expect the future and further expansion of the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>According to reports, <a href="https://coincu.com/198056-okx-liquid-marketplace-launches-new-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OKX</a> is dedicated to improving the transparency of PoR to the traditional financial audit level in order to maintain its position as the industry leader in security and transparency.</p>



<p>It is one of the industry&#8217;s few major encryption exchanges that issue reserve certificates on a monthly basis.</p>



<p>The recent reserve ratio of 22 publicly traded coins all topped 100%, with BTC, ETH, and USDT all at 103% and a total value of $11.3 billion.</p>

<p>OKX Global Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Security, transparency and trust are the core tenets of OKX&#8217;s operating philosophy. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re committed to operating with complete transparency and providing regular PoR audits that users can independently verify. We hope that our efforts will raise the overall standard of the digital asset industry and establish new benchmarks for transparency and security.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Proof of reserves (PoR) is the process of confirming that the customer assets held by a cryptocurrency exchange or financial institution match the number of assets kept in reserve on the customers&#8217; behalf. PoR has been widely publicized as the major method for crypto investors to ensure that their assets are properly safeguarded. It&#8217;s also a crucial tool for crypto platforms since it allows them to demonstrate that they have enough assets to support transactions and withdrawals.</p>



<p>The bankruptcy of FTX and the dissolution of Three Arrows Capital both stunned the cryptocurrency sector. They called into doubt the dependability and integrity of cryptocurrency custodians.</p>



<p>A PoR audit shows that the company&#8217;s on-chain holdings are equal to the client assets recorded on the balance sheet, reassuring consumers that the business is viable and liquid enough to continue doing business with them.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2055.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="565" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2055.png" alt="OKX Released The 8th Proof Of Reserve, All Coins Exceeded 100%" class="wp-image-198399" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2055.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2055-300x166.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2055-768x424.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2055-750x414.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="OKX Released The 8th Proof Of Reserve, All Coins Exceeded 100% 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>PoR is often carried out by a third-party auditor who examines a trading platform&#8217;s assets and liabilities. The auditors want to validate the exchange&#8217;s assertions and will then publish the findings for public consumption. This theory assumes that the exchange&#8217;s digital assets kept in custody for users are backed up 1:1 by exchange-owned reserves.</p>



<p>At the moment, OKX&#8217;s PoR system has been improved using zk-STARK and other cutting-edge technology, and users may independently check OKX&#8217;s solvency at any time.</p>

<p>The transaction occurred approximately 11 hours ago, catching the attention of the crypto community.</p>

<p>The whales not only withdrew $PEPE but also executed several trades involving other cryptocurrencies. The whale sold 97,735 $LINK tokens, valued at around $592,000, and 9,883 $BNB tokens, amounting to approximately $3.01 million. These sales resulted in a loss of approximately $342,000 for the whale.</p>

<p>Following the sale of $LINK and $BNB, the whale made a strategic move by swapping all their positions for 1.93 trillion $PEPE tokens and 227 $ETH tokens, valued at around $424,000. This swap represents a significant shift in the whale&#8217;s portfolio and suggests their interest in diversifying holdings and exploring alternative investments.</p>



<p>Such large-scale transactions by whales often attract attention due to their potential impact on the market. However, it is important to note that individual transactions can be influenced by various factors, including personal investment strategies, market conditions, and the whale&#8217;s risk tolerance.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Themis Protocol was hacked, and its lending function was disabled.</em></li>



<li><em>The attacker drained around $368,000 by exploiting a faulty oracle and using Stargate Finance for fund conversion.</em></li>



<li><em>Recovery efforts and a compensation scheme are underway.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Themis Protocol reported that it had been hacked and that its lending function had been disabled.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="539" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044.png" alt="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack" class="wp-image-198371" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044-768x404.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044-750x395.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack 28"></a></figure></div>


<p>Themis Protocol is a lending platform that has had an agonizing deployment, with consumers having to wait even longer for the platform to become operational after enduring multiphased airdrops but no useable product. On June 16, the project officially went into beta on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer 2 platform.</p>



<p>On June 27, just eleven days later, the team announced that the project had expanded to over $1 million TVL in two working days. They <a href="https://twitter.com/ThemisProtocol/status/1673806486299099137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declared</a> an hour later that they would pause the procedure and launch an emergency investigation into a suspected flashloan attack. In its literature, Themis states that &#8220;security is the highest priority&#8221; of the project and references many PeckShield audits.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="542" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-1024x542.png" alt="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack" class="wp-image-198372" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-1024x542.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-300x159.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-768x406.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-750x397.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-1140x603.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045.png 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack 29"></a></figure></div>


<p>The protocol will initially attempt to work with the hacker to recover the monies. If the hacker refuses to comply, it will work with authorities to fix the situation. A compensation scheme is being prepared at the moment.</p>



<p>According to PeckShield monitoring, an attacker seems to have been able to compromise the project, draining around 220 Themis-wrapped ETH (approximately $417,000). Due to liquidity concerns, they were only able to exchange these for around 94 ETH ($178,000) and over $190,000 in stablecoins, for a total haul of approximately $368,000. According to PeckShield, the flashloan attack was caused by a faulty oracle, and the stolen monies were channeled via Stargate Finance.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bright US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) tweeted will ensure that your right to use and hold Bitcoin is not violated if elected president this year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) reaffirmed that if elected President of the United States would guarantee the inviolability of using and owning Bitcoin.</em></li>



<li><em>He said he would ensure &#8220;we have policies that support Bitcoin and free transactions.&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>Another candidate is Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who has also vowed to &#8220;defend&#8221; Bitcoin during his presidential campaign.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bright US presidential candidate <a href="https://coincu.com/197325-presidential-candidate-rfk-jr-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) </a>tweeted will ensure that your right to use and hold Bitcoin is not violated if elected president this year.</strong></h5>

<p>Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and manipulating the money supply but also points the way to a more transparent and democratic future of government institutions.&#8221;</p>



<p>An article by RFK Jr. was shared by Michael Saylor, co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy &#8220;The next President will be a pro-Bitcoin President.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since running for this candidate, there have always been pro-Bitcoin statements. Before this news on June 23, Robert Kennedy Jr. said in an interview that he would ensure that policies support Bitcoin and freedom of transactions.</p>



<p>Up to now, the list of US Presidential candidates has seen four people with views in favor of Bitcoin and crypto in general.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="880" height="400" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040.png" alt="RFK Jr. Guaranteed Right To Hold And Use Bitcoin If Elected " class="wp-image-198361" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040.png 880w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040-300x136.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040-768x349.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040-750x341.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" title="RFK Jr. Guaranteed Right To Hold And Use Bitcoin If Elected 32"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The first is <a href="https://coincu.com/179391-florida-governor-says-fed-made-digital-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ron DeSantis</a>, the governor of Florida. He has vowed to &#8220;defend&#8221; Bitcoin during his presidential campaign. He also proposed allowing businesses to pay state fees in cryptocurrency. In addition, he is an anti-Central Bank CBDC and has enacted legislation banning the use of CBDCs by federal and foreign governments.</p>



<p>The second is Mr. RFK Jr., as mentioned above. Third is Vivek Ramaswamy, the founder of the pharmaceutical company, who has also announced his support for cryptocurrency and said he would accept campaign donations in Bitcoin. And recently, a fourth name has also appeared, Francis X. Suarez, mayor of Miami. He is best known as the &#8220;Bitcoin Mayor&#8221;.</p>



<p>This new industry requires leaders to pay closer attention as needs such as identifying the potential and driving the development of crypto become increasingly apparent. Candidates like Mr. DeSantis could spark innovation and boost the economy, cementing America&#8217;s lead in the market.</p>



<p>Candidates DeSantis and RFK Jr. have a favorable view of crypto regardless of political views. As the presidential race draws closer, crypto&#8217;s role will certainly increasingly influence candidates&#8217; backgrounds. At that time, American citizens must consider the truth before voting for any candidate to develop the crypto market to its potential.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>European Union regulators have expressed concerns that Binance may be engaging in illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="575" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-1024x575.jpeg" alt="Binance Faces Accusations of False Reporting in Ireland and Malta" class="wp-image-198357" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-1024x575.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-768x431.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-750x421.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-1140x640.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Faces Accusations of False Reporting In Ireland and Malta 33"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>These concerns have been raised due to its operations within Ireland and Malta being particularly difficult to track, despite claiming to employ dozens of employees. Revenue streams are unexplained or explained by “consultancy services” according to official records, and the companies don’t have an active and operational space other than their registered address — which are shared with other companies. In some cases, officials believe BNB is inflating registered employee headcounts by conflating the figure with contractual services to freelancers, whose job is mainly of a promotional nature.</p>



<p>Binance has been accused of commingling funds from revenue streams of different countries to avoid raising the eyebrows of regulators and tax authorities. European investigators have stated that BNB may be faking its accounts and operations in several EU jurisdictions. There are concerns that Binance is obfuscating illicit activity, which is why financial regulators in several EU jurisdictions received requests for information on BNB by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even before the agency charged the crypto exchange earlier this month.</p>

<p>Despite BNB&#8217;s claims to be operating in various countries in Europe, including in France, Ireland, Malta, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, and Lithuania, several European countries are conducting their own investigations into BNB on suspicions of local wrongdoing. In 2018, Binance announced that it was to set up its European headquarters in Malta and set up two companies. Then it changed track and set up three other companies in Ireland, announcing its European headquarters would be there. Eventually, it settled on Paris, France for its EU HQ and received a license to act as a digital asset provider in the country.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s headquarters in Paris was recently raided by police in a European-wide investigation over aggravated money laundering. In addition, Belgium’s financial regulator ordered Binance to stop its services in the country. As a result, Binance is expected to face more legal challenges with other EU countries in the coming months.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[FTX has filed a lawsuit against a former regulatory and compliance officer at the exchange, Dan Friedberg.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX sues former officer Friedberg over bribery allegations.</em></li>



<li><em>Friedberg, known for past poker scandals, was implicated in FTX deception.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX CEO investigates and seeks to recover funds; report points to his role.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FTX has <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/ExternalCall-DownloadPDF?id1=MTU0MDA0Mw==&amp;id2=0&amp;cid=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against a former regulatory and compliance officer at the exchange, Dan Friedberg, saying he conducted a series of bribes to keep employees from reporting difficulties at the exchange.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="980" height="551" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036.png" alt="Former FTX Compliance Officer Dan Friedberg Accused Of Bribes: Report" class="wp-image-198348" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036.png 980w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" title="Former FTX Compliance Officer Dan Friedberg Accused Of Bribes: Report 35"></a></figure></div>


<p>Lawyer Friedberg, whose image was tainted by the greatest online poker scam a decade ago, may also be involved in deceptions perpetrated by collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Friedberg worked at UltimateBet during the company&#8217;s super-user cheating scandal and subsequent downfall, and he was captured on film supporting Russ Hamilton in his efforts to rescue the situation. Until recently, he was the Compliance Officer for FTX US and the general counsel for Alameda Research, a link that only became widely known in the poker community when the firm filed for bankruptcy in November 2021.</p>



<p>FTX filed a lawsuit against Daniel Friedberg on June 27. According to the lawsuit, Friedberg worked as a fixer for the exchange&#8217;s co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, making hush money payments to two possible whistleblowers to prevent them from releasing information regarding regulatory difficulties, and FTX&#8217;s claimed strong relationships with Alameda Research.</p>

<p>As Bankman-Fried awaits trial on allegations of fraud and other offenses, the company&#8217;s new CEO, John J. Ray III, is heading an inquiry and seeking to retrieve as much investor money as possible. Ray&#8217;s most recent interim report, released on June 26, exposes the role of &#8220;a top FTX Group attorney&#8221; in alleged deceptions by the company&#8217;s leadership.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The FTX Senior Executives did not commingle and misuse customer deposits by accident. Commingling and misuse occurred at their direction, and by their design. Bankman- Fried, with the assistance of a senior FTX Group attorney (“Attorney-1”) and others, lied to banks and auditors, executed false documents, and moved the FTX Group from jurisdiction to jurisdiction… to enable and avoid detection of their wrongdoing,&#8221; the report wrote.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/senior-attorney-helped-ftx-founder-misuse-customer-funds-report-says-7180ae25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that &#8220;Attorney-1&#8221; is Friedberg, citing people familiar with the situation. The report, for example, mentions Attorney-1 sending a $1 million incentive to a lawyer and former government official in the Bahamas. According to the <em>WSJ</em>&#8216;s source, Friedberg paid this payment.</p>



<p>FTX issued 11 civil allegations in the 40-page petition, alleging, among other things, that Friedberg disregarded his legal obligations and facilitated a series of fraudulent transfers and loans to other former FTX executives.</p>



<p>Friedberg allegedly received a $300,000 salary, a $1.4 million signing bonus, and 8% stock in FTX US during his 22-month tenure at the exchange, all of which FTX is attempting to recoup, according to the lawsuit.</p>



<p>According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, the creators of cryptocasino Stake <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2490279b-9c94-49a8-beff-cbd7c3307586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talked</a> with Friedberg about their concept. Stake, on the other hand, has denied any link to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really crazy that Apple will unilaterally block you from running the software you want on your own device. One of the most disrespectful parts of their culture, and it&#8217;s damaging to their brand.&#8221; CEO Brian Armstrong commented on Twitter.</p>



<p>Yesterday, William Casarin, founder of Damus, an open social app based on the Nostr protocol, tweeted that Damus will be removed from the App Store on Tuesday for violating Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase rules.</p>



<p>He said that while we&#8217;ve updated the app and clarified that users won&#8217;t unlock any digital content after paying, it will still be removed from the App Store.</p>



<p>The app said it would appeal because the rule had been abused and misapplied. Damus was launched on the App Store earlier this year but was ordered by Apple to be removed from the shelves on June 13 because of its &#8220;zaps&#8221; function (a unique function of Damus that allows users to send small amounts of bitcoin to content creators through the Lightning Network, similar to tweets).</p>

<p>Apple says it doesn&#8217;t allow zaps on its platform because they &#8220;may&#8221; be used by content creators to sell digital content. Apple then said it spoke with Damus and agreed on how Damus&#8217; hits will survive on the platform.</p>



<p>Damus is a decentralized social media platform running on the Nostr protocol, which is quite popular with bitcoins. One of the reasons for its popularity is that most Nostr implementations support payments over the blockchain&#8217;s Lightning Network. Lightning is Bitcoin&#8217;s second-layer payment network allowing faster transactions and lower transaction fees.</p>
