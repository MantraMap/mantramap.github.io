<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum Classic is up 18% in the week</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The network has witnessed an increased hash rate</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum Classic still faces bear pressure at $19</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum Classic (ETC/USD) has been of bull interest in the last two days. Despite losing by an intraday 1% on Friday, it was still up 18% in the week. A majority of these gains happened on January 04, 2023. The gains pushed the cryptocurrency above a crucial descending trendline that has contained ETC for a while. But how far can ETC gains continue?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum Classic was tipped for success when Ethereum <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ethereum-finally-migrates-to-a-proof-of-stake-after-completing-the-merge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shifted to the Proof of Stake</u></a> protocol. Ethereum Classic is itself a Proof of Work protocol. Thus, Ethereum&rsquo;s shift, also known as the Merge, was expected to push PoW miners to Ethereum Classic. Although initially boosting the price, ETC later crashed as the speculations waned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The latest ETC gains reignite hopes of miner activity on Ethereum Classic. While the hash rate went downward in December 2022, it started to gain momentum toward the new year. The hash rate improved from 97.5975 TH/s on December 27 to 111.7497 TH/s on December 30, according to CoinWarz data. That could indicate increased miner activity and ETC transactions which boosted prices after the new year. But buyers may need to exercise caution at the current price level.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Bullish ETC still facing bearish pressure despite breakout</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">A technical outlook shows momentum has increased strongly for ETC. The MACD indicator is attempting to break above the neutral zone. However, bears are trying to force a correction after ETC reached resistance at $19.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What to do with ETC?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Despite breaking above the descending trendline, ETC is facing a correction. The price is yet to trade above the previous high.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A break above the $19 resistance is the needed validation to consider further upsides. Investors should only&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum-classic/buy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buy ETC</u></a> if it recovers above $19 with a confirmed bullish momentum. At the current price, ETC still faces a slump back to the $14 bottom price.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Binance coin has been bearish since the FTX collapse&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency trades on an upside at $255&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">BNB faces resistance at $266, a crucial resistance level</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">While 2022 was largely bearish for almost every cryptocurrency, Binance (BNB/USD) was relatively stable. That&rsquo;s not to mean that the cryptocurrency was bullish, but at least bears did not run riot as they did for most <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrencies</u></a>. It helped BNB hold strengths. At one time before the collapse of FTX, BNB neared the $400 price level. Since then, BNB has remained bearish. What happened?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The collapse of FTX ignited fears that no crypto exchange was too big to fail. Investors rushed to decentralised exchanges that benefited from huge outflows from centralised peers. Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest centralised crypto exchange, was among the culprits of the shift. That sent the native token BNB tumbling to $220 by mid-Dec.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further fears were heightened by Binance&rsquo;s proof of reserves. As CoinJournal <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/will-this-worrying-binances-proof-of-reserves-crash-bnb-further/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>, an audit report raised questions showing that the exchange was not sufficiently collateralised. BNB has been suffering in the aftermath, although the latest recoveries are promising.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>BNB is facing resistance at $266 after recent recoveries</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/06/1673038949867-a6553cea-237b-4076-92fc-594d5450c262.png" width="600" height="313" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BNBUSDT/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BNB/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">BNB is mildly bullish on the daily chart. A bullish MACD crossover was initiated, supporting an improved momentum for the cryptocurrency. However, the MACD indicator is bearish. Bulls are yet to close above the neutral zone, which separates the bullish and bearish momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">BNB also trades below the resistance at $266. This is the level bulls defended strongly before the FTX-inspired crash. Therefore, the level is a key test for the bulls.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>BNB price action next</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">A continuation of the current recovery could see BNB return to its former self and turn $266 into support. For this to happen, bulls must overcome the resistance and break higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the flip side, bears will try to position themselves as the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/#:~:text=What%20is%20BNB%20price%20today,trading%20volume%20of%20%24381.11M." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BNB price</u></a> reaches $266. Already, there is some resistance developing below the resistance zone. A failed breakout will see bears try to force a correction. That could see BNB continue to consolidate below before buyers have another chance.</p>

</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Near Protocol (NEAR/USD) ended 2022 on a low note. At just $1.26 on December 31 2022, NEAR is among the worst-performing&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrencies</u></a>, having started the year above $16. The selloff in the cryptocurrency accelerated in November 2022 post-FTX collapse. Investors earmarked the cryptocurrency after reports showed FTX had invested in Near Protocol tokens for nearly $50 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But as 2023 kicked off, investors have been accumulating the Near Protocol tokens. With a surge of nearly 20% in the past week, NEAR is one of the top-gaining cryptocurrencies. That is underlined by a huge buy-side volume spike as the token bottomed at $1.25. The spike saw NEAR hit $1.65.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>NEAR price outlook and analysis amid increased bullish pressure</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/06/1673037657332-3c1364b6-a9a2-40c4-8f3b-029761f1a2cc.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="315"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NEARUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>NEAR/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The daily chart outlook shows NEAR trading at the descending trendline. The cryptocurrency has been trading on a system of lower lowers and lower highs. The token has retraced at the descending trendline, with the volume indicators showing the entry of bears.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Will NEAR sustain the gains?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are no clear indicators for the recent surge in&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/near-protocol/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>NEAR price</u></a>. It could be due to investors spotting an opportunity as the price crashed following the collapse of FTX.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From the price action and technical indicators, NEAR is still bearish and may not sustain gains. Bears are beginning to gain control of price as it hits the descending trendline. With the bear market showing little signs of abating, the recovery could be hard to come for NEAR. Buying the token on a confirmed uptrend is recommended.</p>

<p dir="ltr">XRP has stalled for the last 3 weeks</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The price has been tied to the crypto sentiment and case with SEC</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Garlinghouse expects a &ldquo;breakthrough&rdquo; in crypto regulation in 2023</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/what-is-ripple/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ripple</u></a> (XRP/USD) trades around $0.33, a level it started for 2023. The cryptocurrency has held the price zone for the past three weeks. Bulls recovered quickly as the price slid to $0.30 on January 2. But still, the upside remains limited. What holds for XRP this year?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Well, much is expected for cryptocurrencies this year after a disastrous 2022. A possible improvement in the macro situation will definitely boost the price, although this looks unlikely in the first quarter. For XRP, Ripple&rsquo;s case with the US SEC will be an additional factor. While there have been glimpses of Ripple&rsquo;s success, the crypto community still remains unsettled over the outcome. For Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, 2023 carries some optimism. But as he advises, it needs caution.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Garlinghouse is not new to throwing punches at the US regulator since the case against Ripple started. Taking to Twitter to share views about crypto in 2023, Garlinghouse believes it is time for regulatory clarity on crypto in the US. Without referring to the pending case with the SEC, the Ripple CEO says it is time to define &ldquo;security&rdquo; in the digital asset sector. He still believes the US stands a chance if regulations come fast, and 2023 could be the year of a &ldquo;breakthrough.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But as the XRP classification case drags on, there is no notable price change as the outlook reflects caution. Still, the latest price action may excite buyers.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>XRP stalls above the $0.31 support</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/06/1673020201530-7e6ffeb1-e02b-4d15-b547-3553297e232c.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="318"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>XRP/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">A technical outlook shows bulls have successfully defended $0.31 support. An interesting highlight was when a strong bullish pin bar formed as the price slid below the support. The formation of the pin bar underlined that buyers quickly arrested the price drop and stabilised it. However, momentum is weak, with the MACD remaining bearish.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What next for XRP?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/#:~:text=What%20is%20XRP%20price%20today,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>XRP price</u></a> may struggle further, but buyers will be observant if prices approach $0.31. The level is a clear buying zone to watch.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Decentralisation is how blockchain should be used</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Kosala Hemachandra, CEO of MyEtherWallet, told Cointelegraph in a&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts" rel="nofollow"><u>recent interview</u></a>, that he believes blockchain technology should be used for decentralised purposes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the CEO, creating centralised products defeats the purpose of using&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/blockchain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>blockchain technology</u></a>. He said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Blockchain, at its core, is a decentralised solution, so why would we create products that are centralised? Because we are defeating the whole purpose of using blockchain.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Self-custody has been gaining traction in the cryptocurrency space since the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/this-week-in-crypto-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>collapse of the FTX crypto exchange</u></a> two months ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">MyEtherWallet remains one of the oldest noncustodial wallets in the Ethereum ecosystem. According to the CEO, the wallet went live roughly two weeks after the Ethereum mainnet launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">He added that the company continues to operate as a decentralised wallet because it believes it is the only proper way to use blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>MyEtherWallet not planning to do an airdrop soon</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Hemachandra revealed that MyEtherWallet is not planning to do an airdrop or launch its token soon. The CEO said the company doesn&rsquo;t see any use case for their own tokens at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the company is working on certain features to enable it to compete with Meta Mask, another leading Ethereum-focused wallet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MyEtherWallet will be adding support for more blockchain networks, and it recently launched a multichain browser extension. The CEO revealed that MyEtherWallet recorded a surge in users following the FTX saga as users look for decentralised solutions to storing their assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the moment, MyEtherWallet has more than three million users, most of them in the United States and Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The hawkish Fed minutes led to more concerns about the industry.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Tron, VIDT, and Huobi Token will likely dive during the weekend.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrency prices remained on edge in the first week of the year. Bitcoin remained in a consolidation phase below $17,000. Ethereum remained stuck at $1,200 while the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies remained below $900 billion. Here is the crypto price predictions for some of the top trending coins like Tron, Huobi Token, and VIDT.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Tron&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Tron is a second-generation blockchain project that was started by Justin Sun. It is a blockchain operating system that handles billions of transactions on a daily basis. The network is also associated with other blockchain projects like Sun, JustLend, and JustStables. Also, it has an association with Huobi, BitTorrent Chain, and USDD.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TRX price crashed hard as concerns of its exposure to Huobi continued. There are concerns that Huobi could go out of business. As a result, Tron dropped to the lowest level since November 23. It has moved below all moving averages while oscillators like the MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) drifted downwards. Therefore, the outlook of TRX during the weekend is bearish, with the next key support level to watch being at &nbsp;$0.04.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Huobi Token</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Huobi Token (HT) came under pressure after the company announced a new round of layoffs. As we wrote in this&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/is-huobi-safe-why-customers-should-be-withdrawing-funds/"><u>article</u></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>there are concerns about the company&rsquo;s liquidity. After the collapse of FTX, there are questions about&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/compare/best-cryptocurrency-exchanges/"><u>crypto exchanges</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and their respective tokens. Huobi has not published its reserve data and its results.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a result, it has seen outflows in the past few days. Data compiled by DeFi Llama showed that users have withdrawn over $114 million in the past month and $90 million in the past 24 hours. Therefore, the Hubi Token price will likely continue falling during the weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">VIDT price crashed to an all-time low in 2022 as concerns about its role in the blockchain industry emerged. It also dropped as demand for NFTs declined. This week, however, VIDT price rose to a high of $0.030, the highest point since December 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the hourly chart, it has moved above its moving averages while the MACD moved above the neutral point. With volume being low, I suspect that the VIDT price will plunge during the weekend.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin price has been in a consolidation phase in the past few weeks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The US will publish the latest non-farm payrolls (NFP) data.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Strong jobs numbers will be bearish for BTC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> price has been in a tight range in the past few months. BTC/USD has remained between last month&rsquo;s low of about 16,285 and a high of 18,455. Bitcoin has dropped by more than 22% from the highest level in November.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">US non-farm payrolls data</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> price has been in a consolidation phase in the past few weeks. The next key catalyst for the BTC price will be the upcoming American jobs data. Economists surveyed by Reuters believe that the economy added more than 200k jobs while the unemployment rate remained at 3.7%. If analysts are accurate, it means that the economy added millions of jobs in 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They also expect the data to show that the country&rsquo;s wages held steady in December. The average hourly earnings are expected to have risen by 5.0% while the participation rate remained at 62.1%. These numbers will come a day after ADP published strong jobs numbers. They showed that the economy added 235k jobs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Stocks open lower after jobs data showed the labor market is still strong" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GqgO7xAzBdQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">US jobs numbers have an impact on Bitcoin prices because they tend to influence the Federal Reserve. The Fed has a dual mandate to ensure that inflation and unemployment rate are steady. It tends to hike rates when inflation is rising. In 2022, the bank hiked rates by 450 basis points.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The NFP payrolls data will come two days after the Federal Reserve published minutes of the past meeting. These minutes revealed that the Fed was considering hiking interest rates in 2023 in a bid to bring inflation lower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All signs are that inflation is easing. In December, inflation data showed that consumer prices dropped to 7.3% in November. With gasoline prices and natural gas prices falling, there is a likelihood that inflation eased.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin price will likely drop if the US publishes strong jobs data because it will mean that the Fed will continue hiking rates.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?exchange=BITSTAMP"><u>BTC chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The four-hour chart showed that Bitcoin has been in a consolidation phase in the past few weeks. As a result, it has remained at 25-day and 50-day moving averages. It is also moved slightly above the Woodie pivot point while the Average True Range (ATR) has pointed downwards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, Bitcoin will likely remain in this range in the coming days as investors wait for the upcoming US inflation data. The key level to watch will be at $15,800.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Cryptocurrency industry was valued close to $3 trillion entering 2022, now it is $800 billion&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">There are 73% less Bitcoin millionaires after 2022</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin has pulled back 75% from its all-time high fo close to $69,000</li>
<li dir="ltr">25% of the bitcoin supply was in a loss entering the year, now it is over 50%</li>
<li dir="ltr">Number of investors holding greater than 1 BTC jumped 20% as the hurdle became much more attainable</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once upon a time, the cryptocurrency market was valued at $3 trillion. To be precise, this was in November 2021, when <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> traded at its all-time high of close to $69,000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But then along came 2022. Inflation sparked as a result of the COVID money printing, war in Ukraine and supply chain issues, meaning central banks worldwide were forced to hike rates to curtail a spiralling cost-of-living crisis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the cheap liquidity pulled out from under markets, Bitcoin &ndash; and crypto as a whole &ndash; felt the pinch. We have seen top 10 cryptocurrencies collapse, one of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/compare/best-cryptocurrency-exchanges/"><u>top exchanges</u></a> revealed to be a house of cards and numerous other bankruptcies and scandals.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The loss has been greater than $2 trillion, with Bitcoin shedding three-quarters of its value as at the time of writing, trading at $16,800.</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12355643">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin millionaires</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Looking at on-chain data from bitinfocharts.com, Bitcoin millionaires have dropped like flies. Entering 2022, there were 90,000 addresses containing over a million dollars worth of Bitcoin. Today, it is 24,000 &ndash; that amounts to a fall of 73%.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;The on-chain data sums up what is glaringly obvious from looking at a Bitcoin price chart &ndash; that the party is over and investors are no longer dreaming of retirement off their Bitcoin holdings, in the near future at least! Nearly three-quarters of Bitcoin millionaires losing that status is perhaps the best piece of data of all to summarise how ugly 2022 was for investors&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>said Max Coupland, Director at CoinJournal.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Percent in supply in loss doubles in 2022</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin&rsquo;s returns before 2022 were astonishing. As a result, the bulk of the supply was in profit, with only 25% of the supply loss-making entering the year. By year-end, this had doubled to over 50% &ndash; another stunning statistic when considering that Bitcoin was the best-performing asset class in the world over the prior decade.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12356431">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2 dir="ltr">Addresses holding greater than 1 BTC</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On the flipside, with Bitcoin being so cheap compared to last year, the number of addresses containing one Bitcoin or greater &ndash; &ldquo;whole coiners&rdquo;, as they are known &ndash; is at all-time high, even if the dollar value contained in those addresses is way down.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12355736">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Entering 2022, there were over 814,000 addresses holding more than 1 BTC. By the end of the year, this number was over 978,000 &ndash; that is a rise of 20%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As can be seen when zooming in on 2022 on the below chart, there were significant jumps when Bitcoin plunged off the back of the three major scandals of 2022 &ndash; Luna&rsquo;s death spiral, Celsius&rsquo; insolvency and the revelations of fraud at FTX.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12355775">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2 dir="ltr">Dropping sentiment matching falling prices</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Perhaps the biggest problem emerging from 2022 is related to these scandals. The reputation of crypto has taken a hammer blow, most notably with the shocking downfall of FTX and disgraced former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a CNBC survey as of November 2022, only 8% of Americans now have a positive view of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto investors have seen similar percentage declines before, of course, only for the market to bounce back. But this time, crypto is fighting against a pullback in the wider economy for the first time in its history.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Until now, it had been zero (or negative) interest rates and a warm money printer. Now, we have transitioned to a new environment, and crypto investors are feeling the pain. They will hope that 2023 can bring a return to prominence and start mending the reputation of the wounded asset class.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Crypto exchange Huobi is reportedly laying off 20% of its workforce and has requested employees take their salaries in stablecoins</li>
<li>Internal communication has reportedly been suspended in order to quell discontent</li>
<li>Customers are pulling their funds from the exchange, while volume is down 23%</li>
<li>Its native token has fallen 10%. Reports had previously singled out Huobi as the exchange which relies the most on its native token to denominate its reserves</li>
<li>While there is no concrete evidence of anything untoward happening with customer reserves, investors would be wise to withdraw the funds until the dust settles, given what else has transpired in the crypto industry over the last year</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s groundhog day in crypto. Yet another centralised <a href="https://coinjournal.net/compare/best-cryptocurrency-exchanges/">crypto exchange</a> is coming another fire, this time Huobi.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What is happening Huobi?</strong></h2>
<p>Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, who is the founder of cryptocurrency <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/tron/">Tron</a> and also sits on Huobi&rsquo;s board, announced that the exchange was to lay off about 20% of its workforce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further reports claimed that in addition to a dramatic reduction of the workforce, employees were required to take their salaries in stablecoins, while internal communication channels were shut in order to quell discontent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the story is still emerging, this is obviously&hellip;not good. Many ominous screenshots of employees trying to get into systems and communicate with one another were being shared all over Twitter. Reports emerged, understandably, that employees were enraged that should they refuse to accept their salaries in stablecoins, they would be dismissed.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Justin Sun's HR is communicating with all Huobi employees to change the salary form from fiat currency to USDT/USDC; employees who cannot accept it may be dismissed. The move sparked protests from some employees. Exclusive <a href="https://t.co/QB4sjDyHc7">https://t.co/QB4sjDyHc7</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1610615698254102529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><strong>Funds leave Huobi swiftly</strong></h2>
<p>The market waited no time in reacting. While there is no confirmed evidence of anything wrong with Huobi&rsquo;s reserves or solvency, it has been a rough year for crypto investors and the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-insolvent-what-next-for-crypto/">demise of FTX</a> and Sam Bankman-Fried is all-too-raw for so many.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, funds were pulled swiftly from Huobi. The below chart from DefiLlama shows the USD outflows picking up. Since December 15<sup>th</sup>, when it received $87.9 million in USD inflows, there has been over $200 million of outflows. $75.1 million of these outflows has been I the last 24 hours.&nbsp;<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/06/1672998646215-210d9d44-1244-4624-bb4e-d8546efd1dd2.jpg" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="363"></p>
<p>&nbsp;During the last 24 hours, volume on the exchange is also down 23% to $295 million from $510 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huobi&rsquo;s exchange token is also feeling the pain. Crypto investors will be particularly sensitive to these native tokens, given FTT&rsquo;s role in the FTX collapse and the fact that it has become increasingly obvious that so many simply serve minimal purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Huobi token has halved since late October. It is down over 10% in the last 24 hours or so since the story of Huobi layoffs emerged.&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12364327">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2><strong>Is Huobi safe to hold assets on?</strong></h2>
<p>While drama about layoffs, employee discontent and falls in volume is concerning, this should not have any effect on the safety of Huobi. At least, in theory it shouldn&rsquo;t. But this is crypto, and if this year has taught us anything, it is that things are often not as they appear.</p>
<p>As I have <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/what-is-next-for-crypto-proof-of-reserves-is-not-helping-this-mess/">written about repeatedly</a>, transparency is abhorrent when it comes to these centralised crypto players. There is simply no way to know for sure what is going on behind the scenes at any of them.</p>
<p>The presence of an exchange token also muddies the water. Is this token being accepted as collateral for liabilities? Again, there is no evidence to suggest it is, but there is also no evidence to suggest it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Looking at data from blockchain analytics platform Nansen, Huobi&rsquo;s native token makes up 32% of its total allocation, while Justin Sun&rsquo;s TRX token comprises an additional 17%. A report from CryptoQuant also shows that of all the exchanges, Huobi relies the most on its own token to denominate its reserves.</p>
<p>Again, while there is no evidence to suggest anything untoward is happening here, the influence of a native token definitely muddies the water.</p>
<h2><strong>Customers making right call in withdrawing funds</strong></h2>
<p>With the doubt on the platform and the recent chaos in the crypto industry last year, it makes perfect sense that customers are pulling their funds. Similar to how such a large chunk of funds <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/a-net-flow-of-200000-bitcoins-leaves-exchanges-following-ftx-collapse-as-trust-broken/">were pulled</a> from exchanges in the wake of the FTX collapse, this is simply sound risk management.</p>
<p>If Huobi is perfectly safe and all returns to normal &ndash; and again, there is nothing concrete to suggest it won&rsquo;t &ndash; then customers can simply deposit their funds back onto the platform. But this is an unregulated, opaque entity that is impossible to make any sort of financial assessment on. That means it is a risk, and with all the madness of the last 24 hours, it would be a questionable move from a risk management perspective to not at least temporarily pull funds and wait until the dust settles.</p>
