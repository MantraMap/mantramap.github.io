<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Circle has adjusted its USDC-backed reserve portfolio to support short-term US Treasuries, thereby avoiding the possibility of a US debt contract breach.</em></li>



<li><em>The Circle Reserve Fund is managed by BlackRock, which no longer holds Treasuries that mature after the beginning of June.</em></li>



<li><em>Tuesday&#8217;s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling hike failed to break the deadlock, and the United States could be forced into an unprecedented default in three weeks.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Circle CEO, which issues<a href="https://news.coincu.com/185705-circle-usdc-circulation-decreased/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> USDC stablecoins</a>, Jeremy Allaire, said in an interview that Circle had adjusted its USDC-backed reserve portfolio to support short-term US Treasuries, which avoids the possibility of breaching the US debt contract. Allaire said the company no longer holds Treasuries that mature after early June.</strong></h5>

<p>According to information disclosed by the Circle Reserve Fund managed by BlackRock, the bonds currently held by the reserve fund will expire at the latest on May 31. The issuer of the largest stablecoin reported on Wednesday. that they have increased their holdings of US Treasuries to $53 billion. Its Treasury bill holdings have an average maturity of less than 90 days. As of Wednesday, USDC has a market capitalization of around $30 billion, according to CoinGecko.</p>



<p>The vulnerability of Circle&#8217;s reserves to external shocks came into the spotlight in March when USDC temporarily lost its 1-to-1 ratio to the dollar following the news suggested that $3.3 billion in reserves used to support stablecoins were held at the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. Since then, the token has been stable.</p>

<p>It is reported that face-to-face negotiations between US President Joe Biden and top congressional officials over raising the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling on Tuesday failed to break the deadlock, and the United States could be forced into an unprecedented default in three weeks. However, Biden and leading members of Congress will meet again on Friday to continue discussions, and both sides insist that the United States will not default.</p>

<p>Early this morning, a Twitter user said he had received an Arkham alert indicating that the &#8220;US government address transferred 9819 bitcoins&#8221;. This immediately caused the community to shake. The price of BTC at that time plummeted from $28,200 to $26,900.</p>



<p>Previously, the US government sold 9,861 BTC on March 14, earning $ 216 million at that time, with a selling price of around $21,800. The US has to pay the fee when making a sale transaction amounting to more than 215,000 USD.</p>



<p>The above BTC is part of a 50,000 Bitcoin sum confiscated by US authorities from James Zhong, who has admitted to hacking and stealing assets from Silk Road, the notorious Internet black market that they shut down. Notably, the US government intends to liquidate the remaining 41,500 BTC in four more sales in 2023.</p>



<p>However, ZachXBT, data firm Arkham and on-chain detectives confirmed that bitcoins held by the US government had not been transferred. Now, KOL has deleted the related tweets and says that the Arkham warning they received earlier was a personal error flag. This caused the BTC price to have a slight recovery toward the $27,500 region,</p>

<p>Arkham has made a false announcement before. Earlier, on the evening of April 26, the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization in the world surged sharply, from $28,900 to $30,000. But a few hours later, this on-chain data statistics unit issued a warning about the transactions of transferring nearly $ 28 million in Bitcoin of the Jump Trading investment fund to several major exchanges. Bitcoin slid to 27,235 USD on the Binance exchange.</p>

<p>The largest of the claims are a $20.4 billion and a $7.9 billion claim against Alameda Research LLC, along with two claims totaling $9.5 billion against Alameda Research Holdings Inc. </p>

<p>These claims are classified as &#8220;Admin Priority,&#8221; which could allow the IRS&#8217; claims to take precedence over the claims of other creditors in a bankruptcy case. According to bankruptcy documents, the $20.4 billion claim against Alameda Research LLC is primarily for partnership taxes, while the remaining amount includes millions in withheld income taxes and payroll taxes.</p>



<p>While the IRS has warned crypto investors to pay their taxes for years, this is the first time the agency has pursued a crypto exchange on such a scale. The outcome of this case will have far-reaching implications for the crypto industry. Whether other regulators will follow the IRS&#8217; lead remains to be seen.</p>



<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States after its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, made a series of large donations to political campaigns. Bankman-Fried has since stated that the donations were unrelated to FTX and that the exchange remains financially sound. </p>

<p>Marathon Digital Holdings, a Bitcoin mining company, has disclosed in a recent filing that it received another subpoena from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to an investigation of a Montana data center that may involve potential violations of securities laws.</p>



<p> Marathon stated that it is cooperating with the SEC. This is the second subpoena the company has received, following one during the quarter that ended Sept. 30, 2021, asking to produce documents and communications concerning the Hardin, Montana, data center facility.</p>



<p>In February, the Las Vegas-based company restated its annual report and said it had found accounting errors in financial statements for several quarters after receiving comments from the SEC. Despite these issues, Marathon is one of the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded crypto-mining companies with computing power, with facilities across the US.</p>



<p>The stock of Marathon has been closely correlated with Bitcoin as the company holds a large amount of digital assets on its balance sheet. The shares have been considered a proxy for the cryptocurrency for those who want to get exposure to the coin without holding it directly. The stock has almost tripled this year to around $10 but fell almost 90% in 2022 as crypto prices tumbled.</p>



<p>This latest subpoena from the SEC highlights the regulatory scrutiny faced by crypto companies, especially those involved in mining. It also emphasizes the need for companies in the industry to have robust compliance practices to avoid legal and financial issues.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Some crypto miners are turning to AI.</em></li>



<li><em>Crypto miners generate revenue in part thanks to AI customers.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI is still a potential to be mined in many areas, it can be stated that the cryptocurrency mining industry has changed as crypto miners have diverged after the Ethereum revolution last September, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-10/ether-crypto-miners-woo-artificial-intelligence-ai-with-gpu-chips-services#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-429.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-429.png" alt="AI Makes Crypto Mining More Advantageous: Report" class="wp-image-186631" title="AI Makes Crypto Mining More Advantageous: Report 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>Companies that utilized and hosted GPUs, or graphics processing units, saw a significant portion of their once-thriving company disappear against the background of an increasingly challenging crypto environment.</p>



<p>Some cryptocurrency miners are turning to artificial intelligence. Hut 8 reported that after only one year of existence, its HPC division produced over $16.9 million in sales in 2022, fueled in part by AI clients. Hive Blockchain, which spent $66 million on GPUs in early 2021, plans to increase its HPC income to $10 million by 2024.</p>



<p>Hut 8 Chief Executive Officer Jaime Leverton said in an interview:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“If you can reapply some of that investment in the GPU mining infrastructure and convert it to new cards and workloads, it makes sense.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Not all cryptocurrency miners are in a position to profit from the AI hype or the surplus of pricey chips on hand. According to Bitpro Consulting, which provides mining brokerage services, 5% to 15% of current crypto-oriented GPUs may be repurposed for artificial intelligence and related applications like computer vision and generative graphic design.</p>



<p>Core Scientific, the biggest publicly traded Bitcoin miner by processing power, declared bankruptcy last year, and many miners have warned of liquidity problems. Yet, there might be an opportunity for miners to reclaim the $15 billion Bitpro estimates they spent on processors.</p>



<p>Machine learning may infuse much-needed efficiency into various economic sectors, from hospitality to investment banking too, most notably, cryptocurrencies, in addition to boosting intellectual progress.</p>



<p>When crypto and artificial intelligence combine their powers, they will really be a force to be reckoned with. It has the potential to remove friction from the crypto user experience, resulting in a truly smooth end-to-end Web3 trip.</p>



<p>There will be no more clumsy transaction approval procedures or switching between programs. Artificial intelligence will automate the time-consuming background processes of crypto protocols, allowing users to have a one-click experience similar to Amazon&#8217;s.</p>



<p>According to Ethan Vera, chief operations officer of Luxor Technologies Inc., a Bitcoin-miner products and services firm, miners may find it difficult to compete with big data services providers such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services.</p>



<p>AI customers may already access widely used tools, systems, and support professionals on these platforms. Yet, miners&#8217; skills in energy management may provide them an advantage, considering that artificial intelligence, like crypto mining, requires a lot of energy.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Elon Musk drove the price of Milady NFTs soaring on Wednesday after tweeting a Milady joke.</em></li>



<li><em>Milady NFT sales and the project&#8217;s floor price increased shortly after Musk wrote.</em></li>



<li><em>It&#8217;s not the first time Musk has used Twitter to drive up the price of digital assets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The crypto world is buzzing over billionaire Elon Musk&#8217;s next action. Instead of discussing Dogecoin (DOGE), Tesla&#8217;s CEO did something entirely different this time: he shared a photograph of an NFT.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-428.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-428-1024x576.png" alt="Elon Musk Creates Excitement For Milady NFT Collection Again" class="wp-image-186627" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-428-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-428-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-428-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-428-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-428-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-428.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Elon Musk Creates Excitement For Milady NFT Collection Again 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>Elon Musk picked Milady, an NFT collection that has appeared in the crypto industry since April 2022 but has also been contentious because of the founder&#8217;s controversy.</p>



<p>Elon Musk posted a meme using the clearly identifiable mascot from the Milady NFT collection on Wednesday, much to the joy of many Milady NFT holders:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“There is no meme, I love you.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After this, the digital collectible&#8217;s floor price climbed to unprecedented heights on the OpenSea marketplace.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://nftpricefloor.com/milady" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a> from the major NFT marketplace, the entry-level price for the collection on crypto marketplaces immediately jumped from 3.75 ETH to 5.41 ETH. As of Wednesday afternoon, sales of Milady NFTs had surged by a factor of 900% over the previous twenty-four hours, and the floor price had jumped by over half. The NFT collection&#8217;s transaction volume increased by more than 1500%.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-427-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-427-1024x576.png" alt="Elon Musk Creates Excitement For Milady NFT Collection Again" class="wp-image-186626" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-427-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-427-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-427-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-427-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-427-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-427-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-427.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Elon Musk Creates Excitement For Milady NFT Collection Again 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>Miladys is a profile-pic (PFP) NFT with 9,823 NFTS with wide-eyed childish features. Despite the harmless picture, the collection has sparked debate due to conspiracy theories and insults published by the project&#8217;s author, known as Charlotte Fang, Charlie Fang, or Charlemagne.</p>



<p>The CEO of Remilia acknowledged being behind an insulting Twitter account and other tweets and quit the enterprise.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not the first time Musk has used Twitter to drive up the price of digital assets; the Milady meme is the most recent example. The price of Dogecoin increased over the previous month when Musk altered Twitter&#8217;s official logo to include the famous canine meme portraying a Shiba Inu dog.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Hungary sees no immediate need for a publicly accessible CBDC but is testing the concept to see whether it might assist the unbanked.</em></li>



<li><em>The nation is required to join the eurozone, but it does not seem to be in any hurry to establish a timetable for leaving its currency.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a top official, Hungary sees no immediate need for a publicly distributed central bank digital currency (CBDC) but is experimenting to see whether one may benefit the unbanked.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424.png"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424.png" alt="Hungary Doesn&#039;t See A CBDC Urgency Right Now" class="wp-image-186620" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Hungary Doesn&#039;t See A CBDC Urgency Right Now 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>Although being a member of the European Union (EU) and so having to adopt the euro, Hungary has shown little urgency in establishing a precise schedule to replace its native currency, the forint.</p>



<p>Around 114 nations were investigating CBDC projects as of the beginning of 2023. The most well-known are the digital yuan, dollar, and euro. Several nations, however, have made tremendous headway with their CBDC programs.</p>



<p>Thailand&#8217;s central bank, for example, collaborated with SCG to undertake a pilot test for its CBDC, while South Korea launched a trial program for its intended CBDC project and then established a legal advisory council to address potential regulatory issues.</p>



<p>Various European authorities, notably the central banks in charge of the pound, euro, and Swedish krona, are actively considering issuing their currencies in digital form. The European Central Bank is expected to decide later this year whether to begin constructing a digital euro, while the Bank of England has said that a digital pound is likely to be required in the future.</p>



<p>With so many nations investigating CBDC projects, it is apparent that this technology is gaining appeal globally.</p>



<p>&#8220;For the moment, we don&#8217;t see any imminent need for large-scale retail CBDC to be introduced&#8221; by ordinary residents and companies, says the report. Hungarian Central Bank Chief Digital Officer Anikó Szombati said at an event held by think tank the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum.</p>



<p>She did, however, remark that the Central Bank of Hungary is launching a series of pilot projects to investigate the possibility of issuing a CBDC, with the goal of remaining at the forefront of CBDC research.</p>



<p>Szombati said that while considering the implementation of a CBDC, the key incentive should be a substantial market failure or a strong governmental goal.</p>



<p>She stated that one potential motivation for Hungary might be increased financial inclusion since around 13% of Hungarian individuals do not presently have access to bank accounts.</p>



<p>According to research undertaken by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), nearly 90% of central banks throughout the globe are considering the implementation of a CBDC.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Many alleged inconsistencies were reported by ParaSpace, linking its CEO, founder, and CTO Yubo Ruan to the mishandling of cash totaling 2,909 Ether seized via a white-hat interception.</em></li>



<li><em>Ruan had sole ownership and administration of a part of the protocol monies returned by BlockSec, according to Paraspace.</em></li>



<li><em>Ruan vehemently denied any misconduct.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>This afternoon, the NFT lending agreement ParaSpace disclosed internal disagreements and accusations of asset embezzlement.</strong></h5>

<p>On May 10, the NFT financialization protocol ParaSpace released a series of alleged anomalies linking its CEO, founder, and CTO Yubo Ruan to the mishandling of money totaling 2,909 Ether retrieved through a white-hat interception on March 18.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear ParaSpace Community,<br><br>TL;DR: There have been no malicious acts from the team. All funds are safe from Yubo, the protocol is under the full control of the team, and we have the financial means to ensure the stability of the platform.<br><br>Today, we are sharing information brought… <a href="https://t.co/58M3U1uLwv" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/58M3U1uLwv</a></p>&mdash; ParaSpace (@ParaSpace_NFT) <a href="https://twitter.com/ParaSpace_NFT/status/1656254657562578944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Ruan vehemently denied any wrongdoing:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Manufacturing claims with the intent to take over and force me to step down as CEO. This is highly problematic and the legal team has taken action.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;There is no misappropriation of public assets,&#8221; Yubo said, but certain members of the team want to overthrow the kingdom!</p>



<p>On its official Twitter account, ParaSpace requests that Ruan &#8220;step down from his roles as CEO and CTO.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jay, the co-founder, was also there at Planet Daily&#8217;s Twitter Space conflict, when the two sides traded fire over the air. Jay also posted via ParaSpace that the creator, Yubo, had embezzled mobile account cash and had contacted them 30 hours before the Twitter Space.</p>



<p>According to the Twitter text, the 2,909 ETH funds recovered after ParaSpace was hacked on March 18 of this year have not been fully returned to ParaSpace, and initially, more than 50% have not been returned, resulting in loopholes in the protocol treasury, and these funds were collected by external wallet management named 0x909…; additionally, any exchange activity by 0x909 has nothing to do with the ParaSpace vault, and all funds are directed to yubo.</p>



<p>As a result, Jay said that the team is working together to assure the agreement&#8217;s multi-signature &#8220;majority security,&#8221; and Yubo&#8217;s multi-signature address authority has been removed. At the moment, all users&#8217; assets are secure, and Yubo can no longer meddle. Jay repeatedly said on Twitter Space, &#8220;Blockchain Don&#8217;t Lie,&#8221; calling on creator Yubo to quit as CEO and give over all remaining assets.</p>



<p>Ruan, on the other side, claims that two former ParaSpace consultants, Thomas Schmidt and Jay Yao, who are now listed as the protocol&#8217;s COO and CBO, respectively, illegally got control of one of the protocol&#8217;s multisig and social media accounts by misrepresenting themselves. Ruan said that upon receiving saved monies from BlockSec, himself, Thomas, Jay, and other key engineering parties agreed to and arranged an organized redeposit mechanism in stages.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;To date, following the schedule, all of the hacker&#8217;s debt has been deposited back into the hacker account. The residual amount has already been paid back in full according to schedule. The mischaracterization by them is absurd, and I have nothing to hide,&#8221; Ruan wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The incident seemed to have transitioned to Rashomon at the conclusion of Twitter Space. Both parties have their own points of view. Jay also requested that the battleground be transferred to ParaSpace&#8217;s official Twitter and that the video camera be opened to allow the team to face each other. The reality is obvious, but the most essential thing for consumers is to promptly limit dangers and remove funds.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>In the previous three months, an MEV bot managed by a pseudonymous crypto person gained millions of dollars in arbitrage and sandwich attacks.</em></li>



<li><em>This MEV bot rapidly gained attention, surpassing other MEV bots used for high-frequency trading algorithms based on blockchain.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In under three months, an MEV bot operated by jaredfromsubway.eth raised $34 million. According to a study by MEV monitoring site <a href="https://eigenphi.substack.com/p/performance-appraisal-of-jaredfromsubway-eth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EigenPhi</a>, an MEV bot managed by a person named after an imprisoned felon has gained $34 million in the last three months via arbitrage and sandwich attacks.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-420.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-420.png" alt="MEV Bot Earned $34 Million In Three Months Via Sandwich Attacks" class="wp-image-186607" title="MEV Bot Earned $34 Million In Three Months Via Sandwich Attacks 30"></a></figure></div>


<p>The bot was established in February by Jaredfromsubway.eth, a reference to the former spokesman for sandwich brand Subway who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for sex offenses. It soon gained popularity by sandwiching other cryptocurrency users and beating competitor MEV bots, which are blockchain-based high-frequency trading algorithms.</p>



<p>According to EigenPhi, the Jaredfromsubway.eth bot launched over 238,000 assaults on almost 106,000 people. The bot brought in $40 million in income. It earned $34 million in net profits while paying $6 million in transaction fees.</p>



<p>EigenPhi claims that as the bot becomes more active, its transactions can now be found in more than 60% of Ethereum blocks.</p>

<p>This week, a crypto engineer using the alias Nox <a href="https://twitter.com/0xNox_eth/status/1655615318067412992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Their success can be attributed to skill, strategy, and tech. Jared&#8217;s bot identifies more MEV opportunities and executes transactions faster than competitors.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A sandwich attack occurs when a quick crypto user notices a transaction on the blockchain that is awaiting processing. It then blends this transaction with two of its own, one before and one after the transaction. It forwards this packet to a blockchain validator, who executes the transaction in exchange for a fee. These two deals are meant to manipulate the market in a manner that makes the initial trade less lucrative and consequently boosts the attacker&#8217;s own profit.</p>



<p>The bot&#8217;s success seems to be pushing its rivals to the sidelines. In Flashbots Discord, the owner of an MEV bot called Yannick said that jaredfromsubway.eth is prepared to give validators a bigger share of the money from the assaults.</p>

<p>Glitch is expected to surpass an average price level of $0.15 by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, and reach a minimum price level of $1 by the end of the year. This article aims to analyze these developments and offer insights into the potential surge in Glitch coin&#8217;s price.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Background and Recent Developments of Glitch</h1>



<p>At the heart of the <a href="https://glitch.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Glitch</a> is its blockchain-agnostic super protocol designed for trustless money markets and decentralized financial applications (dApps). Recently, Glitch announced significant updates that could potentially influence its coin&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>The most impactful of these updates is the introduction of native smart contracts on the mainnet. This brings utility to the chain, allowing developers to launch dApps directly on the Glitch blockchain, unlocking new levels of functionality and potential use cases for the entire community.</p>



<p>Glitch also announced a partnership with Lumos Labs, a leading Web3 innovation management firm, to boost developer adoption of the Glitch blockchain. Furthermore, Glitch will be a track sponsor at the Buidl for Web3 Hack 2023, presenting three distinct use case challenges to over 10,000 developers worldwide.</p>



<p>Another key update is the confirmation of a network security auditing partner, one of the most prestigious auditing firms in the industry. This partner will not only audit Glitch&#8217;s network but also host a bug bounty program on their platform.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Factors Poised to Trigger a Price Surge</h1>



<p>Each update announced by Glitch has the potential to influence its coin&#8217;s price. For instance, the introduction of native smart contracts on the mainnet could attract more developers to the platform, leading to an increase in the demand for GLCH.</p>



<p>Similarly, the partnership with Lumos Labs and the participation in Buidl for Web3 Hack 2023 could lead to an influx of new developers, again potentially driving up the demand for the coin. The confirmation of a prestigious network security auditing partner also adds to the credibility of the Glitch platform, possibly attracting more investors to GLCH.</p>



<p>Moreover, Glitch has announced coming launch of a native NFT marketplace and a launchpad on its blockchain. These developments could increase the utility of GLCH, further driving up its demand and, consequently, its price.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Price Prediction of Glitch coin</h1>



<p>Given the recent updates and the potential increase in demand for GLCH, a price surge seems plausible. However, it&#8217;s important to note that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and unpredictable. Therefore, while these updates are promising, they do not guarantee a price surge. It&#8217;s crucial for investors to stay updated with Glitch&#8217;s developments and perform thorough research before investing.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h1>



<p>The Glitch project has several exciting updates lined up that could potentially impact its coin&#8217;s price. The introduction of native smart contracts, strategic partnerships, and the development of a native NFT marketplace and launchpad are all promising developments.
