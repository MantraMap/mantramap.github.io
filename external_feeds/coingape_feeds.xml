While the deal is actually reasonable due to readership, crypto events, and impact on the industry, he believes the $200 million asking price is a bit overpriced.</p>
<h2>Will Charles Hoskinson Buy CoinDesk?</h2>
<p>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson in a YouTube Live <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVQuGQIAxoI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">session</a> on early January 20 shared why he is interested in buying crypto news outlet CoinDesk. He believes the industry has witnessed bad media in recent times, as well as news outlets&#8217; relations to FTX have been questioned as they received investments from companies related to Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My interest on the media side is more broad. I would like to figure out how to get to journalistic integrity again.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>CoinDesk revealed on Wednesday that it hired financial advisers at Lazard to explore options, including a partial or full sale. The news website is owned by Digital Currency Group, whose lending subsidiary <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-broker-genesis-file-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis Capital is expected</a> to file for bankruptcy soon.</p>
<p>Charles Hoskinson asserts that he hasn&#8217;t seen CoinDesk’s books or financials, but the gross profit was around $50 million. The asking price for the sale is about $200 million. DCG acquired CoinDesk for roughly $500,000 in 2016.</p>
<p>“At $200 million, I believe it’s a bit overpriced,” he said. “I could afford it if I really wanted to.”</p>
<p>However, he believes the crypto industry needs a strong media outlet. He also suggested turning various news pieces into <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible tokens</a>, making it possible for people to interact with them.</p>
<h2>Cardano&#8217;s Status in the Crypto Space</h2>
<p>Cardano’s cryptocurrency is down about 76% in the past year. Some other major blockchains are growing faster than Cardano. The number of monthly active developers increased by 5% last year.</p>
<p>Cardano has 30 active <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dapps</a>, such as games, on its network, according to DappRadar. Whereas, Ethereum has nearly 4,000.</p>
<p>ADA price is currently trading at $0.34, up over 3% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high are $0.328 and $0.342, respectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ripple (XRP) News</strong>: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had on Thursday spoke at length about the state of crypto regulation in various parts of the world. Garlinghouse stressed on the importance of finding the right balance for crypto in terms of codifying the rules and imposing regulation. He said there is very less scope in Ripple&#8217;s case that it is operating in the unregulated space. Earlier, the Ripple CEO criticized the SEC&#8217;s behavior in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/">XRP lawsuit</a> saying that the manner in which the regulating body operated was embarrassing.</p>

<h2>How Far Is Crypto From Regulation</h2>
<p>The Ripple CEO explained the need for defining what are the safe practices to follow within the crypto regulatory space. He took the example of the UAE&#8217;s work on codifying the regulatory scope. Garlinghouse was speaking as part of a panel of speakers at the <a href="https://twitter.com/801_xrp/status/1616101144107053062?s=21&amp;t=AKjpkSuHmwbHIrrfJM1FEg">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos. He also explained how close is Ripple to being regulated as its customers as a cross border payments platform are banks.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The UAE has done the work to codify what the regulations are. The challenge is that a lot of players in the crypto space want to be good actors. There has to be clarity on what that means though.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the crypto prices continue to regain value since the beginning of January 2023. As of writing, the XRP price stands at $0.393, up 3.25% in the last 24 hours. On the other side, the lawsuit against Ripple by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is in the final stages as the community awaits final judgement.</p>

Ray III</a>, stated that he is investigating the prospect of relaunching the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a>. The FTX Token&#8217;s (FTT) price hit $2.41 on the competing exchange Binance, which marks a gain of 73% over the last seven days.</p>
<h2>FTX Token (FTT) Price Surge</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Ray, who is supervising the bankruptcy and restructuring of the FTX business empire, stated that he has put together a task team to investigate the <a href="https://coingape.com/new-ftx-ceo-john-j-ray-iii-plans-to-restart-crypto-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibility of relaunching FTX.com</a>. This information captured major headlines which in turn resulted in the price uptick for the cryptocurrency. It&#8217;s estimated that speculative investors are currently in possession of the altcoin, as most serious investors have lost faith after the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchange</a> filed for bankruptcy in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States</a>.</p>

<h2>FTT&#8217;s Role In FTX Collapse</h2>
<p>The downfall of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> was precipitated by FTT in its most fundamental form. The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a>, much like other native tokens, was used in part as an incentive to drive transactions to the exchange by providing discounts to its holders. This was done in the same way as other native tokens like <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/binance-bnb-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BNB</a> for Binance and KCS for <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/kucoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KuCoin</a>. However, the use of FTT didn&#8217;t appear to be a problem until it was discovered that not only token was one of the primary assets that comprised FTX&#8217;s balance sheet, but also the tokens were used as collateral by <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alameda Research</a> &#8212; in order to gain access to capital through both crypto lenders.</p>
<p>FTT currently ranks as the 208th largest cryptocurrency with a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/#:~:text=The%20term%20market%20capitalization%20or,coin%20at%20any%20given%20time." target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap</a> of $769 million which has seen a 28% gain in the last 24 hours. The trading for the token has also witnessed a surge in <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volume</a> as it&#8217;s up by almost 63% at $84 million; primarily led by the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance exchange</a>. However, even if the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTT</a> has skyrocketed upon the positive news, the token is still down by almost 97% from its all-time high of $84.18.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While the Terra Classic community is positive about the development, association with Terra Rebels caused the community to become uninterested in using or staking with Neblio mobile wallet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Terra Classic community reminded Terra Rebels about returning $150K worth of community funds misappropriated by some members.

<p dir="ltr">This caused massive drops in LUNC prices and staked LUNC tokens. The total staked LUNC dropped from over 900 billion to 850 billion in December. On January 19, the LUNC supply ratio again jumped over 13% and total LUNC tokens staked reached nearly 900 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The reopening of the IBC channels is also bringing back utility to the Terra Classic chain, with a number of projects building on the blockchain.

<p>Terra Classic (LUNC) price increased nearly 10% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.0001755. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000158 and $0.0001773, respectively.

Ray III</a>, who just took over the position of CEO at FTX, has stated that he is investigating the potential of restarting the defunct <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> even as he works to repay the money owed to the company&#8217;s clients and creditors. Ray, who was in charge of restructuring Enron before, said that “if there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.”</p>
<h2>John J. Ray III Says FTX Could Restart</h2>
<p>Ray stated, in the first <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-ftx-chief-says-crypto-exchange-could-restart-11674143168?mod=Searchresults_pos1&amp;page=1">interview</a> he has given since taking over <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> in November, that he has established a task force to investigate the possibility of relaunching FTX.com, the primary international exchange operated by the company. According to him, even though high-level officials at FTX have been accused of criminal activity, a number of clients have lauded the company&#8217;s technology and suggested that there may be merit in rebooting the platform.</p>
<p>The new FTX CEO was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Everything is on the table. There are stakeholders we’re working with who’ve identified what they see as a viable business.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Ray Lashes Out At SBF</h2>
<p>Ray and FTX&#8217;s founder <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, can&#8217;t seem to come to an agreement over whether or not the exchange should have filed for bankruptcy back in 2022. SBF has stated that it was a poor decision for FTX to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bankruptcy/">bankruptcy</a> code, and criticized Ray&#8217;s approach while dealing with the situation. Ray, on the other hand, stated that Bankman-Fried&#8217;s remarks were &#8220;unhelpful and self-serving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ray claims that they &#8220;don’t need to be dialoguing with him” as he didn&#8217;t mention anything that the restructuring team wasn&#8217;t already acquainted with. Earlier last week, Ray &amp; team were able to <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-5-billion-recovery-crypto-cash/">locate $5 billion in cash and liquid cryptocurrencies</a>, which the CEO termed as a &#8220;Herculean effort&#8221; to sort the business&#8217;s finances.</p>
<p>As things stand, the price of FTX&#8217;s native <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a>, FTT, is currently being traded at $2.41. This represents an increase of 30% in the past 1 hour, in contrast to its 68% jump during the last seven days, as per CoinGape’s <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker.</p>

However, going by the historically high buying interest from traders, the BTC price could well be up for a huge breakout in either direction. However, under the current scenario, a price rise could be more likely at least in the short term. Also, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a> could be preparing for the interest rate decision in the FOMC meet in February.</p>

<p>After the US Fed&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/fomc/">Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)</a> announced an interest rate hike by 0.50% in December 2022, the crypto market did not show much deviation as it was on expected lines. The first FOMC meet in the year 2023 is scheduled for February 1. In a latest, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicted that there is a chance of <a href="https://coingape.com/davos-2023-jp-morgan-ceo-claims-further-fed-rate-hikes-in-sight/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">higher interest rates in coming future</a>. Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, the CEO said the rate could probably go higher than 5% due to underlying inflation.</p>
<h2>High Optimism Among Traders</h2>
<p>If this prediction goes on to be true, reduced liquidity in the market could mean crypto prices going downwards. Meanwhile, BTC trading activity is pointing to the possibility of a bigger Bitcoin breakout. In fact, interest in BTC is at an eight month peak after it recently breached the $21,000 mark.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Traders are treating Bitcoin&#8217;s signs of life as a signal that a bigger breakout may be looming soon. The rebound back over $21,000 in January has resulted in the crowd showing the most optimism they have had in markets since July.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As of writing, $20,742 down 3.40% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">CoinGape price tracker</a>. For the first time after November 2022, the BTC price broke resistance at $21,000 earlier in the week.</p>

As a result, the firm made returns of almost $1.8 billion.</span></span></p>
<h2>Peter Thiel&#8217;s Fund Sells Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The firm with its headquarters in San Francisco made its initial investment in bitcoin at the beginning of 2014 and has since invested significant sums of money in cryptocurrency. According to the latest <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a1d5597-7145-4035-987b-ff033bba3d75">reports</a>, around two-thirds of its total investment was used to purchase Bitcoin. By the end of March 2022, the fund had liquidated the vast majority of the cryptocurrencies comprising its entire portfolio.</p>

<p>This opportune move took place prior to the crash of the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) in May, which signalled the beginning of the carnage in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a>. Since May of last year, the market for digital assets has been roiled by a crisis, which has resulted in the failure of several prominent cryptocurrency businesses, including Terraform Labs, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/celsius-2/">Celsius</a>, Voyager, Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>.</p>
<h2>Thiel Still Bullish On Bitcoin</h2>
<p>However, Thiel gave a speech in support of Bitcoin less than a month after it was announced that his fund had liquidated the majority of its cryptocurrency holdings. He stated that the increase in the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">price of Bitcoin (BTC)</a> was a signal that &#8220;the end of the fiat money&#8221; was close and it implied that &#8220;central banks are bankrupt.&#8221; He also took a stand against those who opposed the flagship <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a>, referring to billionaire Warren Buffett as a &#8220;sociopathic grandfather from Omaha.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founders Fund unloaded a number of investments in addition to cryptocurrency. The fund was able to repay around $13 billion to its investors as a result of eight further major exits that occurred between 2020 and 2022; which included the likes of Airbnb and Palantir. According to the information obtained, the fund does not have any significant exposure to cryptocurrency markets at the present time.</p>

The proposal is put forward by Terra Classic core developer Edward Kim to software upgrade the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a> from v1.0.4 to v1.0.5.</p>
<p>Currently, the proposal has received nearly 99.99% votes in favor, indicating support for the proposal. The LUNC community has always supported proposals suggested by professor Edward Kim.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Community Votes on Proposal 11310</h2>
<p>Terra Classic core developer Edward Kim submitted Proposal 11310 last week and updated it with the necessary changes. The proposal aims to software upgrade the Terra Classic blockchain to transition from v1.0.4 to v1.0.5. It will make transaction fees (gas and burn tax) estimation and future chain upgrade a lot easier and smoother.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-core-developer-edward-kim-proposal-up-for-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joint L1 Task Force</a> consisting of Edward Kim, Tobias &#8220;Zaradar&#8221; Anderson, and other developers will fix the node’s LCD endpoint that corrects a calculation issue on the LCD. The upgrade is scheduled to happen at block 11,543,150, expected on February 14.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the first upgrade for the Terra Classic blockchain as per the Q1 roadmap. It will be followed by v1.0.6, Cosmos SDK, Tendermint, and v2.0.4 upgrades.</p>
<p>As per current voting details, 99.99% of voters support the proposal. Also, the proposal looks to reach the “pass threshold” before the set voting period. The proposal has received 21 validator votes until now and all have voted in favor of the proposal. Among the top validators, StakeBin, moonshot, and CryptoKing have voted &#8220;Yes&#8221; to the proposal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former Terra Rebels developer Duncan <a href="https://twitter.com/wrapped_dday/status/1615857953097289732" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> concerns over whether the Joint L1 Task Force team still has access to the Terra Rebels repo and which repo the validators have been using.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price Continues Its Rally</h2>
<p>LUNC price increased nearly 10% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.0001755. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000158 and $0.0001773, respectively. Meanwhile, the trading volume has increased by 37% in the last 24 hours, indicating a slight interest from traders.</p>

Jamie, an outspoken opponent of Bitcoin, has labeled the cryptocurrency a variety of derogatory adjectives, including a ponzi, pet rock and, most recently &#8212; a &#8220;hyped-up fraud&#8221;.</p>
<h2>JP Morgan CEO Slams Bitcoin (BTC)</h2>
<p>On the 19th of January, Dimon appeared on the CNBC show Squawk Box, where he was questioned about his current position on cryptocurrencies. In response, he asked the other members of the panel why they &#8220;spend any breath&#8221; discussing the topic before taking a shot at the world&#8217;s first <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> by saying, &#8220;Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fake, a pet rock.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while he was extolling the virtues of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/#:~:text=A%20blockchain%20is%20a%20distributed,functions%20to%20become%20a%20chain.">blockchain</a> and ledger technologies that JPMorgan internally uses and believes to be harnessed for future money transfers, he casts doubt on whether Bitcoin is a store of value; or as <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">scarce</a> as it is meant to be. While speaking on Satoshi&#8217;s pre-programmed limitation to the supply of Bitcoin, he was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well how do u know its gonna stop at 21 million? Maybe it’s going to get to 21 million, and Satoshi’s picture is going to come up and laugh at you all.</p></blockquote>

<p>While speaking on the broader crypto market, the CEO and chairman of JPMorgan openly confessed that he was not shocked by the downfall and subsequent bankruptcy of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>, which was previously one of the most prominent <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> in the world. He stated that he had referred to FTX as a &#8220;decentralized Ponzi scheme&#8221; in the past.</p>
<p><iframe title="JPMorgan&#039;s Jamie Dimon: Bitcoin is a &#039;hyped-up fraud&#039;" width="678" height="381" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qdIooHrQeK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Jamie noted, in a jab directed towards <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/tether/">Tether&#8217;s</a> alleged lack of disclosures and dollar backing, that U.S. regulators should have stopped the shady activity a long time ago. He went on to say that people, particularly those with lesser incomes and in some cases, seniors, have lost billions of dollars as a result of the unregulated behavior.</p>
<p>Despite Dimon&#8217;s negative comments about Bitcoin, JP Morgan is making strides toward integrating blockchain technology into its existing operations. For example, the lending institution has a cryptocurrency known as JPM Coin that is used for intraday repurchase agreements. And as things stand, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC) price</a> is currently being traded at $20,765. This represents a decrease of 2.48% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 14.50% during the week as per CoinGape’s <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker.</p>

<h2>Is SEC win in sight in XRP case?</h2>
<p>John Deaton, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/amicus-curiae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amicus Curiae</a> in the XRP lawsuit discussed arguments that could have led to a <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US SEC</a> win. He highlighted how should it be decided that the court should grant the Commission’s Summary Judgement motion. However, if the judge decides to rule that XRP was offered as a security in 2013-2015 then it will simply imply that SEC wins the dispute.</p>
<p>As of the filings in the court, the SEC hasn’t presented any such argument to the judge which confine investment contracts to sales and that too in 2013-2015. The commission didn’t offer a theory of common enterprise advanced by the commission which can allow differentiating those sales from others. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>XRP holders’ lawyer is finding it difficult to see how the judge can rule an SEC win here. If the court does it then it will have to be by calling Ripple offering XRP in those years as an investment contract. He added that the commission does not explicitly allege it. However, if the judge wants to drop the split decision, they would need to find a violation in the early years.</p>
<h2>Is Ripple a common enterprise?</h2>
<p>Deaton mentioned that Ripple claims that the commission has alleged that the blockchain firm was the common enterprise. Meanwhile, an expert that SEC later abandoned stated that it was the entire XRP ecosystem. However, in the briefs, the SEC stated that XRP represents the common enterprise.</p>

The country had in the recent years tightened its stance on <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a> trading and other digital asset activities. In 2022, the country&#8217;s administration imposed tough taxation on crypto related activities. Ahead of the country&#8217;s annual budget session that is set to begin on February 1, 2023.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Nothing Outlaws Crypto In India&#8217;</h2>
<p>In a latest, India&#8217;s IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptooIndia/status/1616057530026713089">nothing stands in way of crypto</a> activity in a legal standpoint. The comment could mean a great deal in clearing speculation about the possibility of a blanked ban on crypto in India. However, it remains to be seen if such a ban would be placed on specific activities around cryptocurrencies. Also, the upcoming Union annual budget could perhaps bring in changes or relaxations to the crypto tax slabs.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is nothing today that outlaws crypto as long as you follow the legal process. If you want to invest in crypto, make sure you go through the RBI, get your LRS eligibility, the dollars as per rules.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>India&#8217;s Plans Of Banning Crypto</h2>
<p>Adding to the concerns of Indian crypto enthusiasts, recent reports speculated about the possibility of India&#8217;s role in regulating crypto in context of the country leading the G20 group. On similar lines, the country&#8217;s central bank had in the past expressed its reservations in allowing crypto transactions. Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reaffirmed its stance saying that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and exhibit high correlations with the equity market. More importantly, the <a href="https://coingape.com/india-prohibiting-banning-crypto-g20-presidency/">RBI&#8217;s Financial Stability Report</a> said the country was exploring the possibility of prohibiting crypto.</p>

<p>The main goal of the<strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/explained-roblox-metaverse-and-how-does-roblox-meta-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Roblox Metaverse</a></strong> is to use the already-existing gaming platform and technology to create an immersive virtual world. While other <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaverse</a></strong>-related businesses are heavily utilizing <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/top-5-technologies-that-power-the-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AR and VR technology</a></strong>, Roblox has chosen a different strategy. The industry titan in gaming is not yet persuaded to invest in these technological advancements, at least not yet. Instead, it seeks to improve the user experience through the use of tried-and-true technologies.</p>
<p>Roblox generates revenue by partnering with brands for events that take place in their virtual worlds. For instance, Netflix and Roblox collaborated to promote their show He-Man by introducing pertinent Roblox Metaverse experiences.</p>
<p><iframe title="What is the Roblox Metaverse?" width="678" height="381" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/emUJTQAiU_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>Why is Roblox Metaverse Popular?</h3>
<p>The Roblox Metaverse is an early entrant in the Metaverse because it is a virtual world that is independent of AR and VR technologies. It has all of the fundamental attributes that users anticipate from the Metaverse, such as a <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a></strong>-based economy and surreal virtual world experiences. But what distinguishes it from the competition?</p>
<p>Roblox&#8217;s adaptable stage and simple accessibility requirements are two factors that have contributed to its meteoric rise in popularity. While some of its rivals are only available on a select few platforms, Roblox is accessible on all of the major ones, including Windows, Android, iOS, and Xbox. The gaming stage doesn&#8217;t require users to purchase headsets and other pricey equipment because AR and VR are barely used on them.</p>

<h2>Here are 4 Things That Make Roblox Metaverse Unique</h2>
<p>Viewers can discover creator economies and particular, niche ecosystems within the Roblox metaverse. The most important aspect of Roblox is that it works more like a social media stage than just a game.</p>
<ol>
<li>Future plans for Roblox</li>
<li>Accessible through mobile devices</li>
<li>Interesting Events</li>
<li>Encouraging Originality</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Future plans for Roblox</h3>
<p>The Roblox metaverse&#8217;s current state draws attention to the potential for long-term growth. A thorough explanation of Roblox would also provide information regarding its potential future. Players can use a lot of cutting-edge experiences in the gaming industry. <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/top-web3-games-you-should-explore-in-2022-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popular video games</a></strong> like Minecraft and Fortnite have proven the potential of immersive environments.</p>
<h3>2. Accessible through mobile devices</h3>
<p>VR and AR are the two most popularly used technologies for accessing the virtual world. Just the concept of a Roblox metaverse event may lead to VR and AR support. On the other hand, you don&#8217;t need any of these to participate in Roblox because it can be accessed on smartphones. The fun games on Roblox are available to mobile users at all times.</p>
<p>The Roblox metaverse is well suited for mobile devices due to its adaptability. Mobile devices are used by nearly 72% of Roblox users to access the website. Furthermore, 64% of Generation Z smartphone users keep a constant online connection.</p>
<h3>3. Interesting Events</h3>
<p>The 2021 Roblox Metaverse Champions competition is a perfect example of how Roblox appeals to young people who are interested in technology. An annual event known as the Roblox metaverse egg hunt was changed to a roughly four-week-long occasion. Every winner played 10 to 12 of the 48 games that were played each week. Additionally, in collaboration with Sony Music, Roblox introduced virtual music events. Roblox offered users in the Gen Z generation various fun virtual experiences throughout the pandemic.</p>
<h3>4. Encouraging Originality</h3>
<p>The Roblox metaverse games&#8217; flexibility in incorporating fresh ideas is one of their main benefits. Roblox acts as a stage for new experiences rather than an open <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/play-in-the-metaverse-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming environment</a></strong>. In a virtual workspace, users can design special events like combat games or informal get-togethers. Roblox fosters creativity by promoting freedom of expression as well as the growth of its creator community. One of the main reasons Gen Z users join the Roblox metaverse is their space for creativity. The Hilton Hotel chain, which the game refers to as Bloxton Hotels, is one example.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Davos 2023: While talking at the World Economic Forum being held at Davos, Switzerland, the people from the crypto community were seen shrugging off their hands from FTX and its former boss Sam Bankman-Fried. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO, of Ripple, told CNBC at Davos 2023 that people consider the FTX to be a crypto problem, <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/ftx-not-a-crypto-problem-says-ripple-ceo-at-davos-2023/" title="FTX Not A Crypto Problem, Says Ripple CEO At Davos 2023"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/garlinghouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brad Garlinghouse</a>, the CEO, of Ripple, told CNBC at Davos 2023 that people consider the FTX to be a crypto problem, however, if we get into the depth of it, it is not. He tagged the FTX case as fraud and money laundering. Also, people should not pretend it is a crypto problem.</p>
<p>Garlinghouse also described <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a>&#8216;s personal exposure to the defunct <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a>. On Wednesday, he said that FTX had received a 10 million USD XRP lease from Ripple, which they utilized for a variety of FTX-related expenses.</p>
<p>Since the market reached its pinnacle at a combined value of 3 billion USD in November 2021, the crypto industry has seen almost 2 billion USD lost from its total <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap</a>.</p>
<h2>FTX, failure of an institution?</h2>
<p>Rene Reinsberg, the co-founder of Celo, during a CNBC-hosted panel on Thursday, said that FTX was a failure of an institution and of people. This should be differentiated from the technology of crypto.</p>
<p>While recognizing that FTX has tarnished the image of the crypto industry, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/jeremy-allaire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Allaire</a>, CEO of Circle, told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday said that many people backed FTX and now they are facing the backlash.</p>
<p>Organizations should be properly run, well-financed, highly regulated, have excellent audits, and have solid control. According to him, these all things matter while running a global financial institution. If not, they are going to come under a lot more scrutiny and people will begin to pay more attention to that as opposed to simply accepting it as a fairy tale, added Allaire.</p>

<h2>FTX being compared to the biggest investment fraud</h2>
<p>Garlinhghouse went on to compare the FTX case with Bernie Madoff, who is accused of having done the biggest investment fraud crime in the U.S. He said that people had not reported the case to <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/securities-and-exchange-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a> and the SEC simply overlooked it, hence, not restructuring regulations on hedge funds.</p>
<p>According to him, other asset classes have also suffered large losses, thus it would be dishonest to single out cryptocurrency in estimates of investor losses from hazardous assets in 2022. He mentioned of top U.S. technology equities which also took a  beating.</p>
<p>2 trillion USD was lost last year between Facebook, Amazon, and Tesla. No one is arguing about investments in those businesses, Garlinghouse said.</p>

It is a decentralized, open-source technology that powers much of the crypto world. If you want to experience Ethereum&#8217;s growing popularity, then maybe <strong>Ethereum stocks</strong> can be your jam. Even though the most direct option is buying Ethereum itself, a less volatile option to reap the profits would be investing in its stocks.</p>
<p>Here are the <strong>5 best Ethereum stocks</strong> you can buy and indirectly reap the benefits of <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ether’s price</a> surge:</p>
<h4>1. Grayscale Ethereum Trust</h4>
<p><strong>Current Price:</strong> $7.20</p>
<p>The Grayscale Ethereum Trust is a managed fund that makes it easy to add Ethereum to one’s brokerage account.

According to <a href="https://gov.capital/stock/ethe-stock/" rel="nofollow">Gov. capital</a>, Grayscale Ethereum Trust is a good long-term investment for the next one to three years and is bullish overall and its price can go up to $29.094 in the mid of January 2024.</p>

In <a href="https://walletinvestor.com/tose-stock-forecast/qeth-u-stock-prediction" rel="nofollow">Wallet Investors’ opinion</a>, the Ether Fund will make a good short-term investment.</p>
<h4>3. Accenture PLC.</h4>
<p><strong>Current Price:</strong> 277.90</p>

According to <a href="https://www.wallstreetzen.com/analysts/ramsey-el-assal" rel="nofollow">Ramsey El-Assal&#8217;s Stock Forecast</a>, Accenture PLC’s price might go up to $340.00 in the future and it is surely one of the best Ethereum stocks to buy.</p>
<h4>4. Bitwise Ethereum Fund</h4>
<p><strong>Current Price:</strong> $8.63</p>
<p>Bitwise is the world’s largest crypto index fund manager. It offers managed funds for multiple types of cryptocurrency, and one such example is Bitwise Ethereum Fund.

<p>Dimon made the statement <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/19/jamie-dimon-says-rates-will-rise-above-5percent-because-there-is-still-a-lot-of-underlying-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">while talking on CNBC’s show Squawk Box</a> at the World Economic Forum being held in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I actually think rates are probably going to go higher than 5% because I think there’s a lot of underlying inflation, which won’t go away so quick.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>FED’s historic interest rate hike</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve announced in December that the targeted increase in interest rate will be between 4.25% to 4.5% to battle the rising inflation. This is the highest percentage by which interest rates have been hiked in the past 15 years, making it a benchmark decision.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been certain signs of inflation slashing down, however, Dimon claimed that this is because of the slowing down of the economy of China following the breakout of Covid 19 and the drop in oil prices. He added that the oil prices will rise in the coming 10 years and China will overcome the slow pace at which it has been gripped.</p>

<h2>Recession to follow?</h2>
<p>The series of inflation-combative rate hikes are raising the concerns surrounding recession. The <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/imf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IMF</a> chief has already warned of two-thirds of the global economy to be in recession this year. The labor market and the consumer market have stayed strong despite rising rates. This has pushed the FED to increase rates.</p>
<p>Dimon also mentions that if there is even a mild recession in the U.S., the interest rates will go up to 6%. He acknowledged that there will be ups and downs in the phase, however, he is not about recession but the public policy during these times.</p>

<p><strong>PFP NFTs:</strong> PFP, or &#8220;profile picture,&#8221; is a well-known social media phrase. On the other hand, NFTs are <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible tokens</a></strong>, which are assets with a distinct digital identity that is primarily present on the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ethereum-merge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum blockchain</a></strong>.</p>
<p>PFP NFTs usually consist of a randomized collection of traits with varying levels of rarity. Color, hats, sunglasses, and other more esoteric features are a few examples. Only nine Alien <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/9-amazing-facts-about-cryptopunks-nfts-that-you-didnt-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoPunks</a></strong> exist, and they have been sold for tens of millions of dollars each. A PFP&#8217;s most unique qualities can raise its value. The vast majority of these resources are works of generative art. These pieces are typically produced by computers using generative algorithms, though hand-drawn PFP NFT collections are also quite popular.</p>

<h3>History of PFP NFTs</h3>
<p>NFTs appear to be a relatively recent trend, but they were actually developed by Larva Labs, a product studio founded by Matt Hall and John Watkinson. They were able to produce tens of thousands of punks-stylized humanoids in pixel art. At first, the pair thought they had found a brand-new app or game for smartphones. However, the publication of Hall and Watkinson revolutionized the field of digital art and redefined the concept of ownership.</p>
<p>Some of the first non-fungible token prototypes were presented by Larva Labs as a means of denoting ownership of the Punks. Starting with slightly modified versions of the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/erc-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERC-20</a></strong> tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, Hall and Watkinson began their work. As a result, a specialized digital coin was made possible; the ERC-721 token standard was developed especially for non-fungible tokens.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT collectors</a></strong> soon started using their CryptoPunks characters as Twitter and Discord profile pictures. Before the Punks gained widespread acceptance, it took some time. As celebrities and other members of the NFT community joined, NFT profile pictures started to gain enormous popularity. Numerous PFP projects including the well-known bored apes emerged as a result of the Crypto Punks&#8217; enormous popularity.</p>
<h2>How do PFP NFTs Work?</h2>
<p>PFP NFTs can either be created through the website of the NFT collection or bought on a second-hand NFT market like OpenSea or Magic Eden. Once purchased, the NFT will show up on the user&#8217;s profile page on the NFT marketplace as well as in their supported <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency wallet</a></strong> (like <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/top-5-hot-crypto-wallets-in-january-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaMask</a></strong> or Phantom).</p>
<p>Owners of Ethereum PFP NFTs can display their NFT on Instagram or other social media platforms, or they can link their crypto wallets to their Twitter Blue accounts to verify their profile picture NFTs for a &#8220;hexagon&#8221; shape.</p>
<h2>How to use PFP NFTs</h2>
<p>The fundamental function of a PFP NFT is its function as a profile picture (PFP). Prestige is a key component of the NFT industry and the larger crypto community. PFPs give owners of NFTs the opportunity to display their assets because digital collectibles thrive on rarity and exclusivity. On the other hand, some PFP NFT projects give NFT collectors access to a wider range of usefulness.</p>
<p>Since the monetization of creative works of art is a major factor in NFTs, artists must tread carefully when incorporating utility into their projects. The majority of creators and developers choose not to assign <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/nft-ip-who-owns-intellectual-property-of-non-fungible-tokens-laws-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intellectual property rights</a></strong> (IP rights) to their creations, but PFPs must have a significant practical benefit.</p>
<p>Some PFP projects give users access to metaverse resources. Alongside NFTs, the concept of a virtual world known as the metaverse gained popularity. A PFP NFT could serve as an avatar in a virtual world, which added to the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/why-are-nft-avatars-so-popular-and-what-to-expect-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popularity of avatars</a></strong>. Additionally, a collection like BAYC offers restricted access to the personalized utility, a feature that also applies to the project&#8217;s follow-up, the mutant ape yacht club. PFPs may also grant owners access to benefits that are available in the real world.</p>

<h2>Top PFP NFTs projects of all time</h2>
<p>Even though there are hundreds of projects, these few are among the 1% that continue to make headlines across the NFT ecosystem (for various reasons).</p>
<h3>1. CryptoPunks</h3>
<p>Punks were introduced in June 2017 by Larva Labs, which Yuga Labs acquired in 2022. These Punks were among the very first NFTs ever created on the Ethereum blockchain, giving them immeasurable significance in the context of NFT history. <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-are-cryptopunks-how-to-buy-cryptopunks-nfts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoPunks</a></strong>, which featured humans, apes, zombies, and aliens, invented the concept of generative trait combinations, which is still used as an inspiration in the majority of PFP projects today.</p>
<h3>2. Bored Ape Yacht Club</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/9-amazing-facts-about-bored-ape-yatch-club-nfts-that-you-didnt-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a></strong> is second only to CryptoPunks in significance, but unquestionably first in popularity and worth. In April 2021, BAYC, a collection of 10,000 NFTs, also debuted. Although it got off to a slow start, the project quickly gained value and became one of, if not the most, cherished NFT projects ever.</p>
<h3>3. Doodles</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/aggregatorapps/doodles/">Doodles</a></strong> were introduced in October 2021 and feature 10,000 avatars. But it has quickly emerged as one of the most well-liked PFP projects across all NFTs. Doodles continue to win over the hearts of countless NFT enthusiasts and seasoned NFT collectors thanks to its vibrant community, experienced executive team, and multifaceted approach to <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/5-ways-the-metaverse-might-transform-the-entertainment-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entertainment</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>4. Moonbirds</h3>
<p>A recent NFT PFP collection is called <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/moonbirds/">Moonbirds</a>. Moonbird offers owners a tonne of benefits and is expected to be another high-caliber release like BAYC. The collection&#8217;s tokens serve as membership cards for exclusive clubs. Nesting is another distinctive feature found in the Moonbirds collection. The longer a buyer holds onto a token, the more benefits are accrued for that token.</p>
<h3>5. Cool Cats</h3>
<p>Cool Cats is hard to beat when it comes to neighborhood-based initiatives. The collection, which consists of 9,999 generated and, in the words of its creators, &#8220;stylistically curated&#8221; NFTs, debuted in June 2021. It was supported by partnerships with Ghxsts and TIME magazine as well as a milk chug challenge that almost went viral.</p>
<h2>What distinguishes PFP NFTs from other NFTs?</h2>
<p>PFP NFTs are primarily focused on the fact that each NFT is an avatar that can be used in place of a personal photo as one&#8217;s online alias. But in addition to 2D art, an NFT can be linked to a wide variety of other kinds of metadata.</p>
<p>For instance, blockchain-based metaverses like The Sandbox, Yuga Labs&#8217; Otherside, and Decentraland sell virtual land as NFTs. However, the PROOF Collective has offered for sale NFTs that don&#8217;t provide art but rather serve as a membership card to gain access to various advantages.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/semi-fungible-vs-non-fungible-token-here-are-the-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semi-Fungible Vs Non-Fungible Token: Here Are The Differences</a></strong></p>
<h3>Why are PFP NFTs important?</h3>
<p>PFP NFTs are frequently the first thing that comes to mind when one thinks of an NFT and are arguably what launched the larger NFT cultural phenomenon. They serve as a starting point for NFT technology and give those interested in cryptocurrencies a glimpse of what the technology might have to offer in the future.</p>
<h3>The future of PFP NFTs</h3>
<p>The PFP NFT collections of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Crypto Punks, and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) fill out the remaining top four positions, with billions of dollars in total volume traded, while game character NFTs for <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/my-neighbor-alice-vs-axie-infinity-which-is-superior/">Axie Infinity</a></strong> is the most-traded collection of all time by volume, according to CryptoSlam data.</p>
<p>A future for PFP NFTs, though? Avatars, according to some, are just a passing trend that will eventually give way to utility NFTs like membership cards, <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/5-metaverse-companies-that-offer-online-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain gaming</a></strong>, virtual real estate in the metaverse, and other forms of virtual currency. However, PFP NFTs currently serves as a badge of membership to an exclusive club; Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT holders are peers with celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Madonna and have access to events like Ape Fest.</p>
<h2>Top 10 Celebrities Who Have NFTs as Profile Pics</h2>
<p>What do Jimmy Fallon, MC Hammer, and Reese Witherspoon all have in common? Well, in addition to being well-known, they also have NFT PFPs.</p>

The <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/reserve-bank-of-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reserve Bank of India</a> will issue eRupee only to customers who have deposits in the bank.</p>
<p>The eRupee pilot project is going quite successfully as per the RBI. The pilot project is open only to a closed group of people and the number of users has been increasing gradually. Anuj Ranjan, the chief general manager of the fintech department of RBI, while talking at an event of the Indian Merchants’ Chamber said that the Central Bank will bear the expenses that are related to eRupee as it is for the larger public good. He said that it will be counted in RBI’s liabilities just like the currency is.</p>
<h2>Digital wallets are available to download</h2>
<p>The country head for transaction banking at Yes Bank, Ajay Rajan said that digital wallet is available for download in Apple Store and Google Play Store for customers. He added that it&#8217;s available for bank customers only whose SIM card number is linked to the bank account. Additionally, after installing the wallet, customers can add digital money from any bank.</p>

<p>Rajan also added that cash transactions are free, however, the merchants pay money to cash-management companies for handling notes. Several companies like Reliance Retail, Natural Ice Cream, and oil companies have already signed up for accepting payments in eRupee.</p>
<h2>The eRupee pilot project</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/digital-rupee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital rupee</a> made its debut on Dec 1, 2022. The pilot is now being conducted with four mainstream banks in four cities: Mumbai, Bangalore, Bhubaneshwar, and New Delhi. The aim of the pilot is to see the robustness of the creation, real-time usage, and distribution of the eRupee. More features will be added eventually as it was stated by the RBI. More banks and other cities will also be added in the second phase of the pilot. RBI had stated earlier that since the currency is digital it will make transactions easier, faster, and cheaper.</p>
