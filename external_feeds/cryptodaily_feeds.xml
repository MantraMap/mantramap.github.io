			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">With Conflux (CFX) and Immutable (IMX) currently on a downtrend, investors have their gaze fixed on the new presale on the crypto block, Sparklo. In this article, we will explain why it is a better investment than Confluc (CFX) and Immutable (IMX).</p>
<p class="s6">Conflux&rsquo;s (CFX) Recent Developments Fail to Improve its Token&rsquo;s Value </p>
<p class="s6">Conflux (CFX) is a public layer-1 blockchain designed to power decentralized applications, Web3 infrastructure, and e-commerce through its decentralized, secure, and scalable protocol.</p>
<p class="s6">Conflux (CFX), dubbed China&rsquo;s Polygon (MATIC), is the country's only regulatory-compliant blockchain. Recent developments show that the blockchain has proposed to deploy Uniswap v3 on its network alongside offshore Chinese Yuan (CNH). In addition, the network also plans to join Curve Wars with its token (CFX) bridged to the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet. This proposal happened in the wake of Binance&rsquo;s announcement that it will now support Conflux (CFX) mainnet integration.</p>
<p class="s6">These moves by Conflux (CFX) are intended to attract more investors and provide more liquidity pools, which ultimately will increase the network&rsquo;s usage, worth, and value of its token, Conflux (CFX). Nevertheless, so far, the token has been beset by a downtrend in price movement. Currently valued at $0.28, its value has decreased by over 20% in the past 7 days.</p>
<p class="s6">Conflux's (CFX) current price movement has made investors consider Sparklo&rsquo;s presale, which comes with hopes of an uptrend price movement.</p>
<p class="s6">Immutable&rsquo;s (IMX) Downtrend Worries Investors</p>
<p class="s6">Immutable (IMX) is the first layer-two scaling solution for non-fungible tokens on Ethereum (ETH). The blockchain was designed to be an improvement on Ethereum, thereby making it more scalable, having a better user experience, and having a zero gas fee for minting and trading NFTs.</p>
<p class="s6">Gadget-Bot, a production company rumored to be developing &ldquo;Kadairo,&rdquo; a sci-fi universe, for over a decade, is bringing the game to Web3 on Immutable (IMX), which is slated for launch sometime this year. The game&rsquo;s setting is a post-apocalyptic world with battles against powerful magic users, playable in a combination of player-vs-environment and player-vs-player, and teams of three players.</p>
<p class="s6">This recent news is exciting to gamers and ultimately aims to tap into the gaming sector. However, this news currently has little to no effect on the token&rsquo;s current price, which trades at $0.95 at the time of writing after a drawback of 15% in the past 7 days.</p>
<p class="s8">Sparklo&rsquo;s (SPRK): A Better Investment Than Conflux (CFX) and Immutable (IMX)</p>
<p class="s6">Sparklo presale is currently believed to have better growth potential than Immutable (IMX) and Conflux (CFX) due to its unique investment model. Sparklo is a precious metals investment platform committed to offering opportunities for investment in rare metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. Investors can invest in fractionalized NFTs backed by these precious metals and not fiat or other tokens.</p>
<p class="s6">The project has been predicted to rise in value by over 2,000% in the next year, fueling investors' enthusiasm to be early adopters. With a cheap presale price of just $0.015, Sparklo is one of the better investments of 2023.</p>
<p class="s6">Lastly, and more importantly, the team has concluded its smart contract audit with the InterFi Network, is currently working on its KYC audit, and liquidity is locked for 100 years. This guarantees investment, thereby improving investors&rsquo; commitment.</p>
<p class="s6">Poised for its bull ride, Sparklo is bound for the moon, and investors are in for all of the excitement.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Following several weeks of growth, the cryptocurrency market has given in to bearish pressure. CoinMarketCap reports that the total crypto market capitalization currently stands at $1.14 trillion, representing a mere 0.20% increase from yesterday. </p>
<p class="s7">The primary reason for this was the economic uncertainties that impacted the US equity markets. Consequently, investors are advised to avoid cryptocurrencies like Conflux (CFX) and Arbitrum(ARB) as they suffered the most significant losses during the decline of major cryptocurrencies. Investors are now pushing towards more stable and promising altcoins like Sparklo (SPRK) which is currently at the presale stage.</p>
<p class="s9">Conflux (CFX) Drops 23% In The Past Week</p>
<p class="s7">Like Ethereum, Conflux (CFX) also suffered a substantial drop in value compared to Bitcoin. CoinMarketCap data shows that the token has declined by 23% in the past week, indicating a challenging week for Conflux (CFX) investors.</p>
<p class="s7">Meanwhile, investors need to exercise caution as a bearish breakout at $0.2847 could result in a drop in the price of Conflux (CFX) to $0.1471. The likelihood of this bearish scenario becoming a reality is high, as on-chain data suggest a strong bearish presence for Conflux (CFX).</p>
<p class="s7">Meanwhile, Conflux (CFX) has rebounded in the past hour to $0.293576 today. However, the token is still 22.51% from its all-time high in the past 7 days. </p>
<p class="s9">Arbitrum (ARB) Continues To Plummet </p>
<p class="s7">By press time, CoinMarketCap data shows that Arbitrum (ARB) has declined by approximately 21% within the same timeframe. Given that the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are also experiencing declines, Arbitrum (ARB) investors are closely monitoring market sentiment. </p>
<p class="s7">As a result, Arbitrum (ARB) is experiencing a more pronounced bearish trend as more sellers enter the market. Investors and traders should exercise caution before investing more funds into Arbitrum (ARB). </p>
<p class="s7">As per its current trajectory, Arbitrum (ARB) is likely to head toward $1.1930. In this scenario, more buyers would have to enter the market to defend this critical support level.</p>
<p class="s10">Sparklo (SPRK) Offers New Investment Opportunity In Precious Metals </p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) is revolutionizing the crypto and NFT investment landscape with a unique approach that will allow investors to purchase silver, platinum, and gold bars through the acquisition of fractionalized NFTs backed by these metals. This strategy has the potential to disrupt the crypto and NFT markets as it offers a novel way to invest in precious metals.</p>
<p class="s7">Historically, the high cost of purchasing precious metals has been a significant obstacle for many investors. However, Sparklo has taken an innovative approach to overcome these barriers. As a result, some investors predict that the project will generate a 5,000x return by the end of 2023.</p>
<p class="s7">To ensure users' funds' safety, InterFi Network has already audited Sparklo's (SPRK) reserves. The token's first presale phase has begun, offering investors the opportunity to purchase SPRK at a rate of $0.015 per token.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">As per the recent updates on the cryptocurrency market, analysts have identified Sparklo (SPRK) as a promising investment option. Besides, Polkadot (DOT) And Enjin Coin (ENJ) have succumbed to bearish momentum lately.</p>
<p class="s7">Also, Sparklo (SPRK) has emerged as the top contender, surpassing both Polkadot (DOT) and Enjin Coin (ENJ) even during the first phase of its public presale. Experts have predicted an astounding potential gain of 5,000 times for Sparklo (SPRK).</p>
<p class="s9">Polkadot (DOT) price analysis: Bear Dominate The Market </p>
<p class="s7">Today, bears are dominating the Polkadot (DOT) market, resulting in a downward trend in its price. Currently, the price has dropped to $5.91, falling below $6.00, which represents a 0.97% decline in the past 24 hours. </p>
<p class="s7">The reason behind this Polkadot (DOT) sell-off seems to be the absence of significant catalysts and the general weakness of the entire crypto market.</p>
<p class="s7">If the current bearish momentum continues, Polkadot (DOT) could drop to the $5.80 support level. If this support level is breached, the price may further decline toward $5.85 in the upcoming days. </p>
<p class="s7">Conversely, if buyers take charge and manage to drive the price of Polkadot (DOT) above $6.01, we may witness a recovery toward $5.98.</p>
<p class="s9">Enjin Coin (ENJ) Succumbs To Bearish Pressure</p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Enjin Coin (ENJ) is causing mixed feelings among investors. While some expect a bullish market and anticipate an increase in the token's price, others foresee a further decline in both the trading volume and price of Enjin Coin (ENJ).</p>
<p class="s7">CoinMarketCap reports that Enjin Coin (ENJ) is currently trading at $0.395919, with a 24-hour trading volume of $21,431,301. Enjin (ENJ) has experienced a decline of 0.15% in the last 24 hours and 12.24% over the past 7 days.</p>
<p class="s10">Sparklo (SPRK) Token Presale Garners Attention From Investors </p>
<p class="s7">During its presale, Sparklo (SPRK), which is the world's first decentralized metal trading platform, gained significant interest from both investors and analysts. </p>
<p class="s7">The project is expected to dominate both the metal and crypto markets for years to come, due to its innovative approach, practical usage, and potential for long-term growth.</p>
<p class="s7">Unlike traditional metal trading platforms, Sparklo aims to eliminate barriers such as delays, high transaction fees, and limited investment options, thus revolutionizing the industry.</p>
<p class="s7">Investors are highly optimistic about Sparklo's future, anticipating a potential increase of 5,000 times in value before the end of Q4 2023. This is mainly due to the highly lucrative nature of the precious metals industry. </p>
<p class="s7">Currently, the token is in the first phase of its presale and is priced at $0.015. However, only 60% of the total token supply of 1 billion is available during the Sparklo presale. Therefore, investors should act quickly to capitalize on this opportunity.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin put on a spurt today with a 5.3% rise in price. In the traditional banking sector First Republic Bank has been hammered again, falling as much as 60% over the last two days.</p>
Bitcoin surges again
<p>Bitcoin fooled the markets again as many were expecting the number one crypto asset to at least fall back to the $25,000 support. Bitcoin had been tracking down over the previous week or so, and many analysts were calling for a much deeper pull back.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s growth spurt took Bitcoin back to just touch the $30,000 resistance, taking the rest of the crypto market with it. At time of going to press bitcoin has taken a breath and is hovering at just over $29,700.&nbsp;</p>
Another bank about to fail?
<p>In the traditional banking sector things are still not looking too rosy. First Republic Bank is one of a group of banks that are on the edge following the demise of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether a group of the largest US banks, which helped to prop up the stricken bank to the tune of $30 billion, will have done enough to stop the rot.</p>
<p>If today&rsquo;s rout is anything to go by, the $30 billion may have been good money thrown after bad. At one point today, the FRC price had fallen a further 66% to the downside, taking the price from $14.20 down to $4.75.</p>
<p>Since then the price has edged back to $6.38, but confidence must be completely gone as depositors leave in droves. A report on the BBC stated that $100 billion in deposits had left the bank in March alone.</p>
Is this the game?
<p>Leading financial agencies, regulators, and banks, ably assisted by the mainstream media, are continuing to try and blacken the name of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector.</p>
<p>The game is to drive the average retail investor away from crypto by imposing suppressive regulations and by advising everyone to stay away from these digital assets.</p>
<p>The game is becoming ever-more difficult to pull off as the very institutions that the retail investor is being told are the safest, are those that are failing.</p>
Retail investors need a hedge
<p>In the current financial environment investors are starting to become aware of the situation of the banks. It&rsquo;s all very well for the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the FDIC to try to assuage fears by saying they will backstop all the bigger banks, but when that happens it's the average Joe/Jane who bear the cost through more diminishment of their purchasing power.</p>
<p>Bitcoin at least is still available for those wanting a hedge out of the bank madness. However, the Biden administration may have the perception that crypto is a real threat to the dollar, so stand by for more anti-crypto actions in the coming weeks and months.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a viral 2018 video that resurfaced on social media recently, Gary Gensler, the current chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), likened cryptocurrencies to cash.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto is cash
<p>Gensler is no stranger to the world of crypto, having taught a course on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2018.</p>
<p>The video, which was taken during a lecture at MIT, shows Gensler stating that cryptocurrencies are "a new form of cash," and that they share many similarities with traditional forms of money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He goes on to say that, like cash, cryptocurrencies are decentralised, borderless, and operate outside of the traditional banking system. In fact, he went as far as to say that:</p>

<p>&ldquo;3/4 of the market are not ICOs or NOT what would be called securities&rdquo;</p>

Crypto Twitter is shocked
<p>Crypto Twitter has been quick to react to Gensler's comments, with some expressing surprise that the chairman of the SEC would make such a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The below clip is from a Fall 2018 Graduate MIT course called "Blockchain and Money"Gary Gensler - the current President of the SEC, was the professor. The Hypocrisy speaks for itself 🐀"So we already know in the US and in many other jurisdictions that 3/4 of the market&hellip; pic.twitter.com/rjRWeq5P8X</p>
&mdash; zk-🦈 (@ZK_shark) April 25, 2023
<p>

</p>
Securities debate reignited for crypto
<p>However, not everyone is convinced that Gensler's comments are a sign that the SEC is ready to embrace cryptocurrencies. Regardless of where Gensler stands on the issue of cryptocurrencies, his comments have reignited the debate over whether cryptocurrencies should be treated as cash or as a new asset class entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some argue that cryptocurrencies should be regulated like traditional currencies, while others believe that they should be treated as a separate asset class with their own set of rules and regulations.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: cryptocurrencies are not going away anytime soon. As more and more people begin to embrace cryptocurrencies as a viable form of payment, it is likely that regulators will be forced to take a closer look at how they are treated under the law.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">After a month of steady price increases, Solana (SOL) is on a downward spiral, with a 10.61% decrease in the last week, despite the announcement that the Grayscale&reg; Solana Trust (the &lsquo;Trust&rsquo;) has begun trading on OTC Markets. While some investors are selling Solana (SOL), others are buying Collateral Network (COLT) tokens following a 40% price jump during its presale. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Solana (SOL) Is Hit Hard By Market Downturn </p>
<p class="s7">Since its rise to fame in 2021, Solana (SOL) has remained one of the most popular crypto investments worldwide. Ranked the 10th largest cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL) currently has a market cap of $8.7 billion, with daily trading volume often passing one billion. However, &nbsp;at the time of writing, both the Solana (SOL) price and trading volume have dipped. </p>

<p class="s7">Compared to top competitors in the market, Solana (SOL) has been one of the worst hit by recent trends. While Solana (SOL) has dropped over 10% in the last week, BNB has dropped just 0.90%, and Tron has dropped 1.55%. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s7">With signs that crypto growth is slowing down, experts believe that Solana (SOL) could drop another 8% as trading volume begins to dip. </p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Collateral Network (COLT) Defies Market Trends</p>
<p class="s7">As much of the mainstream crypto market begins to decline, Collateral Network (COLT) is thriving. Since its presale started, Collateral Network (COLT) has increased in value by 40%, with an additional price increase expected once the next phase of its presale sells out. </p>
<p class="s7">Collateral Network (COLT) looks to solve many of the issues associated with the pawnbroking industry. The current market is not only old fashioned, but in some circumstances also has a bad reputation. Collateral Network (COLT) looks to reinvent pawnbroking with DeFi technology. </p>
<p class="s7">Using Collateral Network (COLT), individuals can take a loan against their physical assets discreetly and without ever impacting their credit. Borrowers can use real-world assets, including cards, jewelry, real estate, and fine whiskeys, as collateral to obtain a loan.</p>
<p class="s7">To do this, Collateral Network (COLT) mints an NFT representing the borrower&rsquo;s physical asset and fractionalizes it in pieces. Lenders buy these fractions as a way to lend small amounts of money to fund a single loan. In return, investors receive a fixed interest rate until the borrower pays their loan. </p>
<p class="s7">With huge potential to disrupt the pawnbroking market, market analysts believe that Collateral Network (COLT) could hit $0.35 during its presale, providing investors with an early return of 3500%. </p>
<p class="s7">To get involved now, you can buy tokens through the presale portal with several cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, and BNB. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Conclusion</p>
<p class="s7">With Solana (SOL) decreasing in value, many investors are now looking toward other projects to boost their portfolios. As a result, demand for Collateral Network (COLT) is extremely likely to gain traction, making it a great time to buy before $COLT tokens surge. &nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Blockchain security hacks have been increasing in recent times. Halborn, a blockchain security firm, has detected an exploitable vulnerability that will impact Litecoin and ZCash. However not all news from the crypto industry is sad as Sparklo, a new cryptocurrency investment project, continues to thrive.</p>
<p class="s3">Litecoin and ZCash On the Verge of Been Exploited</p>
<p class="s3">Blockchain network flaws might put billions of dollars at risk by causing all protocols that depend on them to function improperly. "On vulnerable networks, a successful exploitation of the relevant bug could lead to denial of service or remote code execution," writes Behnke.</p>
<p class="s3">Halborn, a blockchain security company, has discovered a number of important and exploitable flaws affecting more than 280 networks. Among the impacted blockchains are Litecoin and Zcash, which support multiple DeFi protocols and other Web3 platforms for the metaverse, gaming, and asset trading. While these blockchains are still unpatched, a total of $25 billion (about Rs. 2,06,300 crore) is at risk.</p>
<p class="s3">According to the official blog post, Holborn researchers discovered the most dangerous peer-to-peer (p2p) communication vulnerability. If exploited, this flaw could allow attackers to generate consensus messages, deliver them to specific nodes, and then take those nodes offline. A vulnerability like this might eventually expose networks to 51% assaults and other major issues.</p>
<p class="s3">The security company describes the technical warning signs that can assist programmers determine whether the Rab13s has affected their blockchains and claims to have discovered a fix for the flaw. "Halborn created an exploit kit for Rab13s with great success. The designated stakeholders have received all the technical knowledge they require to fix the bugs and deliver the required fixes for the community and miners." Behnke continued. </p>
<p class="s3">If these security issues are not fixed on time Litecoin and Zcash are in danger of losing maximum value. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo: Shining Bright As Ever</p>
<p class="s3">All can't be bad in the crypto industry. Despite the threatening news about Litecoin and Zcash, other cryptocurrencies continue to perform well free of blockchain security bugs. </p>
<p class="s3">Experienced investors are aware that buying early on promising projects is the key to long-term gains, and with Sparklo, that theory may be confirmed once more. This coin is now in Level One of its public presale, with a price of $0.015. During the Sparklo presale, just 60% of the 1B token supply will be accessible, and they are selling at a fast rate. </p>
<p class="s3">According to notable crypto analysts, Sparklo might grow by 3,200% to $0.50 by December 2023. We are confident that this forecast will come true as a result of the features and real-world benefits that Sparklo will bring to the metal trading industry.</p>
<p class="s3">The platform is building itself to become the first cryptocurrency investment platform for precious metal objects. Investors will be able to make their investments by aquring fractional NFTs. </p>
<p class="s3">With the overwhelming news of hacks on blockchains, you might be concerned about the security of the Sparklo platform; there's no need for that. Sparklo has completed it's audit with InterFi Network, and a KYC audit is nearing completion. Plus the platform will lock liquidity for 100 years while the team tokens will be locked for 1,000 days. </p>
<p class="s3">If you wait too long, you may miss out on the opportunity to purchase this prospective blue-chip token at a very low price. Remember that early investments yield maximum long-term gains.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Trust Wallet, one of the leading self-custodial and multi-chain wallets, has partnered with Web3Auth to simplify Web3 onboarding using social logins. The move aims to improve the user experience and accelerate the mass adoption of Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onboarding on wallets can be complex and stressful, requiring users to manage and remember their seed phrase, a critical piece of information that is the key to their digital assets. With the current challenges that users face with wallets, this can drive the level of adoption, making it easier for Web2 users to interact.&nbsp;</p>
Safeguarding Users from Human Error and Single Point of Failure
<p>According to the announcement, Trust Wallet's new MPC (Multi-Party Computation) solution, powered by Web3Auth, eliminates the need for a written seed phrase, thus reducing the risk of human error and a single point of failure. Instead, users can use their existing Google, Apple, Telegram, or Discord accounts to quickly and securely access Trust Wallet services. Trust Wallet users can also use SMS OTP and email recovery to further increase security and ease of use. This brings two-factor authentication to the forefront, allowing users to have a web2-like experience in web3. Currently, the MPC feature is available in the beta version and will be expanded to all users soon. These features make it easy for an average "normie" to try crypto without feeling lost or confused.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a significant step for us because it benefits everyone involved. Users can now enjoy an easy-to-use experience while still choosing a self-custodial wallet to manage their cryptocurrencies. By integrating with Web3Auth, we keep providing greater user experience and long-term value to boost broader Web3 adoption," said Eric Chang, Head of Product at Trust Wallet.</p>

<p>With the new MPC two-factor solution, Trust Wallet users can now explore the Web3 world seamlessly and securely across more than 70 blockchains while maintaining full custody of their assets. This option provides an alternative to the previously limited choices of either a custodial wallet with easier access but lower transparency or a fully custodial wallet with more risk and complexity.</p>
Redefining Web3 Security
<p>According to Zhen Yu Yong, the co-founder, and CEO of Web3Auth, lost seed phrases are a messy business and represent one of the significant risks for billions of dollars in crypto losses. He further added that he believes the industry is just starting to adopt Two-Factor Wallets for enhanced security, and the collaboration with Trust Wallet is a significant milestone in their efforts to make enterprise-grade MPC available to all.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A Bitcoin white paper sneakily introduced through every MacOS update since 2018 has been removed from the upcoming operating system update.&nbsp;</p>
Secret &ldquo;Easter Egg&rdquo; Removed
<p>After facing recent queries, Apple has quietly removed the Bitcoin white paper that was a part of every Mac computer for over five years. From now onwards, the digital whitepaper will not be a part of any operating system updates on the MacOS. Although the whitepaper has been included in every update of the software since 2018, most users were not aware of it till very recently.&nbsp;</p>
Secret Doc First Discovered In 2020
<p>It appears to be first noticed by designer Joshua Dickens who discovered it in 2020 and posted about it on Twitter. He discovered that the document was bundled with a test driver for Virtual Scanner II that would allow developers to work with the operating system&rsquo;s image capture module. Clearly, the files were tucked away in hidden system files and not inteded to be discovered by most regular users. A thread was started on the topic on Apple&rsquo;s support forums on April 2021. However, most users still remained oblivious about it till more recently, when prominent technologist Andy Baio addressed it last month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He wrote,</p>

<p>"Of all the documents in the world, why was the Bitcoin whitepaper chosen? Is there a secret Bitcoin maxi working at Apple? Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDF for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users."</p>

Users Wonder Why As Apple Removes BTC Doc
<p>Many users questioned the tech company about why the Bitcoin whitepaper was included in the updates. The company did not directly address the matter, instead choosing to quietly remove the offending document from the upcoming version of the software update. The removal was first brought into attention by the participants in Apple&rsquo;s Beta Software Program, who discovered that the upcoming version 13.4 of the MacOS Ventura did not contain the file or any of the elements which it was previously bundled with.&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;Inside Joke&rdquo; Among Developers

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bitcoin white paper sneakily introduced through every MacOS update since 2018 has been removed from the upcoming operating system update.&nbsp;</p>
Secret &ldquo;Easter Egg&rdquo; Removed
<p>After facing recent queries, Apple has quietly removed the Bitcoin white paper that was a part of every Mac computer for over five years. From now onwards, the digital whitepaper will not be a part of any operating system updates on the MacOS. Although the whitepaper has been included in every update of the software since 2018, most users were not aware of it till very recently.&nbsp;</p>
Secret Doc First Discovered In 2020
<p>It appears to be first noticed by designer Joshua Dickens who discovered it in 2020 and posted about it on Twitter. He discovered that the document was bundled with a test driver for Virtual Scanner II that would allow developers to work with the operating system&rsquo;s image capture module. Clearly, the files were tucked away in hidden system files and not inteded to be discovered by most regular users. A thread was started on the topic on Apple&rsquo;s support forums on April 2021. However, most users still remained oblivious about it till more recently, when prominent technologist Andy Baio addressed it last month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He wrote,</p>

<p>"Of all the documents in the world, why was the Bitcoin whitepaper chosen? Is there a secret Bitcoin maxi working at Apple? Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDF for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users."</p>

Users Wonder Why As Apple Removes BTC Doc
<p>Many users questioned the tech company about why the Bitcoin whitepaper was included in the updates. The company did not directly address the matter, instead choosing to quietly remove the offending document from the upcoming version of the software update. The removal was first brought into attention by the participants in Apple&rsquo;s Beta Software Program, who discovered that the upcoming version 13.4 of the MacOS Ventura did not contain the file or any of the elements which it was previously bundled with.&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;Inside Joke&rdquo; Among Developers
<p>Reportedly, Baio later claimed that he was informed that the document was filed as a developer work ticket last year and was assigned to the same person who initially placed it in the system. He claimed that it was supposed to be an inside joke among Apple engineers and there was no underlying meaning behind its inclusion in the software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it is clearly one of the many Easter eggs that Apple developers have hidden in the software, wild conspiracy theorists have not hesitated in proclaiming that Apple&rsquo;s co-founder and its erstwhile CEO, Steve Jobs (the predecessor of Tim Cook) is the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the unknown creator of Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>India&rsquo;s Enforcement Directorate (ED) has frozen around 916 million from bank accounts linked to companies involved in the HPZ token scam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to authorities, the amount was seized after multiple raids conducted simultaneously in Mumbai, Gurugram, and Bengaluru.&nbsp;</p>
The HPZ Token Scam&nbsp;
<p>According to the Enforcement Directorate, the HPZ token was an app-based token promising users substantial gains by investing in mining hardware for various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. The case was investigated based on an FIR (First Information Report) registered by the Cyber Crime Police Station, located in Kohima, Nagaland. Over the course of the investigation, authorities discovered a much larger conspiracy that involved a number of entities, all involved with money laundering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In connection with the fraud, authorities have frozen around 916 million, located in various bank accounts associated with companies engaged in the fraud. However, sources within the Enforcement Directorate, the bank, or payment gateway companies are themselves not being investigated. However, their premises were searched so that authorities could gather information regarding suspicious accounts maintained by the companies accused in the scam.</p>
The ED Investigation&nbsp;
<p>Investigation into the scam by the Enforcement Directorate revealed that Shigoo Technology Private Limited and Lillian Technocab Pvt. Ltd collected funds from investors under the guise of HPZ tokens. Upon further investigation, authorities discovered that Bhupesh Arora and some of his associates had control of Shigoo Technology Private Limited. Arora was involved in the operation of unregistered gaming websites and apps and was swindling gullible individuals through these apps and websites and collecting money. With the current freeze, the total funds frozen during the course of the investigation stands at 178 Crore. The Enforcement Directorate stated in a press release,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The previous week&rsquo;s search was conducted] in respect of the accounts held by the entities controlled by Bhupesh Arora and his associates in connection with an investigation relating to the misuse of an App-based token named &lsquo;HPZ&rsquo; and other similar applications by several entities.&rdquo;</p>

India&rsquo;s Uneasy Relationship With Crypto&nbsp;
<p>India has been relatively skeptical when it comes to crypto, with the Reserve Bank of India firmly against cryptocurrencies. In fact, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said that the banking crisis unfolding in the United States of America highlights the risk crypto poses to the traditional financial system. The country&rsquo;s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has repeatedly stated that crypto regulation needs global consensus to be effective&mdash;a point she reiterated just a couple of days ago. India has also introduced money laundering provisions to govern the crypto sector. The move comes as the country&rsquo;s latest measure to tighten its oversight of digital assets operating in the country.</p>

CertiK has assured that it will share relevant information with authorities if foul play can be suspected, or if insider information was possibly leaked.Blockchain security firm Peckshield has also issued disclosures on the threat actor, who has started moving some of the stolen funds to exchanges, with $133,800 USDC sent to MEXC Global and $31,000 USDC sent to Binance.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum has started the distribution of 113 million ARB tokens to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) within its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitrum has already airdropped ARB tokens worth $120 million.&nbsp;</p>
ARB Token Distribution Begins&nbsp;
<p>Arbitrum announced the news on their Twitter handle, stating that the test transaction conducted earlier in the week was successful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The full distribution of the DAO airdrop will take place today with those that have confirmed receiving the test transaction that was sent earlier last week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to data from leading Ethereum analytics firms such as Arkham, Nansen, and LookOnChain, Arbitrum has already transferred 100 million ARB tokens to the addresses of protocols eligible for the airdrop. Arbitrum has allocated an initial amount of 113 ARB tokens to 125 eligible DAOs. This is worth around $148 million at current prices. According to data from Spotonchain, around 90 million ARB tokens, worth around $120 million at current valuation, have already been distributed.&nbsp;</p>
Eligible DAOs&nbsp;
<p>There are 125 decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that are eligible to receive the ARB token airdrop. The leading recipients of the airdrop include protocols such as SushiSwap, Uniswap, Dopex, Balancer, Radiant, GMX, and Treasure DAO. Among these, Treasure DAO and GMX are set to receive the highest allocation, getting around 8 million ARB tokens, respectively. Meanwhile, other protocols in the list, such as Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Dopex, will receive between 3 million and 5 million ARB tokens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The DAO Distribution of the Arbitrum airdrop occurred last night. Around $120M of $ARB was sent to Arbitrum protocols - although not all projects have received their allocation yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apart from the projects mentioned above, another 118 protocols in the Arbitrum ecosystem will receive the ARB token airdrop. According to the Arbitrum team, the distribution of the ARB token will be completed by the end of the week.&nbsp;</p>
Fueling Ecosystem Growth&nbsp;
<p>After receiving the airdrop, DAOs will have complete autonomy when it comes to determining how to distribute and utilize their ARB token airdrop. Protocols can reward users retroactively or incentivize usage and liquidity by introducing new ARB incentives. The Arbitrum team explained in a blog post that the primary goal of the airdrop toward DAO treasuries was the localization of community governance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ultimate goal is the localization of community governance. Each protocol knows its community best, and it will be up to the respective DAOs to determine how to distribute governance within their community. It is our hope and intention that by distributing tokens to Arbitrum DAOs, governance power will ultimately be shared with a broader variety of users than just those eligible for the user airdrop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several protocols have committed to using the funds to fuel ecosystem growth. PlutusDAO has intended to strengthen the protocol using the additional funds. Andrew Kang, the co-founder of Mechanism Capital, stated that the additional funds added into the Arbitrum ecosystem could help significantly boost liquidity across DeFi projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Optimism has also launched similar programs to improve the usage and liquidity of its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Smaller Protocols To Benefit The Most&nbsp;
<p>According to on-chain data analyst The Data Nerd, protocols that have smaller market capitalizations would benefit the most from the ARB incentives. According to the analyst, smaller ecosystems and protocols such as PlutusDAO, Vesta Finance, and Yin Finance would end up receiving incentives significantly greater than their current market cap, helping boost their ecosystem growth.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Russia launched a cross-border payment system &ldquo;bound by no restrictions&rdquo; where digital currencies can settle cross-border transactions. </p>
<p>On Monday, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov announced that the country is to implement a new cross-border payment system &ldquo;bound by no restrictions.&rdquo; Minister Siluanov said digital currencies could be used for international payments without interference.</p>
<p>Russian news outlet Tass reported the news.</p>
Russia Introduces an Unrestricted Crypto Cross-Border Payment System
<p>The finance minister is quoted as saying:</p>

<p>We are launching an alternative system of payments based on modern technologies (digital financial assets, digital currencies).</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>Digital currencies could be used in cross-border payments. This is just at the earliest phase of discussions, but the future lies with the use of the digital ruble, the digital yuan, and other similar currencies.</p>

<p>Minister Siluanov emphasised:</p>

<p>This is a system of payments that is bound by no restrictions. Two parties come to an agreement, make settlement payments, and no other country could step in and freeze such payments.</p>

Russia Crippled by Economic Sanctions
<p>Following Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Western nations imposed harsh economic sanctions on the Federation. In a bid to circumvent the sanctions and a bit of desperation, the State Duma &ndash; the lower house of parliament, said it would consider a bill that would legalise a crypto market within the country.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s infamous president, Vladimir Putin, criticised the sanctions against his home country, labelling them as &ldquo;illegitimate restrictions.&rdquo; President Putin pointed out that the current global financial system is highly monopolised and expressed the need for a global payment system powered by blockchain technology devoid of interference. He added:</p>

<p>The existing system of international payments is expensive, the system of its correspondent accounts and regulation are controlled by a narrow club of states and financial groups.</p>

Bank of Russia Tests International Crypto Payments
<p>Not long after President Putin commented on the usefulness of a blockchain-based global payment system, the Bank of Russia (BoR) said it was planning to test the use of cryptocurrencies for international payments within a regulatory sandbox framework.</p>
<p>First Deputy Chairperson of the Central Bank, Olga Skorobogatova, said the BoR would implement a pilot project with interested market players. She added:</p>

<p>We currently plan to test using cryptocurrency for international payments, meaning for international economic activities, within the framework of the regulatory sandbox.</p>
