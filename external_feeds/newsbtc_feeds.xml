					<description><![CDATA[The comeback of the Stellar Lumens (XLM) price keeps going on. In the last 24 hours, XLM has risen by another 15%, bringing the Ripple competitor&#8217;s price in line with XRP. Indeed, both tokens have risen by close to 65% (at this stage) since the summary judgment in Ripple&#8217;s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Remarkably, the relationship between Stellar Lumens (XLM) and Ripple&#8217;s XRP has been an intriguing tale of correlation and decoupling. As the market reacted to the recent developments in the Ripple-SEC battle, XLM followed suit, experiencing a remarkable price surge. However, as the broader market conditions cast their shadows, the question arises: Can Stellar Lumens maintain its newfound independence and continue its upward trajectory? The Correlation Between XLM and XRP It is no secret that Stellar Lumens and Ripple&#8217;s XRP share many similarities in their blockchain technologies and use cases. Moreover, the founder&#8217;s Jed McCaleb’s connection to Ripple adds another layer of intrigue, as investors hope that XLM will not be deemed a security by regulators. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Surges Over 43% In One Week, What’s Pushing It? This connection has often resulted in XLM mirroring the price movements of XRP. The market&#8217;s anticipation of developments for Ripple being equally impactful for Stellar has often led to such correlated movements, just like last week after the Ripple ruling. However, in recent days, Stellar Lumens has managed to stand on its own feet, showcasing its ability to decouple from the fortunes of XRP. One factor for this may have been its partnership with MoneyGram, which yielded the innovative B2B service called MoneyGram Access. This service enables the conversion of the stablecoin USDC into cash worldwide through MoneyGram&#8217;s branch network, tapping into Stellar&#8217;s ledger for seamless execution. This strategic collaboration has not only bolstered Stellar&#8217;s use case but also may catalyzed its recent surge in price. Related Reading: Stellar Makes Surprise 70% Rally – Start Of Something Big For XLM? With the integration of Access into various applications and fiat ramps, XLM&#8217;s demand and utility is substantially boosted. For instance, the HoneyCoin app&#8217;s integration of Access for straightforward cash out in multiple African countries and the United Kingdom might have contributed to Stellar&#8217;s outperformance relative to XRP in recent days. We&#8217;re excited to share @honeycoinapp users can now cash out of their USDC balance at supported @MoneyGram locations in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana, and the UK 🥳️ Another real-world use case for @Circle’s USDC on Stellar.https://t.co/0JKNhdJMx3 — Stellar (@StellarOrg) July 17, 2023 A second factor for XLM’s recently strong performance could be the extremely high interest on the futures market. The open interest for Stellar Lumens has skyrocketed to over $120 million yesterday, a level not seen since the peak of the bull market in November 2021. Notably, this phenomenon is similar to XRP which has also seen open interest soar to prior record levels. Stellar Lumens Price Outlook Despite experiencing a sharp rally, Stellar Lumens still remains in rather bearish territory when looking at the 1-week chart. For this week, it’s crucial that the XLM price regains the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0,1583 as well as the 200-week EMA at $0,1597 (blue line). With the weekly RSI at 73, another leg up could be possible. On the 1-day time frame, XLM remains above all moving averages (EMAs). For a further bullish trajectory, it&#8217;s important that Stellar hold above the support at $0.1250. Should this happen, XLM could experience a further 35% rally towards the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. However, a drop below the support level at $0.1250 would challenge the bullish view.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market swiftly turned bearish from yesterday&#8217;s scarcely bullish outlook, and top coins have receded farther from their new-found support. But interestingly, MarkerDao’s MKR appears unperturbed by the market’s gloomy sentiment as MKR soared higher with massive gains, adding over 17% to its value on the day.  MKR Price Outlook Over the last day, the MRK token has witnessed several steep rise and fall. The digital asset reached a day-high of $1,203 at 2:30 am UTC on July 21, a 20% increase from its July 20 opening price. Related Reading: Best Bitcoin Roulette Sites And Crypto Roulette Games MKR had lost momentum shortly after the $1,203 peak spike, falling to $1,134. However, it continued the fluctuations before regaining momentum for a more bullish rise. At the time of writing, Maker&#8217;s price is changing hands at $1,162, with a 17.63% 24-hour price increase.  Maker’s current price is 26% higher than its value seven days ago and it may surpass $1,200 if it sustains the current bullish rally. A close look at MKR’s sudden price resurgence suggests the token might be riding on some other bullish waves. Possible Reasons Behind Maker’s Sudden Price Surge Maker&#8217;s dramatic price surge may be due to recent developments in the MakerDAO ecosystem. On-chain sleuth, Lookonchain, reported some conspicuous activities by top VC firms Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z and CMS Holdings, which are suspected to be responsible for the price surge. According to the report, a16z recently deposited large chunks of Maker tokens to Coinbase. The venture capital company deposited 12,864 MKR tokens worth approximately $12.6 million at the time.  The firm also reportedly transferred another 6,900 MKR, worth $8 million by today’s exchange rates, to a new address, presumably with plans to deposit the funds on an exchange. Currently, a16z holds around 12,396 MKR tokens worth ~$14.4 million. Also, Lookonchain reported that CMS, a blockchain-focused private investment company, reduced its recently acquired MKR holdings. CMS Holdings deposited 525 MKR tokens worth $614,000 to Binance two hours before the sharp price surge. CMS previously withdrew 1,325 Maker tokens worth $1.54 million from Binance and Bitget at an average price of $793. The investment firm now holds 800 MKR, worth approximately $936,000. Implications Of a16z And CMS Holding’s Activities The unprecedented change in the token holdings of these top market players must have significantly contributed to the token&#8217;s price spike. The market positively reacted to the massive MKR sales, leading to increased trading volume and price surge. The sharp spike in MKR’s price can be interpreted this way: the trading activity of institutional investors like a16z and CMS Holdings draws more attention to Maker. The renewed interest could bring new buyers, exerting more demand pressure on the token and causing the price to spike further. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Positive Price Movement, Bulls Set Crosshair At $0.075 However, the firms&#8217; Maker holdings reduction may raise questions about the token&#8217;s long-term value. This potentially bodes badly for MKR as it could depress investor sentiment, causing massive selloffs which might push the price down.

					<description><![CDATA[Chainlink (CHAIN) has recently experienced a surge in its short-term price action, delivering considerable gains to its holders. The excitement surrounding this upward momentum has been palpable, but astute observers have noticed some intriguing indications that suggest this hike might not necessarily signify the peak for LINK.  Such a notion is not mere speculation; instead, it finds its foundation in the actions of LINK holders and the patterns observed in trading activity. These compelling insights offer a glimpse into the future trajectory of Chainlink and its possibilities. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Positive Price Movement, Bulls Set Crosshair At $0.075 LINK Price Surge Fueled By Increased Accumulation, Network Activity LINK&#8217;s recent price surge has been underpinned by a significant token accumulation and notable activity on the Chainlink network. According to a LINK price report referencing Santiment data, the number of addresses holding between 0 to 1 million LINK has seen an incredible increase, potentially playing a pivotal role in driving the token&#8217;s value. Source: Santiment Coingecko data shows LINK registering an impressive $8.33 price, and a remarkable 24-hour rally of 19.0%. In the last week, the crypto has risen 15.0% in value. Source: Coingecko However, the surge appears far from an isolated event, as the accumulation rate has shown no signs of slowing down. Such consistent accumulation often suggests a growing conviction among investors and traders that LINK&#8217;s value may be on the verge of another substantial increase. Insights From Network Activity A telling metric, the adjusted price to Daily Active Addresses (DAA) divergence, provided intriguing insights into the Chainlink network&#8217;s current state. As the token&#8217;s price rose, the number of active addresses decreased. When looking at historical trends, this pattern has indicated previous upswings for the Chainlink network. Consequently, this data hints at the possibility of another impending price upswing for the LINK token. Bitcoin (BTC) trading at $29,855 today. Chart: TradingView.com The number of developers actively contributing to the Chainlink network has also experienced a significant increase since the first week of July. Technical analysts closely scrutinize chart patterns and price movements to identify potential trends and reversals. The recent rally in LINK&#8217;s price may have triggered breakout signals and attracted momentum traders, causing the price to surge even further. These technical indicators and chart patterns can act as self-fulfilling prophecies as traders react to them, potentially leading to a cascading effect on the token&#8217;s price. As the market evolves, tracking these key metrics, understanding market sentiment, and assessing broader market dynamics will be crucial in making informed decisions about LINK&#8217;s prospects.

<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chainlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Coingecko data</a> shows LINK registering an impressive $8.33 price, and a remarkable 24-hour rally of 19.0%. In the last week, the crypto has risen 15.0% in value.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-543716" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-136.png" alt="" width="935" height="67" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-136.png 935w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-136-460x33.png 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-136-860x62.png 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-136-768x55.png 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-136-750x54.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px"/></p>

<p>However, the surge appears far from an isolated event, as the accumulation rate has shown no signs of slowing down. Such consistent accumulation often suggests a growing conviction among investors and traders that LINK&#8217;s value may be on the verge of another substantial increase.</p>
<h2><strong>Insights From Network Activity</strong></h2>
<p>A telling metric, the adjusted price to Daily Active Addresses (DAA) divergence, provided intriguing insights into the Chainlink network&#8217;s current state.</p>
<p>As the token&#8217;s price rose, the number of active addresses decreased. When looking at historical trends, this pattern has indicated previous upswings for the Chainlink network. Consequently, this data hints at the possibility of another impending price upswing for the LINK token.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/6d70N6Vr/" width="2475" height="1187"/></p>

<p>The number of <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/_oTcqxU8__sCl" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developers actively contributing to the Chainlink network</a> has also experienced a significant increase since the first week of July.</p>
<p>Technical analysts closely scrutinize chart patterns and price movements to identify potential trends and reversals. The recent rally in LINK&#8217;s price may have triggered breakout signals and attracted momentum traders, causing the price to surge even further. </p>
<p>These technical indicators and chart patterns can act as self-fulfilling prophecies as traders react to them, potentially leading to a cascading effect on the token&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>As the market evolves, tracking these key metrics, understanding market sentiment, and assessing broader market dynamics will be crucial in making informed decisions about LINK&#8217;s prospects.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that Chainlink&#8217;s social dominance has observed a large spike after its sharp price surge, a possible sign that the top may be here. Chainlink Social Dominance Rises To 3rd Largest In Cryptocurrency Sector According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, LINK is the third most trending asset in the market right now. The indicator of interest here is the &#8220;social dominance,&#8221; to understand which another metric needs to be looked at first: the social volume. The social volume measures the total amount of social media text documents (that is, text-based posts, threads, messages, etc.) that are making mentions of a given asset (which, in the current case, is Chainlink). This metric basically provides us with information about the degree of discussion that a particular coin is receiving across major social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, and 4chan. Now, the aforementioned social dominance is a metric that compares the social volume of a cryptocurrency, with combined that of the top 100 assets by market cap in the space. Naturally, in the case of LINK, this indicator tells us how much talk related to the top coins in the market is coming from discussions centered on Chainlink alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Crucial Retest: Which Of These Historical Patterns Will Repeat? Here is a chart that shows the trend in the LINK social dominance over the past month: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, Chainlink&#8217;s social dominance has registered a large spike following the rapid growth in the price of the cryptocurrency during the last couple of days. At the peak of this latest sharp surge, the asset&#8217;s value had climbed above the $8.4 mark, but since then the cryptocurrency has gone down a bit. Nonetheless, the price is still floating above $8.1 and the coin&#8217;s gains stand at an impressive 19%. Historically, rallies like these have attracted a lot of eyes to LINK, so it&#8217;s not particularly surprising that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s share of discussions in the sector has shot up. The scale of this rise, though, may be a slightly worrying sign. Chainlink is the third most talked about asset in the market right now, despite being only the 20th largest in terms of market cap. Related Reading: Market Alert: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Capitulation Triggers Cautionary Outlook Generally, when an asset is being talked about too much, the price can become more probable to show a move opposite to what this large crowd is expecting. Given that the latest discussions have come just after the rally, it would appear likely that these talks are in fact a sign of hype in the market. Such amount of hype has often proved to be a bearish signal for Chainlink, as tops become more likely to form in this kind of market environment. If a similar pattern follows now as well, then it may mean that the current social dominance spike is a sign that a local top is already in for the cryptocurrency.

					<description><![CDATA[Solana, a key player in the Layer-1 blockchain network domain, has shown a substantial improvement in the network&#8217;s uptime and reliability this year, with just one recorded outage so far since the year 2023 began. According to a performance report released by the Solana Foundation on July 20, the network&#8217;s stability and performance saw a significant uptick in the first half of 2023. The report presents detailed metrics including the network&#8217;s uptime and the ratio of non-voting to voting transactions, which are key indicators of network efficiency and reliability. Addressing The Network Reliability Challenge Despite its promising features, Solana has historically faced issues relating to network uptime and reliability. These problems, referred to as a &#8220;curse&#8221; by Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, were largely attributed to the network&#8217;s low-cost transactions, which according to Yakovenko frequently led to Solana network outages. Related Reading: Solana Shining Moment: What To Expect After SOL Crossed $20 1/ The Solana Foundation has released the most recent @Solana Network Performance report. The Solana network’s performance has improved through H1 2023, as measured by uptime, the ratio of non-voting-to-voting transactions, &#38; more. Read the full report: https://t.co/naOftyknLA pic.twitter.com/yI9Q8swWdT — Solana Foundation (@SolanaFndn) July 20, 2023 However, the latest report offers a refreshing contrast to this history, marking a 100% uptime since February 25. This performance ensures that Solana completed an entire quarter without any outages, with the only disruption of the year in February causing a nearly 19-hour network blackout. Indicators Of Network Efficiency In addition to its uptime record, Solana is also making strides in the ratio of voting to non-voting transactions. To clarify, voting transactions are carried out when a validator, a crucial component of the blockchain ecosystem, gets involved in validating and approving one or more proposed data blocks on the network. On the other hand, non-voting transactions are those instigated by user activities on the blockchain, which could include actions such as sending or receiving tokens, executing smart contracts, or interacting with decentralized applications (DApps). The Solana Foundation report also predicts a decreasing these voting-to-non-voting transaction ratios over time, as increased network efficiency should result in a lower overall percentage of voting transactions. Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana Smashes Key Resistance, $22 Could Be Next Furthermore, Solana’s throughput, measured in terms of transactions per second (TPS), is another vital indicator of network efficiency. The report reveals that Solana&#8217;s maximum daily TPS has been on an upward trajectory since January, a trend closely associated with new network upgrades. According to data from Dune Analytics, the transaction rate on the Solana network currently stands at 3,781 transactions per second. Meanwhile, the network&#8217;s native token SOL has been in a bearish trend in the past week.  Particularly, SOL has plunged by more than 10% in the past 7 days. The asset has dropped from a high of trading above $30 last Friday following a quick spike to a low of $25.39 at the time of writing, down by roughly 6.6% in the past 24 hours.

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin (DOGE) is fixated on a crucial juncture in its price trajectory. Having recently faltered at the previous range-high, the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits to see whether history will repeat itself.  DOGE bulls, ever resilient, have their sights firmly set on re-targeting $0.075 &#8211; a level that could signify a significant breakthrough if achieved. As the digital coin continues to command headlines and curiosity, the question on everyone&#8217;s mind is whether DOGE can overcome this critical hurdle and forge a path toward new heights.  DOGE Bulls Eye Crucial Re-Entry As Price Finds Support As per Coingecko data, DOGE currently stands at $0.071, displaying a modest 24-hour rally of 0.5% alongside consistent seven-day gains of the same percentage. The recent price action indicates that DOGE has established higher highs and lows since mid-June, granting bulls a favorable advantage.  Source: Coingecko However, the recovery momentarily stumbled upon reaching the previous range-high of $0.0751. Nevertheless, bullish investors saw an opportunity for re-entry at the price imbalance and FVG (fair value gap) located between $0.0694 to $0.0655. Related Reading: Stellar Makes Surprise 70% Rally – Start Of Something Big For XLM? A DOGE price report reveals a notable pattern where generally, the price tends to hit the FVG before resuming its prior trajectory. This trend has been evident as DOGE has already experienced two rebounds from the FVG zone. Furthermore, this FVG range aligns harmoniously with the ascending trendline support. Dogecoin (DOGE) has a market cap of $10 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com Considering this backdrop, a price rejection at the previous range-high of $0.075 might find support at the above confluence area. Therefore, this confluence area holds significant interest for bullish investors, as it could offer another compelling buying opportunity. Dogecoin Faces Mixed Sentiments  While Dogecoin&#8217;s popularity as a meme coin remains strong, a separate report paints a sad picture for the cryptocurrency, suggesting that investors are increasingly exploring alternative options. The once-hyped meme coin is trading more than 90% below its all-time high, signaling a significant decline in value. Amidst conflicting views among analysts, some with a bullish outlook foresee a potential surge toward $0.07. However, contrasting opinions assert a more pessimistic perspective, predicting a likely dip below $0.05. DOGE price action in the last seven days.

While some future price predictions remain bullish, investors are now cautious, realizing that such levels may not necessarily translate to the high long-term ROI they once expected. Consequently, many opt to diversify their investments, seeking alternative opportunities beyond the world of meme coins. (This site&#8217;s content should not be construed as investment advice.

<p>DOGE bulls, ever resilient, have their sights firmly set on re-targeting $0.075 &#8211; a level that could signify a significant breakthrough if achieved. </p>
<p>As the digital coin continues to command headlines and curiosity, the question on everyone&#8217;s mind is whether DOGE can overcome this critical hurdle and forge a path toward new heights. </p>
<h2><strong>DOGE Bulls Eye Crucial Re-Entry As Price Finds Support</strong></h2>
<p>As per <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin/usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Coingecko data</a>, DOGE currently stands at $0.071, displaying a modest 24-hour rally of 0.5% alongside consistent seven-day gains of the same percentage. The recent price action indicates that DOGE has established higher highs and lows since mid-June, granting bulls a favorable advantage. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-543661" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-131.png" alt="" width="938" height="68" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-131.png 938w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-131-460x33.png 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-131-860x62.png 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-131-768x56.png 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-131-750x54.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px"/></p>

<p>However, the recovery momentarily stumbled upon reaching the previous range-high of $0.0751. Nevertheless, bullish investors saw an opportunity for re-entry at the price imbalance and FVG (fair value gap) located between $0.0694 to $0.0655.</p>

<p>A <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://ambcrypto.com/doge-bulls-re-target-0-075-will-they-succeed-this-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DOGE price report</a> reveals a notable pattern where generally, the price tends to hit the FVG before resuming its prior trajectory. This trend has been evident as DOGE has already experienced two rebounds from the FVG zone. Furthermore, this FVG range aligns harmoniously with the ascending trendline support.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/tfnbLg3m/" width="2475" height="1187"/></p>

<p>Considering this backdrop, a price rejection at the previous range-high of $0.075 might find support at the above confluence area. Therefore, this confluence area holds significant interest for bullish investors, as it could offer another compelling buying opportunity.</p>
<h2><strong>Dogecoin Faces Mixed Sentiments </strong></h2>
<p>While Dogecoin&#8217;s popularity as a meme coin remains strong, a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://finbold.com/dogecoin-price-declines-tradecurve-charts-indicate-another-price-surge-on-the-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">separate report</a> paints a sad picture for the cryptocurrency, suggesting that investors are increasingly exploring alternative options. The once-hyped meme coin is trading more than 90% below its all-time high, signaling a significant decline in value.</p>
<p>Amidst conflicting views among analysts, some with a bullish outlook foresee a potential surge toward $0.07. However, contrasting opinions assert a more pessimistic perspective, predicting a likely dip below $0.05.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-543667 size-large" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-132-860x383.png" alt="" width="860" height="383" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-132-860x383.png 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-132-460x205.png 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-132-768x342.png 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-132-750x334.png 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-132.png 1039w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"/></p>


<p>Social media activity plays a substantial role in influencing the price of Dogecoin. While some future price predictions remain bullish, investors are now cautious, realizing that such levels may not necessarily translate to the high long-term ROI they once expected. </p>
<p>Consequently, many opt to diversify their investments, seeking alternative opportunities beyond the world of meme coins.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Charles Edwards, the mastermind behind the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons signal and founder of Capriole Investments, has sounded the alarm. The renowned analyst warns that the Hash Ribbons capitulation signal just flashed, a phenomenon that has historically accompanied moments of distress for BTC miners. As outlined by Edwards, Bitcoin&#8217;s hash rate had experienced an astonishing and seemingly unsustainable 50% surge in 2023. However, this meteoric rise came to a sudden slowdown, which has led to the Hash Ribbons capitulation signal to appear. Via Twitter, Edwards emphasized that the signal is neither a clear sell signal nor a buy indicator. But it demands prudent risk management until a renewed price rally: We have a Hash Ribbon capitulation. AKA a slowing in Bitcoin&#8217;s Hash Rate growth after what has been an incredible (unsustainable) 50% increase in 2023. Hash Ribbons capitulation is not a sell signal, but it&#8217;s also not bullish. Risk management warranted until growth resumes. Market analyst Lukasz Wydra corroborates Edwards&#8217; stance, pointing out that the death cross of Bitcoin hash ribbons is a signal of a time of uncertainty. Wydra revealed that historically, there have been 14 similar events, each leading to diverse outcomes. Among these events, three resulted in rallies, six led to sideways movements, and five triggered declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Rejoice: Blofin Forecasts $49,000 Price High With Potential Spot ETF Launch Wydra takes a statistical approach and reassures investors that, statistically speaking, the Hash Ribbons capitulation does not inflict significant harm on the market. In fact, he emphasizes that when the capitulation finally subsides, it will usher in a strong buying signal, one that has shown remarkable effectiveness in the past. The last time the Hash Ribbons capitulation signal appeared was at the end of November 2022. It was followed by a prolonged sideways trend for over a month until the buy signal flashed at the beginning of January. The result? Bitcoin embarked on a furious rally, etching a memorable start to the year. Why Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Are Such A Powerful Tool In simple terms, the Hash Ribbon indicator is designed to detect periods when BTC miners are facing distress and possible capitulation. These phases tend to coincide with major lows in the price of Bitcoin, making them attractive buying opportunities for astute investors.

During periods of rapid price surges followed by sharp pullbacks, some miners may find it financially challenging to continue their operations, leading them to power down their mining rigs. Charles Edwards elucidates that when miners capitulate, it might be the most potent buy signal observable in the Bitcoin market. However, the indicator does not claim to time the exact bottom of the price. Instead, it identifies periods when miners are turning off their rigs due to adverse market conditions, leading to drops in hash rates. These moments often correspond to macro bottoms in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, making them opportune moments to accumulate Bitcoin. At press time, BTC traded near the range lows at $29,863.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum price is struggling to clear the $1,920 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could gain bearish momentum if there is a close below $1,875. Ethereum is trading in a range above the $1,875 level. The price is trading below $1,910 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key rising channel forming with support near $1,885 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could decline heavily if the price remains below $1,920 for a long time. Ethereum Price Struggles Below $1,920 Ethereum’s price attempted a fresh increase above the $1,900 level. However, ETH failed to gain traction above the $1,920 resistance and reacted to the downside, similar to Bitcoin. The price declined below the $1,885 level but remained stable above $1,875.

The first major resistance is near the $1,910 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level recent decline from the $1,927 swing high to the $1,877 low, above which the price could test the main resistance at $1,920. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $1,940 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,000 resistance in the near term. More Losses in ETH?
