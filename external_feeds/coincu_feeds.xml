<p>As was updated in a previous Coincu News article, Loans by Genesis Creditor Groups, one of DCG&#8217;s subsidiaries, <strong>amounted to $1.8 billion and are continuing to grow</strong>. One of its biggest creditors is the Winklevoss brothers&#8217; crypto company <strong>Gemini, which took in $900 million after Genesis&#8217; lender halted customer withdrawals on November 16.</strong></p>



<p>Genesis said it has begun discussions with its largest potential investors, creditors and borrowers, including Gemini and DCG, to agree on a solution to support the company&#8217;s lending business in terms of overall liquidity and meeting customer needs.</p>



<p>On December 6, <strong>Cameron Winklevoss said Gemini and other creditors have formed a creditor committee to work together to resolve the issue</strong>. Returning money to customers is the company&#8217;s top priority.</p>



<p>The plans are still in the early stages of being implemented, <strong>all information will be updated in detail on the <a href="https://www.gemini.com/earn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a></strong> that has been created to update the situation in the most transparent way for the solution finding process for all users Earn Money in exchange for their property.</p>



<p>It can be said that DCG is one of the leading investment funds in the crypto industry. As of November 2021, they have made over 200 investments in various crypto companies. However, the fallout from FTX&#8217;s collapse took its toll on the Genesis subsidiary because of its large exposure. This is the name that is receiving the most attention because it is on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em><em>Binance</em> is being accused of deceiving the public and advertising its services before it was permitted to do so by law by a group of French cryptocurrency investors who have launched a criminal complaint against t<em>he largest crypto exchange in the world</em></em>.</li>



<li><em>According to the lawsuit, unregistered providers of digital financial services are prohibited from advertising their services in France under a regulation that took effect in France in December 2020.</em></li>



<li><em>Following a significant industry slump and a spike in consumer withdrawals, the exchange is working to restore confidence.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>According to the <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/french-clients-file-complaint-against-binance-over-social-media-marketing-2022-12-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em> report, Binance has been charged with a crime by a group of French cryptocurrency investors.</strong></h5>

<p>According to attorneys <strong>Etienne de Dreuille</strong> and <strong>Baptiste Bonhomme</strong>, a case was filed with allegations of <strong>&#8220;misleading commercial practice&#8221;.</strong></p>



<p>They claim that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153882-binance-joined-committee-us-lobbying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> misled the public and advertised its services before it was permitted to do so by law in the nation.</p>



<p>In <strong>May</strong> of this year, the exchange finished the registration process with the French market regulator <strong>AMF</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, unregistered providers of digital financial services are prohibited from advertising their services in France under a regulation that took effect in <strong>France</strong> in<strong> December 2020.</strong></p>



<p>Due to privacy laws, the attorneys refrained from disclosing the identities of the Binance users who filed the case.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, which <em>Reuters</em> was able to view, <strong>Binance ran marketing activities on social media sites like Instagram and Telegram while its legal registration as a digital financial business with French authorities was still waiting.</strong></p>



<p>The group, which used the site and was a client, has complained to the <strong>Paris</strong> prosecutor&#8217;s office. However, neither <strong>Binance</strong> nor the prosecution office have responded.</p>



<p>A formal inquiry may not necessarily be opened by the <strong>French</strong> <strong>Prosecutor</strong> as a result of this complaint, either.</p>



<p>The CEO of Binance, <strong>Changpeng Zhao</strong>, has frequently complimented France for its <strong>&#8220;pro-crypto&#8221;</strong> legislation and has stated that <strong>Binance intended to establish a regional headquarters there for the European market.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Zhao</strong> was quoted by the news outlet <strong>Mediapart</strong> as claiming that<strong> &#8220;Binance has not been promoting its offers in France before it was allowed to,&#8221; </strong>which was the first to report on the French complaint.</p>



<p>Due to a recent sharp increase in client withdrawals from <strong>Binance</strong>, the crypto community is concerned about another devastating catastrophe.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Elon Musk Will Resign as CEO at Twitter after voting results.</em></li>



<li><em>Twitter boss will leave as soon as he finds the right CEO.</em></li>



<li><em>DOGE price drops more than 10% after this news.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>The results of the vote generated by Elon Musk himself made it possible for him to step down as CEO of Twitter. Immediately after Dogecoin supporters confirmed the information, the price of this coin meme suddenly dropped by nearly 10%.</strong></h5>

<p>Earlier on December 19, Billionaire Elon Musk and the owner of Twitter posted a public vote for users to vote on whether he should give up the top position of Twitter and said to follow the results of the vote.</p>



<p>Notably, the vote ended on the evening of December 19 with <strong>more than 17.5 million votes, 57.5% of which said &#8220;Yes&#8221; to Mr. Elon Musk&#8217;s proposal to resign.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1605372724800393216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 21, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This result also seems to reflect users&#8217; outrage at <strong>Twitter&#8217;s new policy of not allowing users to link to other social networks in their profiles</strong>. According to users, it is a clear violation of each person&#8217;s right to freedom of speech, which Elon Musk has vowed to put first after taking over Twitter.</p>



<p>After the results of the vote, Mr. Elon Musk officially said that he is ready to leave the CEO position of Twitter and move on to manage the software &amp; servers teams, but only if he has found a suitable replacement candidate.</p>



<p>As soon as the vote was posted, the price of <strong>DOGE immediately dropped by nearly 10%</strong>. This is seen as a reaction of the meme coin to its loyal supporters. Currently, the price of <strong>DOGE is still down 2.81% in the last 24 hours. It is currently trading at $0.07269.</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/20/ftx-has-over-1b-in-cash-creditor-meeting-told/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coindesk</a>, the company&#8217;s new management, who took over when FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried stepped down on November 11, said in a due process hearing on Tuesday that<strong> it has determined assets worth more than $1 billion</strong>. The company has placed approximately <strong>$720 million in cash assets</strong>, which the exchange has yet to consolidate, at US financial institutions authorized by the US Department of Justice to hold the funds. <strong>Nearly another $500 million</strong> was held in US institutions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We are reaching out to all of those banks and changing the signatories on the accounts so that we can get access to the accounts and move the cash as much as we can to authorized depository institutions,”</p>
<cite>FTX&#8217;s new chief financial officer, Mary Cilia said during part of bankruptcy proceedings.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Mary Cilia, FTX&#8217;s new chief financial officer, said <strong>they are contacting the banks and changing the signers on the accounts</strong>, so that they <strong>can access the account and transfer </strong>as much cash as possible to authorized depository institutions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1555.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1555-1024x538.png" alt="FTX

<p>Of that, another $485 million was deposited in authorized U.S. depository institutions. Meanwhile, about<strong> $130 million in cash has been frozen in Japan</strong>. Additionally, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153263-insurance-companies-deny-customers-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX </a>has identified a $6 million deposit for operating expenses such as salaries.</p>



<p>Of the $423 million deposited into unauthorized entities in the United States, the majority was held by a broker Cilia declined to identify.</p>



<p>Steve Coverick, senior director of financial advisors at FTX, Alvarez &amp; Marsal, said at the hearing that they are working to define FTX&#8217;s international crypto assets and <strong>move them to cold wallets through custodial providers like Bitgo</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="999" height="666" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1564.png" alt="FTX CEO

<p>The Chapter 11 bankruptcy hearings were intended to close the exchange, but were complicated by perceived mismanagement and poor recordkeeping under Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s reign.</p>



<p>Cilia said the company has yet to file the declaration of assets or financial position required by US bankruptcy law and now estimates it will be able to do so by April 2023.</p>



<p>The company is still trying to determine how many employees worldwide and how much was withdrawn resulting in bankruptcy.</p>

<p>On <strong>December 20</strong>, the <strong>HNS Blake2B+SHA3 air-cooling miners</strong> went on sale, and they were quickly purchased. According to the Bitmain website, <strong>each buyer may only purchase five units.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bitmain Technologies Ltd. </strong>is a privately owned company headquartered in <strong>Beijing</strong>, <strong>China</strong>, that designs<strong> application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) </strong>chips for Bitcoin mining. In <strong>June 2021</strong>, suspended spot delivery of sales of machines globally, aiming to support local prices following Beijing’s crackdown.</p>



<p>However, the market leader for <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153333-the-bitcoin-whales-market-slashed-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> mining equipment continues to be the Chinese mining behemoth <strong>Bitmain</strong>. The <strong>Antminer S19 XP</strong>, the company&#8217;s sole flagship model, has a hash rate of <strong>134 TH/s</strong> and uses just<strong> 21.5 joules per terahash</strong>. At <strong>$6,164 per unit</strong>, it is <strong>three times as expensive.</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, according to the business website, its <strong>100 TH/s S19 Pro Antmine</strong>r has also run out of stock. Additionally unavailable was the <strong>Bitmain Antminer S19 XP Hydro</strong>, which has hash rates of over<strong> 200 TH/s</strong>.</p>



<p>While this shows that mining is still being actively deployed by miners, the current market conditions are undeniably difficult. The <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin network hash rate </a>has <strong>dropped</strong> <strong>11%</strong> from its all-time high in early <strong>November</strong> to<strong> 243.8 TH/s</strong> today. However, it is still too high for many miners to make a profit.</p>

<li><em>The firm continues to have a good cash flow and intends to mine while paying off its debts.</em></li>

</ul>



<h5><strong>According to a familiar person with the company&#8217;s finances, Core Scientific, one of the biggest publicly traded crypto mining businesses in the U.S., is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Texas early on Wednesday morning. <em>CNBC</em> first <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-filing-for-bankruptcy-will-keep-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> about this case.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a personal acquaintance with the company&#8217;s financial condition, who asked to remain unnamed to discuss private company affairs, <strong>the company is still producing positive cash flow, but that money is insufficient to pay off the financial obligation associated with the equipment it was leasing. </strong></p>



<p>This source states the company will not go into liquidation but will carry on as usual while negotiating a solution with senior security noteholders, who are responsible for the majority of the company&#8217;s debt.</p>



<p>As of the close of trade on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, Core Scientific&#8217;s market capitalization was at. <strong>$78 million</strong>, down from a<strong> $4.3 billion </strong>valuation in <strong>July 2021</strong> when the company went public via a <strong>special purpose acquisition vehicle</strong> or <strong>SPAC</strong>. Over the past year, the stock has decreased by <strong>com</strong> <strong>98%</strong>.</p>

<p>Holders of Core&#8217;s common shares may not lose all of their investment, despite what Core had said in a filing in October if the industry as a whole rebounds. Additionally, the company payments that it would not make the debt payments that were due in late <strong>October</strong> and early <strong>November</strong> and that it stated that it was free to take the business to court for nonpayment. The action comes after a year of rising energy prices and falling <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153333-the-bitcoin-whales-market-slashed-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> prices.</p>



<p>The price of Bitcoin has fallen from an all-time high of around<strong> $69,000</strong> in <strong>November 2021</strong> to roughly<strong> $16,800</strong>. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152037-core-scientific-an-proposal-of-72-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core Scientific</a> mostly mines <strong>Bitcoin</strong>. Its profit margins have been reduced as a result of that value decline, increasing rivalry among miners, and rising energy prices. At the time of writing, <a href="https://coincu.com/currencies/btc-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC</a> is trading at <strong>$16,633</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Celsius</strong>, a cryptocurrency lender, sought bankruptcy protection in <strong>July</strong> and <strong>was</strong> <strong>a Core Scientific client</strong>. Another illustration of the contagion effect affecting the whole crypto industry this year is when Celsius&#8217; debts were financial during its bankruptcy procedures, which put pressure on Core&#8217;s sheet.</p>



<p>Not only <strong>Core Scientific</strong> but miners in the crypto industry are also having problems.</p>



<p><strong>Compute North</strong>, a company that offers infrastructure and hosting services for cryptocurrency mining, filed for <strong>Chapter 11 bankruptcy</strong> in <strong>September</strong>, while another miner, <strong>Marathon Digital Holdings</strong>, disclosed an exposure to Compute North of <strong>$80 million</strong>. <strong>Argo Blockchain</strong> is also currently struggling during the harsh crypto winter period.</p>

<p>When it comes to crypto lending practices, Coinbase wrote that borrowing in the cryptocurrency realm has grown to be quite difficult in 2022 due to all of the credit that has been removed from the system. However, the fact that <strong>lender impairment from the collapse of Celsius and 3AC is still there suggests that consolidation is still taking place rather than that there is renewed pressure on these entities as a result of the failure of FTX.</strong></p>



<p>Instead of coming from a retail basis, institutional investors will now be the source of future loan inventories. Even if it could take some time for institutional credit activity to return to previous levels.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Borrowing will likely not be a challenge for credit-worthy, responsible borrowers.</p>

<p>As for bitcoin miners, <strong>precarious economic conditions show no improvement</strong>, with mining companies selling nearly 135% of coins mined per day, and this means that miners are liquidating the entirety of their newly mined coins as well as portions of their BTC reserves, according to the report.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Challenging conditions (such as higher input costs and lower output value), combined with elevated energy prices, have resulted in a highly stressed economic environment for bitcoin miners for the past several quarters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, <strong>market conditions may drive businesses to shut down or &#8220;be acquired by more well-capitalized players&#8221;</strong> if other mining companies don&#8217;t buck the trend. For that reason, the firm expects the bitcoin mining industry to consolidate even further in 2023.</p>

<p>According to Armstrong, <strong>stablecoins should be regulated first, then centralized exchanges and custodians</strong>, making room for DeFi to develop.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Regulating stablecoin issuers is a good place to start, because there is broad interest in D.C., and we can get some momentum with a quick win, we don&#8217;t need to do anything fancy or crypto-specific here; stablecoins can be regulated under standard financial services laws by using, for instance, a state trust charter or an OCC national trust charter.</p>
<cite>Armstrong said</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Armstrong predicts a stablecoin law could be passed in the first half of next year by adopting regulatory frameworks </strong>from traditional financial services, freeing up regulators to concentrate on the more difficult tasks of developing a regulatory framework for centralized crypto players and determining which digital assets qualify as securities or commodities.</p>
