<p class="s7">In the cryptocurrency sector, there is always a new coin or token on the rise, with traders and investors keeping a watchful eye on the latest predictions and trends. One such token that has been making waves lately is Yachtify's (YCHT) token. </p>
<p class="s7">According to industry analysts, YCHT's token is poised to skyrocket 4,000x over Binance Coin (BNB) and Litecoin (LTC) shortly. Interestingly, the token is currently in the presale stage offering an opportunity for investors to get in for only $0.01 per token. </p>
<p class="s9">Binance Coin (BNB): Bearish Momentum Coming?</p>
<p class="s7">Last week, Binance Coin (BNB) tried to break above $340 resistance but failed as bears took over, leading to a correction similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Binance Coin's (BNB) price then dropped below $330 support and hit a low of around $320.8. </p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Binance Coin (BNB) is consolidating and trading below $330 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the 4-hour chart of BNB/USD, a bearish trend line with resistance near $333 is also forming.</p>
<p class="s7">If Binance Coin (BNB) fails to surpass the $335 resistance, it may continue to decline. The first level of support is around $320, followed by a major support level near $315. </p>
<p class="s7">If the token's price plunges below $315, it could extend the decline toward the $300 support level. By press time, Binance Coin's (BNB) price is $325.90, In the last 24 hours, the token's price has increased by 0.83%, but it has declined by 1.37% in the past week.</p>
<p class="s9">Litecoin (LTC) Meets Rejection At $90</p>
<p class="s7">According to Litecoin's (LTC) price analysis, the token found support at $86.00 and has since bounced back to $88.00 with bullish momentum. However, there is still strong bearish pressure, as Litecoin (LTC) bulls were rejected at $90.00. </p>
<p class="s7">Litecoin (LTC) is currently in a bearish rally, as the price broke down from $104.00 to $86.00. Nevertheless, the bulls made a partial recovery, and the price rebounded to $88.00.</p>
<p class="s7">According to data from CoinMarketCap, Litecoin (LTC) currently trades at $88.10, with a 24-hour trading volume of $475,893,346. The price has declined by 0.02% in the last 24 hours but has increased by 0.02% in the past seven days.</p>
<p class="s7">Traders should anticipate that Litecoin (LTC) will move sideways at its current price level before continuing its downward trend.</p>
<p class="s9">Yachtify (YCHT): Invest in Boats for Passive Income</p>
<p class="s7">Yachtify will be a new marketplace where users can rent, buy, sell, or own fractional timeshares in various watercraft, including Sunseeker Yachts and Jetskis. The platform will allow investors to create NFTs corresponding to each investment, which can be purchased to claim real-world asset ownership. </p>
<p class="s7">The Yachtify ecosystem encompasses a lending protocol, NFT marketplace, and rewards club, presenting a promising investment opportunity. Additionally, the team has passed KYC and audits by SolidProof, ensuring investor security. </p>
<p class="s7">With Yachtify, you can buy and sell all types of boats on the blockchain, and receive part of the platform fee shares depending on your investment. </p>
<p class="s7">Currently in its first presale stage, Yachtify tokens are priced at only $0.1 per token. Smart and early investors can benefit from a 30% bonus before the price increases at the end of the month.
