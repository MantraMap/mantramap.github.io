Now users can execute bitcoin deposits and withdrawals using the network, taking advantage of lower fees.</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Binance Completes Integration of Lightning Network</h2>&#13;
<p>Binance recently <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-completes-integration-of-bitcoin-btc-on-lightning-network-opens-deposits-and-withdrawals-eefbfae2c0ae472d9e1e36f1a30bf340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the completion of its integration of Lightning Network, a scaling layer for the Bitcoin blockchain. The exchange informed about these new capabilities on July 17, explaining that users can now deposit and withdraw bitcoin from Binance using this new option.</p>&#13;
<p>The Lightning Network allows users to accelerate the speed of their transactions to and from the exchange, given that there is no need for waiting for transactions as when using Bitcoin in its base layer. Also, the fees for Lightning Network transactions are cheaper than Layer 1-based transactions. This difference is especially notable in times of high congestion on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> base layer.</p>&#13;
<p>For deposits, the exchange accepts transactions starting from 0.00001 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ($0.30) and up to 0.05 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ($1,510). To withdraw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, Binance will collect a network fee of 0.000002 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, or less than ten cents per transaction.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>A Lightning Journey</h2>&#13;
<p>Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-announces-lightning-network-withdrawal-implementation-amidst-bitcoin-network-congestion-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it was working on including Lightning Network capabilities on its platform in May when the exchange had to <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655380303383261185?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pause</a> <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> withdrawals in a period of network congestion created by the appearance of the BTC-based protocol known as Ordinals, which allows users to inscribe arbitrary data on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blockchain.</p>&#13;
<p>Addressing this situation, Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419624962527233?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed. Our team has also been working on enabling <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>In June, Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1671042638592589826?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it was still working on the integration after some users noticed the existence of Lightning nodes associated with the exchange. However, Binance warned there was &#x201C;still more tech work to be done,&#x201D; promising to offer updates when the integration tasks were finished.</p>&#13;
<p>Changpeng Zhao, CEO Of Binance, had stated before that the implementation of the Lightning Network was &#x201C;more complicated&#x201D; than it might appear due to the on-demand generation of invoices featured by the Lightning Network, which is different from having pre-generated addresses.</p>&#13;

Within the realm of cryptocurrencies, there exist two noteworthy tokens backed by gold: pax gold (PAXG) and tether gold (XAUT). Together, these tokens amass a considerable worth of nearly $1 billion. Although the total number of PAXG and XAUT tokens reaches nearly 500,000, their distribution is relatively concentrated, amongst the 31,000 token holders.</strong></p>
<h2>Nearly 500,000 Gold-Backed Tokens in Circulation, Yet 20 Wallets Dominate the Supply</h2>
<p>The two leading gold-pegged crypto assets, PAXG and XAUT, which are backed by a troy ounce of .999 fine gold, still dominate the field of precious metal-based digital currencies. The demand for tokens backed by gold experienced a significant surge in 2022, notably when gold reached its all-time high of $2,074.60 per ounce on March 8th.</p>
<p>An illustrative example is PAXG, which saw its market value soar from <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/demand-for-gold-backed-tokens-brings-premiums-as-precious-metals-value-jumps-higher/">$424 million</a> on February 19, 2022, to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tokenized-gold-market-caps-grew-significantly-last-month-as-fresh-demand-drives-premiums/">$611 million</a> by the end of March. Tether gold also saw growth last year, with its market capitalization increasing from $430 million in February 2022 to $486 million the following March, a rise of more than 13%. Combining the market capitalizations of both PAXG and XAUT on March 23, 2022, amounted to $1.09 billion in value.</p>
<p>Today, the combined market capitalization of both gold-backed tokens has decreased, with PAXG standing at $490 million and XAUT at $487 million. Over the past day, PAXG, issued by Paxos, has recorded approximately $16.38 million in global trade volume, while XAUT has witnessed $4.17 million in trading activity.</p>
<p>Statistics indicate that there are approximately 31,000 holders of PAXG and XAUT combined, with 30,314 wallets specifically holding PAXG. As for tether gold, it is held by only 1,037 unique addresses. Notably, the top ten addresses for XAUT control a significant <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/tethergold/richlist/">98.23%</a> of the total supply. The largest wallet for tether gold contains 93,500 XAUT, while the Tether Treasury possesses 66,679 tokens.</p>
<p>Bitfinex, on the other hand, holds approximately 28,712 XAUT, representing 11.65% of the total supply. Among the 30,000+ PAXG wallets, the top ten addresses account for <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/paxgold/richlist/">34.13%</a> of the entire supply. Binance takes the lead as the largest wallet holder with 20,000 PAXG tokens, followed by the Paxos Treasury, which holds 15,235 PAXG. Furthermore, Binance possesses another wallet within the top ten, containing 5,833 PAXG, while Kraken holds 5,810 PAXG in the wallet just below Binance&#8217;s.</p>
<h2>Gold-Backed Coins Witness Minimal transfers</h2>
<p>Determining the exact availability of these gold tokens for retail traders in the open market is challenging. In previous instances, both PAXG and XAUT have experienced premiums and discounts on exchanges compared to the spot market value of gold. Generally, both coins have closely mirrored the spot value of an ounce of gold since their issuance. Similarly to their physical counterparts, tether gold tokens exhibit minimal transfers.</p>
<p>Since its creation, XAUT has only witnessed a total of 13,654 transfers. On the contrary, PAXG has seen a significantly higher number of transfers, reaching 846,887 since its inception. However, when comparing the transfer activity of PAXG to that of Ethereum and Bitcoin on a daily basis, PAXG&#8217;s transfers appear relatively minor in comparison.</p>

<h2>Crypto Market in Flux</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Throughout this chaotic 24-hour period, leveraged digital asset traders observed a colossal liquidation of <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData">$106.88 million</a>, impacting both short and long positions. Amid the slump on July 18, the crypto asset 1inch (1INCH) surfaced as the most severe casualty, losing nearly 16% of its worth against the U.S. dollar.&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
Amidst the turmoil, other digital assets encountered sharp declines as well. Terra classic (LUNC) suffered the most, plummeting over 6%, while solana (SOL) didn&#x2019;t fare much better, also losing around 6% of its value. Although numerous coins have seen losses, some have managed to withstand the downturn. For example, bitdao (BIT) has increased more than 2% and chainlink (LINK) has gained 4.65% against the U.S. dollar.&#13;</p>
<p class="p1">
<p>&#13;<br />
Other frontrunners on Tuesday encompass sui (SUI), apecoin (APE), and xdc network (XDC). In terms of liquidations over the past hour, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> lead in liquidated positions. While crypto markets have undergone a widespread decline, this week&#x2019;s <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitfinex-Alpha-63.pdf">Bitfinex Alpha Report</a> states that bitcoin investors are &#x201C;behaving more bullishly.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The report highlights that onchain movements in Bitcoin indicate a transfer of supply from long-term holders (LTHs) to short-term holders (STHs), a cycle typically observed in bullish markets.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;This shift hints at new market entrants seeking quick profits and long-term holders cashing in on favourable prices. As this trend plateaus, it signals an early bull market stage where supply change occurs between these two cohorts,&#x201D; the report elaborates.&#13;<br />

The event will focus on the future of Web3, including how blockchain and crypto can empower the next billion people to improve their everyday lives.</p>
<p>The conference will feature over 100 prominent leaders, innovators and influencers as speakers across two stages.

<p>More than 2,000 people are expected to attend from all over the world, with millions more tuning in to the event virtually through <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/live">Binance Live</a>’s stream.

Our objective is to continue building the Web3 and blockchain industry together, expanding on its potential to improve financial equity and positively impact society overall,” said Yi He, Co-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer at Binance.</p>

Many supporters and market observers anticipate a price increase prior to the event. According to an anonymous market analyst known as Plan B, bitcoin&#x2019;s price could ascend to between $40,000 and $50,000 in the run-up to the next block reward halving.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Plan B Estimates Bitcoin Could Cross $40K Ahead of Fourth Halving Amidst Market Uncertainties</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Two optimistic events are stirring discussion in recent circles: the potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., and the impending block reward halving. The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-2024-halving-presents-new-challenges-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-mining-rewards/">forthcoming halving</a>, predicted to occur in about nine months, near April 24, 2024, will inevitably halve bitcoin miners&#x2019; revenues. Analysts at JPMorgan foresee financial challenges for bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) miners if the crypto asset&#x2019;s price and transaction costs fail to increase by that date.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;While bitcoin halving is seen as having a positive effect on the bitcoin price given the production cost acted historically as a floor, it poses a challenge for bitcoin miners,&#x201D; JPMorgan&#x2019;s senior analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou explained in a note to clients.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On July 16, 2023, a<a href="https://youtu.be/vmIlDbTgFYs"> video surfaced</a> from Plan B, an anonymous market analyst famed for creating the <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25">stock-to-flow (S2F)</a> price model. In this video, he posits that bitcoin&#x2019;s value could elevate to a range of $40,000 to $50,000 by the impending halving. A <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/plan-bs-stock-to-flow-price-model-denounced-by-vitalik-buterin-says-model-can-be-harmful/">wave of criticism</a> crashed over Plan B in 2022 when his S2F forecasts <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-supporters-sift-through-the-graveyard-of-technical-indicators-that-failed-to-predict-bitcoins-bottom/">fell short</a>. However, in this latest video, he employed the 200-week moving average as a tool to predict future price trends.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The 200-week moving average increases currently at about $500 [per month], so nine times $500 will be $4,500,&#x201D; Plan B explained in the video. &#x201C;Bitcoin&#x2019;s 200-week moving average right now is a little under $28,000, so $28,000 plus $4,000 is well [a] $32,000 dollars (200-week) moving average at the halving approximately.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The anonymous analyst added:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>And bitcoin would be above that right, and usually it would be like 50% above that, which would indicate a range of Bitcoin at the halving between $40,000 and $50,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Plan B also sparked intrigue on July 17, 2023, by launching a <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1680948756806549504?s=20">survey</a> that posed the question: &#x201C;Can bitcoin this halving cycle (before April 2024) make a new all time low (ATL, currently $15.5K) and/or a new all time high (ATH, currently $69K)?&#x201D; At the time of writing, the poll has drawn more than 20,000 responses, with 37.9% predicting neither a new ATL nor a new ATH prior to April 2024.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Comparatively, Plan B&#x2019;s pre-halving price forecast is modest. For example, Matrixport <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/matrixports-year-end-2024-prediction-bitcoin-to-reach-125000-as-strong-performance-fuels-bullish-sentiment/">forecasts</a> a halving price of $63,160, fueled by Blackrock&#x2019;s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund filing and a marked rise in institutional interest.&#13;<br />

If the POL concept gains approval, validators can earn rewards from staking and also accumulate rewards from multiple Polygon chains.</strong></p>
<h2>Polygon Labs Introduces Next-Gen Crypto With POL, a Potential MATIC Successor</h2>
<p>Polygon Labs <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-tokenomics">introduced</a> a multipurpose token named POL on July 13, 2023, following the release of a <a href="https://polygon.technology/papers/pol-whitepaper">white paper</a> on the subject by a group of Polygon founders and researchers. The white paper outlines POL&#8217;s role as a potential successor to MATIC, becoming a crucial tool in fostering growth and collaboration within the Polygon ecosystem. One significant advantage of POL is that stakers will have the opportunity to accumulate rewards in POL as well as from other Polygon-centric networks.</p>
<p>Described as a &#8220;hyperproductive&#8221; digital currency, POL has the capability to validate numerous blockchains, according to a blog post by Polygon Labs on POL&#8217;s tokenomics. “To attract more validators, some Polygon chains can choose to introduce additional rewards,” the post explains. “These rewards can be in any token, including but not limited to POL, stablecoins or native tokens of those Polygon chains.” Should it receive approval, POL&#8217;s supply is poised to match MATIC&#8217;s 10 billion, and users can exchange MATIC for POL at a 1:1 ratio.</p>
<p>Polygon Labs states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The upgrade from MATIC to POL would require a simple technical action – sending MATIC to the upgrade smart contract, which will automatically return the equivalent amount of POL.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the team announced regular POL emissions as a means to finance a community treasury, the purpose of which is to encourage protocol development, promote protocol research, distribute ecosystem grants, and foster adoption incentives. “The community treasury should be governed by the Polygon community, via an agreed upon governance process,” the blog post elaborates.</p>
<p>MATIC holders will be accorded a time frame to exchange MATIC for POL, with Polygon Labs recommending a period of four years or more. Wrapping up, the team indicated that the transition could commence within a few months if the community endorses this proposal</p>

South Africa, along with Morocco, Ghana, Egypt, and the Ivory Coast, accounted for 23.8% of the continent&#8217;s interest in cryptocurrency year-to-date (YTD).</strong></p>
<h2>High Inflation and Currency Woes Fuel Nigerian Interest in Crypto</h2>
<p>According to the latest Coingecko Africa crypto <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/crypto-interest-africa?utm_source=explore&amp;utm_medium=app">report</a>, Nigeria had &#8220;the highest level of crypto interest&#8221; on the continent with a share of 66.8%. The West African nation’s share of the continent’s crypto interest is nearly 8 times that of the next highest-ranked country South Africa.</p>
<p>The data in the Coingecko report is the latest to reaffirm Nigeria’s status as Africa’s number crypto nation both in terms of user <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/study-nigeria-most-crypto-obsessed-english-speaking-country-globally/">curiosity</a> and traded volumes. According to the report, poor traditional finance infrastructure, high inflation, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-nigerian-anti-graft-body-identifies-individuals-fueling-the-nairas-rapid-depreciation/">currency depreciation</a> are some of the factors which explain Nigerian residents’ unparalleled fondness for crypto.</p>
<h2>Top Six Countries Account for Over 90% of Africa&#8217;s Overall Crypto Interest</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the data also shows that in the period between Jan. 1 and June. 4, no other African country had a level of interest in crypto which surpassed 10%. In South Africa, the level of interest in crypto stood at 8.36% during the same period. Morocco, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-french-crypto-trader-jailed-for-18-months-for-buying-a-ferrari-with-bitcoin/">jailed</a> a crypto trader in 2021, is ranked third with 5.43% while Ghana is just behind with 5.24%. Inflation-stricken Egypt completes the top five with a crypto interest level of 2.74%.</p>
<p>As shown by the statistics in the report, South Africa, Morocco, Ghana, Egypt, and the Ivory Coast accounted &#8220;for 23.8% of the continent’s interest in crypto YTD [year-to-date].&#8221; The data also suggest that the top six countries’ share of Africa’s overall crypto interest level in the period under review was more than 90%.</p>
<p>The findings also suggest that just eight countries had a level of interest in crypto which exceeded 1%. According to the data, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Mozambique had the least interest in crypto among the surveyed African countries.</p>

Ghadimi asserts that developers and users are more concerned with performance than the novelty of Web3 applications.</strong></p>
<h2>Web3 Regulation a &#8216;Certainty&#8217;</h2>
<p>While this may explain developers&#8217; use of or preference for Web2 infrastructure, according to Ghadimi, participants in the Web3 ecosystem can reverse this trend by &#8220;matching the performance and latency of Web2.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when asked about reports of the United States&#8217; attempt to regulate the decentralized finance (defi) ecosystem, Ghadimi told Bitcoin.com News that he remains optimistic regulators will not go after projects which adhere to rules. Although the eventual regulation of Web3 is now widely seen as a &#8220;certainty,&#8221; the researcher nevertheless said he is &#8220;increasingly optimistic&#8221; that this will be done in a &#8220;sensible&#8221; way.</p>
<p>In his written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News via Telegram, Ghadimi also shared his thoughts on why the web infrastructure needs Web3. He also offered his thoughts about the future of centralized entities in Web3.</p>
<p>Below are all of Ghadimi&#8217;s responses to the questions sent.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): What does the decentralization of the Web3 infrastructure mean and what’s the need for moving infrastructure to a decentralized layer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parsa Ghadimi (PG):</strong> Decentralizing web infrastructure is the shift from using corporate-controlled web infrastructure and cloud platforms to permissionless, uncensorable, decentralized platforms. You are only as strong as your weakest link, and so if even one part of your stack is centralized, you are vulnerable to censorship, de-platforming, hacks, service failures, etc. That’s the main reason for needing to move internet infrastructure and software off corporate-controlled cloud platforms and onto decentralized networks. Web3 only becomes a reality if the entire stack is decentralized.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Many developers building decentralized applications are aware of the critical principles of Web3 yet they still go on to build dapps on Web2 infrastructure. Why do you think they still do this and what needs to happen to encourage them to switch to a decentralized base layer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PG:</strong> Performance/low latency is king. No one will care if your product is decentralized if it loads slowly. And so most developers are currently forced to use Web2 infra to get Web3 performance to meet developer/user demands. What needs to happen to encourage them to switch to decentralized infra is that there needs to be decentralized infra that can match the performance and latency of Web2. And that’s exactly what we are aiming to do with Fleek Network and building a decentralized edge network.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>BCN: Can you tell us about your platform — Fleek Network — and its approach to bringing developers a decentralized edge layer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PG:</strong> Fleek Network is a decentralized edge network. It’s optimized to facilitate the deployment and running of performant web and edge services (CDN, serverless functions, etc.). It brings centralized web-like performance to Web3 without sacrificing Web3 values. It will lower the barrier of entry and speed up time to market for developers building Web3 infra/middleware by allowing them to offload a portion of their stack to a decentralized edge, similar to how the modern web works today. And it can replace a lot of the current parts of their stack that they still need Web2 infra for (ex. Cloudflare).</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Over the past few months, we have seen regulators (particularly in the U.S.) become increasingly aggressive in their actions against crypto giants like Coinbase, Binance, and the crypto ecosystem in general. Do you foresee this happening to decentralized entities and do you believe that regulators have a role in an ecosystem that’s designed to be self-regulated?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PG:</strong> It seems like the U.S. is attempting to establish a framework for what ‘sufficient decentralization’ means. So I hope they won’t go after the projects that adhere to that criteria. Regulation seems like a certainty at this point whether we like it or not, I just hope it’s sensible. But I’m becoming increasingly optimistic that it will be.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Do you foresee more centralized entities in the Web3 space in the coming years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PG:</strong> In absolute terms yes, just given the growth of Web3 that we will experience this decade. But I would expect to see the growth of decentralized entities match or exceed that over the same time period.</p>

In this issue, the Argentine central bank sheds yuan for dollars as its reserves bleed, the Central Bank of Brazil would be able to manipulate balances and block digital real accounts, and the first bitcoin futures contract goes live in Argentina.</strong></p>
<h2>Argentine Central Bank Sheds Chinese Yuan as Its Reserves Bleed</h2>
<p>The Central Bank of Argentina is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-argentina-accelerates-yuan-sales-and-dollar-purchases-as-reserves-dwindle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leveraging</a> its Chinese yuan stash to purchase dollars and manage its internal operations as its reserve level dwindles. The bank is making payments to importers using part of the Chinese swap line that government officials <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-to-expand-de-dollarization-efforts-seeks-extension-of-yuan-based-swap-line-with-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended</a> to $10 billion in June.</p>
<p>Local newspaper La Nacion reported that the bank lost $170 million on July 10 and July 11 due to the payments the republic had to disburse to importers and the purchase of dollars. The gross reserves of the central bank bled out $580 million last week, reaching $26 billion. Aurum Valores, a financial group, estimated that the central bank lost $100 million per day.</p>
<p>On this, analysts from the local group Portfolio Personal Inversiones stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A level of reserves is being tested that has never been observed since at least the late 1980s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Half the available amount of the Chinese swap line ($5 billion) is said to have been used already, leaving the country trying to organize a new deal to accelerate disbursements from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<h2>Central Bank of Brazil Would Be Able to Manipulate and Freeze Digital Real Accounts in CBDC Pilot</h2>
<p>The Central Bank of Brazil will reportedly be able to manipulate the numbers of specific accounts during the upcoming pilot test of the digital real, the Brazilian central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pemagalhaes_github-ioralabsrealdigitalsmartcontracts-activity-7082009809549484032-Beqi?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to Pedro Magalhaes, a developer that claims to have discovered the solidity code of the digital real pilot using reverse engineering, the functions associated with the Brazilian CBDC smart contract let its issuer freeze the funds in a wallet, block the functionality of transferring tokens for a specific account, and issue tokens directly to a digital wallet.</p>

<h2>First Bitcoin Futures Contract Goes Live in Argentina</h2>
<p>The first bitcoin futures product in Argentina went live on Thursday, issued by <a href="https://www.matbarofex.com.ar/documentos/investigacion/guia-de-futuros-de-bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matba Rofex</a>, a regulated domestic stock exchange. The futures contract uses the Matba Rofex <a href="https://www.matbarofex.com.ar/Indice-btc-mtr/metodologia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">index</a>, allowing qualified investors to put their funds behind bitcoin in local currency without worrying about the custody of the underlying asset.</p>

There have been no official updates from Sunacrip&#8217;s restructuring board, but Bitcoin mining activities are still halted per local sources&#8217; reports.</strong></p>
<h2>Venezuelan Crypto Ecosystem Still Affected After Sunacrip Intervention</h2>
<p>The situation of the Venezuelan cryptocurrency ecosystem and the current status of its official cryptocurrency asset, the petro, are yet uncertain after four months of the intervention of Sunacrip, the Venezuelan cryptocurrency watchdog. The restructuring board has made no official statements on the processes it is developing, and it is currently not known if the regulatory institution will even survive.</p>
<p>The government of Nicolas Maduro issued an executive order to intervene in the superintendence on March 17 after the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/head-of-venezuelan-crypto-watchdog-sunacrip-arrested-on-alleged-corruption-charges-institution-to-face-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrest</a> of its head Joselit Ramirez, who was accused of intermediating payments for $3 billion in undeclared crude sales to third parties. The financial hole in the case, which is commonly known as the PDVSA-Crypto scheme, was later expanded to represent a potential <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/how-crypto-ended-up-at-the-center-of-a-potential-20-billion-internal-corruption-scandal-in-venezuela-bitcoin-mining-shutdown-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 billion loss</a> for the nation after more undeclared and unpaid sales linked to cryptocurrency payments were uncovered by Reuters.</p>
<p>The intervention of Sunacrip was followed by other measures that were not officially corroborated but were reported by local Bitcoin miners and media sources, like the operation&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/national-exchanges-reportedly-pause-operations-in-venezuela-as-attorney-general-confirms-crypto-watchdog-sunacrip-involvement-in-oil-sale-schemes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pause</a> in local exchanges. Also, miners from the registered cryptocurrency farms in the country were disconnected from the power grid by the state power company Corpoelec in mid-March.</p>
<p>This brought heavy losses for Bitcoin miners based in the country, with some <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-volcano-energy-bitcoin-mining-project-rises-in-el-salvador-venezuelan-miners-leaving-amidst-crypto-corruption-probe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mulling</a> moving to more crypto-friendly nations, such as Paraguay or El Salvador.</p>

<h2>Mass Layoffs and Petro Debacle</h2>
<p>Subsequently, there were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-inflation-skyrockets-in-argentina-el-salvador-processes-digital-assets-licenses-venezuelan-crypto-corruption-probe-continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> of mass layoffs within Sunacrip, which had a payroll of approximately 600 employees, 400 being fired by April 26. But still, there were no official statements on the issue. Even after the Petro blockchain stopped its block production twice in May, with users <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelan-petro-blockchain-faces-operational-difficulties-hundreds-of-wallets-allegedly-blocked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> the blockage of hundreds of wallets, the institution has been radio silent.</p>
<p>Then, last month, sources linked to Sunacrip <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-indicate-venezuela-is-preparing-to-liquidate-the-petro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the decision to end the petro and its operations was already taken, and it would be made effective after liquidating big holders of the currency at a still unknown market price.</p>
<p>On the possible effects of this situation, Juan Blanco Bracamonte, a Venezuelan Bitcoin miner, <a href="https://twitter.com/JblancoB/status/1680585147874246657?t=GkVV7Q-lZULd5nDsNlFSzQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting from scratch will cost a lot of money and some investors are not willing to invest in the midst of the legal uncertainty that has been unleashed since March 2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sunacrip intervention measure will be effective until September 17 but can possibly be extended by six months more.</p>
