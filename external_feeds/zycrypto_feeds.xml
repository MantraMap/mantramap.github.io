<p>On May 11, John Deaton, the attorney and legal representative of XRP holders in the collective lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), supported the report presented by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a major business interest group, opposing the country&#8217;s current regulatory environment driven by the SEC.</p>



<p>According to the Chamber of Commerce, the SEC is misusing its powers, destabilizing the regulatory environment of cryptocurrencies and causing significant economic harm to Coinbase and the broader business community.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-holders-attorney-endorses-chamber-s-report-denouncing-sec-s-overreach"><strong>XRP holders&#8217; attorney endorses Chamber&#8217;s report, denouncing SEC&#8217;s overreach</strong></h2>



<p>XRP holders&#8217; attorney, Deaton, stated that the Chamber of Commerce was not the first to denounce the SEC&#8217;s overreach in the uncertain regulatory environment. For over two years, XRP holders have pointed out that the SEC won&#8217;t stop after its attack on Ripple.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;XRP holders were the first to call out the SEC&#8217;s gross overreach, but clearly, we aren&#8217;t the last. Over two years ago, we warned that this wouldn&#8217;t end with XRP. Even when the government&#8217;s overreach targets a project you dislike, you must stand against it.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Stuart Alderoty, Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer with over 35 years of legal experience in regulatory affairs and complex litigation, noted that the current uncertain regulatory environment is not just a crypto problem but a &#8220;We The People&#8221; problem. The regulations affect not only the crypto ecosystem but all individuals and businesses involved.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For this SEC Chair the judicial process is a weapon to be wielded and Congressional oversight is a game of hide and seek. This isn’t a crypto problem, this is a “We The People” problem.</p>&mdash; Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1657016970267484168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chamber&#8217;s submission could impact crypto regulation</strong></h2>



<p>The Chamber of Commerce made three compelling arguments against the SEC that could add more credibility to the companies and proponents fighting <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">legal battles</a> against the SEC.</p>



<p>Firstly, they indicated that regulatory uncertainty stifles innovation in the United States. Secondly, the SEC is destabilizing the regulatory environment of cryptocurrencies. And lastly, the SEC is violating due process and the right to fair notification.</p>



<p>The last point relates explicitly to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-goes-offensive-against-the-sec-with-lawsuit-targeted-at-regulatory-clarity/">Coinbase&#8217;s</a> lack of response from the SEC when asked to explain which assets offered on its platform are considered securities. The SEC, so far, has been unwilling or unable to respond, even after receiving a court order from a U.S. court to address Coinbase&#8217;s legal action.</p>



<p>As recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-v-sec-chamber-of-digital-commerce-weighs-in-argues-regulator-is-causing-substantial-economic-harm/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, Coinbase is receiving support from various entities like the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), the world&#8217;s largest blockchain advocacy and trade group, in its public battle against the SEC.</p>

<ul>
<li>The scaling tool is part of a suite of products in Cardano for DeFi.</li>



<li>It is an off-chain ‘mini ledger’ shared between small groups of participants.</li>
</ul>



<p>Cardano’s node <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-primed-for-meteoric-surge-as-first-hydra-head-opens-on-mainnet/">Hydra Head</a>, a collection of layer-2 protocols designed to boost the scalability of Cardano, has gone live on the mainnet, the blockchain developers announced Thursday.</p>



<p>Hydra Heads allow developers to integrate complex decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Cardano &#8211; a part of the DeFi-upgrades released on the network this year.</p>



<p>Sebastian Nagel, one of the developers, shared the&nbsp;technical document&nbsp;describing how Hydra Head version 0.10.0 works: an off-chain ‘mini-ledger’ shared among a small group of users, which increases the transaction speeds and reduces fees.</p>



<p>‘‘After demonstrating Hydra Heads on the Cardano mainnet in recent monthly review sessions, we have released the first mainnet compatible version of Hydra-node today,’’ Nagel said in a series of tweets.</p>



<p>The first version of Hydra Head was released at the start of the month. With the successful deployment on the mainnet, Cardano developers have updated the API to accommodate the first batch of requests, preparing Hydra for real-world use cases. The next version, 0.11.0, is reportedly underway.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cardano-s-series-of-defi-upgrades-unveiled-this-year"><strong>Cardano’s Series of DeFi Upgrades Unveiled This Year</strong></h2>



<p>This year, Cardano has focused on releasing upgrades targeting DeFi. In January, the network announced the launch of its decentralized stablecoin, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-based-djed-stablecoin-attracts-over-30m-ada-in-the-first-week-since-launch/">Djed</a>. It was followed by Lace Wallet, a platform that allows Cardano users to stake native ADA tokens.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-to-test-cardanos-new-wallet-with-1000000-worth-of-ada-experiment/">Lace</a> is similar to MetaMask, a browser-built wallet where users can access and operate Cardano-based decentralized applications, sending and receiving ADA, non-fungible tokens, and other digital assets. With Lace, multiple assets can be transferred bundled as one transaction and charged a single fee, significantly saving costs.</p>



<p>Besides, Cardano’s Ethereum Virtual Machine layer, Milkomeda, announced last March that it was integrating a feature enabling every Cardano user to access EVM contracts from Cardano wallets. EVM stores Ethereum accounts and smart contracts for deploying dApps.</p>



<p>The announcement of Hydra heads had caused an increase in the price of ADA by 2% at press time to $0.3652. But more importantly, as Cardano blockchain expands its capability for smart contracts and DeFi, experts project the price to rise even higher.</p>

<ul>
<li>Musk did not immediately reveal the identity of his replacement.</li>



<li>Major outlets have identified the new Twitter boss as Linda Yaccarino, NBCU’s global advertisement chief.</li>
</ul>



<p>According to a Thursday announcement, Elon Musk has picked a new chief executive officer several months after acquiring Twitter. Following this step, there are many speculations as to how the crypto space would be under the new boss.</p>



<p>Musk did not identify his replacement in the announcement but said that the new executive, a woman, would start the job in six weeks.</p>



<p>The Wall Street Journal was the first media house to take a stab at who the appointee could be, identifying her as Linda Yaccarino, the chairperson of global advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal. On Friday, NBCUniversal affirmed that Yaccarino would leave the company ‘‘effective immediately.’’</p>



<p>Following the news, the crypto community is speculating what the new appointment means for the digital asset space, considering the vital role Twitter plays in the sector. As it stands, nothing seemingly connects Yaccarino to the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there is optimism that Twitter&#8217;s ambition regarding digital assets will continue after Musk assumes the role of the chair and CTO at Twitter, which he disclosed in the announcement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Excited to announce that I&#8217;ve hired a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in 6 weeks. My role will transition to exec chair &amp; CTO,&#8221; Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1656748197308674048?s=20">said</a>, adding that he would &#8221;oversee product, software, and sysops (systems operations.).&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-change-to-the-crypto-space-dynamics"><strong>A Change to the Crypto Space Dynamics?</strong></h2>



<p>Musk&#8217;s move comes when Twitter has shifted focus to cryptocurrency, especially integrating digital asset payments into the platform. At the start of the year, the social network <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoiners-cheer-as-elon-musk-charts-a-bullish-course-for-twitter-crypto-payments/">announced</a> it was creating systems permitting payment for fiat and cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin, Musk&#8217;s favourite meme token, surged after the announcement.</p>



<p>Twitter has also taken steps to boost the adoption of digital currencies, including a partnership with crypto and stocks brokerage firm, eToro, enabling users to trade digital assets. Besides, in April, the San Francisco-based company <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-soars-over-25-after-elon-musk-replaces-twitters-logo-with-shiba-inu-image/">replaced</a> the Twitter logo with that of Dogecoin, resulting in a jump in DOGE prices.</p>



<p>However, the announcement of the new CEO has yet to significantly impact the price of DOGE, which changed hands for $0.07107 at press time, a difference of +0.32% in the past day.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency by Market capitalization, has seen a significant dip in its value, dropping below the $26,500 mark amidst rumours of a US government sale of BTC.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has plunged by over 10% in the past week, becoming its second-worst week since its price tapped a 10-month high of $30,000 last month. The latest dip comes amidst rumours that the US government plans to sell a large amount of Bitcoin from its reserves, potentially flooding the market and driving down prices even further.</p>

<p>As ZyCrypto <a href="https://zycrypto.com/40000-btc-from-us-government-seizures-in-motion-what-could-it-mean-for-bitcoin/">reported</a>, on March 14th, the US government reportedly sold 9,861 Bitcoin, worth approximately $215 million, seized from criminals involved in illegal activities on the Silk Road website. According to a court filing in April, the US government revealed it further plans to sell another 41,490 BTC in connection with Silk Road in four separate batches this year. The online marketplace facilitated illegal activities and was seized by law enforcement agencies in 2013.</p>



<p>This week has been enough to spook investors and send prices plummeting, with roughly $44 million in BTC being liquidated in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, independent analysts and research firms refuted the sale claims, with CryptoQuant describing the rumours as “coordinated fake news.”</p>



<p>“<em>Coordinated FAKE NEWS about US government selling Bitcoins leads to second-largest long liquidations in 2023. Many accounts retweeted this news without any fact-checking, and as a result, we saw the second-largest long liquidations in 2023, with over $36M being liquidated within one hour,”</em> Cryptoquant tweeted on May 11.</p>



<p>Arkham, another onchain crypto analytics firm, also distanced itself from the FUD, labelling recent claims showing the said sales with alleged data from its website as false. </p>



<p><em>“Users on Arkham&#8217;s platform can manually add and remove labels for their own private instances. Our platform provides Arkham Entities that can be edited by users in their own sessions. These do not reflect associations with wallets made by the Arkham Team.”</em></p>



<p>That said, while the US government&#8217;s potential sale of Bitcoin has caused a ripple effect in the market, investors should take the news with a grain of salt, considering it is not the first time rumours of the US government selling BTC have circulated.</p>



<p>At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $26,301, down 3.30% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Montenegrin officials have granted Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon bail in the travel document forgery case. Kwon will be freed from jail on a supervised&nbsp; €400,000 ($436,000) bail pending trial.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do Kwon Out On $460,000 Bail</strong></h2>



<p>The man who stands accused of masterminding the implosion of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022 is set to be released from custody in Montenegro.</p>



<p>According to the May 12 announcement, the Basic Court in Podgorica accepted a request made by Do Kwon’s attorneys on Thursday to cough out 400,000 euros ($436,000) to have him put under house arrest instead of being in jail.</p>



<p>The court also agreed to release Terraform’s former chief financial officer Chang-joon Han on a similar €400,000 bond. Under the bail conditions, Kwon and Han will remain under surveillance and are barred from leaving their apartments. If the house arrest is breached, the bail will be put in a “special section” of the court’s working budget, the announcement said.</p>



<p>The two were <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-luna-sees-selloff-following-founder-do-kwons-arrest-in-montenegro/">apprehended </a>by Montenegro police at the Podgorica airport in March while trying to board a plane to Dubai. They reportedly possessed fake passports from Belgium and Costa Rica. They also had at least one genuine passport given by South Korea, their native homeland.</p>



<p>The prosecution initially fought the bail request, indicating that Kwon and Han have adequate financial means but no interest in staying in Montenegro. Local prosecutors now have three days to appeal the decision if they are unsatisfied with it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kwon-s-mounting-legal-troubles"><strong>Kwon’s Mounting Legal Troubles</strong></h2>



<p>The court decision today comes after Kwon and Han pleaded not guilty to charges of travelling with falsified documents and presented their defence at a Thursday court hearing.</p>



<p>After legal proceedings regarding the forgery case in Montenegro are concluded, Kwon faces extradition to the U.S. or South Korea. The disgraced founder faces criminal charges in both countries for his role in the fall of the Luna token and TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin, an event that sent ripples throughout the crypto industry and set off a series of high-profile bankruptcies.</p>



<p>As <em>ZyCrypto </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwons-woes-escalate-as-south-korea-freezes-176m-of-his-assets/">reported</a>, South Korean authorities recently seized Kwon’s personal assets worth $176 million, including a series of imported vehicles, bank deposits, cryptocurrencies held at a digital currency exchange, officetel, and an apartment complex in Seoul.</p>

<p>In December 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">filed a lawsuit</a> against Ripple, alleging that the company conducted an unregistered securities offering of its native XRP token. This article explores how this case&#8217;s outcome could shape the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>First of all, it&#8217;s essential to understand what a security is. Imagine John buying a piece of Company &#8220;A.&#8221; This means John is buying ownership of the company, and his &#8220;piece&#8221; will become more valuable if the company does well. If John decides to sell his piece for a higher price, he will make a profit. This is similar to what the SEC argues happened with Ripple. The SEC claims that Ripple raised over $1.3 billion by financing itself with an &#8220;equity&#8221; offering.</p>



<p>Now, you might be thinking, &#8220;People buy Bitcoin or Ethereum to make a profit and are considered an investment by retail investors.&#8221; And you&#8217;re correct. Most people are attracted to cryptocurrencies because of their rapid increase in value during speculative bull runs. But the classification of whether a cryptocurrency is a security depends on how it was marketed by its &#8220;creators.&#8221; This classification is crucial for the future of the market.</p>



<p>If XRP is considered a security, it would likely be subject to strict regulatory oversight and restrictions, including registering with the SEC and complying with various reporting and disclosure requirements.</p>



<p>This could set a precedent and give the SEC the power to apply these regulations to the entire cryptocurrency industry, potentially overburdening it with excessive regulations. Applying the same rules to a crypto project as a Nasdaq-listed stock would be highly challenging for many projects. Additionally, these regulations may include restrictions on who can purchase or hold the token, which could lead to a significant drop in demand for the market.</p>



<p>However, regulations aren&#8217;t necessarily negative for the market. Scams and Ponzi schemes are common in this industry, and a new, clear regulatory framework could reduce uncertainty and make transactions smoother. Additionally, the framework must take into account the unique value that each cryptocurrency brings.</p>



<p>For example, XRP was designed for cross-border payments, similar to a currency. Other cryptocurrencies were designed for facilitating transactions as a governance token in various NFT projects or for executing transactions as a governance token in several NFT projects, or transferring and storing value, like Bitcoin.</p>



<p>In conclusion, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">the outcome</a> of the SEC vs Ripple case has the potential to shape the future of the industry as it confirms or redefines the concept of “cryptocurrency”. It will be interesting to see how the industry develops in response to the decision.</p>

<ul>
<li>The ongoing banking crisis and hyperinflation are the other catalysts Saylor believes could boost the adoption of Bitcoin.</li>



<li>Ordinals have caused a surge in activity on the top blockchain.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s famous maximalist and co-founder of MicroStrategy, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/mammoth-btc-whale-the-chinese-government-holds-more-bitcoin-than-michael-saylors-microstrategy/">Michael Saylor</a>, says that the latest enthusiasm around Ordinals is a catalyst for Bitcoin adoption.</p>



<p>Speaking on PBD Podcast, Saylor added that the growing cases of bank failures, soaring inflation, and the clampdown by the regulators on digital assets were the other key factors that could drive the next bull run.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Every time someone builds an application that&#8217;s cool on Bitcoin, like all the Ordinals and inscriptions and whatever that are driving up transactions fees, it is a catalyst, he said, adding that &#8220;a company like Microstrategy buying another $100 million worth of bitcoin,&#8221; is also a catalyst.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the Ordinals are taking Bitcoin and the entire crypto space by storm, judging by the recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-weekly-transactions-hit-new-high-as-ordinals-mint-goes-past-2-5-million-sets-new-record/">surge in activities</a> reported on the blockchain. The feature surfaced at the beginning of the year, allowing users to store media on the blockchain by inscribing data on the smallest unit of bitcoin, Satoshi, as non-fungible tokens.</p>



<p>The result has been a jump in the transaction fees for the transfer of bitcoins on the network. According to BitInfoCharts, the average transaction fee on Bitcoin was $20 at press time, representing a jump of more than 500% before May 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ordinals-push-btc-transaction-fees-for-miners-above-the-mining-rewards"><strong>Ordinals Push BTC Transaction Fees for Miners Above the Mining Rewards</strong></h2>



<p>Besides, for the first time since 2017, some Bitcoin miners received more rewards for validating transactions on the blockchain than they were getting for minting new tokens, thanks to Ordinals. </p>



<p>A new fungible standard, BRC-20, introduced in March atop Ordinals, has also brought new use cases of the Bitcoin block space to meme tokens. The current market cap for the BRC-20 tokens, according to brc-20.io, is more than $500 million.</p>



<p>Colin Harper, head of content for mining pool Luxor Technologies, agrees with Saylor concerning the potential of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Recently he commented that the development is a &#8220;cool example of how, just when you think Bitcoin has become boring, something is waiting around the corner that surprises everyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>MicroStrategy <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-spends-29-million-buying-more-bitcoin-as-btc-eyes-30000/">added 7,500 bitcoins</a> last quarter, bringing its total holding to 140,000, according to the firm&#8217;s first quarter 2023 financial results. The company also reported that its digital asset impairment losses had narrowed to $18.9 million from $197.6 million in the prior quarter.</p>

<ul>
<li>The meme token has plunged more than half since peaking on May 5.</li>



<li>Most trading volumes have shifted from Uniswap to centralized exchanges, including Binance.</li>
</ul>



<p>Major crypto whales are accumulating large amounts of meme crypto PEPE coin, despite a drop in prices, on-chain analytics tool Lookonchain reported.</p>



<p><em>‘‘3 whales started to buy $PEPE after the price dropped. 0x50C1 withdrew 1.4T $PEPE ($2.76 million) from Binance when the price was $0.000002054. 0x2Baa bought 212B $PEPE (429K) with 223 $ETH (412k) at $0.000001942. 0x3ae8 bought 424B $PEPE ($864K) with 450 $ETH (831K) at $0.000001957,’’ Lookonchain posted on Twitter.</em></p>



<p>Since <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binances-listing-of-pepe-and-floki-in-its-innovation-zone-strikes-further-eruption/">Binance listed</a> the meme token, inspired by the cartoon meme character Pepe the Frog, on May 6, the exchange has seen huge volumes of the token’s trading on its platform, a shift from decentralized to centralized exchanges.</p>



<p>At press time, data from CoinGecko showed that PEPE’s trading volumes were over $430 million, most of which came from Binance. Despite the price decline, the number of $PEPE holders has surpassed 100,000, according to DexTools.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pepe-down-more-than-50"><strong>$PEPE Down More Than 50%</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/how-this-early-pepe-buyer-turned-260-into-almost-8-million-amid-meme-coin-frenzy/">PEPE peaked</a> at an all-time price high of $0.000004354 on May 5, with daily volumes of $1.61 billion, according to the data shared by CoinMarketCap. But, at press time, the token was changing hands for $0.000001577, representing a price decline of more than 52%,</p>



<p>The decline was reportedly exacerbated by profit-taking by traders and those using advanced trading strategies &#8211; Pepe-tracked futures. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, an increase in ether deposits showed traders were likely taking profits from their Pepe positions.</p>



<p><em>‘‘Exchange addresses interacting on the network is now at its highest level since November 2021, Santiment posted on Twitter, adding, ‘‘as expected, $ETH is showing decoupling signs and on the cusp of breaking $2k once again.’’</em></p>



<p>Nonetheless, market experts are questioning how sustainable $PEPE would be in the future, considering that few investors hold vast amounts of the token since it was tilted on the Ethereum blockchain, risking having few holders in control.</p>

<p>Coinbase is facing withering backlash and a boycott from some members of the crypto community who are turned off by the exchange’s Pepe-hating rhetoric.</p>



<p>In an email newsletter sent to Coinbase users on Wednesday, the crypto exchange called Pepe a “hate symbol” while highlighting an association of the Pepe the Frog meme to political groups.</p>



<p>“The token is based on the Pepe the Frog meme, which first surfaced on the internet nearly 20 years ago as a comic-strip character,” the email read. “Over time it has been co-opted as a hate symbol by alt-right groups, according to the Anti-Defamation League.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pepe-community-seethes-with-anger"><strong>Pepe Community Seethes With Anger&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>While the email has a disclaimer that dissociates the writer and does “not necessarily reflect the views of Coinbase or its employees”, a legion of fans and investors of the frog-themed meme coin were outraged at Coinbase’s portrayal of their beloved token.</p>



<p>Solidity developer and PEPE supporter Kenobi, for instance, astutely stated that the token is not a symbol of hate and that he would be transferring his crypto funds to Gemini digital asset exchange.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The hashtag “#deletecoinbase” began trending on Twitter Thursday as users seemingly deleted their accounts with the leading U.S. exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Former congressional candidate David Gokhshtein <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgokhshtein/status/1656485195099324418">predicts </a>that Coinbase will lose a boatload of customers for “disrespecting PEPE”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase Avoids Listing PEPE</strong></h2>



<p>After the market’s largest exchange Binance, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binances-listing-of-pepe-and-floki-in-its-innovation-zone-strikes-further-eruption/">listed </a>Pepe on the platform’s innovation zone on May 5, the token’s fans have been calling for other crypto exchanges to list the newly-launched meme coin as well.</p>



<p>Winklevoss twins-owned exchange Gemini succumbed to the pressure as it <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-now-supports-pepe">announced </a>the listing of PEPE on May 9. Coinbase, on the other hand, has not indicated any plans to list the token on its exchange for trading.</p>



<p>Pepecoin has been on a roll since its launch last month, with its market cap peaking at $1.82 billion on May 6. Besides its stratospheric price increase, the flurry of speculation also sent Ethereum gas fees skyrocketing to 12-month highs.</p>



<p>However, the Pepe rally has run out of steam in recent days, with the token falling from a peak of $0.00000431 to $0.00000164 at press time, per CoinGecko. The downward price action has seen the meme coin’s total market cap sinking to $691 million.</p>

<p>It appears things are only getting worse for disgraced Terra founder Do Kwon. A Wednesday report revealed that South Korean prosecutors had managed to freeze around 233.3 billion Korean won, valued at about $176 million, in Kwon’s personal assets as criminal proceedings against the former Terraform Labs CEO continue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kwon-s-funds-frozen"><strong>Kwon’s Funds Frozen</strong></h2>



<p>Do Kwon has had his assets frozen by South Korean authorities.</p>



<p>According to a May 10 report from local publication Hankyung, Chief Judge Yoon Chan-young of the 12th Criminal Division of the Seoul Southern District Court approved the prosecutors’ request to lock Kwon’s property. The assets in question include the Galleria Foret apartment complex in Seongdong-gu, Seoul, a new officetel in Nonhyeon-dong, and multiple imported cars.</p>



<p>The judge also prohibited the sale of Kwon&#8217;s financial assets, such as securities deposited in Mirae Asset Securities, deposits in Woori Bank, and crypto assets stored in personal wallets on exchanges.</p>



<p>South Korean law mandates that suspects are banned from the disposition of assets or proceeds obtained illegally until a conviction is made.</p>



<p>Last week, the director of Seoul Southern District’s joint financial crimes told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> that Kwon is facing up to 40 years behind bars if convicted — the longest sentence handed to a financial crime in the history of&nbsp; South Korea.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From Crypto ‘Genius’ To Alleged Crypto Scammer</strong></h2>



<p>The spectacular collapse of Terra’s Luna and the UST algorithmic stablecoin back in May 2022 was a key catalyst for the crypto industry’s slip into its crypto winter, with the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies falling hard and several high-profile players like<a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-weeks-of-hiding-3ac-founders-break-silence-blame-luna-for-hedge-fund-collapse/"> Three Arrows Capital </a>becoming insolvent.</p>



<p>Kwon was infamously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/another-theranos-do-kwon-stares-at-multiple-lawsuits-as-investors-sense-fraud-in-terras-debacle/">compared </a>to the infamous Elizabeth Holmes, who promised Theranos investors far more than she could deliver.</p>



<p>In mid-February this year, roughly 9 months after the Terra ecosystem careened to zero, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-alleging-securities-fraud/">lodged </a>civil charges for securities fraud against Kwon and his now-defunct Singapore-based firm Terraform Labs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SEC claims, for a start, that Terraform Labs worked with U.S.-based trading firms to keep the illusion that UST’s self-balancing algorithm truly worked to keep its price pegged to one dollar. Both through these relationships and through more direct techniques, the SEC states that the beleaguered crypto founder and Terraform frequently intervened in the market for Luna and TerraUSD.</p>



<p>Then, in March, came the news that everyone in the cryptosphere was really hoping for. Authorities of the small Balkan nation of Montenegro disclosed that their police… had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-luna-sees-selloff-following-founder-do-kwons-arrest-in-montenegro/">apprehended </a>Do Kwon.</p>



<p>The detention was swiftly confirmed by both South Korean law enforcement and by Interpol. And within hours, U.S. prosecutors slapped the South Korean national with eight counts of fraud, adding to the civil charges filed previously by the SEC.</p>



<p>Both South Korea and the U.S. are currently vying for the extradition of the crypto entrepreneur once hailed as a genius.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of ETH in whale addresses drops weeks after the Shanghai update, indicating that big investors may be leaning bearish.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Conversely, “shrimps” or small-scale investors with less than 1 ETH have increased their holdings in the past weeks.</li>



<li>Digital asset analysts debate ETH price-to-whale ratio with some saying it is no longer a huge indicator as shown by charts in recent months.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Post-Shanghai era for Ethereum (ETH) came with many possibilities for the network, including attracting more investors but a new statistic shows something might be brewing among big investors.</p>



<p>New data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode show that ETH supply in whale addresses has dropped since Shapella hit the Ethereum network. A drop in whale addresses could signify a shift in perspective from large investors who now look bearish for the short term.</p>



<p>ETH in wallets above 1000 &#8211; 10000 ETH stood at 14.167 million ETH a day for Shapella however, weeks after the update, the figure now stands at 14.033 million ETH. A week before the update, whales had acquired the highest amount of ETH in 2023, 14.303 million ETH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the assets held by whales continue to decline, a similar pattern is also shown by smaller investors with 1- 1000 ETH and even mega whales above 10,000 ETH. However, users with less than 1 ETH have slightly increased their holdings.</p>



<p>Described as “shrimps”, their net position rose from 1.79 million to 1.80 million ETH. The Shapella upgrade hit Ethereum’s mainnet on April 12 to enable users to withdraw their staked assets for the first time since the Merge, which saw the network transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-the-price-of-eth">What’s next for the price of ETH?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>ETH has recorded a good run this year, soaring 55.29% and going <a href="https://zycrypto.com/post-shanghai-huge-influx-of-eth-in-exchanges-leave-experts-at-crossroads-as-price-falls-below-2k/">past</a> the $2,000 resistance level last month before declining below $1,900. Historically, reduced whale activity would give assets a bearish outlook as whales often ignite bull runs, although this is not always the case.</p>



<p>Between 2020 and 2021, ETH witnessed declining whale activity despite going on a bull run in 2021, but from the downtrend in 2022, whale holdings have risen by nearly 1 million ETH driving up the price to $1,857.</p>



<p>Ethereum has dipped since the Shanghai update as validators withdraw their staked assets. A declining whale activity coupled with a reduced investment of staked ETH points downward for the asset.</p>

<p>The world’s largest blockchain advocacy and trade group, the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), has announced backing Coinbase in its legal and public relations battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The Chamber of Commerce filed an amicus brief on Tuesday, claiming that the U.S. regulator’s antagonistic stance against crypto is causing significant economic harm.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-trade-group-files-amicus-brief-in-coinbase-v-sec"><strong>Crypto Trade Group Files Amicus Brief In Coinbase v. SEC</strong></h2>



<p>CDC, a non-profit trade association that engages government officials on the use of crypto and blockchain, has filed an amicus brief in the ongoing court case between America’s leading exchange Coinbase and the SEC.</p>



<p>In the amicus brief — a legal document supplied to a court of law that allows a non-litigant to submit their expertise or opinion in a case as “a friend” of the court — the Chamber of Digital Commerce argued that by failing to respond to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-goes-offensive-against-the-sec-with-lawsuit-targeted-at-regulatory-clarity/">Coinbase’s July 2022 petition</a> for sufficient regulatory guidance, the SEC is “causing substantial economic harm to both Coinbase and the broader business community.”</p>



<p>Filed on May 9, CDC says it is supporting Coinbase as it seeks formal rulemaking within the digital assets sector. In particular, the exchange wants the SEC to answer when a token sale constitutes an investment contract — and therefore qualifies as a securities offering.</p>



<p>The amicus brief also notes that the CDC has a strong interest in ensuring there is enough clarity around regulations applying to digital assets:</p>



<p><em>“Chamber’s members have a strong interest in regulatory clarity, and many of its members are companies subject to US securities laws that may be adversely affected by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s current approach to digital assets.”</em></p>



<p>In recent months, the SEC has pursued a spate of enforcement actions against what it considered issuers of unregistered securities. Recently, those crypto cases have come at a furious pace, with the SEC even boosting the size of its digital assets enforcement team.</p>



<p>The securities watchdog in March sent Coinbase a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">Wells Notice</a> regarding aspects of the company’s staking service Coinbase Earn and Coinbase Wallet after a cursory probe, tipping it off that the regulator is building a case against it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chamber Says Innovation And Regulation Can Co-Exist</strong></h2>



<p>The Chamber of Commerce further argued in the brief that the lack of regulatory certainty in the U.S. is stifling innovation.</p>



<p>“The digital-asset industry offers a case study in how regulatory uncertainty undermines innovation. Before the Commission began rattling its saber, the industry grew quickly — reaching a trillion dollars in market capitalization by early 2021,” the amicus brief noted.</p>



<p>The trader group also has serious concerns about the SEC not testing its legal allegations in court because it forces most companies to settle its enforcement actions. The agency leaves crypto firms to “accept the risk of future litigation — and the associated financial burdens — or they can stop engaging in conduct that the agency might or might not ultimately target.”</p>



<p>The Third Circuit Court of Appeals recently ordered the SEC to respond to Coinbase’s complaint within ten days.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-debuts-offshore-exchange-with-bitcoin-and-ethereum-perpetual-futures-amid-regulatory-challenges-in-the-us/">rolled out</a> its international platform earlier this month via regulatory approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Coinbase International Exchange will first list Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures.</p>

<p>It was recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/garlinghouse-reveals-ripple-will-spend-200m-defending-itself-against-the-sec-even-as-case-worries-xrp-holders/">reported </a>that Ripple Labs would spend roughly $200 million defending the SEC lawsuit. However, top venture capitalist Jason Calacanis has claimed that the San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm would have spent less if it only registered XRP as a security.</p>



<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse did not hesitate to criticize Calacanis, alluding to his lack of securities laws knowledge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-is-obviously-a-security"><strong>“XRP Is Obviously A Security”</strong></h2>



<p>It all started when well-known tech investor and podcaster Jason Calacanis commented on Brad Garlinghouse’s recent interview, revealing that Ripple’s courtroom battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is set to cost his company a lot staggering $200 million.</p>



<p>In Jason’s view, XRP is “obviously a security”, adding that it would have cost Ripple way less if it went to the SEC and registered the token as a security. He added that the company should have just “played by the rules” like other participants in the crypto industry.</p>



<p>The SEC — which is currently going after crypto like never before — <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">accused </a>Ripple of violating federal securities laws. The specific complaint revolves around the firm’s sale of the XRP cryptocurrency without obtaining prior registration with the watchdog agency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, the Ripple chief questioned Jason’s understanding of securities laws and noted that he was known for making controversial statements and taking aim at topics without proper knowledge. Garlinghouse also indicated that the VC’s assertion was both “embarrassing” and “hilariously wrong” given that U.S. authorities have not provided sector-specific rules for registering digital assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More Support For XRP</strong></h2>



<p>The heated exchange between Ripple and Jason spotlights the ongoing debate surrounding the security status of XRP and the lack of a clear rulebook for cryptocurrencies in the United States.</p>



<p>Attorney John E. Deaton, who is representing XRP holders as amicus curiae, also contributed to the argument initiated by Jason. Deaton said the claim that Ripple sold XRP as a security is one thing, while the claim that XRP, which is basically a line of code inside the software, is a security is another thing.</p>



<p>The legal expert also asked where other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Algorand (ALGO), and Stellar (XLM) have registered for they not to be facing the same attack from the SEC.</p>



<p>The three-year battle between the SEC and Ripple — possibly coming to an end soon — is expected to set a precedent for the treatment of cryptocurrencies, particularly altcoins, under U.S. securities and commodities laws.</p>

<p>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest exchange by trading volume, announced it is working on including Bitcoin’s Ordinals tokens in its non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.</p>



<p>According to an official <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/nft/binance-nft-marketplace-to-support-bitcoin-nfts-4250480174684233711?ref=AZTKZ9XS&amp;utm_source=BinanceTwitter&amp;utm_medium=GlobalSocial&amp;utm_campaign=GlobalSocial">statement</a>, Ordinals tokens will be included in &#8220;the coming weeks&#8221; as the exchange expands its NFT ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-wants-to-expand-its-nft-marketplace"><strong>Binance wants to expand its NFT Marketplace</strong></h2>



<p>Binance is working with other relevant projects from the Bitcoin Ordinals community to drive its expansion. Currently, Binance&#8217;s marketplace only supports three networks: BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon.</p>



<p>Therefore, the team hopes that integrating the Bitcoin network will elevate its marketplace and turn it into an &#8220;open marketplace ecosystem, where users can explore and trade a wider variety of NFTs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thanks to this integration, Binance users will be able to trade Bitcoin NFTs without the need for a separate Ordinals wallet. This could benefit the NFT market by removing barriers to entry for artists and content creators with little experience in the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>Binance will focus on finding quality NFT projects that are &#8220;innovative&#8221; to support the growth and development of Bitcoin Ordinals.</p>



<p>Those who wish to participate in Binance&#8217;s special registration event, which includes opportunities to be whitelisted and receive an airdrop, must complete a form available from May 09 to May 15 at 23:59 UTC.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that many crypto enthusiasts have rejected Ordinals tokens due to congestion caused by the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-weekly-transactions-hit-new-high-as-ordinals-mint-goes-past-2-5-million-sets-new-record/">excessive minting </a>of BRC20 tokens on the Bitcoin network and the non-financial nature of this implementation —which is considered by some to be against Bitcoin’s ethos as a P2P electronic cash system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are Bitcoin Ordinals, and why have they become a trend?</strong></h2>



<p>The Ordinals protocol essentially allows users to convert individual satoshis into unique NFTs by attaching additional data. This process is known as &#8220;inscription.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unlike traditional NFTs, Ordinals inscriptions can contain videos, images, texts, or codes. Although this could be innovative for artists in the crypto ecosystem, it has been the most significant problem caused by the latest Bitcoin &#8220;Taproot&#8221; update, according to some<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ordinals-project-surpasses-11000-nft-mints-in-weeks-amid-criticisms-from-bitcoin-maxis/"> bitcoin maximalists</a>.</p>



<p>Even Binance had to temporarily halt Bitcoin transactions over the weekend for a few hours due to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-sees-spike-in-transfer-fees-following-ordinals-launch/">network congestion</a> related to the issuance of BRC-20 tokens minted and traded through the Ordinals protocol.</p>
