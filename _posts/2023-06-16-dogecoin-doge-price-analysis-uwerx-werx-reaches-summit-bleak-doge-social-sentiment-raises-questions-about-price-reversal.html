<p>This article explores what the SEC lawsuit could mean for Dogecoin (DOGE) while exploring the unique benefits Uwerx has to offer its users.&nbsp;</p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): The Fate of the Meme Coin
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE), like several other tokens, has been caught in the SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. While several media platforms spread uncertainty and fear regarding Dogecoin (DOGE), crypto analysts take a different approach to the token&rsquo;s price predictions.</p>
<p>Most media outlets have communicated that the recent sell-offs and price drops in Dogecoin (DOGE) forewarn investors of an even bleaker future. But crypto analysts have stated that the sell-offs and price drops were not driven by long-term traders but by short-term investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to industry experts, the fate of Dogecoin (DOGE) in the crypto market is less bleak than media outlets will lead most to believe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Dogecoin (DOGE) sells at $0.061421, with a live market cap of $8,554,931,776. Dogecoin&rsquo;s (DOGE) market supply is presently at 139,736,336,384 DOGE. Due to market sentiments, Dogecoin (DOGE) is predicted to reach $0.092 by 2024.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): A Brighter Future
<p>Uwerx is positioned to be the leading freelance platform globally. Uwerx is set to be different and preferable compared to other freelancing platforms. Considering Uwerx&rsquo;s increasing numbers, one might state that Uwerx is already meeting its goals.</p>
<p>With over 6,200 sign-ups on the Uwerx platform, over 1,600 followers on Twitter, and over 1,600 subscribers to the Telegram community, the Uwerx platform is growing beyond all expectations. While other platforms might take this as a sign to work less hard, the Uwerx team remains unrelenting. With the current listing on CoinSniper and the scheduled Uwerx listing on Uniswap by the 1st of August, the Uwerx Team is doing all it can to ensure that Uwerx reaches its target audience.</p>
<p>The confidence of the Uwerx team in expanding its reach can be traced to several factors. Firstly, Uwerx has successfully passed its audit approval by InterFi Network and SolidProof. This implies that the platform is excellent by all standards in the industry. In addition, Uwerx is set to only offer a 1% transaction fee, a very affordable fee compared to Upwork and Fiverr&rsquo;s 10 and 20%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx will also be offering its users incentivization and gamification features to serve as more motivation for their work. Uwerx will also put a 25-year liquidity lock in place for its tokens. Uwerx team tokens are included in the mix as team tokens have already been locked for nine months, further assuring Uwerx users of the security and stability of their tokens. Once Uwerx is unveiled on the 4th of August, 2023, contract ownerships will be renounced, thus eliminating the likelihood of scams and fraud.</p>
<p>The Uwerx Vault has now been unveiled, allowing Uwerx users to store their tokens securely, just like staking, as they get rewarded dependent on the variables existing within the platform. The&nbsp; Alpha platform has also been unveiled, and Uwerx will soon be transitioning from the Alpha Platform to the Beta platform, allowing Uwerx users to test the platform for themselves. The Uwerx team encourages users to send their feedback via email to the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the 31st of July, 2023, when Uwerx&rsquo;s presale ends, WERX token holders will receive their tokens in a 6-week vesting period. Uwerx will also carry out a Test Airdrop when the Uwerx presale ends.&nbsp;</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Presale: Beyond the Stars
<p>The Uwerx team has been in awe of Uwerx&rsquo;s incredible growth and sell-out of its presale. The first four stages of Uwerx&rsquo;s presale were all sold out in a very short time. The Uwerx team has also had to modify the critical token allocations due to the high demands for Uwerx.</p>
<p>WERX tokens sell at $0.041 per token with a 15% bonus on all purchases. Considering that Uwerx will be launched officially on the 4th of August, this price is bound to increase soon.&nbsp;</p>
