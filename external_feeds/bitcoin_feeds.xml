Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) has promised to ensure that “your right to use and hold bitcoin is inviolable” if he is elected U.S. president. “Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, it points the way toward a future in which government institutions are more transparent and more democratic,” said the presidential hopeful.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Bitcoin Promise</h2>
<p>U.S. Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) has made a promise regarding bitcoin if he is elected president of the United States. Kennedy is a son of former U.S. Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy. RFK Jr. tweeted Tuesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>As president, I will make sure that your right to use and hold bitcoin is inviolable.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, it points the way toward a future in which government institutions are more transparent and more democratic,” he continued.</p>
<p>The presidential hopeful explained in May that he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-advocates-for-bitcoin-and-opposes-cbdcs-in-candid-interview/">opposes</a> central bank digital currencies, stating that CBDCs “will vastly magnify the government’s power to suffocate dissent by cutting off access to funds with a keystroke.” Warning that central bank digital currency could lead to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-government-could-ban-seize-bitcoin-cbdcs-could-lead-to-financial-slavery-political-tyranny/">financial slavery and political tyranny</a>, he emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>I support bitcoin, which allows people to conduct transactions free from government interference. Bitcoin has been a lifesaver for people’s movements around the world, especially in Burma.</p></blockquote>

<p>“Cryptocurrencies, led by bitcoin, along with other crypto technologies are a major innovation engine. It is a mistake for the U.S. government to hobble the industry and drive innovation elsewhere. Biden’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-budget-proposal-targets-crypto-investors-using-like-kind-exchange-provision-plan-aims-to-tax-crypto-miners-30/">proposed 30% tax</a> on cryptocurrency mining is a bad idea,” he also tweeted in May.</p>
<p>Kennedy, who <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-to-accept-btc-for-campaign-contributions-says-bitcoin-is-an-exercise-in-democracy/">accepts bitcoin</a> donations for his presidential campaign, also recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-slams-sec-for-protecting-banks-instead-of-american-people-calls-for-crypto-friendly-commissioners/">slammed</a> the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for protecting banks instead of the American people. “I don’t want people on the SEC commission who are anti-crypto,&#8221; he stressed. &#8220;At most, they should be neutral, and we should have people on there who are from the crypto community.&#8221;</p>

A former SEC head of internet enforcement warned that the motion may “prompt the criminal authorities to expedite whatever action, if any, they plan on taking with respect to Binance.”</strong></p>
<h2>Judge Denies Binance’s Motion Against SEC</h2>
<p>Binance’s motion against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was denied by Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Monday. The motion was filed as part of the case in which the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">SEC charged Binance</a>, CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), and Binance US with securities law violations.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency exchange filed a motion asking Judge Jackson to prevent the securities regulator from making public statements alleging that Binance and Zhao mishandled the assets of U.S.-based customers. The cryptocurrency exchange argued that the SEC has not provided evidence of any commingling allegations and raised concerns that the regulator&#8217;s statements risk prejudicing the jury. Binance urged the judge to enforce a Washington, D.C., professional conduct rule which prohibits counsels from making misleading extrajudicial statements that could significantly impact court proceedings.</p>
<p>However, Judge Jackson denied the motion, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67474542/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-binance-holdings-limited/">stating</a> in her order:</p>
<blockquote><p>While all of the lawyers in this case should adhere to their ethical obligations at all times, it is not apparent that Court intervention to reiterate that point is needed at this time, or that it is necessary or appropriate for the Court to get involved in wordsmithing the parties&#8217; press releases. Nor is it clear that the agency&#8217;s public relations efforts to date will materially affect proceedings in this case.</p></blockquote>

<p>Former SEC official John Reed Stark, who called Binance’s motion “<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binances-provocative-motion-against-sec-could-expedite-criminal-charges-warns-former-sec-official/">provocative</a>,” commented on the judge’s decision Monday. Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years.</p>
<p>He stated that the judge&#8217;s decision to deny Binance&#8217;s motion was “lightning-fast,” stating that it was made &#8220;a mere 3 business days after Binance filed the motion and without ever even receiving any response/opposition from the SEC.&#8221; Deeming Binance&#8217;s motion filing to be unworthy, Stark opined: “I wonder how much Binance&#8217;s motion cost in legal fees and whether it was worth filing at all. It seemed so frivolous on its face and more akin to marketing theater than legal argument.” The former SEC internet enforcement chief concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>My view is that the motion may also prompt the criminal authorities to expedite whatever action, if any, they plan on taking with respect to Binance.</p></blockquote>

Curiously, the internet is teeming with headlines suggesting the plausibility of such a collapse, whether caused by cyberattacks, physical assaults on infrastructure, equipment malfunctions, or even the notion of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) incapacitating the most influential energy providers.</strong></p>
<h2>Antiquated and Fragile Power Grids Putting U.S. and Global Economies on Edge</h2>
<p>In recent months, the media has honed in on the potential for a grid collapse. On June 27, 2023, Wired writers Maryn McKenna and Matt Simon elucidated in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-grid-collapse-would-make-a-heat-wave-far-deadlier/#">editorial</a> that although the power system may possess resilience, it is not impervious to vulnerabilities. The article delves into the implications of scorching heat waves and questions whether contemporary power stations can withstand the demands. The authors elaborate on the detrimental impact hurricanes and earthquakes can have on the grid infrastructure, resulting in “widespread destruction.”</p>
<p>In a noteworthy development, Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, the electricity minister of the Republic of South Africa, expressed concerns about the detrimental effects of an excessive reliance on solar power, warning that it could potentially lead to a grid collapse in his region. Ramokgopa <a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/energy/699057/how-too-much-solar-could-collapse-the-grid/">emphasized</a>, &#8220;There are pitfalls to the rate at which you add new generation from solar PV. It has the potential to collapse the grid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Forbes decided to put the AI-powered chatbot, Chatgpt, to the test, questioning it about potential triggers for a collapse of the U.S. electric grid. Chatgpt <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/llewellynking/2023/05/17/chatgpt-ponders-us-electric-grid-collapse/?sh=2ee86df03eac">promptly identified</a> factors such as “extreme weather events,” “insufficient power generation,” “transmission network overload,” “cascading failures,” and “lack of grid resilience.” An <a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/2023/06/california-isolated-power-grid-vulnerable/">article</a> published in calmatters.org says California’s regionally isolated power grid “leaves the state vulnerable to failure.” Discussions of grid failure are at their peak again in Texas this summer as local media outlets <a href="https://www.kut.org/texasstandard/2023-06-22/ercot-texas-power-grid-energy-conservation-summer-heat-wave">claim</a> “Texans have the grid on their minds.”</p>
<p>Several countries have experienced widespread electric outages like Malaysia, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. In 2006, Europe dealt with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_power_outages">cascading breakdown</a> where millions of people were affected from Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Greece, Morocco, and Portugal. China suffered from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58733193">severe blackouts</a> and widespread electric outages in 2021 and it was reported that millions of homes and businesses were hit by power cuts. The fact is there are plenty of regions worldwide that could suffer from a major grid collapse.</p>

<p>Examples of this situation have happened time and time again all over the world. In April 2015, Washington D.C. experienced a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/07/widespread-power-outage-reported-in-washington-dc-area.html">widespread power outage</a> that affected government and privately-owned buildings, as well as the city&#8217;s public transit rail system. The same year, Turkey <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/massive-blackout-plunges-turkey-darkness/story?id=30024749">experienced</a> a massive nationwide power outage that affected almost all parts of the country. In March 2023, tripwire.com author Robert Ackerman Jr., explains that the “problem with the U.S. power grid [is that] it’s too vulnerable to attacks.” The number of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/26/physical-attacks-electrical-grid-peak-00075216">reported attacks</a> on the U.S. grid has surged in the past decade, with 2020, 2021, and 2022 being the most active.</p>
<h2>Widespread and Long-term Outages Could Collapse a Nation-State&#8217;s Entire Economy; No Country is Protected from EMPs</h2>
<p>In any country, a prolonged grid collapse yields significant and <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/301131449.pdf">severe economic repercussions</a>, as seen in the past.

Additionally, the prolonged absence of electricity can exacerbate matters by inflicting damage on critical infrastructure components. In fact, a widespread grid shutdown can precipitate the failure of a nation&#8217;s fiat system within days. Ultimately, the extent of impact and recovery timeline hinge upon diverse factors, including emergency response efficiency, resource availability, and the resilience of the population.</p>
<p>Thus far, both the United States and numerous other nations boasting interconnected grid systems have managed to withstand cyberattacks, physical assaults, and natural calamities. However, nation-states remain vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse (EMP), a destructive phenomenon. EMPs can occur naturally through solar flares or be induced by the electromagnetic radiation resulting from a nuclear explosion. These events trigger widespread voltage surges in electrical systems, often leading to substantial damage to electrical components. Presently, no country possesses complete protection against EMPs, and the U.S. government has <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-113hhrg89763/html/CHRG-113hhrg89763.htm">raised concerns</a> regarding China and Russia, suspecting their possession of EMP attack capabilities.</p>

The new service, known as Tradelink, has been heralded by Ledger as “the first open network to enable custodial trading via exchange and custodial partners.”</strong></p>
<h2>Ledger Targets Institutions With Tradelink Launch</h2>
<p>The security firm and crypto hardware manufacturer Ledger announced the launch of a new service on Wednesday that targets institutional investors. According to the company, the <a href="https://enterprise.ledger.com/tradelink/">Ledger Enterprise Tradelink</a> service will enable “off-exchange trading,” “enhanced security,” “distribution of risk,” “zero transaction fees,” and “faster and more efficient trading.”</p>
<p>Ledger details that it has partnered with a slew of asset managers and market makers such as Hodl Group, Wyden, Wintermute, Coinsquare, NDAX, Damex, Bitazza, Flowdesk, YouHodler, Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Huobi, Uphold Institutional, and Cex.io. Furthermore, Ledger partnered with regulated custodians such as Komainu, Tetratrust, Etana, Crypto Garage, Damex, and Kryptodian as well.</p>
<p>“We are creating a future-proof solution that will give Ledger Enterprise customers flexibility and security allowing institutions to de-risk their businesses,” the chairman and CEO of Ledger Pascal Gauthier detailed in a statement sent to Bitcoin.com News. “By unlocking better trading options for enterprises, we are empowering asset managers, custodians, and exchanges to navigate the changing landscape with confidence while making the whole ecosystem a safer and more transparent place,” Gauthier added.</p>

<p>Ledger&#8217;s latest service comes off the heels of the firm&#8217;s $109 million fundraising <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-hardware-wallet-maker-ledger-raises-100m-amid-growing-demand-for-secure-storage-solutions/">announcement</a> at the end of March 2023. Furthermore, Ledger revealed a new hardware wallet at the end of 2022 called the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ledger-reveals-new-crypto-hardware-wallet-designed-by-ipod-creator-tony-fadell/">Ledger Stax</a>, which was designed by iPod creator Tony Fadell. The company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ledger-faces-backlash-for-controversial-backup-tool-as-crypto-community-expresses-discontent/">faced backlash</a> for a controversial backup tool it introduced but later disclosed it would work toward open-sourcing its code as much as possible. &#8220;So, we have made the decision to accelerate the open-sourcing roadmap,” Gauthier <a href="https://www.ledger.com/blog/ledger-recover-a-message-from-pascal-gauthier-chairman-ceo-at-ledger">said</a> at the time.</p>

The Nasdaq-listed software company&#x2019;s announcement came amid a series of positive developments in the crypto industry.</strong></p>
<h2>Microstrategy Adds 12,333 Bitcoin to Its Holdings</h2>
<p>Business intelligence and software company Microstrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) has expanded its bitcoin holdings. The company&#x2019;s co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor, announced in a tweet Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microstrategy has acquired an additional 12,333 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for ~$347.0 million at an average price of $28,136 per #bitcoin. As of 6/27/23 Microstrategy hodls 152,333 $<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> acquired for ~$4.52 billion at an average price of $29,668 per bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-8-k_6-28-2023.pdf">filing</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, the company clarified that the additional coins were acquired during the period between April 29 and June 27. At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin is $30,109.</p>
<p>Saylor is a vocal bitcoin supporter. He tweeted last week that the cryptocurrency &#x201C;now has the support of presidential candidates, regulators, legislators, money managers, bankers, investors, and the general public.&#x201D; The executive opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The future will bring a parade of positives for those intent on proliferating bitcoin as an instrument of economic empowerment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Microstrategy made its announcement amidst a series of positive developments in the crypto industry. Recently, the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager, Blackrock, filed to launch a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">bitcoin trust</a> that many believe to be a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Following Blackrock&#x2019;s move, several other major companies are reportedly submitting similar filings, including Fidelity. While the SEC has not approved a spot bitcoin ETF, the filings by major companies have sparked optimism in the crypto space that the securities regulator will grant approval in the near future.</p>
<p>Last week, a series of prominent financial institutions <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-backed-by-fidelity-schwab-citadel-launches-with-trading-of-4-cryptocurrencies/">launched EDX</a>, a cryptocurrency exchange that allows the trading of four cryptocurrencies. The platform&#x2019;s founding investors include Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, Paradigm, Sequoia Capital, and Virtu Financial. Moreover, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/deutsche-bank-applies-for-license-to-offer-crypto-custody-service/">Deutsche Bank</a> has applied for a license to offer crypto custody services in Germany. This week, banking giant <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hsbc-enables-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etf-trading-on-mobile-apps-in-hong-kong/">HSBC</a> also enabled bitcoin and ethereum ETF trading on its mobile apps in Hong Kong.</p>

Market uncertainty has heightened in recent days, following the news that Prime Trust has been placed into receivership. Additionally, traders&#8217; nerves increased ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s latest speech.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) fell by nearly 5% in today’s session, as traders reacted to several points of macro-economic news.</p>
<p>After surging to a peak of $0.000007668 on Tuesday, SHIB/USD dropped to an intraday bottom at $0.000007261 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This drop saw bearish sentiment marginally increase, with short sellers now seemingly targeting a floor at $0.00000640.</p>

<p>Overall, SHIB has fallen for three of the last six days, pushing its relative strength index (RSI) to a current low at 41.89.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the index fell below a support point at 46.00, and now seems to be heading for a lower floor at 40.00.</p>
<p>Should it reach this point, there is a good chance that the meme coin will be trading under the $0.00000700 mark.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>In addition to SHIB, polygon (MATIC) also edged lower on Wednesday, falling to a one-week low in the process.</p>
<p>MATIC/USD bottomed out at $0.6293 earlier in the day, which comes following Tuesday’s peak at $0.6713.</p>
<p>The drop in prices resulted in polygon falling to its lowest point since June 20, when it reached a low of $0.5913.</p>

<p>From the chart, this decline comes despite momentum appearing to be bullish, with the 10-day (red) moving average nearing an upwards cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Additionally, price strength has fallen below a floor at 39.00, and is tracking at 38.63 as of writing.</p>
<p>In the event MATIC continues to decline, a likely target for bears will be an upcoming support zone at $0.580.</p>

Bankman-Fried claims he was charged in a manner that violates the “rule of specialty” as far as the extradition treaty between the Bahamas and the United States is concerned.</strong></p>
<h2>Judge Throws Out Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Motion to Dismiss</h2>
<p>Disgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) attempt to dismiss criminal charges against him has been <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.167.0_3.pdf">rejected</a> by U.S. district judge Lewis Kaplan on June 27, 2023. SBF moved to dismiss the post-extradition charges (counts 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, and 13) because his legal team believes he was charged in a manner that violates the “rule of specialty.”</p>
<p>Essentially, SBF claimed that the extradition process from the Bahamas to the United States did not adhere to the rule of specialty because he was being charged with additional offenses beyond those specified in the extradition request.</p>
<p>SBF’s legal team insisted that the United States exceeded the initial agreement&#8217;s scope by bringing forth charges that were not part of the extradition arrangement. Judge Kaplan determined that the charges brought against Bankman-Fried were within the permissible scope of the extradition treaty.</p>
<p>As a result, the judge rejected Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attempt to dismiss the criminal charges, indicating that he would have to face trial for the offenses specified in the extradition process.</p>
<p>Kaplan said the charges are “joined properly with the other pre-extradition charges in this case because a common scheme unifies them.” The common scheme was to “accelerate the growth of FTX and Alameda and to enrich the defendant thereby,” the court filing details.</p>
<p>Interestingly, SBF attempted to get counts 1 and 2 dismissed which include the charges of “conspiring to commit and committing wire fraud on FTX customers.” SBF contends that these charges should be dropped since the indictment fails to mention any &#8220;financial harm&#8221; inflicted upon FTX customers. Kaplan disagrees and states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The defendant is wrong both factually and as a matter of law.</p></blockquote>
<p>A great deal of SBF’s arguments leverage the language written in the indictments and jurisdiction gray areas to justify the dismissal of the charges against him. Yet the judge details on numerous occasions that the defendant&#8217;s arguments are “unpersuasive” and the counts against SBF “are legally sufficient.”</p>

<p>Kaplan opined that the dismissal arguments are “either moot or without merit” and for those reasons, the motion to dismiss is denied. “Accordingly, the motion to dismiss for improper venue is denied without prejudice to renewal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29,” the judge concluded.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) consolidated on Wednesday, as traders opted to secure profits following a recent bull run.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD broke out of a key resistance level at $30,800 on Tuesday, on its way to a peak at $31,006.79 late in yesterday&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>However, take profit orders seemed to have been triggered, with bitcoin dropping to an intraday low of $30,169.78 today.</p>

<p>As mentioned yesterday, the relative strength index (RSI) was approaching a ceiling at 73.00, and it appears that bulls were unable to move beyond this point.</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at the 66.45 mark, which comes after price strength was unable to stop at a support level at 68.00.</p>
<p>Should this downward momentum continue, it is likely that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will fall below $30,000 in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also edged lower on Wednesday, with price once again falling under the $1,900 mark.</p>
<p>After Tuesday&#x2019;s peak at the $1,911.31 mark, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD slipped to a bottom at $1,850.87 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>This low has acted as an interim point of support for previous bulls, who typically go on to push prices higher from this level.</p>

<p>So far, that has been the case, with the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency now tracking at $1,862.93.</p>
<p>Ethereum&#x2019;s price strength is currently hovering slightly below a floor at 55.00, and should it once again move above this zone, bullish optimism could rise.</p>
<p>If so, the next target will likely be a breakout of the $1,930 resistance level.</p>

SNB chairman Thomas Jordan said while the Central Bank has not ruled out launching retail CBDCs, the bank is being &#8220;a little bit prudent at the moment.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>&#8216;This Is Not Just an Experiment&#8217;</h2>
<p>The Swiss central bank said on June 26 it intends to issue wholesale central bank digital currency on SIX Digital Exchange, a subsidiary of SIX, an operator of infrastructure for the Swiss and Spanish financial centers. According to Thomas Jordan, the chairman of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), the pilot CBDC project is expected to commence soon and will run for a limited period.</p>
<p>However, the SNB chairman who spoke at the <a href="https://www.pointzeroforum.com/">Point Zero Forum</a>, revealed that the experiment would involve the use of a real money equivalent.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not just an experiment, it will be real money equivalent to bank reserves and the objective is to test real transactions with market participants,&#8221; Jordan reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/snb-launch-digital-currency-pilot-chairman-2023-06-26/">said</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Central Bank Not Keen on Launching Retail CBDC</h2>
<p>By taking this step, the Swiss central bank joins its peers in countries which have either launched their respective CBDCs or are still in the trial or study phase. Their objective, according to a Reuters report, is to avoid ceding control of digital payments to the private sector.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, during his address at the forum, the SNB chairman attempted to explain why the central bank is currently unwilling to launch a retail CBDC. He said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not exclude that we will never introduce retail [CBDCs] but nevertheless we are a little bit prudent at the moment.&#8221;</p>
