title: 'Attention Cardano (ADA) Holders: Further Drops Ahead'
tag: CryptoDaily
---

<p>Cardano (ADA) dropped to a multiyear low last week. The coin is currently trading at a critical threshold that could open up for further drops ahead.</p>
<p>It is by far ADA&rsquo;s most disappointing year, falling from its all-time high of $3 recorded just a year ago.</p>
<p>Analysts say this is the best time for Cardano (ADA) holders to jump into The Hideaways (HDWY) as a way to recover their losses and hedge against market volatility.</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) Still Has Room for a Big Retracement</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) declined to its lowest level in many years. ADA is currently trading at $0.25, carving another opportunity to print the lower low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price is down 14.27% in the last seven days which sent its total losses this year to 80%. This is a huge disappointment for the crypto community - Cardano (ADA) is known as the next Ethereum (ETH) killer, after all.</p>
<p>And although they are operating on the same business base, ADA underperformed against ETH by 29.93% year-on-year.</p>
<p>Analysts gave out their negative price forecast for Cardano (ADA) at the same time they upgraded projections for The Hideaways (HDWY).</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) is expected to reclaim the $0.15 support level if buying sentiment does not improve at $0.25. From the current state of things, we are more likely to see $0.15 back on the charts before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA)&rsquo;s Technicals Point to Low Investor Sentiment</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA)&rsquo;s 24-hour trading volume has declined to $63.82 million from its $116 million level on December 16. This shows the lack of buying appetite for the crypto major as fear takes hold.</p>
<p>Moreover, its relative strength index remains in the oversold territory after falling to the critical level on December 15. RSI is now at 26.70 - a result below 30.0 shows strong selling pressure while a result above 70.0 indicates buyers&rsquo; dominance.</p>
<p>As of late, Cardano (ADA) is not working on any visible projects that could propel prices back to the green. This means we will be seeing more volatility in the coming weeks which is a clear signal to go elsewhere. Among the top investor choice is The Hideaways (HDWY), a real estate project everybody&rsquo;s taking an interest in.</p>
