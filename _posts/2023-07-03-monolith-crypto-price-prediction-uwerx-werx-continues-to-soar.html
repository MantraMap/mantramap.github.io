<p class="s7">Uwerx is a new project seeking to reconceptualize the gig economy with its revolutionary features. This accounts for its presale success and the increased adoption it has been gaining. Due to these, analysts predict a bright future for the project, which has shown strong potential to keep soaring in the crypto winter. </p>
<p class="s7">On the other hand, Monolith (TKN) is struggling to beat bearish sentiments as the bears continue to dominate over the token. This article looks at Monolith&rsquo;s (TKN) predictions, what Uwerx is all about, and why you should quickly become a WERX holder.</p>
<p class="s9">&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
What The Charts Say About Monolith (TKN)
<p class="s7">The crypto market considers Monolith (TKN) a near-dead crypto as it has only recorded a few transactions or trading activities for a long time. This has caused Monolith (TKN) to see a huge plunge without signs of recovery. </p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) currently dines with the bear as it has remained at the bottom, with predictions showing it might record only a negligible price increase. Monolith (TKN) has declined by almost 5% in the past week, and further decline is imminent. </p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) is seeing increased selling pressure as most token holders quickly sell their tokens and move to more active platforms.</p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) Launched Its Visa Debit Card</p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) is a decentralized banking powered by Ethereum (ETH), enabling users to use its Visa debit card to store or spend their tokens globally. Monolith (TKN) provides a DeFicontract wallet where users can store their tokens and use the Visa debit card to make in-app crypto purchases. </p>

Uwerx (WERX) Continues Smashing Through Its Presale
<p class="s7">Uwerx's surging presale has been marveling, quickly reaching its final stage, stage 5. This exceeded initial predictions, and due to demands, WERX allocation for the presale was increased to 427,500,000 (57%). Stage 5 has 72,500,000 WERX available, and the total supply of WERX is 750,000,000.</p>
<p class="s7">The WERX price increase is more surprising. WERX started trading at $0.005 but is now at $0.047725, with more price increases unavoidable. Also, the WERX launch price was increased to $0.095 - $0.115 due to the token&rsquo;s rising value.</p>
<p class="s7">There is a 15% purchase bonus to increase users&rsquo; profits, and the presale ends on July 31. </p>
Uwerx (WERX) Has Leverage Over Other Freelancing Platforms
<p class="s7">Global gig workers are expected to reach 78 million in 2023. Hence, Uwerx is making significant moves to increase adoption and stand out from centralized platforms. It brings blockchain technology and a 1% service fee, features yet to be seen in freelancing. There is also the UwerxVault which promotes user rewards and engagement.</p>
<p class="s7">Its platform&rsquo;s Alpha version launched a few months back and has been gaining traction with more features added. The platform&rsquo;s features now include the Initial Step of Job Creation, My Activity Page, Initial Step of Finding Talent, Hiring Dashboard Page, Logging In and Sign-Up Pages, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process Page, and Forgot Password.</p>
<p class="s7">The Job Application Page was remodeled to the Post Job and Apply Page to quicken users' job applications. New features like the Tools and Client and Freelancer Dashboards are in the works. </p>
<p class="s7">Uwerx will transition to the Beta version, which is now in the works so users can test the platform themselves. InterFi Network and SolidProof have performed audit approvals on Uwerxto ensure its security. The platform has gained over 1,825 Telegram members, 1,652 Twitter followers, and 6,953 sign-ups.</p>
<p class="s7">The team's agile methodology to release the project in bits and modify the platform based on users' feedback has also contributed to the project&rsquo;s success. They are eager to hear from the community, and feedback can be emailed to feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
<p class="s7">To show their dedication to users, the team&rsquo;s token allocation is now only 7% following their decision to reduce it. For sustainability, they will forfeit ownership of the smart contract once the project becomes listed on centralized exchanges. Also, they began a nine-month liquidity lock on their tokens to prevent rug pulls. This started on June 7, after the 82.8% vote it received from the community to start immediately. </p>
<p class="s7">A Test Airdrop will be performed to verify wallet addresses for users, for which 98.2% of the community is in support.</p>
<p class="s7">Uwerx will be a force to reckon with in the freelancing industry. To do that, you have to become a WERX holder. It is best to do so now and maximize the 15% purchase bonus. </p>
