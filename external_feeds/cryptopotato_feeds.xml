			            <description><![CDATA[The Guardia Civil detained one person who was supposedly part of the crime unit.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Spain&#8217;s authorities reportedly busted a criminal organization that orchestrated a massive cryptocurrency scam. The wrongdoers embezzled more than €100 million ($110 million) from over 3,000 people across the globe. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Guardia Civil arrested a suspect in Mallorca considered a gang member.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Operation &#8216;Mandoa&#8217; Turned Successful</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A local media outlet <a href="https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/news/local/2023/04/24/112403/massive-global-cryptocurrency-fraud-busted-mallorca.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">informed</a> that the Guardia Civil (the oldest law enforcement agency in Spain) investigated a crime unit that supposedly swindled approximately $110 million from thousands of people via investments in non-existent cryptocurrencies. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The police launched the so-called operation &#8220;Mandoa&#8221; after receiving a complaint from a person in the province of Alava who claimed to have been conned in a crypto fraud. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The investigation, which covered the Basque Country and the Balearic Islands, estimated that the recipient of these counterfeit investments was a firm based in Palma de Mallorca. For its part, the alleged company made separate transfers to nations outside the European Union. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Guardia Civil confirmed that members of the organization lured victims into their scheme through telephone calls, advertisements in newspapers, or SMS, promising them high returns without risk. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once formalizing a contract with clients and receiving funds, the wrongdoers provided them access to a website where they could check the profits of their investments with fake graphs. The criminals even instructed fraudulent brokers to stay in touch with victims so they could encourage them to keep investing in the scheme. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the gang did not honor the people&#8217;s request to obtain some of their profits. Instead, they instructed them to transfer more money with excuses such as the closing of annual balance sheets or tax payments.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The police have so far detained only one suspect in Mallorca for being a supposed member of the criminal group.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto Scams Could Cause Serious Harm</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Such fraud has recently affected numerous individuals, skimming substantial sums from their pockets. As <em>CryptoPotato </em></span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/scottish-woman-to-sell-her-house-after-losing-almost-200k-in-crypto-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> last week, a Scottish woman called Jennifer was left with a $190,000 debt after falling victim to a cryptocurrency scheme.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">She decided to invest her entire life savings into a suspicious project after seeing a fake advert on Facebook featuring the British journalist and advice expert &#8211; Martin Lewis. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I can&#8217;t actually quite believe what&#8217;s happened to me; it&#8217;s absolutely horrific. It&#8217;s taken me a long time to get to where I am, and the thought of losing this home, obviously for the sake of my children, is horrific,&#8221; the woman regretted.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another example is a Hong Kong resident who </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/hong-kong-woman-loses-her-life-savings-in-a-crypto-scam-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">lost </span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">all her money ($900,000). She fell prey to a criminal who contacted her on Instagram and urged her to invest in digital currencies with the promise of great returns. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When trying to withdraw her funds, she was requested to pay a certain fee. The woman even attempted to borrow money from her daughter before realizing she had fallen prey.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Three individuals have been added to the OFAC's sanctions list, following their connection with North Korea-linked hackers, Lazarus Group.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The United States Department of Treasury sanctioned three individuals who helped the notorious hackers Lazarus Group to process the conversion of stolen cryptocurrency to fiat, allegedly for the funding of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea&#8217;s (DPRK) illicit weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An earlier report by Chainalysis claimed that Lazarus Group was responsible for crypto theft worth about $1.7 billion in 2022.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">3 China-based OTC Traders Face OFAC Sanctions</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) under the Department of Treasury designated sanctions to two over-the-counter (OTC) traders Wu Hiuhui, based in the People&#8217;s Republic of China, and Cheng Hung Man, based in Hong Kong.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The OFAC also sanctioned Sim Hyon Sop, who recently relocated to China and worked for the Korea Kwangson Banking Corp., an entity that was previously designated for offering financial services support to two other institutions which were sanctioned for proliferating weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As stated in a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1435#:~:text=The%20DPRK%27s%20Foreign%20Trade%20Bank,13382%2C%20is%20KKBC%27s%20parent%20company" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">press release</a>, Wu facilitated the conversion of stolen crypto worth millions of dollars into fiat in 2021 for Lazarus Group, while Cheng assisted Wu by remitting payments to companies to receive cryptocurrency. The PR reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Frequently, DPRK actors use these networks of OTC traders, including People’s Republic of China (PRC)-based OTC traders, to conduct transactions on their behalf to avoid detection by financial institutions or competent authorities.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Sim, on the other hand, &#8220;coordinated millions of dollars in financial transfers for the DPRK,&#8221; with the Treasury Department stating that the bank official received funds from information technology workers who fraudulently obtained jobs abroad.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, Sim directed Wu and Cheng, along with other OTC traders, to transfer stolen crypto to front companies who will, in turn, pay for goods, including tobacco and communication devices, in fiat on behalf of the DPRK.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following the OFAC sanctions, properties belonging to Wu, Cheng, and Sim are blocked, and individuals or foreign institutions who have conducted certain transactions with the designated people could also risk being sanctioned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A statement from Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“The DPRK’s use of illicit facilitation networks to access the international financial system and generate revenue using virtual currency for the regime’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction(WMD) and ballistic missile programs directly threatens international security.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 dir="ltr">Lazarus Group Controlled by NK&#8217;s Intelligence Bureau</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the OFAC announcement noted that Lazarus Group is under the DPRK&#8217;s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the country&#8217;s primary intelligence organization. The hacker group is notorious for several hack incidents in the crypto industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lazarus Group has been said to be <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/north-korea-responsible-for-ronin-network-hack-fbi-confirms/" data-wpel-link="internal">behind</a> the largest-ever crypto hack involving the Ronin Network, which saw a loss of $620 million. A report by blockchain security outfit Chainalysis in February 2023 stated that the cybercriminal group <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/north-korean-hackers-stole-1-7b-worth-crypto-in-2022-chainalysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">stole</a> about $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2022.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Standard Chartered made a bold Bitcoin price prediction for the next bull cycle amid an unfolding banking crisis in the United States.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a note published on April 24, Standard Chartered analysts predicted that Bitcoin prices will climb to $100,000 by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Analyst Geoff Kendrick noted that the collapse of several U.S. banks, including <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/silicon-valley-bank-drags-down-nft-trading-volume-by-51-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">Silicon Valley Bank</a>, Silvergate, and Signature, has solidified the case for Bitcoin as a “decentralized, trustless, and scarce digital asset.”</p>
<p>The bank analyst was confident that the bear market is over and prices will continue higher next year in the next bull market cycle.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see potential for Bitcoin (BTC) to reach the USD 100,000 level by end-2024, as we believe the much-touted ‘crypto winter’ is finally over,”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin to Hit Six Figures</h2>
<p>The current stress in the traditional banking sector is highly conducive to BTC&#8217;s outperformance, he said, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/bitcoin-btc-price-could-hit-100000-by-end-2024-standard-chartered.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according</a> to CNBC.</p>
<p>Kendrick predicted that Bitcoin market dominance would also return to the 50-60% level. It is currently 47.37%, according to Tradingview, having fallen back 3% over the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>He also said stablecoin woes and shrinking supplies have also benefitted Bitcoin. An outflow of stablecoins into BTC has been seen this month as the asset reached a ten-month high of roughly $31,000.</p>
<p>Speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary tightening further means the “pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer,” he added.</p>
<p>In his report, the analyst also noted a benefit to Bitcoin mining firms which have seen stock prices surge in 2023.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The associated price jump – from below USD 20,000 before the SVB issues to above USD 30,000 – has dramatically increased the profitability of Bitcoin mining companies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Kendrick concluded that the broader backdrop for risky assets such as BTC is improving. “While BTC can trade well when risky assets suffer, correlations to the Nasdaq suggest that it should trade better if risky assets improve broadly,” he said.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered is another bank to make a big U-turn on crypto. In December 2022, the bank <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/standard-chartered-analyst-explains-why-btc-will-suffer-even-more-in-2023-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a> BTC prices would fall to $5,000 in the wake of the FTX collapse. How things can change in just a few months!</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin prices</a> are currently trading down 1.4% on the day at $27,399 at the time of writing. Resistance at the $30K level was too strong for markets to overcome, and they have entered an expected correction.</p>
<p>Total capitalization has slipped 1.3% on the day to $1.2 trillion, and further declines are looking likely this week.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Uniswap Protocol has officially surpassed $1.5 trillion in trading volume in April. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market significantly improved this year, but volatility persisted. Despite this, Uniswap managed to maintain its dominance over the decentralized market.</p>
<p>In fact, it remains one of the largest decentralized exchanges in the ecosystem, commanding over $4 billion in total value locked (TVL) across all blockchains.</p>
<h1>Activity on Uniswap</h1>
<p>In yet another milestone, the protocol officially surpassed $1.5 trillion in trading volume in April, according to Uniswap Labs, the crypto firm behind the DeFi trading platform, which quoted <a href="https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1650565791291518976" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a> from Dune Analytics.</p>
<p>The trading volume on Uniswap has been increasing for quite some time. The regulatory clampdown in the US and a banking crisis that caused the USDC stablecoin to de-peg triggered an influx of investors in decentralized exchanges in the first quarter of the year. This gave a major leg up to Uniswap as investors <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/uniswap-hits-ath-of-almost-12b-in-trading-volume-amidst-usdc-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">rushed</a> to the platform to exchange USDC for wrapped ether and other tokens.</p>
<p>After recording $70 billion in trading volume in March alone, Uniswap flipped its centralized counterpart, Coinbase, for the second month in a row. While the platform has seen its trading volume surge during times of turmoil, the previous spikes have been brief. This indicated that the popular DEX may not be able to retain the lead for a long time.</p>
<p>But Uniswap has also been experiencing a <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2396829/3932715" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">spike</a> in transaction count. The increased activity comes in the backdrop of a &#8220;memecoin frenzy&#8221; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/how-someone-turned-27-into-1-million-in-days-with-pepe-but-theres-a-catch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">prompted</a> largely by Pepe (PEPE), a new memecoin that launched last week and has since blown up in value. As a result, daily active users on Uniswap recently <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/uniswap" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">surged</a> near 85,000, marking a notable high since May 2021.</p>
<h2>Uniswap Mobile Wallet</h2>
<p>The latest surge comes just a week after Uniswap <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-mobile-wallet-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">announced</a> the launch of a mobile wallet application to promote broader DeFi wallet adoption and support on-the-go trading.</p>
<p>The new product offering is designed to allow users to purchase crypto with a 2.55% fiat on-ramp fee. It also enabled users to swap funds on popular DeFi platforms, such as Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Although Palihapitiya has been a proponent of Bitcoin for years, he now believes the future of cryptocurrencies lies elsewhere.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Host of the popular podcast “All In” and seasoned venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya has been a long-time believer in fledgling companies and causes. During his career, Palihapitiya has invested in successful companies such as Slack and Yammer. For the past few years, Palihapitiya has championed Bitcoin and its march to 200k to the world of venture capitalists.</p>
<p>He has also been a senior executive at Facebook in its early days, a far cry from his teenage years spent working at Burger King.</p>
<h2>Regulators Stifled Growth</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/crypto-is-dead-in-america-says-tech-investor-chamath-palihapitiya.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by CNBC, Palihapitiya expressed his disappointment in the current state of the crypto industry. According to Palihapitiya, the future of crypto lies elsewhere, due mostly to the actions taken by regulators.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Crypto is dead in America. “You had Gensler even blaming the banking crisis on crypto. The United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto (companies). They were probably the ones that were the most threatening to the establishment. And they were the ones that, in fairness to the regulators, did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy.”</p></blockquote>

<h2>Still a Believer</h2>
<p>Although Palihapitiya has expressed his dismay at the current state of affairs, he has made it clear that he still believes in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large.</p>
<p>However, the future growth of the industry lies elsewhere, whether in Europe, Asia, or the world at large, an opinion also expressed by Republican stalwarts such as Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, who lambasted SEC Chairman Gary Gensler during a testimony before Congress.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Regulation by enforcement is not sufficient nor sustainable. “You’re punishing digital asset firms for allegedly not adhering to the law when they don’t know it will apply to them, (…) driving innovation overseas and endangering American competitiveness.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In turn, Gensler has decided to stick to his guns and apply for more <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/gary-gensler-wants-more-sec-funding-to-crack-down-on-wild-west-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">funding</a> in order to police “the wild west that is crypto.”</p>
<p>Consequences to the SEC’s actions have already started to surface, as firms like <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-ceo-slams-sec-says-gensler-led-agency-caused-untold-harm-to-the-us/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a> and Bittrex have allegedly started making contingency plans for a move abroad.</p>
<p>Both firms – as well as countless other firms across the industry – have repeatedly expressed their will to be compliant and join the larger world of financial services as equals. Unfortunately, they cannot ensure complete compliance in the absence of well-defined laws pertaining to cryptocurrencies.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TinyTap &#8211; a technological startup that empowers users to create different educational game-based activities &#8211; secured an $8.5 million fundraiser.</p>
<p>The company, which is a subsidiary of the blockchain gaming platform Animoca Brands, will use the funds to accelerate its product development and hire more staff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Several giants in the finance field <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tinytap-sequoia-animoca-brands-funding-round-crypto-edtech-startup-exclusive-2023-4" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">led</a> the multi-million funding round, including Sequoia Capital, Liberty City Ventures, Shima Capital, and Kingsway Capital. Polygon also participated in the financing.</li>
<li>The Tel Aviv-based TinyTap said it will use the money to expand its team and enhance product development. Co-founder Yogev Shelly claimed the firm was supposed to secure the fundraiser last year, but the uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market halted the effort:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We started in October and within a month reached 80% of what we aimed for in the round. By November, some big investors who had soft committed for a large part of the funding had to fold due to certain fallout and rising uncertainty. As a result, the round took a bit longer to close, and we had more to prove.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>TinyTap <a href="https://technode.global/2022/10/28/animoca-brands-and-tinytap-to-auction-first-education-publisher-nfts/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">jumped</a> on the crypto bandwagon last year by introducing Publisher non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</li>
<li>Animoca Brands&#8217; co-founder Yat Siu believes the move was beneficial to teachers and educators who are the main customers of the application:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Teachers and educators are among the most important content creators and contributors in society, and yet their wages typically do not reflect their critical importance. This is why we&#8217;re incredibly excited at the Web3 opportunities that TinyTap is exploring in the field of education.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

The milestone marks a significant accomplishment in Venom’s roadmap as it prepares to launch on mainnet. Along with the testnet launch, Venom has also unveiled a host of in-house developed decentralized applications as part of its growing ecosystem.</p>
<p>The testnet design suits both ecosystem users and developers. It enables developers to test and debug dApps and blockchain protocols, while allowing users to experience these dApps firsthand. The goal of the program is to encourage innovation and community building within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Developers and users can try out the testnet in two simple steps. First, download the Venom Wallet on mobile via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, or on the desktop as a Google Chrome extension. Secondly, users can jumpstart their journey of testing the Venom ecosystem by claiming a free testnet allocation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to announce the launch of Venom&#8217;s public testnet, a crucial step towards our upcoming mainnet launch. With our highly scalable and reliable asynchronous blockchain, we&#8217;re confident that developers will be able to build innovative dApps, while users will be able to experience them firsthand,&#8221; said Peter Knez, Chair of the Venom Foundation Council.</p></blockquote>
<p>Developers will be able to try their hand at building on the asynchronous Venom blockchain which boasts ultra-fast speed at 100k TPS, and a dynamic sharding feature that enhances scalability and network reliability. To kick things off, Venom has curated a repository of developer documentation to equip developers with the necessary tools and knowledge to start building.</p>
<p>Venom’s network boosts interoperability making it a viable tool for developers, while its low transaction fees makes it user-friendly for global adoption.</p>
<p>A host of dApps debut on the testnet</p>
<p>Several dApps are to make their debut on Venom testnet. Users can test them out by performing transactions, testing the native Venom wallet and much more.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The field of Web3 has advanced by leaps and bounds over the past year, and we see more and more well-known brands jump on that ship.</p>
<p>From financial behemoths to fashion icons and flagship names, many companies are dipping their toes in the metaverse, and the trend is bound to accelerate.</p>
<p>The retail industry, valued at over $30 trillion, is ripe for innovation, and The AceMeta Company is seeking to do just that.</p>
<h2>What is The AceMeta Company?</h2>
<p>Functioning as the ultimate bridge between the retail and fashion industry and the digital assets realm in the face of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-nft/" data-wpel-link="internal">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a>, The AceMeta Company seeks to provide physical products with a unique digital identity.</p>
<p>To do so, the team has developed an innovative platform that leverages both blockchain and near-field communication (NFC) technology.</p>
<h2>Enter Labelled3</h2>
<p><a href="https://labelled.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Labelled3</a> is a Web3 enabler that’s designed to revolutionize the way people perceive value within the retail industry, currently worth over $30 trillion.</p>
<figure id="attachment_247861" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-247861" style="width: 556px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-247861" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img1.jpg" alt="img1" width="556" height="263" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img1.jpg 556w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img1-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-247861" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TheAceMeta Company</figcaption></figure>
<p>Thanks to the advancement of distributed ledger technology, as well as the ever-increasing demand for the real-world utility of non-fungible tokens, the team is eager to dig deeper into the potential of Web3 within the retail and fashion industries.</p>
<p>The goal is to leverage the power of blockchain-based technology and create a more transparent, sustainable, and inclusive ecosystem not only for big brands but also for all retail creators, such as writers, designers, and artists.</p>
<p>Speaking on the matter was the CEO of <a href="https://theacemeta.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">The AceMeta Company</a> &#8211; Shawn Lim, who said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We believe that Web3 has the potential to revolutionize the fashion and retail industry by providing consumers with more control over their data, enabling greater transparency during transactions, and promoting an ongoing relationship between companies and consumers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The AceMeta Company is building a platform, through Labelled3, that’s designed to serve as a marketplace for retailers and the secondary market and enable them to freely transact phygital (from physical + digital) goods.</p>
<p>Users will be allowed to purchase from affiliated brands thanks to the so-called Labelled Passport and also mint associated NFTs. The latter will serve not only as on-chain collectibles but also as engagement ticketing and authenticators.</p>
<p>The secondary market sales of items will be facilitated, perpetrating the revolution of social commerce as well as enhancing the creation of stronger external communities.</p>
<h2>Interactive Shopping Experience</h2>
<p>In addition, the team aims to redefine the relationship between consumers and brands through secondary sales capabilities of the application that should enable accurate and open dialogue. In certain scenarios, brands can welcome consumers to even take part in the process of designing their products.</p>
<p>“Our platform will create an engaging and interactive shopping experience for customers unlike any other. It will force people to rethink what is possible for the items they purchase and consume. This technology has the potential to transform what consumers demand from the brands they believe in but also enables said brands to deliver above and beyond these expectations through innovating rewards programs and the speed at which incentives can be targeted and issued.” &#8211; Said Nikolai Kea, COO of The AceMeta Company.</p>
