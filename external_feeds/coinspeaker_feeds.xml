<p>A joint task force from Italy and Albania recently busted a suspected crypto investment scam involving millions of dollars. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/italy-albania-crypto-scam/">Law Enforcement in Italy and Albania Clamp Down on Alleged Crypto Scam</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Law enforcement authorities in Albania and Italy have uncovered a 15 million euro ($16 million) suspected crypto scam. </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/23/authorities-in-italy-albania-bust-16m-suspected-crypto-investment-scam/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to reports</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the Eurojust joint investigation team seized assets worth 3 million euros during the raid. The European Union’s cross-border organized crime-fighting agency also recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.eurojust.europa.eu/news/takedown-online-investment-fraud-responsible-losses-eur-15-million" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that it confiscated more than 160 electronic devices. These include digital video recorders, computers, servers, and a cellphone. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Perpetrators Pulled Off Alleged Italy and Albania Crypto Scam</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Eurojust also alleged that an organized crime group (OCG) operating out of a call center in Tirana, Albania was behind the fraudulent operation. The suspects successfully pulled off the investment fraud by telephoning victims using unidentifiable virtual numbers and delocalized virtual private networks (VPNs). According to Eurojust, these miscreants asked the victims to create an account on a portal and transfer an initial sum. Victims who obliged received an immediate financial gain, after which the perpetrators contacted them again – this time posing as brokers. According to the Eurojust statement, the organized crime group attempted to sell its victims profitable cryptocurrency investments without risk. However, it remains unclear if any digital currency purchase took place. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Victims were also implored to make far more substantial investments, which sometimes constituted their entire economic capital. Upon receipt of these larger sums, Eurojust alleged that the perpetrators reset the details of the newly-created accounts. Furthermore, the criminals locked unsuspecting victims out of their accounts, embezzled the received funds, and made themselves untraceable. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Eurojust noted that the organized crime group was able to fool its victims due to the bait-and-switch approach of its strategy. By allowing victims to secure an immediate financial gain against a small investment, the perpetrators gained the trust of clueless investors. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Round Two</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the second phase of the scam, the organized crime group gained access to the victims’ personal home banking pages. According to Eurojust, these criminals could secure access using PC remote control software. At this point, the malevolent crime syndicate then proceeded to persuade investors to commit their entire economic capital. However, the scam was not done yet. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Eurojust also further alleged that victims who uncovered the deception were contacted in the final stages of the ruse by OCG members. These miscreants then convinced the victims to make additional payments to recover the lost funds. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other Details Pertaining to Case</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The European Union’s organized crime fighting unit coordinated its actions on the Italy-Albania <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fca-crypto-financial-scam-uk/">crypto scam</a> between December 13th and 15th. In addition, the agency executed precautionary detention orders against the main suspects of the fraud. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to reports, Italian authorities opened the case at Eurojust in 2020, and thirteen locations underwent intense search exercises in Albania. In addition, during the action, the Eurojust organized four coordination meetings and a coordination center. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Authorities that participated in the action included the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Pisa and the Carabinieri Pisa in Italy. Furthermore, Albania’s Special Prosecution Office Against Corruption and Organised Crime (SPAK), and its State Police also took part in the investigation. </span></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-funds-berkshire-hathaway/">Crypto Twitter Speculates Binance Looking at Raising Funds from Berkshire Hathaway</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major point of conversation on crypto Twitter is that Binance Exchange, the world’s largest digital currency brokerage by daily trading volume is in talks with Warren Buffett’s </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/berkshire-hathaway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NYSE: BRK.A) for some equity funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-proclaimed “Engaged Value Investor” Mike Alfred broke the news on Twitter citing a source he claimed was a “fund manager closely connected to one of the earliest investors in Binance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considered one of the biggest critics of Binance and its Chief Executive Officer Changpeng “<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CZ</a>” Zhao, Alfred said his source confirmed to him that “Binance is in active discussions with potential new &#8220;Keystone&#8221; investors, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/warren-buffett/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warren Buffett</a>&#8216;s Berkshire Hathaway, about an equity round that would provide support and credibility to the company.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">serve as a &quot;decentralized CFO&quot; according to the company.</p>
<p>2. Binance is an active discussions with potential new &quot;Keystone&quot; investors, including Warren Buffett&#39;s Berkshire Hathaway, about an equity round that would provide support and credibility to the company.</p>
<p>&mdash; Mike Alfred (@mikealfred) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikealfred/status/1606006113605808129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since FTX </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">imploded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Binance has come under intense scrutiny as many believed the collapse of the trading platform may be a signal of ill health for bigger exchanges to also go under. Binance spearheaded the publishing of Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) in November and despite its attempts to show transparency, the community </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-proof-of-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">faulted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the fact that the trading platform did not publish any form of debt or liabilities which makes its proofs faulty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since FTX’s file for bankruptcy, the questions surrounding the integrity of Binance’s internal operations have grown and this accounts for the need to secure a high-profile investor like Berkshire Hathaway to prop up its image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Alfred’s anonymous source, Binance has no centralized Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and that about 20 people working in the company’s Treasury are designated as decentralized CFOs. The FUD surrounding Binance’s operations has weighed down the trading platform in terms of volumes processed, and the valuation of BNB has plunged by 15.2% over the past 14 days.</span></p>
<h2><b>Is There a Likelihood of Berkshire Hathaway Investing in Binance?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This remains a major question on the minds of many on Crypto Twitter as Warren Buffett is known to be a major critic of Bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The likelihood that Berkshire Hathaway is going to invest in Binance is considered very slim as Binance is reportedly under the radar of authorities in the United States. This will not only make the American conglomerate refrain from furthering conversations with the trading platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major point raised by some observers is the fact that CZ may be unwilling to open up Binance’s books for the kind of scrutiny that external investors like Berkshire Hathaway will require to place a bet on the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the impossibilities have been highlighted, chances are that Berkshire Hathaway may also inject some funds using one of its Venture Capital offshoots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berkshire Hathaway is building a history of investing in crypto-based companies. The company </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/buffett-berkshire-hathaway-nubank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as much as $1 billion in the crypto financial institution, Nubank, carving out the premise that if it can invest in Nubank, it can also inject funds into Binance or any of its entities.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tsmc-plant-germany/">TSMC Setting Up Plant in Germany</a></p>
<p>Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tsmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSMC</a> is reportedly discussing with key suppliers over building its first chip plant in Germany. Specifically, TSMC is planning to build the first European plant in the German city of Dresden. If successful, the chipmaker can capitalize on the rising demand from the German car industry.</p>
<h2>TSMC in Talks with Supplier to Build Plant in Germany</h2>
<p>According to people familiar with the matter, TSMC will send a team of its senior executives to Germany. The sources noted that the team will make the trip in early 2023 to discuss how the government will support the project. Also, the executive will debate the ability of the local supply chain to meet its needs. Although there is no official statement on the plant yet, TSMC hinted at a potential factory in Germany. The company <a href="https://beamstart.com/news/tsmc-in-talks-with-suppliers-16717815153513" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We do not rule out any possibility but there is no concrete plan at this time.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Just last year, TSMC said it was in the early stages of considering the possibility of expanding into EU member Germany. The discussion the company has been having with material and equipment suppliers is based on if they can provide the required investment for the prospective plant. Also, the main focus of the European plant would be on 22-nanometre and 28-nanometre chip technologies.</p>
<p>Per the European Chips Act, the European Commission has set aside 15 billion euros for semiconductor projects. The aim is for the budget to cater to public and private semiconductor projects by 2030. Under the act, the money will be used to increase Europe’s share in the rapidly expanding chip industry.</p>
<h2>TSMC&#8217;s Vision for Japan</h2>
<p>In addition to its Germany plant, TSMC also plans to set up another plant in Japan. The matter was revealed last week by the secretary-general of a Japanese ruling party lawmakers’ group on chip strategy. The executive said the chipmaker is considering a second chip plant in the country. The same as TSMC said about a plant in Germany, the company said it does not rule out the possibility of a factory in Japan, but there are no definite plans yet.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the semiconductor company said it would triple its Arizona chip plant investment. It said it would triple the investment to $40 billion, marking one of the largest foreign investments in US history.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/2022-bitcoin-market-watchers/">2022 Bitcoin Market Watchers: Year of Surprising Twists &#038; Turns</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/23/bitcoin-price-calls-in-2022-how-the-market-got-it-wrong.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">market watchers were aplenty in 2022</a> as the price of the leading crypto plunged to new lows. Before the turn of the year, some of these pundits predicted that BTC would build on its November 2021 record high of approximately $70K. According to these bullish market watchers, including popular venture capitalist Tim Draper, Bitcoin would attain new record highs in 2022.</p>
<p>However, other market players were less optimistic about BTC&#8217;s price trajectory and instead accurately foresaw a plunge below $20K. Some pundits were even more bearish and did not rule out the prominent crypto sinking further to $10K.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, 2022 came with a string of unsavory surprises within the digital currency space. These surprises include the mid-year epic failure of stablecoin <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/terrausd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TerraUSD</a> that crippled several investors. Furthermore, the crypto industry&#8217;s 2022 woes also constituted the recent dramatic <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> collapse that triggered an insolvency crisis.</p>
<p>Amid the tumult within the crypto space, investors have also had to weather rising interest rates due to runaway inflation. The rate hike has subsequently piled pressure on riskier assets such as stocks and digital currencies.</p>
<p>Even the most bearish Bitcoin market watchers must have been caught off guard by the developments of 2022. The prominent crypto is currently at a massive 75% drawdown since its November 2021 all-time high of $69K. In addition, the entire crypto market is presently down at a $2 trillion deficit from a year ago. Case in point, BTC was changing hands at just under $17K as of the time of writing.</p>
<h2>2022 Bitcoin Market Watchers: Notable Bears</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bitfinex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitfinex</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/tether/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tether</a> chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino previously predicted that BTC would fall well below $40K in 2022. However, Ardoino added that he expected the world&#8217;s largest crypto by market cap to end the year well above $50K.</p>
<p>When contacted this month on his earlier prediction, Ardoino stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As mentioned, predictions are hard to make. No one could have predicted or foreseen the number of companies, well regarded by the global community, failing in such a spectacular fashion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the Bitfinex CTO also doubled down on his faith in Bitcoin, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Some legitimate concerns and questions remain around the future of crypto. It might be a volatile industry, but the technologies developed behind it are incredible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Other 2022 BTC bears and their price predictions at the time included Deutsche Bank ($28K), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan</a> ($13K), and Absolute Strategy Research ($13K).</p>
<h2>Bulls</h2>
<p>This year&#8217;s Bitcoin market-watching bulls also featured some notable names, including Tim Draper, crypto lender Nexo, and former Seba CEO Guido Buehler.</p>
<p>Draper was the most optimistic of the lot by a mile and predicted that BTC would surge to a lofty $250K. The prominent investor was so confident in his forecast that he even channeled some parts of his persona around BTC&#8217;s motif.</p>
<p>However, it is safe to say that Draper&#8217;s predictions would not materialize this year at least. When recently asked about his lofty prediction, the Draper Associates founder claimed his prediction would materialize – in six months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nexo CEO Antoni Trenchev previously foresaw Bitcoin shooting past $100K in 2022, while Guido Buehler once angled for $75K. According to the former chief executive of regulated Swiss bank Seba, institutional investors would drive the price higher.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/okx-second-proof-of-reserves-report/">Crypto Exchange OKX Releases Second Proof-of-Reserves Report</a></p>
<p>Digital currency trading platform <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/okex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OKX</a> has <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/12/23/2578964/0/en/OKX-Publishes-Second-Proof-of-Reserves-With-New-Features-Commits-to-Monthly-PoR-Reporting.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">released</a> its second Proof-of-Reserve (PoR) report as it seeks to deepen the trust within its ecosystem with respect to the health of its financials. The released PoR aims to show the community and investors that the exchange has the number of deposits it said it has. This proof also shows it can fulfill all withdrawal obligations without running into a liquidity crisis.</p>
<p>The implosion and subsequent bankruptcy filing of FTX Derivatives Exchange have pushed a host of exchanges on the path whereby they voluntarily push for enhanced transparency in their activities. Scared of the community’s reaction to the collapse of the FTX which was adjudged by many to be one of the healthiest in the industry until early November pushed OKX to join the bandwagon in publishing its PoR last month.</p>
<p>Unlike many in the space, however, OKX has now decided the report will be monthly and that its users can download the monthly report to verify its claims.</p>
<p>“Publishing PoR results on a monthly basis strengthens our commitment to lead the industry when it comes to transparency and trust,” Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said in the release. “At OKX, we believe that PoR should be verifiable via open source tools so that users can self-verify the balances and ownership of our reserve addresses.”</p>
<p>OKX said the report will be published on the 22nd day of each month and besides the latest version of the report, users will also be able to download past reports at their convenience. According to the digital currency trading platform, all of its 23,000 addresses can now be audited by anyone, adding to the layer of trust that it said it has worked hard to build over the years.</p>
<h2>The OKX Proof-of-Reserve Report</h2>
<p>In the report, OKX said it has a <a href="https://www.okx.com/proof-of-reserves/detail" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">balance of 113,754 Bitcoin</a> ($1.87 billion) in its wallet as of Tuesday 12:00 UTC. This figure comes against a user balance of 112,192 <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) giving the premier asset a 101% reserve ratio. The reserve ratio for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> (ETH) comes in at 103% as user balances on the exchange were pegged at 1,091,007 as against the 1,124,295 held by the trading platform.</p>
<p>USDT also has a substantial reserve ratio of 101% atop a user balance of 3,118,778,203 and an OKX wallet balance of 3,137,965,012. <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/okx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to a review of the exchange’s addresses by Nansen, it was discovered that the trio of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT makes up about 90% of all holdings.</p>
<p>This cannot be likened to concentration risk as exchanges nowadays have features for easy transfer of value from one asset to the other. With the plan to be publishing the report every month, OKX has set a new standard for transparency that users may demand from all other trading platforms.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/10-year-treasury-yield-personal-consumption/">10-Year Treasury Yield Inches Higher as Market Awaits Key Personal Consumption Expenditure Report</a></p>
<p>The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note was marginally higher on Friday, December 23rd, as investors await critical inflation data. The markets are paying close attention to a key inflation metric for clues to the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate move.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/23/bonds-10-year-treasury-yield-ticks-higher-ahead-of-inflation-data.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">According to reports</a>, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed by a basis point to 3.6856%. Meanwhile, the yield on the 2-year Treasury note remained unchanged at 4.2636% as of press time.</p>
<h2>November CPI Could Impact 10-Year Treasury Yield, Other Govt Debt Obligations</h2>
<p>Fed yields have risen throughout the week as investors continue to ponder the chances of a recession. In addition, the capital markets remain on edge over how a recession could impact monetary policy. On Thursday, released US government data showed a third-quarter 3.2% annual rate increase in gross domestic product. This figure came in higher than a 2.9% previous estimate after the economy contracted 0.6% during the second quarter.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis will report November’s personal consumption expenditure on Friday morning. This report is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. The core personal consumption expenditures price index (CPI) is expected to have increased by 0.2% last month. This figure, which excludes food and energy prices, also marks the same increase seen in October. Investors, market analysts, and observers currently view the personal consumption expenditures price index as a helpful barometer for US inflation.</p>
<h2>Sustained Fed Battle to Curtail Inflation</h2>
<p>Throughout the year, the Fed has continuously hiked interest rates to rein in sky-high inflation. The US central bank previously increased rates by 75 basis points on four consecutive occasions before <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fed-hike-interest-rates-50-basis-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deciding to cut back</a>. The reduction is due to fears that the string of steep rate hikes could inadvertently bring about a recession. Furthermore, key data from October and November also suggested that inflation could be waning, thereby calling for reduced rate hikes.</p>
<p>In late November, the Federal Open Market Committee released <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20221102.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minutes</a> from its fiscal meeting, which suggested a hike slowdown. Part of the minutes read:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A number of participants observed that, as monetary policy approached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve the Committee’s goals, it would become appropriate to slow the pace of increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Around the same time, Fed Chair <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jerome-powell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerome Powell</a> also favored a 50 basis points increase for December. As Powell put it at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On December 14th, the Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fed-interest-rate-highest-15-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased</a> its interest rate to between 4.25% and 4.5%, marking the highest level in 15 years. In addition, the FOMC suggested maintaining higher rates throughout the next year until 2024. According to the fiscal Committee, its projected terminal rate or point for ending the hikes is 5.1%. Furthermore, Powell observed that although optics regarding declining inflation remain positive, “it will take substantially more evidence” to be sure.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mythical-games-lawsuit-ex-ceos/">Mythical Games Files Lawsuit against Three Ex-CEOs for Raising $150M for Their Own Firm</a></p>
<p>Crypto gaming unicorn Mythical Games, which is also backed by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/a16z/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, has <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/crypto-unicorn-mythical-games-alleges-former-execs-used-company-secrets-to-raise-150-million/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against its top three executives for violating the fiduciary duty and leveraging the company&#8217;s leads to raise $150 Million worth of funds.</p>
<p>Mythical Games has accused ex-Chief Executive Officers Rudy Koch, Matthew Nutt, and Chris Ko of breaching their fiduciary responsibility to raise hundred and fifty million and establish their venture.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and calls Koch the firm&#8217;s co-founder, Nutt as the CEO and head of game studio and publishing, while Ko is the Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investment.</p>
<p>All three executives had very recently left Mythical Games. The gaming chain became a unicorn last year after achieving a valuation of $1 Billion. The lawsuit states that the firm put forward three named executives as the supervisors for raising money for a novel fund called Mythical Ventures. According to the lawsuit, a Mythical Games investor presented the United Arab Emirates-based Cypher Capital to the three officials. However, instead of acquiring investment for the firm, the trio used the Mythical Games strategy to persuade Cypher Capital to invest in another business project. While the allegations are serious, Koch, Ko, and Nutt have not responded to any questions yet.</p>
<p>A few weeks after leaving Mythical Games, the Trio launched their new publishing platform for Blockchain games called the Fenix Games. They also claimed to have raised capital from Cypher and Phoenix Group for their new venture.</p>
<p>As part of the complaint, Mythical Games is demanding several things like &#8220;restitution of the ill-gotten gains&#8221; and &#8220;punitive impairments&#8221;. The lawsuit also conjectures that the three ex-executives have used fraudulent plans while hiding ulterior motives and violating both their fiduciary responsibilities and contract.</p>
<p>Mythical Games Head of Communications Nate Nesbitt has refused to talk about the upcoming litigation but has offered a typed formal statement by mail. According to the mail, the company swears by its ideals of safeguarding intellectual establishments and corporate assets. Hence, it was important for the company to make the situation better by going forward with the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Mythical Games’ Head of Communications Nate Nesbitt declined to comment on details of the ongoing litigation but provided a written statement by email.</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based Mythical Games&#8217; latest round of funding also raised around $150 Million. This round was led by Silicon Valley venture capital company a16z, and other investors like NBA legend Michael Jordan, the National Football League&#8217;s investment arm 32 Equity, and RedBird Capital Partners.</p>

<p>The US SEC has already launched its first attack declaring that FTX's native cryptocurrency FTT token was a security. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/collapse-ftx-sec-banning-crypto/">Collapse of FTX Can Bring SEC Closer to Banning Cryptocurrencies</a></p>
<p>The dramatic collapse of the crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> last month has sent shockwaves across the entire crypto industry. Millions of FTX users have lost their hard-earned money while trading with FTX. The situation with FTX has pushed the SEC to gather enough legal ammunition which might lead to the consideration of banning digital assets and other centralized crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>Earlier this week on Wednesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) announced charges against two major allies of FTX founder <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>. This includes FTX co-founder Gary Wang and Alameda Research&#8217;s former CEO Caroline Ellison. The duo has pleaded guilty to federal authorities.</p>
<h2>SEC: FTX (FTT) Token Is a Security</h2>
<p>In a further development, the SEC said that the FTX Exchange&#8217;s native FTT token sold as an investment contract was a &#8220;security&#8221;. In its complaint to the court, the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2022/comp-pr2022-234.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If demand for trading on the FTX platform increased, demand for the FTT token could increase, such that any price increase in FTT would benefit holders of FTT equally and in direct proportion to their FTT holdings. The large allocation of tokens to FTX incentivized the FTX management team to take steps to attract more users onto the trading platform and, therefore, increase demand for, and increase the trading price of, the FTT token.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result, the SEC has also charged Ellison and Wang with securities fraud for offering FTT as unregistered securities and for manipulating the price of FTT. The SEC has also labeled the FTT token as an &#8220;illiquid crypto asset&#8221;.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the securities regulator also mentioned the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;buy and burn&#8221; program adding that this initiative, along with several other exchange tokens is similar to stock buyback wherein revenue from FTX would repurchase and burn FTT, thus increasing its value.</p>
<h2>SEC Should Ban Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>Earlier this week, Sherrod Brown, chairman of the US Senate Banking Committee said that the US SEC and the CFTC should consider banning cryptocurrencies. The US banking committee has jurisdiction over all the financial institutions in the US. In an appearance NBC’s “Meet the Press” on December 18, Brown said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We want them [the SEC and CFTC] to do what they need to do at the same time, maybe banning it, although banning it is very difficult because it would go offshore, and who knows how that would work&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/afa-world-cup-metaverse/">Argentine Football Association (AFA) Partners with Upland as It Takes World Cup Win to Metaverse</a></p>
<p>The Argentine Football Association (AFA) is still reeling from its recent FIFA World Cup win, which took place less than a week ago. In the spirit of the moment, and to keep abreast of the latest trends, the football governing body AFA has <a href="https://www.afa.com.ar/es/posts/la-asociacion-del-futbol-argentino-presenta-a-upland-como-socio-estrategico-para-el-desarrollo-del-metaverso-de-la-liga-profesional" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> a new partnership with metaverse startup Upland. This partnership deal signals one of the AFA&#8217;s first forays into the world of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-web-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web 3.0</a> as it looks to improve fan experience and engagement amongst other things.</p>
<h2>AFA Explores the Potentials of Web 3.0 Technology and Metaverse</h2>
<p>According to statements issued by AFA President Claudio Tapia, the body aims to take full advantage of Web 3.0. To him, this is what the Upland partnership is all about.</p>
<p>Upland is a popular game that involves buying and selling virtual lands. And interestingly, these virtual lands are linked to real-world locations. The game also has over 3 million registered gaming accounts to its name, while the startup backing it, has a valuation of $300 million as of November 2021.</p>
<p>Tapia further added that the new partnership will be opening up massive opportunities for all subjects under the AFA umbrella. Especially in terms of offering them an alternative means of generating income. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This agreement allows us to partner with the best creators of technology and new digital products and thus generate a new source of income for all participating clubs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The AFA fully controls the entire Argentine football league system. That includes its apex league — the Primera División, the Torneo Regional Federal, and even lower tier Primera D. It also organizes the nation&#8217;s domestic cups including Copa Argentina, Copa de la Liga Profesional, and the Trofeo de Campeones de la Liga Profesional. Additionally, all the national teams, including the Senior team, U-20, U-17, U-15, and Olympic teams, are under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the AFA has a broad reach. And given the massive number of football lovers around the world,  the new partnership with Upland does not only set a precedence for other football associations in the Latin American region. It represents a major push for the global adoption of Web 3.0 technology.</p>

<p>American multinational social and metaverse-focused company, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms Inc</a> (NASDAQ: META) has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-parent-meta-pay-725-mln-settle-lawsuit-relating-cambridge-analytica-2022-12-23/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">agreed</a> to pay the sum of $725 million to settle a class action lawsuit involving the British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica to access millions of Facebook user’s personal information.</p>
<h2>Meta Platforms and Cambridge Analytica Scandal</h2>
<p>The settlement puts an end to the long protracted lawsuit that has been on since the scandal broke out in 2018. Cambridge Analytica played a major role in former President <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>’s campaign and the firm profiled users’ data through Facebook without permission. Meta Platforms was indicted in the move as it was claimed that it allowed the consulting firm to harvest the personal information of millions of users through an application plugged into the social media’s network.</p>
<p>According to the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, this settlement payout will be the largest that has been linked to a privacy lawsuit in the United States and the largest paid out by the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;This historic settlement will provide meaningful relief to the class in this complex and novel privacy case,&#8221; the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs, Derek Loeser and Lesley Weaver, said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>In settling the case, Meta Platforms did not admit any wrongdoing and the settlement is subject to approval by a judge in California. According to Meta Platforms, its decision to settle is the best course of approach for its investors and community. Since no company does well in the face of a scandal or a lingering court case, the settlement push, if approved, may favor the company in the long run.</p>
<p>Following the scandal with Cambridge Analytica at the time, Meta Platforms Inc said it has implemented a rigorous privacy campaign policy that has generally solidified its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last three years we revamped our approach to privacy and implemented a comprehensive privacy program,” Meta said.</p>
<h2>Meta Platforms are Not Alien to Lawsuits</h2>
<p>Of the big tech firms in the United States, Meta Platforms may come off as one of the most sued companies. As a custodian of data that is operating in a highly competitive data sphere, Meta Platforms are often pitched in lawsuits against regulators and the public as a whole.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Meta Platforms have had to pay the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zuckerbergs-ftc-facebook-5-b-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sum of $5 billion in settlement</a> to the Federal Trade Commission back in 2019 for privacy-related lawsuits at the time. In addition, Meta Platforms has had to pay $100 million in settlement to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) on allegations that it misled investors on the misuse of users’ data.</p>
<p>Meta Platforms is not particularly in a healthy position financially as the strain in the global economy had a unique toll on its shares in the year-to-date period. However, the settlement will help it get back on its feet and focus on what truly matters for its growth moving forward.</p>
