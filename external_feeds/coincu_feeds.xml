<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Sui blockchain posted tokenomics and information about the upcoming coin.</em></li>



<li><em>Tokenomic is designed to create a blockchain environment with low cost but still high performance.</em></li>



<li><em>The project is being enthusiastically responded to by the community ahead of the mainnet launch.</em></li>
</ul>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On April 21, Sui blockchain officially announced tokenomics to prepare for the mainnet launch and the pre-sale opening according to the set schedule.</strong></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dive into the full details in the blog post: <a href="https://t.co/BIscXNEzpZ" target="_blank">https://t.co/BIscXNEzpZ</a></p>&mdash; Sui (@SuiNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1649227672881606656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>According to the development team&#8217;s announcement, Sui operates its platform around three main parties, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>General users: those who conduct transactions to create, transfer digital assets, or interact with applications on the Sui ecosystem.</li>



<li>Staker: SUI holders and token keys participate in staking to contribute to the network&#8217;s security, participate in administrative activities, or use paid SUI to interact with applications on the chain.</li>



<li>Validators: people who validate, process and execute transactions.</li>
</ul>



<p>The parties will support each other to operate a stable Sui economy.</p>



<p>At mainnet time, Sui will have a total supply of 10 billion SUI tokens, distributed as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>More than 50% of the total tokens are allocated to the Community Reserve &#8211; a community reserve fund managed by the Sui Foundation. Many programs divide this token among builder, researcher, and validator.</li>



<li>Most of the remaining 50% of SUI is for those who contributed, supported, and trusted the project from day one.</li>
</ul>



<p>Overall, SUI&#8217;s token allocation plan needs to provide details as previously announced in December 2022.</p>



<p>Also, according to the announcement, the SUI token has four core uses:</p>



<ul>
<li>Staking to secure the network and in return for passive rewards one of the ways to encourage the community to join the network;</li>



<li>Pay transaction fees on the network;</li>



<li>Provide on-chain liquidity;</li>



<li>Grant the right to participate in voting on proposals.</li>
</ul>



<p>Sui&#8217;s Tokenomics is designed in sync with the platform&#8217;s technical structure to create a blockchain environment with low cost but still high performance. With this goal in mind, Sui is committed to treating all ecosystem members fairly, from developers to general users.</p>

<p>As information in the previous article, after much speculation, Blockchain&#8217;s development team <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182613-sui-network-launch-mainnet-on-may-3rd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finalized </a>the mainnet deployment schedule on May 3. The whitelist portal to participate in the project IDO is closed and no longer accepts new registrations. The project has screened out 180,000 accounts eligible for presale and is sending email notifications to users.</p>



<p>The project will not airdrop tokens, instead opening and selling 594 million SUI token through two rounds of General Sale and Whitelist Sale on several designated exchanges. The lucky ones who win the whitelist can buy SUI at a preferential price of 0.03 USD/token. This is one of the hottest projects on the market that is eagerly awaited by the community.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Atlas, Rocket Pool&#8217;s second major upgrade since the mainnet launch has been successfully launched. To increase compatibility with the Ethereum Shanghai (Shapella) update, the update brings the protocol including updates to both the Smartnode stack and the Rocket Pool protocol in general.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Rocket Pool shines ahead of Atlas update</h2>



<p>Since the Shapella update, Rocketpool (RPL) has not only significantly outperformed BTC and ETH, but also outperformed its closest competitor and market leader in terms of liquidity staking protocol, Lido ( LDO). Rocketpool is currently relatively small in the Ethereum staking industry, with just 2% of the depositors market share, compared to Lido&#8217;s 31% and Coinbase&#8217;s 12%.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1282.png"><img decoding="async" width="630" height="380" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1282.png" alt="Rocket Pool&#039;s Atlas Update How Explosive After The Shanghai Ethereum Upgrade" class="wp-image-182183" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1282.png 630w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1282-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" title="Rocket Pool&#039;s Atlas Update How Explosive After The Shanghai Ethereum Upgrade 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, since Shapella, RPL has increased by almost 40% thanks to potentially bullish catalysts. Rocketpool also got its own update this week, Atlas, which will reduce the amount of ETH needed to become a validator of the protocol from 16 ETH to 8 ETH. It usually takes 32 ETH to become a validator on the Ethereum network, so this upgrade will give Rocketpool a competitive edge over other protocols in the form of more validators and a more decentralized network, could also allow it to gain market share.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Outstanding changes</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For Shapella and withdraw</strong></h3>



<p>Shapella introduces withdrawals to the Beacon Chain, meaning node operators can now access the ETH currently locked on the Beacon Chain in 2 options:</p>



<ul>
<li>Partial Withdrawal (Skimming), where your reward (your excess Beacon Chain balance over 32 ETH) is sent to your minipool on the Execution Layer. This is done automatically by the protocol itself regularly (about every four or five days on the Mainnet).</li>



<li>Full Withdraw, when you exit your validator from the Beacon Chain and its entire balance is sent to your small pool on the Execution Layer. This is done automatically by the protocol itself after your validator has been off the chain for long enough.</li>
</ul>



<p>Atlas introduces a new authorization contract for small pools that allows node operators to distribute the small pool&#8217;s ETH balance, split equally between the node operator and rETH holders (plus commissions, of course) anytime. This gives node operators instant access to their Beacon Chain rewards! It also returns rETH holders&#8217; share back to the deposit pool, so it can be used to free rETH for ETH at the protocol&#8217;s exchange rate (or to create new shards).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ETH Optimized Minipool</strong></h3>



<p>One of the most anticipated changes made in Atlas is the introduction of the ability to only provide 8 ETH to create a minipool instead of 16 ETH. Minipools with only 8 ETH linked by their owning node operator are matched against 24 ETH from the staking pool (provided by rETH holders) to generate validators. This greatly reduces the capital requirement to run your own validators and provides higher returns for both node operators and rETH bettors! In fact, running two 8 ETH minipools instead of one 16 ETH minipool will yield 18% more rewards &#8211; even if the 16 ETH minipool has a commission rate of 20%.</p>



<p>New minipools can be created with 8 ETH or 16 ETH. Minipool 16 ETH is unchanged from how they work today and is available to users who want to minimize their exposure to RPL tokens.</p>



<p>Additionally, once Atlas has been applied, node operators can directly migrate existing 16 ETH minipools to 8 ETH minipool without having to exit. This will return them 8 ETH as deposit credit, which can be used to create a new 8 ETH minipool for free.</p>



<p>There are also many other improvements such as the efficiency of using Minipool gas. Make a new Minipool post, Atlas will now use 40% less gasoline.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solo Staker Migration</strong></h3>



<p>Part of the Shapella upgrade involves the ability for a single validator to change their validator&#8217;s withdrawal information (opens a new window) from the original BLS-based withdrawal key (currently unused) application to an address on the Execution class. This address will be the recipient of all that validator rewards and all ETH balances after exiting the Beacon Chain.</p>



<p>Currently about&nbsp;<strong>30% of validators on Ethereum</strong>&nbsp;are classified as unknown, this means we don’t know whom they staked from. Generally it’s safe to say most of these are solo stakers which is awesome for Ethereum’s health.</p>



<p>With withdrawals rapidly approaching, node operators who are staking can now withdraw their ETH. With Rocket Pool being the&nbsp;<strong>only current</strong>&nbsp;permissionless protocol for node operators to join, we’ve designed a method for these node operators to migrate to Rocket Pool should they wish to do so, while still maintaining the decentralisation factor.</p>



<p>Regular Rocket Pool node operators need not worry about any of these issues, as the protocol automatically sets this up for your small pools as you create them. However, as part of this new requirement for single validators, Atlas presents an interesting opportunity: the ability to create a special minipool that will become the withdrawal address for existing single validators. </p>



<p>In other words, this will allow you to convert a solo validator directly into a Rocket Pool minipool without having to exit it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New Smartnode feature</strong></h3>



<p>Starting with Atlas, node has a new mission: automatically distribute minipool rewards! This is because of how the Shapella upgrade works, by transferring your rewards from the Beacon Chain into your minipool every few days.</p>



<p>In addition, created a new Grafana dashboard (opens a new window) to help node operators monitor and evaluate the status, progress, and overall health of their nodes.</p>

<p>Smartnode v1.9.0 also introduces split mode support to Nimbus! Instead of running Beacon Node Client and Validator inside a single process/container, Smartnode will now run them in separate containers just like other clients.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>This upgrade will be Rocket Pools biggest to date and will be focused at scaling the protocol to meet much higher demand, now and into the future, while fully maintaining our commitment to decentralisation and the health of the Ethereum.</p>



<p>One of the most important changes made as a result of the Atlas upgrade is actually supporting Shapella&#8217;s cons, allowing anyone to reverse their ether (ETH) bets coming from the Rocket Pool system completely. perfect. This will certainly enhance the flexibility of the system, making it a lot simpler and also available to a more comprehensive viewer.</p>



<p>Overall, the Atlas upgrade will improve ease of access, flexibility, and safety. Therefore, it is really no surprise that the market has actually reacted favorably to this advance, increasing the RPL ratio.</p>



<p>It will certainly be of interest to how the Rocket Pool system continues to grow and evolve in the coming months and years as it seeks to dethrone the leading decentralized betting system in the Ethereum community.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sui Wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet application developed for Sui, an emerging blockchain platform that has received much attention recently. So let&#8217;s explore the features and usage of this cryptocurrency wallet through the article below.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Wallet Sui?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1398.png"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="400" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1398.png" alt="Sui Wallet Review: Detailed Instructions On How To Use It You Shouldn&#039;t Miss" class="wp-image-182469" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1398.png 640w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1398-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="Sui Wallet Review: Detailed Instructions On How To Use It You Shouldn&#039;t Miss 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The open-source Sui Wallet gives Sui users the ability to create addresses, view and manage assets on the Sui network, and interact with dApps. The Sui Wallet is a reference implementation for other potential wallets and applications in the Sui ecosystem. Finally, it will showcase the newest and most unique Sui abilities. The Sui Wallet repository will act as an essential ecosystem enabler as Sui begins to support large-scale use cases, Move-powered ownership models, and features other skills only found in Sui.</p>



<p>Sui Wallet will adapt based on input from the developer community. Make sure to join our Sui Discord and provide feedback directly on the #General or #Suggestions channels.</p>



<p>Sending SUI tokens from a Sui Wallet will cost the blockchain platform fee in SUI. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why choose Sui Wallet?</h2>



<p>The path to Web3 adoption is genuinely an empowered developer community and ecosystem. The Sui team is building the best, high-performance blockchain for mass adoption &#8211; and the best ideas, apps, and businesses come from the community.</p>



<p>The Sui Wallet is an ecosystem education and support tool, not an actual wallet. We are open to cooperation and eager to see what our community will build. Current definitions of crypto wallets may need to be improved and optimized for rapid user adoption and large web2 migrations. As wallet builders start pushing for the following version, we also look forward to seeing what the Sui community dreams of.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Structure Sui wallet</h2>



<p>Like most crypto wallets, Sui Wallet has 3 critical parts you must note:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wallet Address: A sequence of numbers and characters used to send assets to the Sui wallet. Others can transfer money to you through the wallet address you provide.</li>



<li>Passphrase: A security key that can be understood as a password consisting of any 12 English keywords. To get your wallet back, you must go through the Passphrase login step to perform the operation. The format of a passphrase: become toes armor elephant bar other price snow achieve development flag</li>



<li>Private Key: A string of characters and numbers to connect to the account, quite similar to the Password of a bank account.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Functions</h2>



<p>You can use Sui Wallet to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Create Sui accounts (addresses)</li>



<li>Import private keys from other wallets (must be a 32 or 64 byte address)</li>



<li>Stake and earn SUI</li>



<li>Transfer coins and NFTs to another address</li>



<li>View your coins, tokens, and NFTs</li>



<li>View recent transactions</li>



<li>Auto split/merge coins to the exact transfer amount</li>



<li>Easily access transaction history in the Sui Explorer</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Basic Instructions</h2>

<p>You can try out staking SUI to earn rewards. These rewards are not real and are for testing purposes only. When you stake SUI, you delegate your SUI tokens to a validator to stake. The validator then pays you rewards for delegating your SUI for them to stake. Note that SUI tokens have no value on test networks.</p>



<p><strong>To stake SUI and earn rewards</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Open your wallet and click&nbsp;<strong>Coins</strong>.</li>



<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Stake &amp; Earn SUI</strong>.</li>



<li>Select a validator to stake with.</li>



<li>Choose an amount of SUI to stake. Enter an amount that leaves sufficient SUI in your wallet to cover gas fees.</li>



<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Stake Now</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Your stake starts earning rewards at the start of the next epoch.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase&#8217;s Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Base, has been making steady development.</em></li>



<li><em>The layer 2 mainnet launch is the highest priority.</em></li>



<li><em>It seeks to bring together millions of developers and billions of users on the blockchain, promoting mass adoption and innovation.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Base, which was launched in February as a platform that streamlines app creation and interaction with the Coinbase product suite, has been functioning on testnet since February and is currently preparing for a mainnet debut in 2023.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1578.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1578-1024x512.png" alt="Coinbase&#039;s Layer 2 Base Mainnet Sets To Launch Within 2023" class="wp-image-183072" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1578-1024x512.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1578-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1578-768x384.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1578-1536x768.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1578-2048x1024.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1578-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1578-750x375.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1578-1140x570.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase&#039;s Layer 2 Base Mainnet Sets To Launch Within 2023 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>Coinbase&#8217;s foray into the Layer 2 area seems to be making solid progress toward a mainnet debut shortly.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a Coinbase official revealed the likely timing for the Base mainnet deployment. The mainnet will be launched in 2023 since the team prioritizes providing it as quickly as feasible.</p>



<p>Jesse Pollak, Coinbase&#8217;s Base lead and director of protocols, stated in an exclusive interview with <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/21/coinbases-layer-2-blockchain-base-plans-for-2023-mainnet-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechCrunch</a></em> that the mainnet launch is the team&#8217;s primary goal.</p>



<p>While no formal date has been provided, Pollak stressed the need to complete the mainnet as soon as feasible. Base seeks to bring together millions of developers and billions of blockchain users, enabling mainstream acceptance and innovation in the sector. Pollak stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“It’s coming soon, we are working hard on it. It’s our number one priority alongside decentralization goals and the rest of the year is really about making sure we get there as quickly as possible.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For more than a decade, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/176652-coinbase-to-create-new-flatcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> has been a prominent participant in the crypto market. Base was introduced as a platform that allows developers to easily build applications that can be integrated into the Coinbase product suite for user convenience.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1580.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1580-1024x683.png" alt="Coinbase&#039;s Layer 2 Base Mainnet Sets To Launch Within 2023" class="wp-image-183074" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1580-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1580-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1580-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1580-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1580-2048x1365.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1580-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1580-1140x760.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase&#039;s Layer 2 Base Mainnet Sets To Launch Within 2023 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>Pollak foresee Base and Coinbase working together to bring a large number of developers and users on-chain, hence accelerating the expansion of the blockchain ecosystem. According to the executive, the wider objective is to merge Base and Coinbase in order to get millions of developers and billions of users on the chain.</p>



<p>Base&#8217;s principal aims in the short term are to acquire mainnet status and decentralize its operations. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has underlined the significance of decentralization, saying that Base must live up to that concept and ethos. Pollak anticipates that the process of decentralization will take months or years rather than a decade. The emphasis is still on making everyday progress toward this objective.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ukraine-based authorities are attempting to apply specific MiCA laws in order to make crypto assets lawful in the country.</em></li>



<li><em>They believe Ukraine will be one of the first nations to incorporate new EU laws into national legislation.</em></li>



<li><em>The desire of Ukraine to embrace EU laws comes as MiCA is set to be published in the middle of this year.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>With the European Parliament passing the regulation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), countries in Europe have also begun to plan to introduce new laws to facilitate the adoption of legislation for crypto companies, and Ukraine can be a pioneer in this regard.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1576-1024x536.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="536" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1576-1024x536.png" alt="Ukraine To Adopt New Crypto Law Follow The MiCA Regulations" class="wp-image-183067" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1576-1024x536.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1576-300x157.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1576-768x402.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1576-750x393.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1576-1140x597.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1576.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ukraine To Adopt New Crypto Law Follow The MiCA Regulations 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>Yaroslav Zheleznyak, Deputy Head of Ukraine&#8217;s Revenue Committee, <a href="https://t.me/yzheleznyak/3926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on his Telegram channel on April 20 that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The European Parliament passed a law to legalize and regulate cryptoassets in the EU MiCA.<br>The text has been developed, debated and rewritten over the past three years, but the collapse of the global crypto-asset market has accelerated the process a little.<br>Legislative norms will be fully operational in 2024.<br>The EU will be the first major jurisdiction in the world with a systemic legislative framework for the field of crypto-assets.<br>Well, we, together with colleagues from the National Commission for Securities and the Stock Market and other regulators, are already working on the implementation of part of the provisions of MiCA, so that crypto-assets are legal in Ukraine as well.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The establishment of MiCA is a significant step forward for the European Union&#8217;s crypto business.</p>



<p>The bill is the culmination of European officials&#8217; lengthy attempts to implement universal laws and develop standardized norms for crypto assets throughout the EU, since crypto enterprises are now compelled to conform to 27 varied legal frameworks across EU member nations. The adoption of MiCA is projected to increase competitiveness among startups in the EU, perhaps increasing their market share in comparison to uncontrolled rivals.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“I am sure Ukraine will be one of the first countries to implement this regulation into national legislation,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nssmc.gov.ua/istorychne-rishennia-dlia-kryptorynku-ievropeiskyi-parlament-skhvalyv-rehlament-mica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Yurir Boyko, a member of the NKCPFR.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the fact that EU MPs must yet complete legal and linguistic checks on MiCA and publish the bill in the EU journal, several players in the crypto business have responded favorably to the news.</p>

<p>Soon after the voting, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase stated that the decision marked a watershed moment for crypto regulation since the bill would give crypto firms the confidence to invest and expand in the area.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Some industry experts have warned in recent months that proper oversight of the crypto company is essential. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, often known as CZ, hailed the EU&#8217;s action in a recent tweet, stating that it provides more consumer protection and promotes asset-class innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Controversial cryptocurrency exchange OPNX, founded by the co-founders of three arrow capital (3AC), has unveiled an investor lineup.</em></li>



<li><em>AppWorks, Susquehanna (SIG), DRW, MIAX Group, China Merchant Bank International, Token Bay Capital, Nascent, and Tuwaiq Limited, were among the investors listed by OPNX.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, the trading volume in the early days of the exchange was quite dismal.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>High-profile corporations such as Susquehanna International Group (SIG) and DRW are among the primary investors in OPNX, a new exchange for trading bankruptcy claims launched by the guys behind defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).</strong></h5>

<p>Additional investors include Taiwanese venture capital company AppWorks, US options exchange MIAX Group, China Merchant Bank International&#8217;s Hong Kong affiliate, and Saudi digital asset fund Tuwaiq.</p>

<p>Three Arrows Capital, a once-famous Singaporean hedge fund worth an estimated $10 billion at its height, was completely wiped out by the bear market last year. Nonetheless, the carnival it has developed since the first explosion continues to exist, and its principal characters seem to be doing well as well.</p>



<p>Kyle Davies, the co-founder of OPNX and the now-defunct 3AC, seems to have taken some consolation in his cooking experience. After considerable upheaval, the former hedge fund manager is now an ambitious restauranteur focused on one goal: refining the art of cooking chicken.</p>

<p>Su Zhu said on April 6 that the US authorities had suspended OPNX&#8217;s official Twitter account and attached a link to the Chinese Telegram group. He did not, however, explain the precise reason.</p>



<p>While daily traffic was originally just approximately $13, by the time this article was published, the exchange had reached almost $1.8 million in daily trading volume. According to <a href="https://flexstatistics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flexstatistics</a>, OPNX&#8217;s daily volume surpassed $2 million earlier this month.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not easy to disappoint the audience, yet these figures are rather amazing. Consider that the total amount of all regulated crypto goods listed in Hong Kong is just approximately $1.19 million every day.</p>

<p>On May 2, at 10 a.m. PT, the Ekos Genesis Art Collection will launch a Dutch auction of 995 one-of-a-kind NFTs.</p>



<p>The auction will run 88 minutes and celebrates the 15th anniversary of the theatrical premiere of &#8220;Iron Man,&#8221; the first picture in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for producer Louis D&#8217;Esposito.</p>



<p>Bidding will begin at 10 Ether (ETH) and then decline by 0.5 ETH every four minutes until the price reaches 0.5 ETH. If the whole collection has not already sold out, the price will be reduced to 0.2 ETH during the last eight minutes of the auction.</p>



<p>A Dutch auction is a sort of auction in which the price begins high and gradually drops until a bidder accepts the current price. It is a prominent approach in financial markets and has gained popularity in the NFT industry owing to its simplicity and transparency.</p>



<p>The Ekos Genesis Art Collection is the newest addition to the thriving NFT market, and it comprises one-of-a-kind artwork from a diverse group of brilliant artists.</p>

<p>The NFT collection includes original artwork by late comic book artist Michael Turner and his regular collaborator Peter Steigerwald, who are noted for their work in Marvel and DC comics as well as collaborating on series for Turner&#8217;s Aspen Comics.</p>



<p>Mythos Studios owns 50% of Aspen Comics and the supporting intellectual property. The Ekos Collection features characters from Fathom and the eponymous Ekos, Turner&#8217;s last project that was not completed when he died.</p>



<p>Maisel has always admired Turner&#8217;s art and began collecting it in 2003. Each NFT is based on Michael Turner&#8217;s original line drawing and incorporates color influenced by various influences such as the Pop Art movement, black light posters, or neon lights.</p>



<p>Collectors and investors are anticipated to pay close attention to the collection, and the Dutch auction structure will lend an element of excitement to the proceedings. Overall, the Ekos Genesis Art Collection Netherlands auction is a fascinating event for NFT collectors and investors. Because of the usage of a novel auction mechanism and the importance of the date, this is a must-see event for everyone interested in the NFT market.</p>

<p>A client is a program that allows users to connect with a blockchain network by validating transactions and storing a local version of the network.</p>



<p>According to OP Labs, Test in Prod used the modular and open-source OP Stack to create an alternative execution client Op Erigon, which is now available for testing on OP Goerli, allowing users to open the source code in the GitHub repository or Tested in Prod&#8217;s OP Goerli public RPC, which will eventually be integrated into Optimism mainnet.</p>



<p>Optimism is a Layer 2 scaling solution aiming to boost the throughput and efficiency of Ethereum (or other blockchain networks) by executing calculations off-chain and only reporting the results to the main chain.</p>

<p>The OP Erigon version, which is currently in testing, helps the Optimism blockchain&#8217;s attempts to promote client diversity. The unveiling of OP Erigon occurred only one day after startup funding firm Andreessen Horowitz unveiled <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182578-a16z-optimism-rollup-client/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magi</a>, its own consensus client, for Optimism.</p>



<p>The Optimism architecture is also intended to support numerous clients running on the Layer 2 network as well as additional chains inside the Optimism ecosystem, such as Coinbase-backed Base. Client variety, according to optimistic contributors, may assist in increasing the network&#8217;s overall resilience.</p>



<p>The OP Stack, Optimism&#8217;s software architecture, enables the network to be divided into a consensus layer, responsible for reaching consensus, and an execution layer, designated for smart contracts, similar to the Ethereum mainnet.</p>

<p>Today, a Bitcoin whale that has been dormant for a decade moved 279 BTC to three new addresses. On-chain analyst account Lookonchain tweeted that the wallet in issue got 1,128 BTC between October 2012 and May 2013. During such transactions, the price of BTC was about $12 and $195 per coin, respectively.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>This transfer comes only a day after another long-dormant Bitcoin whale moved 2,071.5 BTC after nine years of dormancy.</p>



<p>Although the rationale for the move is unclear, some long-time crypto users are reportedly shifting old cash to new wallets in the midst of a massive wallet-draining operation apparently targeting old wallets.</p>



<p>In other Bitcoin-related news, the deadline for Mt. Gox creditors to furnish payback information passed earlier this month, allowing for payments to be made by Oct. 31, 2023.</p>



<p>Mt. Gox plans to disperse an unknown percentage of its 142,000 BTC, 143,000 BCH, and 69 billion Japanese yen holdings through BTC, BCH, and fiat payments.</p>



<p>According to BTC.com statistics, the Bitcoin mining difficulty reading was 48.71 trillion at block height 786,240, up 2.23% from the previous adjustment. From February 25, the difficulty level has risen in the past five modifications.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182915-bitcoin-mining-reaches-all-time-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increases</a> the computer power necessary to mine blocks and be rewarded with Bitcoin. The more harder it is to mine Bitcoin, the more computational power is needed. Currently, BTC is trading at $28,000 and it has suffered a two-day slump. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has also just declined substantially.</p>

<li><em>He was also accused of being racist.</em></li>



<li><em>After a recent piece by Skybridge&#8217;s Anthony Scaramucci, this accusation gained traction.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillman, Sam Bankman-Fried propagated false or racist stories about Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao before to the bankruptcy of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto exchange FTX.</strong></h5>

<p>The collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX was watched by the whole world. Bankman-Fried has been a hot issue for quite some time. While things were beginning to calm down, new charges against the former FTX CEO started to surface. The previous FTX CEO was also accused of racism. Hillman posted on Twitter:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>After a recent piece by Skybridge&#8217;s Anthony Scaramucci, this accusation gained traction. The article explains how SBF paid $45 million for a stake in Skybridge. Scaramucci subsequently invested $10 million in FTX&#8217;s native coin FTT. The November fall of FTX left the investment almost worthless.</p>



<p>During SBF&#8217;s discussions with authorities in Dubai, he had disparaged Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, SBF&#8217;s rival crypto billionaire. The Mooch had not attended those sessions, but his Skybridge colleague had and had reported the terrible behavior to him.</p>

<p>Scaramucci also claimed in the paper that SBF &#8220;bad-mouthed&#8221; CZ in front of Dubai authorities. Nevertheless, the Skybridge CEO was not there at the meeting, and a colleague who was there wired it back to him. The report went on to say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Also, people talk. “He was lighting CZ up,” The Mooch continued. “And these are small towns. They look glitzy from a travel brochure, but trust me, these are small, very connected, interconnected towns. It got back to CZ” As also recounted previously, SBF’s denigration of CZ led the latter to suggest publicly that he might consider selling his $500 million investment in FTT tokens.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Hillman, Binnace&#8217;s decision to sell FTX coins was motivated by this rationale. He stated that SBF &#8220;denigrating CZ&#8221; was the norm for Binance residents.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“[It] had nothing to do with deciding to sell the worthless FTT on the company’s books.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>SBF and CZ have had a personal rivalry for a long time. While FTX was in danger but still running, Binance offered to buy it out for $1 billion. Nevertheless, after doing due diligence on the firm, Binance pulled out of the acquisition the next day. Eventually, everything went apart, forcing FTX to declare bankruptcy.</p>
