<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, announced the discontinuation of XRP leveraged tokens, with trading to cease on July 25.</em></li>



<li><em>The delisting includes XRPUP and XRPDOWN tokens, as well as spot trading for XRP against BUSD.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance advised users to redeem their leveraged tokens before the delisting, and any remaining tokens will be converted to USDT based on the net asset value and distributed to users&#8217; accounts.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has revealed its decision to halt trading for XRP leveraged tokens. The discontinuation of trading for XRPUP and XRPDOWN tokens will take effect on July 25.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-655.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-655-1024x683.png" alt="Binance Will Terminate Redemption Service Of XRP Leveraged Tokens From From July 25" class="wp-image-201704" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-655-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-655-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-655-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-655-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-655-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-655.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Will Terminate Redemption Service Of XRP Leveraged Tokens From From July 25 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>As part of the delisting process, trading for XRPUP/USDT and XRPDOWN/USDT will be <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-to-delist-and-cease-redemption-for-xrpup-and-xrpdown-leveraged-tokens-2023-07-25-e6764830f1aa468990b3263cd967c655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended</a> on July 25 at 06:00 (UTC). Any active trade orders initiated by customers were automatically closed by the system. <a href="https://coincu.com/200804-binance-abandons-dutch-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> urged users to trade their XRPUP and XRPDOWN tokens for other assets before the delisting.</p>



<p>To facilitate the transition, users are advised to redeem their leveraged tokens through the wallet function or the dedicated Leverage Tokens page before the delisting. For users still holding these tokens after the delisting deadline, Binance will convert them to USDT based on the net asset value (NAV) at the time of delisting. The USDT tokens will be distributed to users&#8217; accounts within 24 hours, after which the leveraged token assets will be removed from the wallet.</p>



<p>At present, the tokens are no longer available on the Binance platform. However, Binance has kept the redemption service open for customers who still hold these tokens, enabling them to redeem the leveraged tokens for USDT through the dedicated Leveraged Tokens page or the wallet function.</p>



<p>The exchange had previously <a href="https://coincu.com/201599-binance-delists-these-altcoin-pairs-from-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its plans to cease trading for spot tokens against BUSD as well.</p>



<p>Leveraged Tokens are designed to amplify gains or losses in trading. For example, a 2x leveraged token would provide twice the return of the underlying asset. The XRPUP token multiplies investors&#8217; returns in the event of XRP price increases, while XRPDOWN multiplies returns in the case of XRP price declines.</p>

<p>The delisting of XRPUP and XRPDOWN tokens follows Binance&#8217;s previous actions this year, where the exchange delisted several leveraged tokens. In January, Binance announced the delisting of twenty leveraged tokens between February 14 and 18. Additionally, six leveraged tokens were delisted from May 9 to 11.</p>



<p>Earlier, the exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/201234-binance-launch-the-32nd-launchpad-arkham-arkm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> its 32nd Launchpad project with the launch of the Arkham (ARKM) token.</p>

<p>Rodeo Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, was recently <a href="https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xb1be5dee3852c818af742f5dd44def285b497ffc5c2eda0d893af542a09fb25a" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xb1be5dee3852c818af742f5dd44def285b497ffc5c2eda0d893af542a09fb25a" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit </a>by a TWAP oracle manipulation attack, resulting in the loss of around $1.5 million worth of ether. The attacker was able to transfer the stolen funds from the Arbitrum network to Ethereum and exchanged the tokens for other assets. </p>



<p>The ether was then routed through Tornado Cash, a popular transaction mixer, which effectively obscured the trail of funds. Igor Igamberdiev, the head of research at Wintermute, described the attack as a form of DeFi manipulation that artificially skews the calculated average price of an asset, giving the attacker an undue advantage during a transaction. </p>

<p>This manipulation can lead to various forms of attacks, including flash loan exploits. Such complex maneuvers have become tools for hackers who manipulate oracle price data feeds to execute exploits. The Rodeo exploit is not an isolated occurrence but part of a trend that has been plaguing the Arbitrum ecosystem over the past few months.</p>

<p>These types of attacks highlight the importance of implementing robust security measures in DeFi protocols.

As the popularity of DeFi continues to grow, it is crucial to stay informed and remain vigilant against potential threats.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance Coin (BNB) experiences price fluctuations, falling below the $240 support level, but sees a recovery following the announcement of the ARKM token sale on Binance Launchpad by Arkham Intelligence.</em></li>



<li><em>BNB deposits surge on Binance, resulting in a significant increase in daily trading volume.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite the positive response to the token sale, BNB&#8217;s price remains below the Fib 23.6% level and struggles to surpass the $250 resistance level.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance Coin (BNB) has seen a couple of swing swings from $250 in the last few days. The price fell below the $240 support level. Binance&#8217;s announcement of the introduction of <a href="https://coincu.com/201309-arkham-intel-on-chain-intelligence-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARKM</a>, the new token from on-chain forensics company <a href="https://coincu.com/201349-arkham-airdrop-on-july-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arkham Intelligence</a>, on the <a href="https://coincu.com/201234-binance-launch-the-32nd-launchpad-arkham-arkm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance Launchpad</a> is seen as a favorable indication.</strong></h5>

<p>Binance Coin recovered all weekly losses after Binance launched a token sale for the on-chain analytics tool Arkham yesterday and said that investors must possess Binance Coin to participate. The ARKM token sale includes a hard ceiling of $2.5 million, with a maximum contribution restriction of $15,000 per user.</p>

<p>Binance has seen a huge rise in BNB deposits over the previous 12 hours, which has resulted in a 180% spike in daily trading volume. A huge whale sent roughly 141,835 BNB ($35 million) to various Binance deposit addresses, likely in anticipation of the Arkham token sale. This occurrence is most likely to blame for the current increase in BNB trading volume.</p>



<p>Binance Coin is an unusually high flyer in the market, and anytime it moves, it is clear that the exchange&#8217;s favorable feeling is strong at the moment.</p>



<p>Due to anticipation around the forthcoming token sale, the price of BNB on Binance increased by 7.46%, jumping from $231.3 to $248.6.</p>



<p>The currency is now trading at $246.4, with a 24-hour trading volume of $848,332,976.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-1024x623.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-1024x623.png" alt="BNB Price Is Struggling At $250 Despite Launchpad Effect" class="wp-image-201682" width="1022" height="622" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-1024x623.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-300x182.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-768x467.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-1536x934.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-2048x1246.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-750x456.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-649-1140x693.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" title="BNB Price Is Struggling At $250 Despite Launchpad Effect 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BNB price chart. <em>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/1EribfXh/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABNBUSDT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TradingView</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, we need to note that this is an effect brought about by the new Binance Launchpad, and the price of BNB is still below the Fib 23.6% level. What&#8217;s special is that it also coincides with the $250 resistance level. This level is the price of the coin that was rejected many times after losing its key $300 support.</p>



<p>For now, the wait is still ongoing as Bitcoin is still trading around the $30,300-$30,600 mark with no signal of a breakout above $31,000. Although Binance Coin received a very enthusiastic response, if the overall trend of the market remains gloomy, it is difficult for it to surpass the $250 mark.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Digital asset exchange BIT announced today an update to its existing integration with Copper's ClearLoop, a leading digital asset settlement network.<p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com/201652-bit-and-copper-revolutionize-crypto-trading/" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p><p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="https://coincu.com"><strong>Coincu News</strong></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>BIT announces an integration upgrade with Copper ClearLoop, a settlement network, to enhance trading features for institutional clients.</em></li>



<li><em>The upgrade enables traders to use all of their assets as collateral and introduces USD-margined options, reducing counterparty risk.</em></li>



<li><em>The partnership provides secure trading on the BIT exchange while assets remain safeguarded under Copper&#8217;s custody, improving capital efficiency and settlement times.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital asset exchange BIT <a href="https://blog.bit.com/bit-extends-integration-with-coppers-clearloop-to-facilitate-off-exchange-settlements-on-usd-margined-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today an update to its existing integration with Copper&#8217;s ClearLoop, a leading digital asset settlement network.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="504" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-1024x504.png" alt="BIT And Copper Join Forces To Revolutionize Institutional Crypto Trading" class="wp-image-201659" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-1024x504.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-300x148.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-768x378.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-1536x755.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-2048x1007.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-750x369.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-640-1140x561.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BIT And Copper Revolutionize Institutional Crypto Trading With Enhanced Security 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>The improved integration intends to transform institutional customers&#8217; crypto trading experiences by providing expanded trading tools and greater asset protection.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/174165-copper-stops-enterprise-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Copper</a> through ClearLoop will now support BIT&#8217;s Unified Margin function, allowing traders to use all of their assets as collateral, thanks to the integration update. In addition, the update converts previously supported coin-margined choices to USD-margined ones. BIT will also implement the new ClearLoop trust structure as part of the upgrade, which offers additional protections against counterparty risk through Copper&#8217;s market-leading legal framework.</p>



<p>The ClearLoop update also converts previously supported coin-margined options to USD-margined options and implements the new ClearLoop trust structure, reducing customers&#8217; exposure to counterparty risk even more.</p>



<p>Copper is a SOC2 Type 2 accredited startup that was formed in 2018 with ClearLoop as its heart. ClearLoops allows customers to trade and settle in near real-time across several exchanges, reducing counterparty risk and enhancing capital efficiency.</p>



<p>Dmitry Tokarev, founder and CEO of Copper.co, expressed his satisfaction with the growing partnership, stating:</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We&#8217;re proud to grow our partnership with BIT as they adopt the new ClearLoop Trust Structure, providing their institutional clients with even greater protection for their digital assets.

<p>ClearLoop&#8217;s technical capabilities for off-exchange settlement remains unaltered. The integration, however, now includes the critical advantage of bankruptcy remoteness provided by ClearLoop&#8217;s legal structure.</p>



<p>This huge boost in integration is intended to alter institutional customers&#8217; trading experiences by providing them with a smooth and safe platform. Because of BIT&#8217;s enhanced trading features and collaboration with Copper, institutional customers may easily utilize BIT&#8217;s trading services without having to move assets from Copper custody. This arrangement alleviates typical security issues connected with trading on cryptocurrency exchanges, such as the danger of exchange hacking and asset freezing.</p>

<p>The integration enables institutional customers to conduct secure trading on the BIT exchange while knowing that their funds are safe in Copper&#8217;s segregated custody. This method efficiently decreases counterparty risk, improves capital efficiency, and shortens settlement times.</p>



<p>BIT customers may now instantly access assets and finalize transactions via their ClearLoop account, using Copper&#8217;s revolutionary off-exchange settlement technology.</p>



<p>The crypto exchange was started in August 2020 as a <a href="https://coincu.com/187715-matrixport-and-copper-join-to-streamline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matrixport</a> affiliate and is especially popular among institutional investors due to its crypto options trading offering. Portfolio Margin and Unified Margin help the firm&#8217;s superior risk management and fund efficiency.</p>

<p>Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of USDC stablecoin operator Circle, believes stablecoins could help the Chinese government internationalize the yuan more quickly than its central bank digital currency (CBDC) eCNY. Although there is no indication that Beijing is warming up to crypto, Allaire thinks that stablecoins typically pegged to fiat currency, could be a more immediate solution to promote the use of the RMB in trade and commerce worldwide. He cited an offshore yuan-pegged stablecoin as an example of how this might work.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has promised to roll out regulations on stablecoins by 2024, recognizing the potential impact that these products could have on financial markets. In tandem, the Securities and Futures Commission is also working on its complementary regulations. This marks the next front in Hong Kong&#8217;s bid to regulate crypto markets and become a global virtual asset hub.</p>



<p>Stablecoins are a unique breed of crypto assets, pegged to fiat currency, making them more stable than other cryptocurrencies. They can be used for a variety of purposes, including remittances, cross-border payments, and trading. It remains to be seen whether stablecoins will take over CBDCs in promoting the use of cryptocurrencies, but they are gaining traction in the global market for now.</p>



<p>Despite the potential benefits, there are still concerns over their regulation and risks. The HKMA&#8217;s move to regulate stablecoins is a step in the right direction toward addressing these issues. As the crypto market continues to evolve, it is important for regulators to keep pace with new developments and provide a framework for the responsible use of these assets.</p>

<p>As of May and June, another 18 sites were inspected, bringing the total number of inspections for the year to 34. The regulator has been working closely with the South West Regional Organized Crime Unit and the police forces of Greater London, Bedfordshire, and Hertfordshire to conduct these inspections.</p>



<p>According to the FCA, it has &#8220;disrupted&#8221; 26 machines operating unlawfully across the country. However, despite the crackdown and warnings issued by the FCA, some members of the public continue to use crypto ATMs. In one case, a person paid 1,000 British pounds ($1,290) into a crypto ATM, but no funds were returned even though the machine said the transaction was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The public to be aware that any crypto ATMs in the country are operating illegally, and consumers will not be protected if they use one and something goes wrong. The FCA has issued various warnings since March 2022, urging people not to use these machines.</p>



<p>None of the more than 40 registered crypto companies in the U.K. is licensed to offer ATM services. Therefore, any crypto ATMs operating in the U.K. are doing so illegally, as the FCA has warned. According to data site Coin ATM Radar, there are 10 such locations in the country.</p>



<p>The FCA&#8217;s crackdown on these illegal crypto ATMs is crucial to protect consumers from scams and ensure that financial regulations are being followed. Furthermore, it&#8217;s important for members of the public to be informed and aware of the risks associated with using these machines, and to avoid using them altogether.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin Ordinals gain traction and challenge Ethereum&#8217;s NFT dominance, setting record numbers of inscriptions.</em></li>



<li><em>Ordinals experience a surge in sales and active buyers, with significant growth in USD sales and a potential shift in dominance within the NFT sector.</em></li>



<li><em>Ethereum&#8217;s struggle to maintain traction is attributed to falling floor prices of top collections, while Bitcoin Ordinals continue to gain adoption despite controversies.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Ordinals, the NFTs created on the Bitcoin (BTC) network, are rapidly gaining momentum and closing in on their Ethereum (ETH) counterparts in terms of dominance. Since their inception in April 2023, Ordinals have been making waves within the Bitcoin community, setting record numbers of inscriptions and challenging Ethereum&#8217;s position in the NFT space.</strong></h5>

<p>Ordinals are unique digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Their creation became possible through the Taproot upgrade, which was launched on the Bitcoin network in November 2021. This upgrade enabled data inscription on the Bitcoin network in a similar manner to creating NFTs on other blockchain platforms. The introduction of Ordinals has created a buzz in the Bitcoin community, leading to significant traction and growing interest among users.</p>



<p>According to data from NFT aggregator <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoSlam</a>, collections such as $INSC BRC-20 NFTs, Uncategorized Ordinals, $SATS BRC-20 NFTs, and $BRC-20 NFTs have seen substantial trading volumes, surpassing popular Ethereum collections like Azuki, BAYC, and DeGods.</p>

<p>The number of new inscriptions on Ordinals reached over 250,000 on Monday, based on data tracked by the data analytics platform <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune Analytics</a>. This represents a surge of more than 300% since the launch of the Bitcoin Request for Comment BRC-69 token standard on July 3. The BRC-69 token standard, the modified version of the BRC-20 standard, has significantly reduced the cost of inscriptions for Ordinals by over 90%.</p>

<p>In contrast, Ethereum&#8217;s daily volume experienced only a 3.8% increase during the same period. However, it is important to note that Ethereum&#8217;s sales volume still exceeds that of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Ordinals have witnessed a remarkable surge in both sales and active buyers, achieving over 130% growth in USD sales and capturing close to 10% of the buyer market. Although Ethereum currently leads the NFT sector with total sales surpassing $15.65 million, the rapid rise of Bitcoin Ordinals suggests a potential shift in dominance.</p>

<p>This shift indicates that traders&#8217; interest in Bitcoin NFTs has surpassed that of Ethereum. One contributing factor to Ethereum&#8217;s struggle to gain traction is the falling floor prices of its top collections.</p>



<p>While Ethereum previously held the title of the king of NFT volume, primarily due to its mass adoption in 2021, collections on the Ethereum blockchain have faced challenges in maintaining a steady upward trajectory since the beginning of the year. It was during this same period that Bitcoin Ordinals emerged, backed by the Taproot network, steadily gaining adoption despite controversies surrounding its operation on the Bitcoin network.</p>



<p>As Bitcoin Ordinals continue to set new records and attract increased attention, it remains to be seen if they will dethrone Ethereum and reshape the landscape of the NFT sector.</p>

<p>This method generates Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through a process called inscribing, and has become increasingly popular. In fact, the number of new inscriptions has already risen to over 350,000 on Monday, according to data tracked by Glassnode, a blockchain analytics firm.</p>



<p>This increase in daily inscriptions represents a surge of over 250% since <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bitcoin.org/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ordinals</a> launchpad Luminex unveiled the BRC-69 token standard on July 3. This modified version of the BRC-20 standard has reduced the cost of inscriptions for Ordinals by over 90%.</p>

<p>Luminex said in a Tweet thread that with BRC69, the costs of inscriptions for Ordinals collections can be reduced by over 90% through a 4-step process: (1) inscribe traits, (2) deploy collection, (3) compile collection, and (4) mint assets. The brilliance of BRC69 lies in its simplicity, as minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image. This text allows the final image to be automatically rendered on all ordinals-frontends, using solely on-chain resources, thanks to recursive inscriptions.</p>



<p>While the number of new inscriptions has surged, the daily fees paid for inscriptions remain stagnant, according to data tracked by Dune Analytics. This trend suggests that the BRC-69 token standard has delivered on its promise.</p>

<p>Ordinals was launched in January, bringing the NFT and smart contracts narrative to the Bitcoin blockchain and spurring investor interest in tokens like STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network.</p>



<p>The Ordinals boom can be divided into two waves, according to Glassnode. The first wave represents activity between early February and late April, when image-based inscriptions led the way. The second wave began in May, with high free-paying text-based inscriptions leading the way. This trend suggests that the Ordinals market is still evolving and that we can expect to see more exciting developments in the future.</p>
