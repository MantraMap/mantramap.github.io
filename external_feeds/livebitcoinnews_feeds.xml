										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Buenos Aires, Argentina, December 20, 2022</em>–<a href="https://bc.game/i-946j27rm-n/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BC.GAME</a>, AFA’s official crypto casino sponsor, is celebrating Messi and Argentina’s legendary win with a huge lottery event.

<p><strong>Argentina Wins Over France </strong></p>
<p>On a night full of anticipation and heart-pounding moments, Argentina takes home the championship in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Argentina defeated France by 4-2 in a penalty shootout in the nerve-wracking final match held in the Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.afa.com.ar/es/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Argentinian football team</a>’s victory against France this Sunday night adds another win to Argentina’s World Cup championship titles list. This marks Argentina’s third World Cup win since their last World Cup championship title in 1986, making it 36 years since the country last won the World Cup.</p>
<p><strong>Messi’s Dream to Win the 2022 World Cup  </strong></p>
<p>Lionel Messi has obtained every possible football achievement throughout the entirety of his football career except one: winning the World Cup. After losing the finals to Germany in 2014, the 2022 World Cup marked his another chance to win the World Cup title.</p>
<p>Thanks to Argentina’s well-deserved victory, Messi has finally achieved and added the football’s grandest title to his roster of achievements. The historic win not only brings immense joy to all fans of the Argentinian football team but also provides a great ending to Messi’s legendary football career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, <em>Live Bitcoin News</em> reported that the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-ftx-arena-is-changing-its-name-following-exchange-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX Arena for the Miami Heat</a> was going to change its name following the collapse of FTX, the now disgraced cryptocurrency exchange based in the Bahamas. The company wanted nothing to do with the firm’s rotten legacy, and now Cal – aka the California Memorial Stadium/ FTX Field – is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/ncaafb/welcome-to-cals-ftx-field-a-naming-rights-deal-funded-by-cryptocurrency/ar-AA1479xl" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">looking to do the same</a>.</p>
<h2>Cal Doesn&#8217;t Like the Letters FTX Anymore</h2>
<p>Cal has stated that what happened with FTX is wrong and it wants no part in whatever shady deals FTX may have conducted. It doesn’t need this kind of trouble and is now looking to engage in a legal name change so the FTX letters are removed from its banner forever.</p>
<p>Cal serves as the home football field for the Golden Bears team. A few years back, Cal announced that it was joining hands with the now fallen digital trading platform and would be taking on a name change as a means of supporting the company’s legacy and operations.</p>
<p>The naming deal was set to last a full ten years. At the time, Cal director of athletics Jim Knowlton said the field had allegedly found a “great partner” in the digital exchange, and they were looking forward to a future filled with profit and possibilities. He stated in an interview at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe we have found a great partner in FTX. FTX is a growing company at the forefront of innovation in an emerging technology, one that fits well at both Cal and in the Bay Area. This agreement extends well beyond field naming rights, which is part of our strategic plan to diversify revenue streams in support of our student-athlete experience, and includes commitments for our Cameron Institute, Cal Veterans, and students in need here in Berkeley. We are looking forward to building our relationship now and in the years ahead.</p></blockquote>
<h2>One of Crypto&#8217;s Most Embarrassing Moments</h2>
<p>The collapse of FTX is likely going to go down as one of the most devastating (and embarrassing) things to happen within the confines of the crypto space. FTX first came to fruition in the year 2019. From there, it looked like a glorious future was written in the clouds for the exchange, and the company’s head executive – then 27-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried – was lauded as a genius businessman of sorts by several experts in the arena.</p>
<p>However, that reputation has faded fast as just a few weeks ago, the now crushed exchange ran to Binance for help, begging the larger competitor to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">buy it out in</a> part to an ongoing liquidity crunch the company was experiencing. While it looked like the deal was going to go through, Changpeng Zhao – the head of Binance – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">eventually backed out</a>, claiming the problems the firm was facing were too big.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Bankman-Fried – the disgraced runner of now failed crypto exchange FTX – gave a lot of his money to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-billionaire-sam-bankman-fried-spends-big-in-the-name-of-politics/" data-wpel-link="internal">democrat candidates during</a> the midterm elections… So much, in fact, that he’s been listed as the <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/10/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-joe-biden-democratic-party-second-biggest-donor/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">second highest donor</a> to said candidates this season.</p>
<h2>The Filth of Sam Bankman-Fried Fell into D.C.</h2>
<p>This raises big questions <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/democrats-took-his-shady-crypto-money-will-they-keep-it/ar-AA147TZO" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">regarding where the money came</a> from and how it was used. Many people are wondering if the money given to democrats was filthy or had been laundered in some way. It’s not like Bankman-Fried – or SBF as he’s so commonly called – has the cleanest record to his name. There’s far too much coming out about the situation now, and several of these democrats are now being asked if they’re going to part with the money that they received from him.</p>
<p>In most cases, it seems like the obvious thing to do would be to give the funds back and say, “I won’t accept your filthy, lousy endorsement.” Strangely, however, that doesn’t seem to be the case with some of these candidates, who claim they are either keeping the funds or have given them to good causes. These slimy politicians will say just about anything necessary to keep paychecks rolling in, won’t they?</p>
<p>Representative Ruben Gallego – a democrat from Arizona – says he took the money he received from Bankman-Fried and put it towards the campaign of Andrea Salinas, a Latin woman that ran for – and won – a seat in Congress representing a district of Oregon. In an interview, he said of the funds:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, I think I’ve paid it back.</p></blockquote>
<p>Representative Carolyn Bourdeaux, a Georgia representative, was not on the receiving side when it came to money stemming from Bankman-Fried or the PAC he created, while her challenger was. She didn’t win her election, and says she has mixed feelings about the unraveling of FTX that followed. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I knew that this was a very risky financial instrument, and these guys were likely to come to a bad end. Early on, I called for Lucy to disavow this funding. She had no control over it, but she could have at least said, ‘This is not appropriate.’</p></blockquote>
<h2>No Easy Way Out</h2>
<p>She continued to claim that the fraud surrounding SBF and FTX are relatively obvious, and she’s convinced lawmakers will come down hard on both. She mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The horse is out of the barn. The fraud is so obvious, [and] what happened is so egregious that it’s going to be very hard for members to say, ‘We shouldn’t intervene to regulate this sector.’</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, Bankman-Fried is under supervision in the Bahamas, where FTX is stationed. He is facing potential fraud charges in that nation, though he could also face criminal charges in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people like betting because they are always interested in trying their luck to win a big prize. However, as traditional betting is not transparent and over regulated, luck is not always enough. When betting, individuals can not control their funds every step of the way, and that’s why a lot of gimmicky situations appear. Also, normal betting is not anonymous and you have to give your personal info to a third party as a result.</p>
<p>It’s good that the betting revolution is happening right now: <a href="https://p2pbet.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">P2PBET</a> has launched a world-first crypto-betting platform based on the blockchain. All this sounds intriguing, but before we find out more about this platform, let&#8217;s first understand what cryptocurrency and the blockchain are and how they can influence betting.</p>
<p><strong>About blockchain and cryptocurrency</strong></p>
<p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that stores the record of ownership of digital assets. People who participate in the network are called nodes. The data stored on the blockchain can’t be modified, which makes the technology a legitimate disruptor for industries like payments, cybersecurity and healthcare. Similarity can be seen with Google Docs when a person shares their Google Doc with a group of people, the document becomes distributed among everyone who has access to it. Thus, it becomes decentralized and transparent. Of course, blockchain technology is far more complicated and one can not make any changes once the code is written which makes it more secure.</p>
<p>A cryptocurrency is a form of digital cash that enables individuals to transmit value in the digital world. Crypto functions on the blockchain and does not have a central bank or any party that can change the rules without reaching consensus.</p>
<p>By implementing the blockchain and crypto technology into the betting industry, we can get a completely new way of betting – decentralized betting.</p>
<p><strong>How do decentralized bets work on P2PBET?</strong></p>
<p>Now that we know how the blockchain and crypto work, let’s look at how blockchain decentralization makes betting better.</p>
<ul>
<li>All the transactions happen on the blockchain which means that every user can track the transfers that happen on the platform. What is more – there are no delays and stops in transfers.</li>
<li>There’s no KYC on <a href="https://t.me/p2pbet" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">P2PBET</a> which means that user info is not required.</li>
<li>User money is safe. The participants can be sure that nobody can have access to their money except themselves because the platform requires connecting MetaMask and TRC20 wallets.</li>
<li>Unlike traditional betting, P2PBET does not regulate any rates, because all the financial assets’ statuses are synchronized with the actual rates on Binance.</li>
<li>The platform’s commissions are always fixed at 3% from each win. Such conditions are written in the smart contract and as such, there’s no room for fee manipulation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More about P2PBET</strong></p>
<p>The advantages mentioned above can make the betting platform anonymous, transparent and unlimited. <a href="https://t.me/P2PBET_Chat" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">P2PBET</a> took a new innovative approach to betting and revolutionized the industry with the idea of connecting the blockchain, crypto and betting. Now, the ones who love betting can enjoy the process relying on their luck and professionalism, without worrying about other factors.</p>
<p>Moreover, P2PBET launched a <a href="https://free.p2pbet.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Free</a><a href="https://free.p2pbet.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> Game</a> on their platform where anybody can have 3 attempts to predict BTC’s price by the end of the day. The winner gets $100! The users do not need to invest any money to participate because the game is free. Also, as it has been launched recently, everyone has a big chance to be the winner in guessing the actual price of Bitcoin. This is the perfect chance to give yourself a nice present before Christmas!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canaan – a large manufacturer and distributor of bitcoin and crypto mining equipment – has seen its profits and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/canaan-net-income-nosedives-88-as-bitcoin-mining-suffers-on-heels-of-ftx-crumble-1031910477" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">revenue plunge over the</a> course of the last several months. Thus far, net income for the company has dipped roughly 88 percent in 2022, and the company has only made a little more than $8.5 million for the year.</p>
<h2>Canaan Isn&#8217;t Doing So Hot</h2>
<p>The mining <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-mining-companies-really-have-it-hard/" data-wpel-link="internal">sector has been suffering heavily</a> as of late, partly because prices are going down, but also because electricity and energy costs continue to skyrocket thanks to ongoing inflation. The price of bitcoin, for example, is down more than 70 percent from its all-time high of about $68,000 per unit in November of 2021. Right now, it’s trading in the mid-$16,000 range.</p>
<p>Several other digital assets have followed suit, and as a result, the space has lost more than $2 trillion in overall valuation. This has arguably been one of the most bearish – if not <em>the</em> most bearish – years for crypto, and at the time of writing, very little is being witnessed in terms of hope and strength.</p>
<p>Canaan CEO Nangeng Zhang commented in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The negative market dynamics have significantly hindered bitcoin miners&#8217; revenues and cash flows. As miners are forced to cut their demand for computing power, we had to adjust down our selling price in response.</p></blockquote>
<p>2022 has been the year in which many crypto companies fall apart completely, and the mining sector has been particularly vulnerable. Not long ago, major digital currency <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-mining-firm-compute-north-files-for-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">mining farm Compute North</a> was forced into bankruptcy proceedings, and other crypto-based companies – from Three Arrows Capital to Voyager Digital – have done the same.</p>
<p>But aside from all this, the digital mining space is facing heightened pressure to go completely green, something that isn’t entirely doable right now. Many eco-friendly people have gone against crypto mining, claiming that it is setting the planet on a downward spiral that could result in some major issues if things are not turned around quickly.</p>
<p>There have been many reports <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-mining-may-require-more-energy-than-180-countries/" data-wpel-link="internal">produced over the years</a> that say bitcoin and crypto mining use more electricity than many of the globe’s developing nations. While this could ultimately be shrugged off, it doesn’t help when top figureheads like Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla fame are backing this sentiment.</p>
<p>In early 2021, Musk <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-permits-bitcoin-payments-for-tesla-vehicles/" data-wpel-link="internal">announced that Tesla buyers</a> could purchase new vehicles with bitcoin. This decision didn’t last when he quickly decided <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-has-taken-a-nasty-stumble-many-are-blaming-elon-musk/" data-wpel-link="internal">that bitcoin miners</a> couldn’t be trusted, and thus he wasn’t willing to support the space.</p>
<h2>Trying to Keep Money in the Bank</h2>
<p>Zhang further commented with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our priority is to conserve our cash, minimize our expenses, and endure this market downturn.</p></blockquote>
<p>At press time, stock shares in Canaan are selling for less than $3 each according to data from <em>Benzinga</em>.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Cardano price is struggling below $0.300 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-more-upsides-18k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. ADA price must stay above the $0.250 support to avoid more downsides.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, cardano price saw a fresh decline from the $0.320 zone against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair declined below the $0.305 and $0.300 support levels.</p>
<p>The price even declined below the $0.280 support and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-risk-of-more-losses-below-0-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hour)</a>. A low was formed near $0.2491 and the price is now consolidating losses. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $0.260 zone.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $0.268 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3290 swing high to $0.2491 low.</p>
<p>The next major resistance could be near the $0.2900 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3290 swing high to $0.2491 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.295 on the 4-hours chart.</p>
<p>A clear upside break above the $0.295 level might send the price towards the $0.320 resistance. Any more gains could start a steady increase towards the $0.350 level.</p>
<p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $0.250 level. The next major support is near the $0.235 level, below which the price may perhaps decline towards the $0.212 support level. Any more losses might call for a test of the $0.20 level.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is struggling below $1,250 against the US Dollar. ETH/USD remains at a risk of more losses if there is a break below the $1,150 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, ethereum faced a rejection near the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-bulls-aim-upside-break-above-1300/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$1,350 zone</a> against the US Dollar. ETH price failed to gain strength and started a fresh decline below the $1,300 level.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $1,280 and $1,250 support levels. The bears pushed the price below the $1,220 support zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,270 on the 4-hours chart.</p>
<p>The price traded as low as $1,150 and is currently consolidating losses. An immediate resistance is near the $1,200 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,350 swing high to $1,150 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,220 zone.</p>
<p>The main resistance is near the $1,250 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-rally-possible-above-this-hurdle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,350 swing high to $1,150 low.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $1,240 and $1,250 resistance levels might call for a decent increase to $1,300. Any more gains could even send the price above the $1,350 resistance zone.</p>
<p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $1,160 level. The next major support is now near the $1,150 level. A break below the $1,150 support could push the price to $1,100.</p>
<p>If the bulls struggle to protect the $1,100 support, the price might decline towards $1,065. Any more losses could lead the price towards $1,000 or even $920.</p>
