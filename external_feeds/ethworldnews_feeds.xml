<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Alameda Research also had unlimited access to customer accounts among other special privileges at the FTX crypto exchange.</li><li>The CFTC&#8217;s complaint against Sam Bankman-Fried cited insider information, chat logs, and internal conversations as evidence for its lawsuit.</li><li>Charges were also filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC. </li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said that Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading behemoth, was insolvent as of May/June 2022 despite allegedly using customer funds to finance debts and loans.</p>



<p>On Tuesday following SBF’s arrest, the CFTC filed a formal complaint against Bankman-Fried for committing fraud among other crimes. The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/">filed </a>charges against SBF on December 13.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the CFTC, Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives gave special access to Alameda. SBF’s trading firm was exempt from liquidation rules thanks to specific code written into FTX’s trading engine, per the complaint. The regulator added that Alameda could also open positions and order transactions without insufficient asset balances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alameda could borrow without limit on FTX, said the CFTC. The filing noted that Alameda’s borrow limit, or lack of it, included customer deposits and user assets.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>On at least one occasion during the Relevant Period, Alameda had reached a previously-set borrowing limit for its FTX account. In response, Bankman-Fried directed FTX personnel to raise the borrowing limit to a level that would be unlikely to ever be exceeded. On information and belief, FTX personnel ultimately raised Alameda’s borrowing limit to be many tens of billions of dollars. Alameda’s borrowed funds could also be withdrawn from FTX. These features, in combination, allowed Alameda unlimited ability to borrow and withdraw digital assets directly from FTX Trading to put towards its off-platform activities.</p></blockquote>



<p>Despite using customer funds to backstop billions in Alameda’s losses, the CFTC alleges that SBF’s trading giant was unable to repay loans and meet margin calls by May/June 2022. Notably, Terra’s $40 billion implosion happened around the same time. </p>



<p>The filing <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-new-ftt-tokens/">spurred</a> discourse around claims that Bankman-Fried and FTX played a role in crashing Luna and Three Arrows Capital after Su Zhu and his 3AC co-founder Kyle Davies published a barrage of Twitter threads blaming SBF for their fortunes. </p>

<h2>Bitcoin, Ether, and Tether Are Commodities: CFTC</h2>



<p>Part of the CFTC’s complaint gave insight into the regulators&#8217; approach toward classifying some cryptocurrencies. “Certain digital assets are commodities including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT) and others are commodities”, said the CFTC. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="680" height="319" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC.png" alt="CFTC: Alameda Used FTX Customer Funds To Stave Off Insolvency In May/June 2022 2" class="wp-image-580143" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC.png 680w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC-300x141.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC-269x126.png 269w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" title="CFTC: Alameda Used FTX Customer Funds To Stave Off Insolvency In May/June 2022 3"></figure>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-chief-gary-gensler-cftc-cryptos/">reportedly</a> backs classifying Bitcoin as a commodity. However, the SEC under Gensler <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-pos-security-gary-gensler/">suggested</a> that Ethereum, and by extension ETH, should fall under U.S. Securities laws&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clear crypto regulations in the U.S. remain elusive despite the CFTC’s argument and the SEC’s rhetoric. Crypto participants have long blamed a lack of regulatory guidance for crypto as the underlying factor behind some failures in the digital asset industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the FTX Congressional <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/" rel="noreferrer noopener">hearings</a>, bipartisan lawmakers suggested a myriad of regulatory paths total bans on crypto, inclusive regulatory policies, and completely isolating blockchain technology from America’s traditional financial ecosystem. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Binance CEO Chanpgeng Zhao pointed to FTX&#8217;s collapse as a reason for increased scrutiny of the digital asset industry.</li><li>Zhao&#8217;s internal meme to Binance staff said the crypto exchange &#8220;will survive any crypto winter”.</li><li>Outflows from Binance crossed $6.1 billion in assets while inflows exceeded $6.5 billion in the same 24 hours, Nansen data showed.</li></ul>



<p>According to Binance CEO Chanpgeng Zhao, crypto winter is far from over and bumpy days lay ahead for the digital asset industry following the collapse of FTX, a now-bankrupt crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao who is known as CZ by crypto participants and mainstream media shared his thoughts in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. CZ told colleagues and staff to expect amplified scrutiny on crypto companies. Zhao also expects that industry leaders like Binance will have tough questions to answer as the FTX debacle unfolds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on December 13, a few before he was scheduled to testify before Congress. United State prosecutors affirmed that SBF was indeed arrested ahead of a formal indictment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/">charged</a> with eight counts including fraud on customers and investors, money laundering, and campaign finance violations. Bankman-Fried was arraigned before a judge and denied bail. His lawyers argued for a $250,000 bail bond.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Binance Prepared For ‘Stress Test’ Says CZ</h2>



<p>CZ’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/binance-ceo-zhao-warns-bumpy-road-ahead-in-message-to-his-staff?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">memo</a> echoed previous rhetoric that Binance boasts liquidity to match withdrawal demands. The crypto exchange “will survive any crypto winter”, said Zhao to staff. Indeed, massive outflows from Binance highlighted mounting skepticism for centralized crypto exchanges and their reserves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nansen data showed withdrawals of over $6.1 billion in Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets from Binance in 24 hours. Data also showed $6.5 billion in inflows within the same period. CZ remained adamant that Binance customer assets are held 1:1.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="210" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Nansen-1024x210.png" alt="CZ Binance Says To &#039;Expect Tough Months Ahead&#039;, Calls $6 Billion In Outflows A&#039;Stress Test&#039; 3" class="wp-image-580139" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Nansen-1024x210.png 1024w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Nansen-300x62.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Nansen-770x158.png 770w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Nansen-269x55.png 269w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Nansen-746x153.png 746w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Nansen.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="CZ Binance Says To &#039;Expect Tough Months Ahead&#039;, Calls $6 Billion In Outflows A&#039;Stress Test&#039; 6"><figcaption>Nansen Data</figcaption></figure>



<p>Zhao used “FUD” and “stress test” to describe the spotlight on Binance following FTX’s crash, where top executives like SBF stand accused of stealing customer funds to finance debts and expenditures at Alameda.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>FTX CEO John Ray has testified before the U.S House Committee on Financial Services</li><li>John Ray criticized former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for his unacceptable business practices.&nbsp;</li><li>The new management has recovered over $1 billion of the lost funds.&nbsp;</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried has blamed John Ray and his team for jeopardizing the funds of FTX US customers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>John Ray III, the current CEO of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWAnrigAO3I" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">testified</a>&nbsp;before the U.S House Committee on Financial Services earlier today. This much anticipated congressional hearing was originally meant to feature former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried as well, but given that he is currently under arrest in The Bahamas, Mr. Ray has given lawmakers and creditors some key insights into the controversial business activities that transpired at what was once the world’s second-largest crypto exchange.</p>



<h2><strong>Unacceptable management practices at FTX</strong></h2>



<p>According to John Ray, FTX had “unacceptable management practices” which ultimately led to its collapse. The current CEO revealed that there was literally no record keeping within the company whatsoever. The man who was brought in to clean up the controversial Enron scandal, testified that he had never seen such an utter lack of record keeping at a company.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The owners, business, and senior management had virtual control of all the accounts and could move money or assets as they desired, undetected by customers.” John Ray stated.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>As for the funds lost due to the poor management that went on with FTX and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-knew-more-about-alameda-research-than-let-on/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alameda Research</a>, Mr. Ray stated that the funds lost were in excess of $7 billion. He added that his team had successfully recovered more than $1 billion of those funds. John Ray has estimated that it will take several months to secure the bankrupt exchange’s assets. The lack of proper financial records will be a major hindrance in this process. “‘I don’t trust a single piece of paper at this organization,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried’s congressional testimony</strong></h2>



<p>The former CEO was also expected to testify before the congressional committee. The testimony was canceled following his arrest by Bahamian authorities last night. However, a transcript of his intended testimony was published by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/?sh=2f1ecc3c3c47" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>&nbsp;earlier today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to SBF’s testimony, “American customers were protected, at least until Mr. Ray’s team took over.” The document further reveals that FTX US had separate order books and funds from the parent company. Sam Bankman-Fried was confident that the customers of the American subsidiary could be made whole immediately since FTX US is still solvent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York filed criminal charges against Sam Bankman-Fried on Tuesday.</li><li>The unseal indictment order detailed eight counts including fraud, conspiracy, and violation of U.S. Campaign Finance Laws.</li><li>Other authorities like the CFTC and SEC filed charges against Bankman-Fried following his arrest by Bahamian law enforcement. </li></ul>



<p>The United States of America charged FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried on eight counts including in the Southern District of New York. United States Attorney Damian Williams previously announced SBF’s arrest in the Bahamas ahead of formal criminal charges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An indictment document unsealed on Tuesday revealed eight charges against SBF built around the operations of crypto exchange FTX, and Alameda research.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Counts Against Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<ul><li>Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud on Customers&nbsp;</li><li>Wire Fraud on Customers&nbsp;</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud on Lenders</li><li>Wire Fraud on Lenders</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Commodities Fraud</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud&nbsp;</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering&nbsp;</li><li>Conspiracy to Defraud the United State of America and Violate the Campaign Finance Laws</li></ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23450344-unsealed-indictment-in-us-v-bankman-fried-22-cr-673-abrams-as-sam-bankman-fried-of-ftx-heads-to-sdny-echoes-of-onecoin-and-un-bribery-cases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">indictment</a> means that Federal prosecutors have evidence that Sam Bankman-Fried used deceived customers and investors alike. U.S. Attorneys filed that SBF used customer funds from the FTX exchange to finance Alameda’s trading position and loan obligations. This means that customer deposits and assets were exposed to substantial losses worth billions. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried notably denied defrauding customers of their crypto assets during several public interviews. SBF also claimed that Alameda had limited access to assets deposited on the FTX exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>U.S. prosecutors filed that Bankman-Fried knowingly comingled funds between FTX deposits and Alameda.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>BANKMAN-FRIED agreed with others to defraud customers of FTX.com by misappropriating those customers’ deposits and using those deposits to pay expenses and debts of Alameda Research, BANKHAN- FRIED&#8217;s proprietary crypto hedge fund, and to make investments.</p></blockquote>



<p>FTX CEO John Ray’s scathing testimony before House Committee on Financial Services <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankruptcy-documents-fraud/">echoed</a> concerns from users and authorities alike that FTX, under SBF’s leadership, funded Alameda with stolen FTX user deposits. SBF was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-testify-senate/">scheduled</a> to testify at the same hearing prior to his arrest.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Authorities Crackdown On Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Southern District of New York (SDNY) have both <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-ftx-customers/">charged </a>Sam Bankman-Fried for the collapse of FTX. Another regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), announced a lawsuit against the former crypto billionaire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF was arrested in the Bahamas on Tuesday. At press time, it’s unclear if or when extradition to American soil will happen.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>SEC vs Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>According to the SECs <a href="https://t.co/w2kZOfN7He" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filing</a>, SBF deceived equity investors of FTX Trading Ltd while also defrauding retail customers as well. The commission noted that Bankman-Fried raised over $1.8 billion from around 90 U.S.-based investors between May 2019 and November 2022. </p>



<p>The SEC said SBF branded himself as a “responsible leader of the crypto community” while “orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud”.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Customers around the world believed his lies, and sent billions of dollars to FTX, believing their assets were secure on the FTX trading platform. But from the start, Bankman-Fried improperly diverted customer assets to his privately-held crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC (“Alameda”), and then used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations.</p></blockquote>



<p>Tuesday’s filing noted that Bankman-Fried continued funding Alameda with FTX customer deposits when his trading giant was unable to meet loan obligations after the crypto crash in May 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SECs filing argued that Alameda was bolstered with FTX customer assets in order to keep up appearances and maintain access to cash injections from investors and lenders. Also, the charges <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankruptcy-documents-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that company assets were used to fund personal loans to SBF and other top FTX executives.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>But Bankman-Fried did not stop there. Even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried continued to misappropriate FTX customer funds. Through the summer of 2022, he directed hundreds of millions more in FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for additional venture investments and for “loans” to himself and other FTX executives.</p></blockquote>



<p>SEC prosecutors further opined that Sam Bankman-Fried remained active in decision-making at Alameda despite appointing Caroline Ellison and Sam Trabucco as joint heads of the company. The allegations threw more doubt on claims from SBF that he had little knowledge of day-to-day operations at Alameda. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Bankman-Fried remained the ultimate decision-maker at Alameda, even after Ellison and Trabucco became co-CEOs in or around October 2021. Bankman-Fried directed investment and operational decisions, frequently communicated with Alameda employees, and had full access to Alameda’s records and databases.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was the first to face charges following FTX’s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankrupt-sam-bankman-fried-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collapse</a> in November 2022. The fallen crypto tycoon was in custody and awaiting possible extradition to the U.S. at press time. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The program will help people from around the world to better understand the crypto industry, how Web3 projects are launched, and the potential of blockchain as a disruptive technology.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Binance takes a step towards customer education</strong></h2>



<p>Binance revealed this program in a blog post, which stated that it will be available to interested students across the world. The program will be taught in English as well as French. It is scheduled to launch in February next year and marks an important step towards customer education and crypto adoption. According to the announcement, it has already been tested on a group of 1000 participants.</p>



<p>This program will last for three months, but students will have the opportunity to learn at their own pace. As per the official website of <a href="https://founderz.com/program/online-master-blockchain-web3" rel="nofollow noopener">Founderz</a>, the program will feature a virtual campus for students to network and attend events. The Online Master in Blockchain and Web3 course is based on a microlearning concept which means that it is suitable for students without a technical background as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program is set to cost €650, but <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/billions-transfered-binance-ftxs-collapse/">Binance</a> users who sign up before the end of the year will get a 50% discount. In a bid to attract potential students, the program will also roll out special edition NFTs for the first 7500 students. These NFTs will be minted over the first 3 months of the program and will grant the holders access to exclusive events and program contents.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The blockchain startup suggested connecting Uniswap V3 to BNB Chain, the second-largest DeFi ecosystem with over a million active user addresses and $5 billion in total value locked.</li><li>0xPlasma Labs argued that deploying on BNB will expand utility and trading on the decentralized exchange beyond Ethereum&#8217;s network. </li></ul>



<p>0xPlasma Labs <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-to-bnb-chain-binance/19734" rel="nofollow noopener">submitted</a> a governance proposal aimed at deploying Uniswap v3 on DeFi’s second-largest blockchain network by trading volume and active users &#8211; BNB Chain. The startup, 0xPlasma Labs, builds tools to complement the crypto decentralized exchange (DEX).</p>



<p>Ilia Maksimenka, the CEO of 0xPlasma  who published the proposal, argued that Uniswp could onboard more than a million active users and an additional $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Ethereum topped the TVL on the DEX with $2.3 billion out of $2.5 billion when this report was written. </p>



<p>DeFiLlama data showed Ethereum Layer 2 protocols Polygon ($26.7 million) and Arbitrum (83.5 million) were the second and third largest by TVL on the DEX. Maksimenka’s plan added that bringing BNB Chain into the fold will earn the respect of decentralized finance solution builders and boost adoption for Uniswap’s NFT platform. </p>



<p>The proposal was in discussion at press time. It’s unclear whether the community will agree with 0xPlasma Labs that Uniswap&#8217;s third iteration or V3 should deploy on BNB Chain.  Notably, the move could intensify competition with Pancakeswap, the leading DEX on Binance&#8217;s blockchain.</p>

<p>BNB Chain was launched in September 2020 by leading crypto exchange Binance. The BNB token initially lived on Ethereum’s network before Binance migrated the coin to its own decentralized network.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Ethereum’s Most Active Smart Contract &#8211; Uniswap V3</h2>



<p>Data from Tokenterminal showed that Uniswap topped other protocols in terms of gas consumption. Gas refers to the fees paid by traders when sending cryptocurrencies. The smart contract code powering the DEX used around $4.4 million in gas fees, making Uniswap the most active smart contract on Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stablecoin Tether USD (USDT) and on-chain solution CoinTool were ranked second and third. Their gas estimates were $3.9 million and $3.7 million respectively at press time. </p>



<p>In other news, the DEX was the center of controversy after an updated privacy policy was announced to the community. Uniswap also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-nft-trading-airdrop-genie/">debuted </a>NFT trading and a $5 million USD Coin (USDC) airdrop for Genie users.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Reuters reported that the U.S. Justice Department remained undecided about charging Binance with fraud and money laundering.</li><li>About a dozen prosecutors reportedly advised actions against the leading crypto exchange, its founder Changpeng Zhao, and other executives at the company.</li><li>Other lawyers proposed delaying any decision till more evidence can be reviewed.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Reuters reported that a “split” between prosecutors in the U.S. Department of Justice impeded a decision on whether criminal charges should be brought against crypto exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors previously <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-probed-anti-money-aundering/">opened</a> investigations into Binance and several executives at the company in 2018, including CZ. Reports said that Zhao and his company were under probe due to suspicions of “unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy, and criminal sanctions violations”.</p>



<p>Around a dozen prosecutors on the case proposed “aggressively moving” against Zhao’s company, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N3321X6" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> on Monday. The U.S. Justice Department was unable to reach a consensus on the matter as other lawyers said more time was needed to review evidence. </p>

</figure>



<p>Furthermore, Reuters claims that lawyers from Gibson Dunn met with Justice Department officials to discuss possible plea deals. Gibson Dunn represents the cryptocurrency exchange as a U.S. law firm. </p>



<h2>Binance Calls Out Reuters</h2>



<p>Friction between Binance and Reuters erupted following a series of reports from the media company that accused CZ’s exchange of violating U.S. sanctions and laundering $10 billion for criminal organizations. Binance said the reports leveraged outdated information and contested the claims.</p>



<p>On Monday, Reuters quoted a company spokesperson who said the crypto exchange had no “into the inner workings of the US Justice Department, nor would it be appropriate for us to comment if we did.”</p>



<p>Shortly after the story broke, Binance called out Reuters for cherry-picking their words in Monday’s report. The company published its full statement on the matter, claiming to have a good relationship with law enforcement and prosecutors. </p>



<p>While the response cites a blog post on a so-called law enforcement team started in 2021, the statement did not address claims of plea talks between CZ&#8217;s company and with the Department of Justice. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reuters has it wrong again. <br><br>Now they&#39;re attacking our incredible law enforcement team. A team that we&#39;re incredibly proud of &#8211; they&#39;ve made crypto more secure for all of us. <br><br>Here’s the full statement we sent the reporter and a blog about our remarkable law enforcement team.</p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1602287184400326656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>Crypto Industry On High Alert</h2>



<p>The news comes on the heels of FUD around CZ’s company in the wake of FTX’s collapse. Users expressed skepticism about the company’s proof-of-reserves and proof-of-liabilities audit which was recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-bitcoin-reserves-collateralized/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-bitcoin-reserves-collateralized/" rel="noreferrer noopener">attested</a> by Mazars.</p>



<p>Indeed, scrutiny of industry players and crypto companies surged after consecutive meltdowns in the crypto markets where entities like BlockFi, Celsius, FTX, Terra, and Three Arrows Capital wiped out billions in retail investments.</p>
