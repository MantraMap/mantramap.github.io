<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum gained 2% to maintain above support</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum has been witnessing whale accumulation at $1,230</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency still lacks a directional bias as sellers remain active</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum (ETH/USD) rose more than 2% on Friday, cementing a position above $1,250 support. The recovery saw ETH trade to a price of nearly $1,300 before falling slightly. However, the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ETH price</u></a> is not at a level we can consider bullish. It is, instead, consolidating at or above the crucial support. Will buyers help further recoveries?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Going by the Santiment data on December 7, big investors are accumulating ETH. The data shows that whales and sharks had accumulated ETH worth $690 million in the previous two days. The accumulation happened as ETH hovered around $1,230. That emphasises that the accumulation could be behind the recent, however small, recovery for ETH.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The whale accumulation underlines that the price at or around $1,250 is becoming very important for ETH. The level has held ETH since July. Even as the FTX saga happened and the price slipped below, ETH recovered quickly to the level. Clearly, long-term buyers should consider this as an important zone for accumulating the cryptocurrency. Still, buyers may struggle with bears at the crucial level as the price lacks momentum.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>ETH lacks the upside but remains stable above the support</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/09/1670613081087-8783ab02-16ea-4bba-9b0d-9c6dda7cf7cd.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="310"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ETH/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">A technical outlook shows bulls firmly holding to the price above $1,250. However, bears are also relentless, as shown by the weak momentum in the price of ETH.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The slight gains recorded in the day take the RSI above the midpoint, suggesting the entry of buyers. The reading is still near the level that equates demand and supply. The MACD remains in the bear territory despite a slightly improved momentum.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What next for ETH?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Buyers have a slight edge over bears for ETH above $1,250. However, bulls are still facing pressure. ETH may continue consolidating until the cryptocurrency gets a catalyst to push above the support. Should&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/buy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buying ETH</u></a> intensify, the next level for the cryptocurrency is at $1,400-$1,450.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Binance has been on a slow decline since touching $315</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency has lacked positive catalysts to take the price higher</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">BNB faces a decline to the $266 support zone&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/what-is-binance-coin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Binance</u></a> (BNB/USD) continues to consolidate but is on a short-term descent after tapping a minor resistance. As of press time, BNB was trading at $289 and looking increasingly bearish. Investors now stare at a possible price bottom at $266.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The decline in BNB comes amid limited fundamentals to support the cryptocurrency. Across the general sector, the market is mixed, with most <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrencies</u></a> consolidating. That underlines that BNB&rsquo;s price action mirrors that of the sector, with investors still reeling from the FTX impacts. While Binance&rsquo;s reassurances of stability have at least supported BNB, the recent slow gains mean investors are cautious.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The trading comes even as a bitter exchange ensues between Binance CEO Changpeng &lsquo;CZ&rsquo; Zhao and former FTX head Sam Bankman-Fried. The exchange on Twitter related to an exit by Binance on investment in FTX back in 2021. Bankman-Fried accused CZ of demanding an extra $75 million kickback. Instead, CZ called SBF a &ldquo;fraudster,&rdquo; looking for someone to blame for the FTX implosion. Of course, the exchange harms an already depleted market confidence as investors are unsure which exchange is next.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>BNB trends lower, with weakening momentum</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/09/1670612752838-459f8f98-fa24-4a6f-a5ad-65f7475e68b2.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="304"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BNBUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BNB/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Technically, BNB is slightly bearish. The RSI is at the midpoint meaning that bulls are muscling equally with the bears. However, the MACD indicator shows that momentum has weakened. Similarly, the MACD and signal line lies in the neutral zone.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Will BNB stay bearish?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">With the limited fundamentals to support&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20BNB%20today,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BNB price</u></a> and the non-ensuing confidence crisis, the token may fall further. The price action supports a decline to the next support at $266.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Buyers are, however, relentless, as shown by the reading on the RSI and MACD. For BNB to maintain the uptrend, the price must recover above $315. However, as it looks, we may have to shelve the ambitions until a further date.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Gnosis blockchain completes The Merge</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">First Ethereum, now Gnosis. Gnosis announced earlier this week that it has&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/the-gnosis-merge-schedules-for-today-as-the-blockchain-migrates-to-proof-of-stake/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>migrated to a Proof of Stake</u></a> (PoS) protocol from its previous Proof of Authority (PoA), completing The Merge.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The migration had seen the number of validators on the Gnosis blockchain increase to over 100k from the previous 20 it had when it maintained its PoA protocol. The migration is expected to boost decentralisation and security of the Gnosis blockchain.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Coinbase expects 2022 revenue to decline by 50% or more</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, revealed earlier this week that the cryptocurrency exchange is expecting its 2022 revenue to&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinbase-fy2022-revenue-to-be-less-than-half-of-fy2021-revenue-says-brian-armstrong/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decline by 50% or more</u></a> from what it generated last year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the CEO, the bear market has affected its operations, with most coins down by 70% from their all-time highs. The recent events, including the FTX collapse, have also affected the confidence in the market. However, Armstrong said he would continue to advocate for the crypto industry in Washington DC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase also&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinbase-asks-users-to-switch-usdt-for-the-reputable-usdc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asked its users</u></a> to switch USDT stablecoins for the more &lsquo;reputable&rsquo; USDC. USDC is issued by Circle, the company co-founded by Coinbase. The crypto exchange said USDC is more truCelsius ordered to return crypto worth $44M to customerssted and reliable, and its users should start using the stablecoin ahead of the USDT issued by Tether.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, Circle, the issuer of USDC, officially announced that it had&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/circle-plan-to-go-public-is-cancelled-what-does-it-mean-for-stablecoin-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cancelled plans to go public</u></a>. The company was expected to go public with a $9 billion valuation, but recent market events forced it to cancel its plans.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Celsius ordered to return crypto worth $44M to customers</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius has been&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-lender-celsius-ordered-to-return-crypto-worth-44m-to-customers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ordered to return</u></a>&nbsp;$44 million worth of cryptocurrencies to its customers. United States Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn said he wants creditors to recover as much as they possibly can as soon as they possibly can.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Celsius owes billions to its creditors, and the $44 million approved applies to pure custody assets. These are assets that haven&rsquo;t been used in the Celsius Earn accounts but were present in the custody program.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>PayPal begins crypto operations in Luxembourg</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Payment platform PayPal revealed earlier this week that it is&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/paypal-expands-cryptocurrencies-operations-to-luxembourg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expanding its cryptocurrency operations</u></a> to capture Luxembourg. The company said its crypto services would soon be available in the European country, allowing citizens to buy, sell, and hold various crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">PayPal added that it is currently working with Luxembourg&rsquo;s regulators and policymakers to create a policy that is excellent for the investors, PayPal, and the country.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Ethereum&rsquo;s Shanghai hard fork to take place in March 2023</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">&Eacute;thereum core developers have set March 2023 as the date for the network&rsquo;s Shanghai hard fork. The hard fork is a crucial one for the Ethereum community as it would allow users to withdraw their staked Ether tokens on the network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Coinbase has encouraged customers to dump Tether for USD Coin by waiving fees</li>
<li>Binance had delisted USDC pairs last September to push its own stablecoin, BUSD</li>
<li>The war between the centralised stablecoins deepens</li>
<li>DAI holds the torch for decentralisation but faces uphill battle for relevancy as model seems unscalable</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The stablecoin war is heating up.</p>
<p>Coinbase, who co-founded the USDC stablecoin, are the latest to go on the offensive. It posted a blog post encouraging its users to swap their USDT over to USDC.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The events of the past few weeks have put some stablecoins to the test, and we&rsquo;ve seen a flight to safety.&nbsp;</em><em>We believe that USD Coin (USDC) is a trusted and reputable stablecoin, so we&rsquo;re making it more frictionless to switch: starting today, we&rsquo;re waiving fees for global retail customers to convert USDT to USDC.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I have wondered for a while why Coinbase has not gone on the offensive more and used its exchange to push holders into USDC. Of course, the cynic will say that this decision by Coinbase is to jack up the USDC holdings to reap extra revenue, as these have become a massive earner for the company given the interest rate on T-bills is now 4%.</p>
<p>That makes sense, and that is exactly what it is. But even still, such is the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/im-sick-of-talking-about-tether-but-heres-an-article-about-tether/">constant anxiety around Tether</a>, it may also be a good thing for the ecosystem at large. The best scenario &ndash; as far-fetched as it may seem &ndash; is for Tether&rsquo;s market cap to benevolently trickle down to zero.</p>
<p>Whether Tether is good for it or not, the constant conversation on the topic is negative for the entire industry.</p>
<h2><strong>Binance kicked the stablecoin war up a notch</strong></h2>
<p>Of the five big stablecoins, there has been some serious movement this year.</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12116552">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p>Obviously, TerraUSD is the big one, its <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/luna-why-i-sold-my-ust-for-95-cents-on-the-dollar-today/">shocking crash</a> rocking the market. Since then, the decentralised torch has been passed to DAI. But that is beset by its own problems, coming under criticism for being centralised in nature, given its large holdings of USDC.</p>
<p>This led to it voting to move into T-bills, while the latest plan is for it to &ldquo;free float&rdquo;, as there is no other alternative if they want to pursue decentralisation. I&rsquo;ve been vocal in the past of my thoughts on DAI, and they haven&rsquo;t changed: I believe it has no future, as the model simply is not scalable.</p>
<p>Oh, and a stablecoin that free floats is also not a stablecoin, by the way.</p>
<p>Regarding the centralised stables, it was Binance that kicked up this stablecoin war a notch when it announced in September that it was delisting USDC pairs and auto-converting customer holdings into BUSD.</p>
<p>If we plot the market share of the stables since August, we can see that USDT and USDC have pared back significantly, while BUSD has come up.</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12116745">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2>
<p>The above chart shows quite how dominant the top three providers are, with DAI now having a market cap of $5.2 billion, a mere drop in the ocean.</p>
<p>While this presents as a concerning amount of centralisation, the reality is that nobody has cracked the code on how to create a decentralised stablecoin. So like it or loathe it, it&rsquo;s centralisation going forward.</p>
<p>The question now is who wins out between the titans up top. This move by Coinbase is a notable one, as Binance had been making serious gains in the wake of their auto-convert announcement. But Binance still list USDT, as the most controversial stablecoin remains the most entrenched, absolutely vital to the entire ecosystem and the biggest liquidity pair by far.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that is a good thing, so in the eyes of the market, it&rsquo;s nice seeing USDC make a move here.</p>
<p>The market share will be interesting to track again in a few months time. Hey, maybe we will all be <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/chinas-national-cryptocurrency-is-getting-more-ominous/">using CBDCs</a> before long, anyway.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies were still in a somber mood this week.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">FTX Token rose by more than 30% despite SBF legal woes.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Fetch.ai token surged after a staking announcement by Binance US.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/"><u>Cryptocurrency prices</u></a> remained in a tight range this week as investors focused on macro issues in the United States. Data published last week revealed that the American economy added 284k jobs in November while the unemployment rate remained at 3.7%. Therefore, investors believe that the Fed will leave rates at an elevated level for longer than expected. Here are the top crypto predictions for this weekend.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">FTX Token (FTT)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">FTX Token token price soared by more than 31% in the past 24 hours, according to data compiled by&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/"><u>Binance</u></a>. It still remains near its all-time low as Sam Bankman remains in legal limbo. As we wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-to-file-for-bankruptcy-as-metacade-mcade-is-set-to-skyrocket-in-presale/"><u>here</u></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>American authorities are investigating him on a myriad of crimes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In recent interviews, Bankman has hinted that FTX and Alameda Research did indeed comingle customer funds, which is a crime. Therefore, there is a likelihood that he, and other FTX and Alameda officials will be locked up for a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The hourly chart shows that the FTT price went parabolic on Friday. As it rose, it managed to rise above the important resistance at $1.538. It also moved above the 25-day moving average. Still, I believe that this rally is a dead cat bounce, which will see it retreat in the coming days.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">How to buy FTX Token</h2>
<p dir="ltr"></p><h3>
    Bitstamp</h3>

    <p>Bitstamp is a leading cryptocurrency exchange which offers trading in fiat currencies or popular cryptocurrencies.

Bitstamp is a fully regulated company which offers users an intuitive interface, a high degree of security for your digital assets, excellent customer support and multiple withdrawal methods.</p>

<p>
    <a href="/visit/bitstamp-crypto?guid=OTY5NzI&amp;component=simple-table&amp;language=en&amp;country=US&amp;state=VA&amp;position=1&amp;totalPositions=2" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored">
                    Buy FTT with Bitstamp today            </a>
    </p><h3>
    Binance</h3>

    <p>Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. It is better suited to more experienced investors and it offers a large number of cryptocurrencies to choose from, at over 600.

Binance is also known for having low trading fees and a multiple of trading options that its users can benefit from, such as; peer-to-peer trading, margin trading and spot trading.

                    Buy FTT with Binance today            </a>
    </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Fetch.ai (FET)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Fetch.ai price was among the best-performing tokens this week. It rose to a high of $0.1290 after Binance US enabled staking. Historically, cryptocurrencies tend to rally after being offered by a major exchange like Binance or Coinbase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the hourly chart, we see that the FET price went parabolic this week. Recently, however, it has scaled back and dropped by double-digits from its highest point. It has moved above the moving averages.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, Fetch.ai price will likely resume the bearish trend as the staking mometum wanes. If this happens, it will likely drop below the important support at $0.100.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Crypto exchange Coinbase wants its users to switch their USDT for USDC.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The company calls USDC the trusted and reputable stablecoin.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase is a co-founder of Circle, the company that issues the USDC stablecoin.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Coinbase wants users to adopt USDC</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase, one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, has urged its users to swap their USDT stablecoin for USDC. USDT is the leading stablecoin in the world (with a $65 billion market cap) and is issued by Tether.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, USDC is the stablecoin issued by Circle, a company that Coinbase helped founded. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/switch-to-the-trusted-and-reputable-digital-dollar-usdc"><u>blog post</u></a> on December 8th, Coinbase said USDC is the more trusted and reputable stablecoin. Coinbase wrote,</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;We co-founded USDC in 2018 with the vision of creating a more open, global financial system. USDC is unique in that it&rsquo;s 100% backed by cash and short-dated U.S. treasuries held in U.S.regulated financial institutions. It&rsquo;s always redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars. Customers are calling for transparency, and USDC delivers via monthly attestations by Grant Thornton LLP, one of America&rsquo;s largest audit, tax, and advisory firms. Plus, eligible customers globally&sup2; earn up to 1.5% APY&sup3; on their USDC holdings with Coinbase.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Recent events prompted Coinbase to favour USDC</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase explained that events of the past few weeks prompted it to ask its users to switch to USSC. On-chain data indicated that USDT briefly lost its peg against the US Dollars following&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/this-week-in-crypto-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the FTX collapse</u></a>. Coinbase wrote that;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;However, the events of the past few weeks have put some stablecoins to the test, and we&rsquo;ve seen a flight to safety. We believe that USD Coin (USDC) is a trusted and reputable stablecoin, so we&rsquo;re making it more frictionless to switch: starting today, we&rsquo;re waiving fees for global retail customers to convert USDT to USDC.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Although USDT remains the leading stablecoin in the cryptocurrency space, it has encountered numerous controversies over the years. There were claims that Tether&rsquo;s USDT stablecoins were not fully backed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In September, the stablecoin issuer was ordered by a U.S. judge in New York to produce financial records associated with the backing of USDT. In 2020, the New York Attorney General&rsquo;s office&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/new-york-ag-asks-bitfinex-and-tether-to-stop-further-delays/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filed a lawsuit</u></a> to get Tether to release documents regarding its finances.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">This article outlines the eight of the best staking cryptos to buy that strike a great balance between decent rewards and long-term fundamentals. </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">1. Metacade (MCADE) &ndash; The Best Staking Crypto to Buy</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is a community hub built for the future of Web3 and Play2Earn gaming.

In the Metacade, you&rsquo;ll find chat rooms, leaderboards, reviews, and the hottest alpha from industry experts that can help you get ahead in the world of Play2Earn gaming.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Whenever you post a review, offer up some tips, or produce other useful content for the Metacade community, you&rsquo;re rewarded with the MCADE token. There are also regular prize draws and tournaments where you&rsquo;ll go head-to-head against other community members for your chance to win a big cash prize! If you&rsquo;re a gamer who loves to play the latest titles before everyone else, then you&rsquo;ll also be able to earn as a tester for Metacade&rsquo;s developer community by using the platform&rsquo;s native testing environment to offer direct feedback on games in development. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Staking your MCADE tokens means you can win rewards from the project, which are paid in stablecoins to avoid inflating the number of MCADE tokens in circulation. Even if you&rsquo;re not one for staking, you can still use your MCADE tokens to vote on the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE holders can vote on game proposals to decide which games are developed next on the platform. The game developer whose proposal achieves the most votes will be awarded a Metagrant, a source of funding, to support the development of the game. Once the title is ready for launch, Metacade will add it to its virtual arcade for everyone to enjoy. Eventually, Metacade plans to host dozens of the very best Play2Earn games in its arcade, as voted for and backed by the community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With all of these incredible features in mind, Metacade is set to dominate the budding GameFi industry by offering a buzzing community space at the forefront of the gaming revolution. Combined with attractive staking rewards and plenty of utility for MCADE holders, it&rsquo;s the top pick as the best staking crypto to buy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; You can participate in the Metacade presale&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">2. Polkadot (DOT)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://polkadot.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Polkadot</u></a> is a solution to the issue of interoperability across different blockchains. It effectively allows two separate chains, like Ethereum and Solana, for example, to communicate with one another and uses parachains (parallel blockchains) to ensure fast and scalable transaction speeds. Its native token, DOT, is used as a governance token and to validate transactions using the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As such, DOT can be staked to realise rewards. By running a validator node, you&rsquo;ll achieve 14.9% returns per year, but you&rsquo;ll also need to lock up 350 DOT, or around $1800 in late November 2022. Alternatively, you can become a delegator, which returns 13.98% per year and requires locking up 80 DOT (approx. $415). The best way to stake DOT is on Binance, which returns 20.98% APR over a 120-day lockup with a limit of 20 DOT available to be staked.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Considering DOT&rsquo;s status as the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap and the unique solution the Polkadot network offers, it&rsquo;s the second best staking crypto to buy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">3. Cosmos (ATOM)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cosmos.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cosmos</u></a> is a chain similar to Polkadot. It&rsquo;s an interoperability solution that aims to create an &ldquo;internet of blockchains&rdquo; by allowing users to develop custom-built blockchains that can communicate with one another. This allows them to share data and perform transactions quickly and cheaply using the ATOM token. Like Polkadot, Cosmos uses a PoS consensus, meaning that holders of ATOM can stake their tokens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cosmos offers the highest rewards out of the top thirty tokens by market cap, with delegators earning 19.03% APR with no minimum lockup amount. You can boost these earnings on Binance, which offers 32.9% APR when you stake up to 5 ATOM tokens for 120 days. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">When accounting for its status in the interoperability space and as a token that&rsquo;s performed exceptionally well during the recent bear market, ATOM&rsquo;s rewards are some of the best on the market. For that reason, it&rsquo;s the third best staking crypto to buy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">4. Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The world&rsquo;s most valuable smart contract platform,&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ethereum</u></a>, recently upgraded its network to run on proof-of-stake, as opposed to its former proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The upgrade was carried out to improve scalability, security, and environmental output, with the PoS system promising to drastically boost transaction speeds and reduce fees. This system enables holders of ETH to now stake their tokens and validate transactions on the network instead of setting up a costly mining rig.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, you can earn 6.24% a year by running an Ethereum validator node or 5.11% using a staking pool. However, you will need 32 ETH to stake with either of these methods, which is around $35,400 at today&rsquo;s price of $1100. You can stake on Binance at up to 5.2% APR with no minimum amount, but you will need to lock up your tokens for at least six months until Ethereum&rsquo;s Shanghai upgrade is complete.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s still one of the most stable and promising tokens on this list despite these high requirements, so it&rsquo;s the fourth best staking crypto to buy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">5. Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://solana.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Solana</u></a> is a smart contract platform that was developed to address the issues of scalability and speed that affected the Ethereum network at the time. Solana offers blazing-fast speeds of around 3500 transactions per second (TPS) compared to Ethereum&rsquo;s ~30 TPS (<a href="https://ethtps.info/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ethtps.info</u></a>), with a theoretical maximum of 710,000 TPS on a standard gigabit network, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.solana.com/introduction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Solana&rsquo;s documentation</u></a>. This still beats the expected maximum after the Ethereum upgrade, which should stand at around 100,000 TPS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Solana offers 7.79% APR as a validator, with just 1 SOL (~$11 today) needed to operate a node, with a minimum lockup of five days. Becoming a delegator is easier and offers 7.04% APR, with the same minimum lockup amount and period as a validator. However, probably the easiest and best way to stake your SOL is through Binance, which offers 16.9% APR when staking up to 5 SOL for 120 days.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With low barriers to entry, competitive staking rewards, and a valuable use case, Solana is the fifth choice as one of the best staking cryptos to buy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">6. Binance Coin (BNB)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.binance.com/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Binance Coin</u></a> is the native token of the Binance exchange. It was initially used as a trading discount fee token, but has since progressed to power the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a smart contract platform that is used as an alternative to Ethereum. Since its launch in 2020, BSC has grown to become one of largest smart contract platforms in the crypto market, powering over 4,300 decentralised apps (dApps), according to&nbsp;<a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/binance-smart-chain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DappRadar</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While running a validator node is out of the picture unless you have $3 million lying around, you can become a BNB delegator by locking up 1 BNB, or around $250 in November 2022. This will return you 4.09% yearly with a minimum lockup period of just seven days. On the Binance platform, you can stake up to 0.5 BNB for 120 days to earn 6.2% APR.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given that BNB has remained as one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies and is likely to outperform in the coming bull market, it&rsquo;s the sixth best staking crypto to buy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">7. NEAR Protocol (NEAR)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://near.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>NEAR</u></a> is a smart contract protocol that uses sharding to produce incredibly fast transaction speeds at virtually no cost. It uses sharding (breaking data into more manageable pieces) to achieve this, creating a much more efficient and scalable smart contract solution. NEAR Protocol is what&rsquo;s known as a layer 1 solution, meaning that it&rsquo;s built for other developers to build from the foundation it provides. Once development is complete, NEAR is expected to be able to handle up to 100,000 TPS &ndash; a potent rival to Ethereum and Solana.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like Ethereum and Solana, NEAR uses PoS. However, NEAR offers much better staking rewards than either of these tokens, returning 10.05% per year as a delegator with a one-day minimum lockup period. You can become a validator to realise a 10.83% APR, but it&rsquo;s much easier to become a delegator. Binance offers the best staking rewards out of all major crypto exchanges, returning 30.49% APR with a maximum staking allowance of 20 NEAR.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While its use might not be as widespread as other layer 1 solutions, NEAR is a serious contender in this space and could soon creep into the top ten most valuable projects. Factoring in its excellent staking rewards, NEAR Protocol is a great choice as the seventh best staking crypto to buy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">8. Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://polygon.technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Polygon</u></a> is a layer 2 solution that works with the Ethereum blockchain to achieve faster transaction speeds and lower fees. It&rsquo;s essentially a parallel blockchain running alongside the main Ethereum chain, and has provided a solution for developers looking to use Ethereum&rsquo;s framework without facing significant congestion and high fees. Even after the Ethereum upgrade, Polygon will still provide critical infrastructure to developers looking for more flexibility in their products as one of the most advanced layer 2 solutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By becoming a MATIC delegator, you can earn 5.9% APR with a minimum lockup of 21 days and no minimum token requirement. You could become a validator for 6.37% APR, but according to <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/matic-network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Staking Rewards</u></a>, this is ranked as &ldquo;very hard.&rdquo; You can stake up to 250 MATIC ($195) for 90 days on Binance for a 13.9% APR, which will likely be your best bet if you&rsquo;re just beginning your staking journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">MATIC, like ATOM, has performed excellently in the recent bear market. Combined with its status as the best layer 2 solution and attractive staking rewards, Polygon is the eighth best staking crypto to buy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade (MCADE) Is Our Top Choice</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Staking has the power to boost your passive returns from crypto investing, or at the very least, mitigate some losses you might face. Of course, you should only stake projects that you believe have long-term potential. Otherwise, you expose yourself to the risk that the token depreciates more than your annual returns. In our opinion, the token with the greatest upside potential and the least downside is Metacade.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is positioning itself as a leader in one of the fastest-growing industries on the planet: GameFi. The GameFi industry is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 100% between now and 2025 (<a href="https://content-hub-static.crypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GameFi_Past-Present-and-Future_Overview-with-Comparisons-to-Traditional-Gaming-Industry-2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Crypto.com</u></a>), and Metacade will be there as the industry&rsquo;s number one community hub that makes it all possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to get in on Metacade before it explodes, there&rsquo;s no better moment than right now. The MCADE token is still in presale, and the sooner you buy, the greater your long-term returns. For example, in presale phase 1, you could get 125 MCADE for just $1. In presale phase 9, you&rsquo;ll get just 50 MCADE for $1. If you want to be one of the earliest investors in the GameFi revolution, then you should start seriously considering the Metacade presale as one of the best investment opportunities in this space.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Stifel&rsquo;s CEO believes that rules are necessary to boost innovation within the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrency companies need to build trust with their users.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Customer protection should be at the heart of every cryptocurrency company.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Trust is needed in the cryptocurrency space</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Ron Kruszewski, the chairman and CEO of Stifel,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/stifel-ceo-tells-crypto-industry-make-us-trust-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told PYMNTS</u></a> in a recent interview that trust is needed within the cryptocurrency space. He made this comment while talking about the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/this-week-in-crypto-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>collapse of the FTX crypto exchange</u></a>. He stated that</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Look, if I were running a crypto fund. I would be sitting in front of you saying we need to assure our customers that putting money in crypto is really no different than putting money in a bank, and that we welcome the regulation &mdash; how can you have a payment system if you don&rsquo;t trust that your money will get where it&rsquo;s meant to be going?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Kruszewski added that cryptocurrency entrepreneurs need to ensure that people have confidence and trust in what they are building. He added that</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask [these companies] the tough questions. These are the people building the ecosystem, they need to make sure everyone has confidence in it. I&rsquo;d really like to see that.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Regulation will promote innovation in the crypto industry</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Kruszewski believes that regulation is important for innovation to continue in the cryptocurrency market. He told PYMNTS that;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;What I find amazing in all this is that I&rsquo;ve yet to see crypto leaders go out and say &lsquo;we segregate our clients&rsquo; funds and our clients&rsquo; securities.&rsquo; Until they can say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to that, the industry will not move forward. &ldquo;Until we put rules [in place], we will not encourage good innovation. You can&rsquo;t really have destructive technology in the financial system. The U.S. has the most sophisticated, deep and fair markets in the world because we put good rules and regulations in place, and we need to do that for crypto &mdash; and then crypto can flourish and [consumers can] enjoy its true business applications versus where it stands now, unregulated, just a casino.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Stifel CEO added that consumer protection should be an important factor to consider when building cryptocurrency products.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;The concept of the customer protection role at its heart means you will not co-mingle your customer funds, and importantly you will also have what we call possession and control &mdash; if you give me your money or securities, I will know where they are and know that they are yours,&rdquo; Kruszewski told PYMNTS&rsquo; Karen Webster. &ldquo;It should be clear the SEC has the jurisdiction to protect U.S. investors.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Several CEOs in the crypto space have commented about the FTX fiasco. Earlier this week, Coinbase&rsquo;s Brian Armstrong&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinbase-fy2022-revenue-to-be-less-than-half-of-fy2021-revenue-says-brian-armstrong/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called the FTX collapse a massive fraud</u></a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Crypto markets were shaken to the core by the recent news that the world&rsquo;s second-largest crypto exchange <a href="https://ftx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>FTX</u></a> was to file for bankruptcy in US courts. An $8 billion black hole was discovered in FTX&rsquo;s balance sheet after dozens of customers withdrew their funds, and a potential takeover from arch-rival Binance fell through, leaving founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried no option but to apply for bankruptcy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite this latest blow to hit the markets, Metacade looks set to hold its value and skyrocket during its presale.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What is Metacade?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is the first community-led gaming arcade to appear on Web 3.0. It&rsquo;s a place where gaming enthusiasts can gather and hang out while playing the latest play-to-earn (P2E) titles. It plans to become the leading GameFi platform in the metaverse, offering something for investors, gamers and developers alike.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The entire ecosystem is underpinned by the MCADE coin, which can be spent, staked, and earned within the platform. As well as the P2E side of the gaming experience, users can contribute to the community in several other ways, earning rewards as they go. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Knowledge sharing in the social space</li>
<li dir="ltr">Backtesting games</li>
<li dir="ltr">Providing feedback to developers</li>
<li dir="ltr">Writing game reviews</li>
<li dir="ltr">Regular prize draws</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The overarching aim of Metacade is to produce a fully autonomous and community-owned space in which the members have complete control over platform decisions while offering one of the most in-depth range of titles in the Web 3.0 GameFi space that will keep users coming back again and again.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Why is Metacade different?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Several aspects of Metacade&rsquo;s roadmap, which can be viewed on its <a href="https://metacade.co/whitepaper.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>white paper</u></a>, set it apart from its GameFi competitors. The most obvious is the vast catalogue of titles that will continually evolve as developers create new titles. Unlike other gaming platforms, Metacade isn&rsquo;t reliant on one or a limited number of titles to maintain members&rsquo; interests.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade has not accepted funding from venture capitalists in an attempt to bring on board only those with a genuine interest in gaming. Further, the MCADE presale is open to all, so when MCADE enters the market, its community members stand to benefit the most from an upturn in value.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This not only puts the power of gaming back in the hands of those who care most about video games, but the unique and self-sufficient economy will also see MCADE tokens given back to its users through in-game rewards, competitions, prize draws, staking, and community engagement. Additional revenue will be drawn into the game through advertising, a pay-to-play arcade, and job listings.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This community approach is at the centre of every part of Metacade&rsquo;s roadmap. It&rsquo;s a hub where developers can turn their ideas into reality and gain community-approved funding through Metagrants, voted for by members and distributed by the platform. In addition, those looking to build a career in the GameFi space can apply for a range of vacancies with some of the biggest Web 3.0 industry.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Why MCADE is Set to Skyrocket</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Although the crash of FTX has created significant unease among investors and markets, particularly given the levels of liquidity and market cap value lost,<strong>&nbsp;those cryptocurrencies yet to be listed on an exchange</strong> have been insulated from the worst of the crash&rsquo;s impact.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This, along with the platform&rsquo;s clear potential for longevity is a rarity in the metaverse world in that it is a platform where users can accomplish many of the things they would like to do in Web 3.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, once the presale is complete,&nbsp;<strong>the market cap will likely be around $28 million</strong>. This makes it far smaller than competitors, such as The Sandbox and Decentraland, which achieved peaks of more than $5 billion. This illustrates how much potential the MCADE token has to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Buy MCADE in Presale</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Early investors in MCADE will end the presale, having made a return on their money if they choose to sell. During the presale&rsquo;s opening round with investors able to get 125 MCADE for $1. Its nine rounds sees the value increase to a final value of 50 MCADE for each $1 invested. This already makes it an appealing prospect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the rich potential of the platform and the exceptionality tightly knit thoughout its route to market gives Metacade a feeling of being undervalued &ndash; even when taking into account the market instability caused by FTX&rsquo;s crash. All of this means that Metacade could well be the bargain investment of the year.</p>
