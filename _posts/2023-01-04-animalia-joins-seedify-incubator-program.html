<p class="s4">Kuala Lumpur, 4 January 2023 - With the recent Crown Staking Launch in November 2022 and the planned release of Alpha Test in December 2022, Animalia is now part of the Seedify Incubation Program, to strengthen key aspects of the business. </p>
<p class="s4">&ldquo;Animalia has a strong, talented, experienced team with a proven track record in the gaming industry. This strategy-based cryptocurrency card game with unique NFT characters offers players a novel and engaging experience, focusing on environmental conservation and entertainment. Additionally, Animalia offers a highly strategic game mechanic that engages players with absolute precision, focus, and entertainment.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s4">Seedify is dedicated to supporting and nurturing innovative startups and presenting quality projects to its community, making Animalia a perfect partner for Seedify&rsquo;s incubation program.&rdquo; Levent Cem Aydan, CEO and Founder of Seedify said. </p>

<p class="s4">&ldquo;Animalia is here to stay, as a GameFi project that always puts our community first. We are excited and proud of our development so far, from launching the NFTitan Crown Staking feature to the release of Alpha Test this month. This incubation program will &nbsp;enable both teams with a diversified roster of experts from a variety of fields to work together, to foster a growth-friendly environment during this crypto winter .&rdquo; Eddy Lim, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Animalia said.</p>

<p class="s4">With the incubation initiative, both Animalia and Seedify are expecting further growth when it comes to business, network, and community expansion in months to come. </p>
<p class="s4">Animalia is an independent free-to-play online NFT trading card game featuring crypto-inspired meme creatures and gemstones. The launch of Crown Staking and Alpha build release are the latest milestones in Animalia&rsquo;s roadmap. In 2023, the community can look forward to further development for Closed Beta Release and expansion of Animalia&rsquo;s NFT collection with support from Seedify. </p>
<p class="s8">Crown Staking is the first staking feature integrated with the game, enabling a true in-game Play and Earn experience. Collectors will need to own at least one NFTitan to activate this feature. The NFTitans are a collection released by Animalia earlier this year that comes with powerful in-game utilities. </p>
