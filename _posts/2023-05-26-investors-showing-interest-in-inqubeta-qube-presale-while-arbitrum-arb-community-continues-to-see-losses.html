<p>Investors are increasingly showing interest in the InQubeta (QUBE) presale, while Arbitrum(ARB) holders continue to see the value of their holdings drop. Presales and initial coin offerings (ICO) are known to excite investors, but InQubeta&rsquo;s presale is generating unprecedented interest as investors look to capitalize on a barrier-free opportunity to purchase equity in promising Artificial Intelligence (AI) startups.</p>
<p>AI is one of the fastest-growing technology fields, with total investments in the industry rising by over $80 billion from 2015 to 2021. That&rsquo;s a clear indicator that many traditional investors expect AI to be a significant part of everyday life in the future.</p>
<p>Many AI-powered devices that were once nothing more than a fantasy of novelists are now a common reality. AI-powered devices now clean floors in many homes, while some vehicle manufacturers have added self-driving features to their products. All this has occurred while AI technology still remains in its infancy.</p>
<p class="s8">InQubeta keeps trending upwards while other altcoins like Arbitrum lose value</p>
<p>InQubeta&rsquo;s unique platform deserves credit for the growth enjoyed during its presale. It allows anyone, to invest in AI startups without a need for Silicon Valley connections or other barriers associated with mainstream investment firms. The platform also makes it easier for AI startups to secure the funding needed for their projects.</p>
<p>Startups raise capital on InQubeta&rsquo;s platform by creating ERC20 QUBE tokens. These are fractionalized, deflationary non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent equity and other rewards in their companies. These tokens are then listed on the InQubeta marketplace where investors find and research startups with potential to invest in.</p>
<p>Investors purchase fractionalized QUBE tokens of startups they link with $QUBE tokens, the platform's native currency. This gives them equity in the company and other rewards like profit-sharing in some cases.</p>
<p>InQubeta&rsquo;s platform has deflationary protocols that help to push prices upwards. Buy and sell transactions with QUBE tokens are taxed at a 2% rate. The taxes generated are sent to a burn wallet to reduce the total number of available coins. The tax rate is 5% for $QUBE transactions, and it&rsquo;s used to fund a dedicated reward pool for investors who stake their coins.</p>
<p>InQubeta (QUBE) also allows investors to be part of the platform's governance, with the size of each investor&rsquo;s holdings deciding the authority of their voice. Investors can propose, discuss, and vote on ideas that affect the platform's protocols and future.</p>

<p class="s8">Arbitrum (ARB) release hasn&rsquo;t gone as planned</p>
<p>Arbitrum is built around the Ethereum (ETH) network &ndash; the second most popular cryptocurrency worldwide. ETH &nbsp;has lots of things going on for it like supporting smart contracts. However, Ethereum transaction fees have gotten outrageously high as its value grows.</p>
<p>Arbitrum has created a third-party solution for Ethereum&rsquo;s problems by building its platform on Ethereum&rsquo;s blockchain to speed up transactions and lower fees. It&rsquo;s emerged as a popular place for ETH holders to complete transactions.</p>
<p>Arbitrum released its new ARB governance token in March 2023, but the token hasn&rsquo;t seen significant growth since. Instead, prices have dropped by over 50% since setting an all-time high of $1.77 in April. Altcoins like Arbitrum have struggled to grow since the start of the InQubetapresale as investors can&rsquo;t resist the urge to be part of the AI revolution going on. Artificial intelligence has the potential to surpass the internet regarding its effects on how the world works, leading to a steady flow of investment capital into the industry and services that help its growth.</p>
<p class="s8">Summary</p>
<p>Many cryptocurrencies are predicted to experience significant growth this year, but Arbitrummight not be one of them despite making Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper. Other promising altcoins like InQubeta are drawing significant investments, keeping investments in coins like ARB low for now.</p>
