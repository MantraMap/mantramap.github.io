			            <description><![CDATA[An official from Shiba Inu's team has shared a stark warning prior to the much-anticipated announcement today.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The community is eagerly anticipating today&#8217;s announcement, and many seem to believe that it will be related to the up-and-coming layer 2 scaling solution developed by Shiba Inu &#8211; Shibarium.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meanwhile, Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing strategist took it to X to warn users of potential fraudulent actors, outlining one of the popular attack vectors.</li>
<li>Lucie emphasized that Shibarium is open for anyone to build on, akin to Polygon, Ethereum, and other blockchains. Herein lies the issue.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Regrettably, this also provides an avenue for bad actors to develop scam dApps and rug-pull tokens, among other things.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The official stressed that the incorporation of terms like &#8220;Shib&#8221; and &#8220;Shibarium&#8221; in the names of such projects holds no credibility, <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1691784869628555764" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">urging</a> users to prioritize their safety.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Prioritize research: delve into their Telegram and Discord channels, gauge the community&#8217;s atmosphere, scrutinize their social media posts, and check Etherscan.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The warning comes at a critical moment because the community is eagerly anticipating a major announcement today during the conference in Toronto.</li>
<li>Many believe Shytoshi Kusama will reveal the launch of the much-anticipated Shibarium, but just as many are skeptical of it.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase will be able to offer futures contracts in BTC and ETH to eligible customers in the US.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase Global announced securing regulatory approval to enable retail customers in the United States to trade crypto futures.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the National Futures Association, which happens to be a CFTC-designated SRO, has greenlighted Coinbase Financial Markets as a registered Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). The approval comes almost two years after the initial application was submitted.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Obtains Futures Commission Merchant Approval</h2>
<p>The regulatory clearance makes Coinbase the first in the industry to directly offer traditional spot crypto trading alongside regulated and leveraged crypto futures on an integrated trading solution for its verified customers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, we are pleased to announce that approval has been secured, which will allow eligible US customers to access regulated derivatives products through Coinbase Financial Markets and alongside our spot market for a seamless experience subject to the oversight of the CFTC and the NFA.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the NFA functions as a self-regulatory entity. The San Francisco-based crypto exchange filed to become a member of the National Futures Association and register as an FCM back in September 2021.</p>
<p>While embroiled in a legal dispute with the SEC, Coinbase has <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-financial-markets-inc-secures-fcm-approval-to-bring-regulated" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">characterized</a> the approval as a &#8220;significant milestone.&#8221; The company said it views this development as a notable step towards establishing federal regulatory supervision within the crypto markets, a move aimed at safeguarding consumers and maintaining the United States as a hub for digital innovation.</p>
<h2>Expansion and More</h2>
<p>With mounting regulatory uncertainties back home, Coinbase is intensifying its expansion strategy across the North American market. Earlier this week, the firm <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-continues-its-global-expansion-by-entering-the-canadian-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> officially launching operations in Canada, as part of which, the crypto exchange introduced Coinbase One to local users &#8211; a 30-day trial offering zero trading fees and priority support.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s recent expansions in the region also include the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-officially-launches-platform-for-non-us-institutional-investors-in-bermuda-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">launch</a> of a platform in Bermuda that serves non-US institutional clients.</p>
<p>The company public <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbases-base-notches-4th-rank-in-daily-tps-among-layer-2-solutions-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> its Base mainnet recently, which witnessed significant user activity in a span of less than a week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its CEO, Brian Armstrong, had previously <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-is-exploring-best-way-to-integrate-bitcoin-lightning-network-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> exploring the best possible way to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN) scaling solution.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The spotlight in the crypto market is firmly on Shiba Inu, with investors expecting strong volatility in light of the imminent Shibarium launch. So far, $SHIB has disappointed the bulls as it has plummeted 3% over the past day.</p>
<p>The past week’s meme coin rally has come to an absolute halt as other top tokens like Dogecoin, Pepe, and Bone ShibaSwap are also seeing a strong depreciation.</p>
<p>However, on-chain data suggests that the recent bearishness in $SHIB can be attributed to a sell-off from the bankrupt crypto platform Voyager and the token can soon see another bullish resurgence.</p>
<p>The continued support from Tier-1 exchanges like Binance and Crypto.com can also provide fresh legs to a Shiba Inu rally.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, newly-launched Sonik Coin has begun turning heads in the meme coin market, while Wall Street Memes token continues to gain strong traction and is emerging as an alternative to Shiba Inu.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Slides Despite Upcoming Shibarium Launch</strong></h2>
<p>After experiencing a remarkable 22% bull rally, Shiba Inu is now facing significant bearish forces, as it has incurred the most substantial losses of any top 20 crypto assets in the past day.</p>
<p>$SHIB has plunged just over 3% in the past 24 hours and is now below the $0.000010 price level. Its market capitalization has also fallen below the $6 Billion mark, highlighting the bearish momentum.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-22.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266862" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-22.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="331" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-22.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-22-300x165.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-22-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/SHIBUSD/technicals/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TradingView</a>, a technical analysis platform, gives a Sell signal to the token in the daily time frame, which further deteriorates to a Strong Sell when considering only the moving average indicators.</p>
<p>The on-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that the <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1691272802077429761?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SHIB’s bearish trajectory</a> over the past few days could be a result of a sell-off originating from Voyager. The bankrupt crypto exchange has sold $14.4 million worth of Shiba Inu tokens over the past 7 days in an effort to return client funds.</p>
<p>The good news for the bulls is that Voyager does not have any substantial amount of $SHIB tokens remaining. Thus, experts remain bullish on Shiba Inu’s short-term prospects, with crypto trader Andrew Griffiths believing that the recent correction has, in fact, presented <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewGriUK/status/1690985626412171264?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">excellent buying opportunities</a>.</p>
<p>Popular crypto analyst @army_shiba believes that if the meme coin could target and hold the $0.0000108 price mark, it could see a <a href="https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1690984253251571712?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">strong surge of whale interest</a>, resulting in another strong pump.</p>
<p>$SHIB investors would hope that a successful Shibarium launch can kickstart another bullish wave.</p>
<p>Major exchanges are also jumping on the Shibarium bandwagon. Crypto.com announced yesterday that it has listed <a href="https://twitter.com/Shibtoken/status/1691400569347252226?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$LEASH</a>, another token from the Shiba Inu ecosystem, on its platform. Binance also gave a major boost to $SHIB when it approved it as a collateral asset and increased its OTC trading limit.</p>
<h2>Sonik Coin Presale Kicks Off with Discounted Entry Price &amp; Low Hard Cap &#8211; Could it be a Shiba Inu Alternative?</h2>
<p>Although Shiba Inu dominates the headlines, it&#8217;s not the only coin attracting attention from meme coin investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/box_3bb03a9e65107f306e2760608ad07313?referrer=heres-why-the-shiba-inu-price-has-dipped-as-traders-back-these-new-meme-coins-to-pump" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sonik Coin ($SONIK)</a> is a new meme token that has just launched its public presale phase, allowing early investors to get involved at just $0.000014 per token.</p>
<p>$SONIK’s creators have allocated 50% of the total token supply to the presale, with the hard cap set at just over $2 million.</p>
<p>Additionally, the creators have set aside 10% of the token supply to provide DEX liquidity post-launch – a strategy designed to minimize slippage and price volatility.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-23.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266861" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-23.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="292" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-23.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-23-300x146.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-23-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>As its name implies, Sonik Coin is inspired by the popular video game character Sonic the Hedgehog, featuring meme-friendly branding that looks set to capture the interest of investors.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not just $SONIK&#8217;s branding playing into the token&#8217;s value – the creators have also implemented a staking protocol and set aside 40% of the total token supply for rewards.</p>
<p>According to Sonik Coin’s website, the current APY on offer is a whopping 3,392%, although this is expected to decrease as more holders stake their $SONIK.</p>
<p>While $SHIB continues experiencing volatility, Sonik Coin&#8217;s fair presale structure and staking incentives make it one to watch as the meme coin market continues evolving.</p>

<h2><strong>Wall Street Memes Also Bullish as Token Nears $24 Million in Presale, Experts Expect A 10x Surge</strong></h2>
<p>Another meme coin that generated headlines is <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=heres-why-the-shiba-inu-price-has-dipped-as-traders-back-these-new-meme-coins-to-pump" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes</a>, as its presale continues to generate tremendous hype and excitement. The token has now breached the $24 million mark in less than 3 months.</p>
<p>Experts believe that the token will continue its explosive growth even after its launch, with popular YouTubers like Crypto Dose calling it the <a href="https://youtu.be/Kfe1aPsjZcU" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">next 10x meme coin</a>.</p>
<p>The bullish price action would not be surprising as the meme coin is already catching the eyes of big-money investors. One whale recently purchased 460 ETH worth of $WSM tokens, making a total cumulative investment of over $1 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-16.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266859" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-16.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="297" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-16.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-16-300x148.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-16-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes token continues to receive promising backing from its community, in part due to its strong association with the Wall Street Bets Reddit group that led the ground-breaking GameStop bull run in 2021.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes group has since become the trendiest online trading community, boasting a million-strong internet army and farming 40 million impressions monthly across its social media. Even Elon Musk enjoys its edgy and on-point humour.</p>
<p>$WSM is aiming for a $1 billion market capitalization after its launch. After all, the developer team behind the token has a strong track record of building successful Web3 projects &#8211; its Wall St Bulls NFT collection sold out in just 32 minutes.</p>
<p>Investors can purchase the token through bank cards by swapping ETH, USDT or BNB in exchange for it.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The CEO, CLO, and CFO of Silvergate Bank will all have stepped down by the 30th of September.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this summer, Silvergate Bank was required to submit a detailed liquidation plan following its liquidity crisis caused by the collapse of FTX and other internal issues.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s situation has worsened since then, and now some of its highest-ranked officials stepped down.</p>
<h2>Sticking to The Plan</h2>
<p>Silvergate Bank was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/silvergate-ordered-to-submit-liquidation-plan-within-10-days/" data-wpel-link="internal">ordered</a> to submit a plan that would prevent executives from leaving the firm with golden parachutes, ensuring as much liquidity as possible would be provided to legitimate customers of the company.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Federal Reserve’s order ensures Silvergate will implement its previously announced plan for winding down the bank’s operations in a manner that protects the bank’s depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. Silvergate is also prohibited from making capital distributions, dissipating cash assets, and engaging in certain other activities without regulatory approval.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In accordance with the plan, Silvergate <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1312109/000095015723000884/form8-k.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">submitted a notice</a> to the SEC today, stating that CEO Alan J. Lane and John M. Bonino, the Chief Legal Officer of the company, had resigned effective immediately on the 15th of August.</p>
<p>Although the two executives would be receiving severance packages, they would not be receiving “any further compensation related to their employment.” The exact details of the severance packages were not revealed to the public.</p>
<p>Antonio Martino, Silvergate’s Chief Financial Officer, will also be leaving the company. However, his official resignation will be tendered on the 30th of September, owing to active duties still needing his attention.</p>
<h2>No Further Appointments to The C-Suite</h2>
<p>According to the document, Lane’s position as CEO will be taken over by Chief Transition Officer Kathleen M. Fraher, who will continue to serve as CTO simultaneously. Once Martino steps down, his duties will be taken over by Chief Accounting Officer Andrew Surry.</p>
<p>However, the newly appointed executives will most likely be the last to hold their respective positions, as no further appointments are foreseen due to the bank’s upcoming liquidation.</p>
<p>Until the liquidation is resolved, Silvergate must address several high-profile lawsuits, such as the one filed by the Texan Word of God Fellowship Church, which <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3Ad028ad43-0852-38b5-b77f-4303149115dc" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">accused</a> it of using $25 million worth of church deposits for FTX’s benefit.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, the Church demands its deposit back, as well as any profit that Silvergate may have accrued from illegally aiding, abetting, and profiting off of FTX’s schemes. A class-action <a href="https://www.blbglaw.com/cases-investigations/silvergate" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> caused by Silvergate’s alleged failure to do due diligence when onboarding clients such as FTX is also underway.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[XRP’s 1% market depth on crypto exchange Gemini has rebounded.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XRP is currently reeling under severe bearish pressure alongside other top cryptocurrencies. Over the past week, XRP was down by almost 7%, contributing to its monthly losses, which have now reached 20%.</p>
<p>But the latest analysis suggests that the crypto-assets market depth on Gemini has rebounded.</p>
<ul>
<li>Last week, XRP&#8217;s price on Gemini <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-explodes-to-50-but-its-not-what-you-think/" data-wpel-link="internal">experienced</a> a temporary surge, reaching $50. This occurred following the token&#8217;s relisting on the exchange, which was prompted by low trading activity.</li>
<li>The XRP market depth, representing a 1% share, plummeted from 45,000 XRP to nearly negligible levels as its price exceeded its typical range.</li>
<li>Consequently, market makers scaled back their participation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;XRP prices on Gemini briefly rose to $50 last week after the exchange re-listed the token due to thin liquidity. The 1% XRP market depth on the exchange declined from 45k XRP to nearly zero as its price flew well beyond its normal range and market makers reduced activity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Crypto analyst Ali also voiced a similar <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1689929018143903744" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">observation</a> last week and added that the XRP market depth on Gemini was so minimal that merely a $37,000 order could lead to a 2% price shift.</li>
<li>Fortunately, the liquidity has now rebounded, stabilizing at approximately 150,000 XRP, according to Kaiko&#8217;s <a href="https://research.kaiko.com/insights/curve-3pool-sees-175m-outflows" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a>.</li>
<li>After the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated a lawsuit against Ripple in late 2020, several major US-based crypto exchanges opted to withdraw XRP from their offerings.</li>
<li>Last month&#8217;s court verdict stated that XRP is not considered a security in secondary markets transactions, and numerous exchanges have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-listed-on-gemini-following-ripples-partial-court-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">reversed</a> their decisions.</li>
</ul>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seychelles-based crypto exchange OKX has added LBR, the native token of Lybra Finance’s decentralized system, to its spot market.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the same time, the exchange has also included the Hedera token (HBAR) in its perpetual market.</li>
<li>Users of the platform can deposit LBR against Tether (USDT) using the new LBR/USDT spot pair on Aug. 16, but <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/16/2726066/0/en/Flash-News-OKX-Lists-Lybra-Finance-s-LBR-Token-on-its-Spot-Market.html#:~:text=August%2016%2C%202023.-,OKX%20Lists%20Lybra%20Finance&#039;s%20LBR%20Token%20on%20its%20Spot%20Market,the%20LBR%2FUSDT%20spot%20pair" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according</a> to OKX, withdrawals will commence on Aug. 17.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sonik Coin ($SONIK), a new community-driven meme token, aspires to be the fastest-growing project in its niche and is rapidly emerging in the meme coin space.</p>
<p>With a fair presale ongoing and lucrative staking rewards, <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/box_3bb03a9e65107f306e2760608ad07313?referrer=new-meme-coin-to-watch-sonik-coin-launches-presale-looks-to-be-fastest-token-to-100m-market-cap" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sonik Coin $SONIK</a> injects hilarity and vibrant energy into the meme coin market.</p>
<p>Following the recent successes of comparable low-market-cap cryptos, numerous early presale participants think Sonik Coin could chart a similar course.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-21.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266827" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-21.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="199" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-21.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-21-300x99.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-21-50x17.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<h2>Limited-Time Sonik Coin Presale Opens Doors to Early Investors</h2>
<p>Sonik Coin has just launched its public presale phase, where 50% of the total 300 billion $SONIK supply has been earmarked for early investors.</p>
<p>$SONIK tokens are priced at just $0.000014 – allowing meme coin enthusiasts to get involved in the project ahead of its DEX debut once the presale ends.</p>
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://www.sonikcoin.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sonik Coin’s whitepaper</a>, the tokenomics distribution also includes 10% for exchange liquidity to minimize price volatility post-launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-21.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266826" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-21.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="291" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-21.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-21-300x145.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-21-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Without any private funding rounds, Sonik Coin&#8217;s founders have emphasized their community-centric vision from the outset.</p>
<p>The recently-launched presale has a hard cap of just $2 million, with investors able to get involved using $ETH or $USDT.</p>
<p>Once the hard cap has been hit, $SONIK will immediately be launched on Uniswap – the world’s largest decentralized exchange, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/decentralized" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">according to CoinGecko</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this setup has attracted attention, with Sonik Coin’s presale raising $20,000 in its first 24 hours.</p>
<h2>$SONIK Staking Provides Lucrative Passive Income Opportunities to Holders</h2>
<p>In addition to a fair presale, Sonik Coin’s team has pledged 40% of the total token supply to staking rewards for $SONIK holders.</p>
<p>This staking protocol gives the meme coin a use case beyond just trading and speculative potential.</p>
<p>By staking their <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/box_3bb03a9e65107f306e2760608ad07313?referrer=new-meme-coin-to-watch-sonik-coin-launches-presale-looks-to-be-fastest-token-to-100m-market-cap" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$SONIK tokens</a>, holders can earn substantial APY yields.</p>
<p>According to Sonik Coin’s website, the current staking APY stands at over 4,300%, with approximately 555 million $SONIK tokens already locked up.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-21.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266825" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-21.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="204" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-21.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-21-300x102.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-21-50x17.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Beyond just passive income, Sonik Coin’s staking protocol also aims to incentivize long-term holding of $SONIK, thereby promoting price stability.</p>
<p>This staking setup is rare in the meme coin space, which has historically been flooded with tokens that lack real-world use cases.</p>
<p>With $SONIK staking, holders can have a tangible impact in helping the development team reach their goals.</p>
<p>As such, $SONIK holders are empowered beyond just buying and selling the token – further underscoring the project’s community-centric approach.</p>
<h2>Success of $PEPE Highlights Sonik Coin’s Explosive Price Potential</h2>
<p>Many early members of the <a href="https://t.me/Sonikcoin" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sonik Coin Telegram community</a> believe that the ongoing appetite for meme coins could pave the way for huge $SONIK growth.</p>
<p>Well-known projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have demonstrated the impact online communities can have in driving exponential returns.</p>
<p>However, newer meme coins like $PEPE have also demonstrated the ability to deliver returns of 10,000% (or more) to early backers.</p>
<p>Given the recent success of $PEPE, which had no built-in use case, there is growing optimism that $SONIK could see heightened investor interest thanks to its staking model and holder incentives.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-15.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266824" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-15.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="173" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-15.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-15-300x86.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-15-50x14.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Also boosting Sonik Coin&#8217;s prospects is the project’s unique branding, which taps into the proven popularity of Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>This established brand awareness could give Sonik Coin a head start in gaining viral momentum.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while any investment carries risk and Sonik Coin&#8217;s developers make no guarantees, its high-velocity vision and passion around creating the fastest-growing meme token have evidently piqued the interest of investors.</p>
<p>With its presale now ongoing, investors intrigued by unique meme coins may wish to take a closer look at this new, staking-powered entrant into the space.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">PEPE finally found its resistance and the price crashed by 10% in a day.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.00000123</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.00000136</strong></p>
<h2>1. Price at Critical Support</h2>
<p>With the rally over, PEPE has found good support at $0.00000123. However, sellers have control of the price action right now and may not be satisfied yet. Further volatility seems likely as pressure builds at this key level.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266808" style="width: 2448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-16_16-47-24.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266808" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-16_16-47-24.png" alt="PEPEUSDT_2023-08-16_16-47-24" width="2448" height="1199" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-16_16-47-24.png 2448w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-16_16-47-24-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-16_16-47-24-1024x502.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-16_16-47-24-768x376.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-16_16-47-24-1536x752.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-16_16-47-24-2048x1003.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEPEUSDT_2023-08-16_16-47-24-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2448px) 100vw, 2448px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266808" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>2. Sellers Return in Force</h2>
<p>Over the past two days, the selling pressure intensified and changed the dynamics in the market, which could turn the price action bearish if sellers break below the current support.</p>

<h2>3. Bearish Momentum</h2>
<p>PEPE&#8217;s momentum shifted gears in one day. This shows that memecoins are a high-risk bet as their volatility and direction can change suddenly based on market sentiment. If bulls can&#8217;t defend the current support, the bearish momentum will be more likely to intensify.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for PEPE is bearish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for PEPE Price</h2>
<p>As long as the key support at $0.00000123 holds, buyers still have a chance to stop sellers and take over. If they fail, then look for levels around $0.00000116 might come in play before PEPE can find its footing again.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[There's some development in the case between Ripple and the SEC but it's not what most would expect.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ongoing case between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission continues to be among the most heavily-discussed topics in the industry.</p>
<p>Most recently, presiding Judge Analisa Torres approved a notice of appearance for an Investment Banker Declarant, but what does this mean?</p>
<h2>Approving Notice of Appearance</h2>
<p>Judge Analisa Torres has recently approved a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.888.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">notice of appearance</a> in the case between crypto heavyweight Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The Judge approved Andrew A. Kunsak from the law firm Sidley Austin LLP. He will appear as an investment banker declarant in the lawsuit.</p>
<blockquote><p>Andrew A. Kunsak of Sidley Austin LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, a member of this Court in good standing, hereby respectfully enters an appearance for Investment Banker Declarant in the above-captioned action.</p></blockquote>
<p>The purpose of this is to avoid disclosure of any potentially confidential information in response to an earlier order that was sealed by the court &#8211; that of the Hinman Speech Documents.</p>
<p>The investment banker declarant aims to protect their own stakeholders and bar uncertainty as the Commission looks to further appeal the Court&#8217;s summary judgment ruling, where Judge Torres concluded that secondary XRP sales do not constitute investment contracts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that Ripple had previously opposed an appearance for an investment banker declarant.</p>
<h2>More Action Coming This Week</h2>
<p>As <em>CryptoPotato </em><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-tumbles-in-anticipation-of-major-development-in-ripple-v-sec-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> earlier today, XRP&#8217;s price has been having hard times during the past 24 hours as the market seems to be anticipating the company&#8217;s stance on the SEC&#8217;s interlocutory brief aiming to appeal Judge Torres&#8217; summary judgment.</p>
<p>Ripple&#8217;s head lawyer, Stuart Alderoty, said that they will respond this week.</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC does not have the “right” to appeal just yet, which is why they are asking permission to file an “interlocutory” appeal. Ripple will file its response with the Court next week. Stay tuned.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.25</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.28</strong></p>
<h2>1. Key Support Lost</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for ADA holders, the price did not manage to hold above the key support at 28 cents. This has now turned into resistance, and the current momentum is favoring sellers.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ADAUSDT_2023-08-16_16-24-32.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-266796 alignleft" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ADAUSDT_2023-08-16_16-24-32.png" alt="ADAUSDT_2023-08-16_16-24-32" width="2448" height="1199" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ADAUSDT_2023-08-16_16-24-32.png 2448w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ADAUSDT_2023-08-16_16-24-32-300x147.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ADAUSDT_2023-08-16_16-24-32-1024x502.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ADAUSDT_2023-08-16_16-24-32-768x376.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ADAUSDT_2023-08-16_16-24-32-1536x752.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ADAUSDT_2023-08-16_16-24-32-2048x1003.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ADAUSDT_2023-08-16_16-24-32-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2448px) 100vw, 2448px" /></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>2. Bearish Momentum Intensifies</h2>
<p>With a new lower low, the bears appear to have full control of the price action, which could lead ADA into much lower levels. The most significant support right now is found at 25 cents.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>3. RSI Approaching Oversold Area</h2>
<p>Since mid-July, Cardano has been in a downtrend which could end once the daily RSI reaches the oversold area at under 30 points. There is still plenty of space for this indicator to fall before that, however.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for ADA is bearish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for ADA Price</h2>
<p>With the downtrend intact and momentum favoring sellers, ADA cannot hope for a reversal at this time. The price will need to become much more attractive before buyers return. This could very well be at 25 cents.</p>
