<p>The cryptocurrency market has grown in leaps and bounds since it first began. With the induction of the first cryptocurrency, there was an atmosphere of innovation and advancement as it ushered in a pathway and a glimpse into the future of finance.</p>
<p>Since then, we have had many coins rise and fall, some being completely obliterated by the competitive nature of the market. However, the latest innovation in the market is that of meme-coins, like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which bring about a light-hearted nature to the normally serious demeanor of the industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has become a force to be reckoned with since last year with its speedy growth, sublime rewards system, and grand community of investors. The platform has shown great potential with everything they have done, and as they prepare to launch in less than a month, the next six months seem like an exciting time for the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin has a range of products and services in store for investors and loyal users, as well as easily accessible tokens which are to be listed on popular exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Journey, New Rewards</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin has worked diligently to deliver the best quality products and services to its community of users and investors. During the ongoing presale, the platform has a wide variety of profitable opportunities. From the loot boxes to NFTs to bonuses, Big Eyes Coin did not shy away from rewarding its clientele in the best of ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next six months, Big Eyes Coin community members can look forward to a Big Eyes Coin Casino, which will have over 4,000 games and a variety of Play-to-Earn (P2E) games that come with their rewards. The casino will be fully operational in August, and users can play using only $BIG, which will likely reduce the supply of tokens on exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now is a fantastic chance to earn tokens during the current presale and build up your Casino Kitty. Buy your tokens now using the code END300 for a 300% bonus and avoid scarcity!</p>
<p>BIG Plans For Exchanges</p>
<p>When a cryptocurrency is listed on an exchange, it is the same as being picked up by a record label to being starred in a big movie - it brings about recognition and credibility to the brand. This is the next step for Big Eyes Coin because the platform wants to develop a larger community of investors through visibility, authenticity, and accessibility. The best way to do so is through exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin plans to launch on several exchanges, possibly starting with Tier 1 Exchange and Uniswap and including Bitget, CoinEx, BitMart, Deepcoin, and Gate.io, to name a few. This will ensure that Big Eyes Coin maintains a steady level of growth and can gain access to a wider and possibly global market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Altogether, the months following the launch are bound to be some of the most exciting times for both Big Eyes Coin and the community. Although Big Eyes Coin is going to be now on the market, it is speculated to be a solid competitor for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu based on how well it performed during the presale. Once the launch happens, Big Eyes Coin will face an exhilarating phase of growth, one that will be most profitable for both the platform and its investors.</p>
