<p>The crypto market remains volatile. But analysts have seen signs that indicate a massive pump for Uwerx, PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Increased DeFi activity and a more risk-on macroeconomic environment are the driving forces behind this predicted surge. Investors who want to capitalize on this incoming rally, need to act fast. </p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX)Analysts investigating Uwerx noted two key points: the 25-year liquidity lock following launch and the audits completed by InterFi Network and Solidproof. Two fundamental indicators of a project with a long-term vision. Uwerx leads a paradigm shift for the gig economy and will create an industry-first decentralized freelancing platform. Uwerx will employ blockchain technology to deliver a platform better suited to freelancers, one that is more secure and transparent and does not charge exorbitant platform fees. Upwork made more than $373 million in service fees in 2020, and this heavy bureaucratic attitude with escrow services has harmed the growth of freelancing, making it more difficult for newer players to enter the space. Uwerx will provide an alternative and, as a result, has the potential to become a blue-chip project used by millions worldwide. Some have already stated their expectations for the current presale price of $0.0065 to increase to $7 by the end of 2023. </p>
<p>PancakeSwap (CAKE)</p>
<p>PancakeSwap (CAKE) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that allows users to trade through the use of liquidity pools. PancakeSwap (CAKE) has displayed steady growth since its launch in 2020. PancakeSwap (CAKE) grew partly because of its speed, and PancakeSwap (CAKE) is one of the fastest DEXs due to its deep liquidity and the BSC network.</p>
<p>Increased DeFi activity on the BSC always leads to price appreciation for PancakeSwap (CAKE). The PancakeSwap (CAKE) token is an integral part of the PancakeSwap (CAKE) platform, and holders who lock their tokens receive yield boosts on the core farms. &nbsp;Shiba Inu (SHIB)</p>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has announced the launch of Shibarium, a layer two scaling solution built on Ethereum. Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders have understandably been excited by the news. Shiba Inu (SHIB) will pump on the release, and more importantly, it will add another use case for Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens.</p>
<p>The release of Shiba Inu (SHIB) layer two will further fuel the enormous Shiba Inu (SHIB) token burn. Analysts expect a solid performance in 2023 for Shiba Inu (SHIB) with this continued commitment to development from the team. Breakout Year For Uwerx (WERX)Uwerx will explode in 2023. It provides real-world utility, and coupled with growing DeFi activity and a more risk-on environment; investors should not be surprised when they see the WERX token start rocketing through the rankings.
