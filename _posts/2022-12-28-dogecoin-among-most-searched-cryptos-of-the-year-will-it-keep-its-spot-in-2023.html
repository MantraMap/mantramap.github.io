According to the report, the meme coin recorded around 1,290,000 monthly searches in the U.S., but in terms of global monthly searches, Dogecoin took the crown. This cryptocurrency recorded around 6,000,000 monthly searches compared to the 4,400,000 million from SHIBA.  DOGE To See Further Growth In Popularity Per the report, the dominant trends in the crypto industry can be divided into meme coins, represented by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and innovative contract platforms, represented by Ethereum and Avalanche.  Finally, people took an interest in old cryptocurrencies revamping their ecosystem with new features, represented by Cardano and Litecoin.
