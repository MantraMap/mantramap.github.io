<h2>Impact of BRICS Currency on US Dollar and American Living Standards</h2>
<p>Investment analyst Jon Wolfenbarger, CFA, published a blog post titled &#8220;Will a New BRICS Currency Change Anything? Maybe” on Mises Institute&#8217;s website last week. Wolfenbarger is the CEO and founder of Bull And Bear Profits, an investment website. He has more than 30 years of experience in the investment industry, having worked for over 22 years as a securities analyst at Allianz Global Investors and as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan.</p>
<p>Commenting on de-dollarization efforts by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Due to the Russia-Ukraine war and China’s continued economic growth, the BRICS are accelerating plans to take power from the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>He mentioned several BRICS initiatives, including the New Development Bank for infrastructure lending, a Contingent Reserve Arrangement to protect against foreign exchange pressures, and a payment system as an alternative to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).</p>
<p>Moreover, Wolfenbarger detailed that the BRICS nations are also working on a reserve asset based on a basket of the member countries’ currencies to compete with the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) special drawing rights (SDR).</p>
<p>Commenting on whether the U.S. dollar will be dethroned, the investment analyst detailed: “The BRICS countries are unlikely to seriously challenge the king dollar if their only tool is just another fiat currency they can create out of thin air.” He stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The BRICS will have a much better chance if they create a hard currency backed by gold or other commodities like oil.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The U.S. has the largest and safest government bond market, no capital controls, and a reputation for enforcing the rule of law. By contrast, the BRICS countries are hardly known for respecting laws or having strong currencies,” Wolfenbarger opined. “Of course, their competition with the dollar would ultimately end in failure, as Bretton Woods did, if the BRICS countries continue to create money out of thin air to finance their warfare and welfare spending.”</p>

<p>Regarding the economic and political impact of a BRICS currency on the U.S. and the USD, the former JPMorgan investment banker noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the BRICS are successful and the U.S. does not change its policies to focus on a stronger dollar, less spending, and peace instead of war, it is possible the dollar will slowly lose its ‘reserve currency’ status.</p></blockquote>
<p>“This would hurt U.S. living standards and lead to less power for the U.S. government, similar to the weakening of the UK after World War II. All empires in history have failed, and the U.S. will not likely be an exception — if the BRICS can create a successful hard currency to compete with the dollar,” he opined.</p>
<p>Many people agree that a successful BRICS currency could erode the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance, including a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-will-erode-us-dollars-dominance-former-white-house-economist-warns/">former White House economist</a>. The BRICS economic bloc is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-actively-discussing-brics-expansion-with-member-nations-official-reveals/">gaining more influence</a> globally; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">19 countries</a> have applied to join or have expressed interest in joining. A Swedish university professor said last week that Saudi Arabia joining the BRICS group would <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/saudi-arabia-joining-brics-would-accelerate-chinese-yuans-use-as-trading-currency-says-professor/">accelerate</a> the Chinese yuan&#8217;s use as a trading currency.</p>

<h2>Peter Schiff on Inflation Tsunami, Financial Crises, Depressions, and Bank Failures</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff discussed the U.S. banking crisis and where the U.S. economy is headed in an interview last week on One America News Network.</p>
<p>Citing “the mess that the Fed made by keeping interest rates so low for so long,” Schiff explained that it enabled banks to load up on “low yielding, overpriced long-term debt, treasuries, [and] mortgages.” Moreover, he stressed that the government and regulators push banks &#8220;into these securities with favorable accounting treatment for government securities or anything guaranteed by the U.S. government.” He warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>A lot more banks are going to fail. This is just the reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) contemplating how they might tweak the coverage for regional banks after several major banks <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">failed</a>, Schiff suggested: “How about abolishing the FDIC and let the free market handle banking. We&#8217;d have a much more solid bank system if depositors knew that their deposits could be lost at a bank that was reckless and took a lot of risks, and then those banks would be under competitive pressure not to take those kinds of risks.”</p>
<p>Noting that the source of the U.S. banking crisis is that “We socialized the banking industry,” Schiff detailed: “We’ve also socialized interest rates because the Federal Reserve is like a Polit Bureau. They just pick an interest rate rather than allowing the market to discover the appropriate rate.” The economist opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the Fed sets interest rates too low and prints a lot of money in order to make that possible, it unleashes massive inflation, creates tremendous economic imbalances that result in financial crises and depressions when the bubbles burst. That’s where we are right now.</p></blockquote>

<p>Schiff added: “I think the Fed is going to have to unleash so much inflation to try to prop up all these banks, and the U.S. government, which is also insolvent. That is going to unleash runaway inflation. That is the real problem.” He cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nobody’s money is safe in any bank, because even if your bank doesn’t fail, it’s going to be bailed out through inflation. So, you might not lose your money, but your money will definitely lose its purchasing power.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding the Federal Reserve raising interest rates by 25 basis points at their latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Schiff stated that it is not enough to bring down inflation but “it is enough to create more problems for the banks and anybody else that has debt that they have to service.”</p>
<p>He explained that a lot of companies and people, particularly those who own commercial real estate, took out short-term loans at very low rates a few years ago. As those loans mature, they cannot afford higher payments. “They have less revenue, and now their interest expenses are rising,” Schiff described. In addition, many companies that borrowed in the junk bond market are not going to be able to afford to service their debt at the new rates once these bonds mature, he noted, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, the bulk of this financial crisis, which just got started, is in our future. We’re just at the tip of a huge iceberg right now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding where people should put their money, Schiff advised: &#8220;Get out of the dollar. Get out of banks, and get into something real, whether it&#8217;s gold, silver, foreign stocks. You have to look for a port in the storm because this is an inflation tsunami.&#8221;</p>

Despite the government’s crackdown, illegal crypto mining continues to account for a serious amount of energy consumption, official figures suggest.</strong></p>
<h2>Illegal Crypto Miners in Iran Steal 1.8 Billion kWh of Electricity, Official Says</h2>
<p>Enterprises minting digital currencies outside the law in Iran have stolen 1.8 billion kilowatt hours (KWh) of electricity, according to a spokesperson for the electric power industry, quoted by the English-language Iranian daily Financial Tribune and the Bargh News portal.</p>
<p>“About 8,200 unauthorized centers for cryptocurrency mining have been identified and closed in the past three years, in which more than 246,000 active miners were using 680 megawatts (MW) of energy,” said Mostafa Rajabi-Mashhadi. It’s estimated that another 1,200 MW of power capacity is still being occupied by illegal miners in the country, he added.</p>
<p>Most of the electricity theft occurred in the provinces of Isfahan and Tehran, followed by Khorasan Razavi, Khuzestan, Markazi, Fars, and East Azerbaijan. By cracking down on illegal mining activities, the government wants to support the operations of licensed miners, the reports noted.</p>
<p>In July of 2022, the Iran Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution Company (Tavanir) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iranian-power-utility-tavanir-vows-severe-measures-against-unlicensed-crypto-miners/">vowed</a> to take severe measures against unlicensed crypto miners. By the end of 2022, the utility had found and closed down 7,200 unauthorized mining farms.</p>

<p>Iran legalized bitcoin mining in 2019 but has since <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-to-shut-down-crypto-mining-farms-amid-record-high-power-demand/">halted</a> legal operations on several occasions, citing power shortages during the summer and winter months, when electricity consumption usually spikes. That’s despite registered mining facilities paying at higher electricity rates than other industries in the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>The Iranian Ministry of Energy requires owners of crypto mining hardware to report the location of their devices in the Comprehensive Trade System of the Ministry of Industries, Mining and Trade, which issues the licenses. Failure to do so would result in hefty fines.</p>

In addition to ORDI, Bitget has also announced a new round of Launchpad featuring another BRC-20 token, <a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/support/articles/12560603785471">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals 1 (BIP1)</a>, to further support the continuous improvement of the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://brc-20.io/">BRC-20</a> is a new fungible token standard designed for the Bitcoin blockchain that has become one of the latest trends in the industry. This new token standard is set to revolutionize the crypto space. Built on the <a href="https://ordinals.com/">Ordinals </a>protocol, BRC-20 is a coin on Bitcoin that allows users to write information to each Satoshi, such as text, pictures, audio, and video, among others. The protocol aims to inscribe information mainly in the form of NFTs and tokens on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> chain, despite the size limit of the Bitcoin block. The introduction of BRC-20 and Ordinals will enable users to create and manage more efficient and secure blockchain-based assets.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bitget is excited to list ORDI and be among the first exchanges to offer BRC-20 tokens to our users,&#x201D; said <strong>Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget</strong>. &#x201C;We believe in the potential of this token standard to enhance the functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain and provide more truly decentralized opportunities for the crypto community. Bitget is committed to supporting the BRC-20 ecosystem in the long run and is thrilled to be a part of this innovative development.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Since its launch just two months ago, the total market cap of BRC-20 tokens has already surpassed 1 billion on May 9, proving the demand for this innovative standard. The deposit service of ORDI started at 12 PM UTC on May 10th, 2023, and trading commenced on the same day. Bitget users can now trade and transact with BRC-20 tokens, with futures trading and other features coming soon. Bitget aims to offer a seamless trading experience for its users and continues to innovate and add new features to its platform. The launch of the BRC-20 token is just one of many exciting developments to come from Bitget.</p>
<p>As a leading derivatives crypto platform, Bitget is expanding its product offerings beyond derivatives. Bitget is also rapidly listing promising coins in its revamped Innovation Zones on Bitget Spot, providing users with access to the most trending sectors, such as MEME, Liquid Staking Derivatives, BRC-20, NFT and so on. According to Coinmarketcap, Bitget Spot now supports over 500 coins with approximately 551 trading pairs.</p>

This news comes on the heels of Paypal&#x2019;s announcement that Venmo now facilitates external transfers of cryptocurrencies to wallets and exchange platforms.</strong></p>
<h2>Paypal&#x2019;s Crypto Holdings Increase in Value Since Dec. 31, 2022</h2>
<p>Paypal&#x2019;s latest quarterly <a href="https://archive.ph/ql2zn#selection-30719.33-30719.477">earnings report</a>, filed with the SEC, reveals that the payments giant is sitting on a substantial stash of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>). As of March 31, 2023, Paypal&#x2019;s crypto holdings include $499 million in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and $362 million in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, with an additional $82 million in &#x201C;other&#x201D; cryptocurrencies that the company supports. Impressively, Paypal&#x2019;s crypto cache has surged by a whopping $339 million since December 31, 2022, when digital currency values were significantly lower.</p>
<p>Paypal is currently supporting bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, and litecoin, with the payments giant relying on trusted third parties for certain custodial solutions. According to the 10-Q filing, these solutions involve &#x201C;holding our customers&#x2019; cryptographic key information, securing our customers&#x2019; crypto assets, and protecting them from loss or theft, including indemnification against certain types of losses such as theft,&#x201D; as detailed in Paypal&#x2019;s SEC filing. The payments company&#x2019;s quarterly report adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our third-party custodian holds the crypto assets in a custodial account in Paypal&#x2019;s name for the benefit of Paypal&#x2019;s customers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Paypal&#x2019;s latest quarterly report comes on the heels of its subsidiary, Venmo, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-upgrades-crypto-services-to-60-million-venmo-users-allowing-transfers-to-external-wallets-and-exchanges/">announcing</a> support for external transfers to wallets and exchange platforms. Paypal itself rolled out <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-upgrades-crypto-service-now-lets-users-transfer-cryptocurrencies-to-other-wallets-exchanges/">external transfer support</a> in June 2022, and reported a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-ceo-demand-for-cryptocurrencies-multiple-fold-initial-expectations/">surge in crypto usage</a> following its initial support for digital assets in 2021. Notably, both Paypal and Venmo offer a cash-back-to-crypto reward system, adding an extra incentive for users to engage with the world of cryptocurrencies.</p>

As per the document, servers allegedly hurled the court documents at Shaq&#8217;s car, ultimately landing on the public street near his Georgia residence.</strong></p>
<h2>Shaq&#8217;s Legal Team Fights Back Against FTX Lawsuit</h2>
<p>In Monday&#8217;s legal filing, Shaq&#8217;s lawyers <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/65757245/garrison-v-bankman-fried/">contested</a> the proper service claims, following the Moskowitz Law Firm&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/moskowitzesq/status/1647755666134650880?s=20">disclosure</a> that they had served O&#8217;Neal and that the service was captured on his home security system. &#8220;We made it very clear that he is not to destroy or erase any of these security tapes, because they must be preserved for our lawsuit,&#8221; Moskowitz stated in a tweet.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, attorneys for Shaq contend that the purported delivery at his Georgia property was not legally valid. They argue that process servers gathered outside Shaq&#8217;s residence without identifying themselves and state that court documents were thrown at the NBA star&#8217;s vehicle before falling onto the public road as he departed. His lawyers add that the process servers simply left the paperwork on the street.</p>
<p>Moskowitz <a href="https://twitter.com/moskowitzesq/status/1646696475047477250?s=20">alleges</a> that O&#8217;Neal evaded process servers for months while other celebrities accepted their complaints. The latest court document also claims Moskowitz&#8217;s servers missed the deadline to serve O&#8217;Neal. O&#8217;Neal&#8217;s attorneys argue that plaintiffs had numerous attempts to serve him properly, stating, &#8220;Mr. O’Neal has not evaded service by failing to be at the residences where plaintiffs belatedly attempted service or by driving past strangers who approached his car.&#8221;</p>

<p>The charges against O&#8217;Neal involve his promotion of FTX and implicate its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried as a co-defendant. Furthermore, Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, Stephen Curry, Udonis Haslem, David Ortiz, William Trevor Lawrence, Shohei Ohtani, Naomi Osaka, Lawrence Gene David, Kevin O’Leary, and the NBA team the Golden State Warriors are also named as defendants in the Miami-based Garrison v. Bankman-Fried, 22-cv-23753 case.</p>

Prices climbed by nearly 2% in today&#x2019;s session, despite the global market cap moving marginally lower. Polygon, which currently occupies the tenth position, fell to a five-month low. </strong></p>
<h2>TRON (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" 312021  target="_blank">TRX</a>)</h2>
<p>TRON (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" 312021  target="_blank">TRX</a>), rose by as much as 2% on Wednesday, as the token moved closer to entering the cryptocurrency top 10.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.06841 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" 312021  target="_blank">TRX</a>/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $0.07031 earlier in the session.</p>
<p>As a result of this jump, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" 312021  target="_blank">TRX</a> is now marginally above a long-term resistance level of $0.070.</p>

<p>It appears that the target for bulls could be to not only break this ceiling, but move to $0.072, which would see the token hit a three-month high.</p>
<p>One of the main obstacles preventing this is the relative strength index (RSI), which is currently tracking at 59.67, below resistance at 60.00.</p>
<p>If and when price strength moves beyond this point, there will likely be more bulls reentering the market.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) which is currently the world&#x2019;s tenth largest cryptocurrency, fell for a fifth straight day.</p>
<p>MATIC/USD plunged to a bottom at $0.866, less than a day after the token was trading near $0.90.</p>
<p>This latest decline in price has pushed polygon to its lowest point since January 11, when it traded at $0.84.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this spell of sell-offs has sent the RSI below 30.00, which is deep in oversold territory.</p>
<p>The last time price strength tracked this low was back in July 2022, which may give bulls optimism that a reversal could be soon approaching.</p>
<p>MATIC is now trading at $0.8723, which is marginally higher than its earlier lows.</p>

<h2>Grayscale Introduces Grayscale Funds Trust and Files for 3 ETFs</h2>
<p>As the leading digital currency fund manager, in terms of assets under management (AUM), Grayscale Investments <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1656042617660948486?s=20">unveiled</a> the Grayscale Funds Trust launch. The trust is a Delaware statutory trust structure designed to strengthen the company&#8217;s worldwide asset management capabilities. &#8220;A registration statement relating to Grayscale Funds Trust has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective,&#8221; Grayscale stated on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Grayscale highlighted that they had previously established Grayscale Advisors, an SEC-registered investment advisor, which will serve as the new trust&#8217;s advisor. Besides the trust, Grayscale has also filed a registration statement for three additional funds. These newly launched funds consist of the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, and Grayscale Privacy ETF.</p>
<p>Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/09/2665053/0/en/Grayscale-Investments-Forms-Grayscale-Funds-Trust.html">said</a> in a statement: “The creation of Grayscale Funds Trust reflects our dedication to scaling Grayscale’s business responsibly,” adding that “we are putting the necessary foundations in place so Grayscale can continue creating and managing regulated, future-forward products.”</p>

<p>Moreover, Grayscale announced that David LaValle, the company&#8217;s global head of ETFs, would assist with their expansion. “It has been incredibly exciting to build our ETF franchise – hiring a dedicated team, expanding our partnerships, and enhancing our position within the ETF ecosystem,” LaValle said.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) continued to consolidate on Wednesday, as markets awaited the latest inflation report from the United States.</p>
<p>Following a high of $27,824.39 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $27,375.60 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s move pushed bitcoin close to a key support point at $27,300, however prices have since rebounded.</p>

<p>Overall, it appears that the previous drop took place following a breakout on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>Price strength moved below a floor at 43.00, with the index tracking at 42.63 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is now trading at $27,607.96.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum also hovered close to a support point of its own in today&#x2019;s session, as overall market sentiment remained uncertain.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit a bottom of $1,835.70 on Wednesday, which comes a few days removed from price trading above $2,000.</p>
<p>Overall, ethereum is now in the red for a fifth consecutive day, and is down nearly 10% within that period.</p>

<p>This recent run has sent the 25-day (blue) moving average (MA) lower, with the trend line fast approaching its 10-day (red) counterpart.</p>
<p>Although longer-term momentum is slowing, the fact that the 10-day MA is below the 25-day line, means an upwards crossover could lead to a bull run.</p>
<p>Should this occur, there is a good chance that the target for bulls will be to recapture the $2,000 point.</p>
