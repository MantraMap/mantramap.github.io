<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>LayerZero CEO&#8217;s Twitter account has been compromised, leading to the posting of fake information and warnings to users.</em></li>



<li><em>The fake tweets referenced the game Artifact, which was discontinued two years ago, raising concerns about the attacker&#8217;s motives.</em></li>



<li><em>Users are advised to be cautious, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and wait for official updates from the project team to stay informed about the incident.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The crypto community is buzzing with the recent incident that LayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino&#8217;s Twitter account has been used by bad guys to post fake information.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/188275-layerzero-bug-bounty-worth-up-to-15-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LayerZero</a>, a cross-chain interoperability protocol, has publicly confirmed that its CEO&#8217;s Twitter account (@PrimordialAA) has been compromised, warning users not to click on any strange links or engage in suspicious behaviors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimordialAA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@PrimordialAA</a> account has been hacked — please don’t engage with any links / suspicious activity</p>&mdash; LayerZero Labs (@LayerZero_Labs) <a href="https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs/status/1676327546202517504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 4, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to current information gathered by <a href="https://coincu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coincu</a>, Pellegrino&#8217;s account posted a tweet regarding Artifact, a card game he also participated in 5 years ago.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Artifact is a digital collectible card game in which players construct decks of collectible cards acquired from the Steam Marketplace in order to beat an opponent in one-on-one combat. It borrows heavily from the Valve-developed multiplayer online combat arena game Dota 2.</p>



<p>This is a game that died two years ago, and it is unclear whether the attacker&#8217;s purpose is to call the community back to this game or to exploit user information.</p>



<p>Artifact failed because it was review bombed early on, with players dissatisfied with the apparent pay-to-win mechanics; this drove new players away, preventing the game economy from stabilizing at a point where the cost of building winning decks would have been comparable to other digital card games like Hearthstone.</p>



<p>Besides taking advantage of Twitter users who are worried about information being stolen, LayerZero&#8217;s fake account pages also post reclaimed content if it is affected by the hack; this is completely a form of a scam aimed at appropriating user assets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>EU lawmakers are advancing the controversial European Data Act, despite crypto community protests.</em></li>



<li><em>The inclusion of a kill switch option for smart contracts has sparked concerns among decentralized finance advocates.</em></li>



<li><em>The European Commission is developing the digital euro, prioritizing privacy protection and accessibility, including offline payments.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Despite protests from the crypto community, European Union (EU) lawmakers have made substantial progress in enacting the contentious European Data Act.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-236.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1019" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-236.png" alt="European Lawmakers Promote Kill Switch For Smart Contracts Act" class="wp-image-200057" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-236.png 1019w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-236-300x226.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-236-768x579.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-236-750x565.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1019px) 100vw, 1019px" title="European Lawmakers Promote Kill Switch For Smart Contracts Act 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>The legislation is intended to encourage the use of data resources for algorithm training, however, the inclusion of a kill switch option for smart contracts has raised worries among proponents of decentralized finance.</p>



<p>The planned amendment to the EU&#8217;s smart contract laws, which includes the kill switch option, calls into question the core idea of trust inside smart contracts.</p>



<p>The capacity to cancel smart contracts, according to critics, defies the entire basis of their self-executing and immutable character. The crypto community pushes for smart contract integrity and reliability, emphasizing the need for safe and transparent transactions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-237.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-237-1024x576.png" alt="European Lawmakers Promote Kill Switch For Smart Contracts Act" class="wp-image-200058" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-237-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-237-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-237-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-237-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-237-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-237.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="European Lawmakers Promote Kill Switch For Smart Contracts Act 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>At the same time, the <a href="https://coincu.com/196640-european-still-plan-digital-euro-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Commission</a> developed a legislative strategy for the digital euro, with the objective of making it a widely recognized and readily accessible payment mechanism.</p>



<p>Individuals will be able to get digital euros via their banks upon request, enabling quick access and avoiding exclusion, according to the idea.</p>



<p>In addition, the proposal includes provisions for free basic <a href="https://coincu.com/198610-european-union-plan-for-digital-euro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital euro</a> services, privacy protection, and offline payments. The digital euro plan prioritizes privacy protection. The European Commission understands the need to protect people&#8217;s personal data and financial information. The plan contains stringent privacy safeguards to protect users&#8217; sensitive data, creating trust and confidence in the digital currency ecosystem.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these trends, the <a href="https://coincu.com/196295-european-pauses-digital-euro-support-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European</a> crypto environment has some encouraging news, especially at the municipal level. For example, the National Council of Slovakia introduced an amendment to lower personal income tax on gains from the sale of cryptocurrencies held for at least one year.</p>



<p>Additionally, the proposal recognizes the necessity for offline payments, stating that smooth transactions should be possible even when internet access is restricted or absent. This characteristic enables the digital euro&#8217;s practicability and usage in a variety of contexts, adapting to people&#8217;s unique requirements and circumstances.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em><em>The UK&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued guidelines for digital asset marketing.</em></em></li>



<li><em>The guidelines will come into effect on October 8, 2023, and apply to both domestic and international crypto businesses targeting UK clients.</em></li>



<li><em>Crypto companies will have four legitimate avenues to comply with the FCA&#8217;s marketing guidelines.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom (UK) has alerted crypto companies about upcoming financial marketing guidelines for UK clients.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-232.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-232-1024x683.png" alt="FCA Announces Strict Measures To Prohibit The Illegal Promotion Of Crypto" class="wp-image-200051" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-232-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-232-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-232-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-232-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-232-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-232.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="FCA Announces Strict Measures To Prohibit The Illegal Promotion Of Crypto 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/185525-uks-fca-control-of-crypto-atms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK financial watchdog</a> has said that crypto enterprises in the nation would have four legitimate avenues to comply with its guidelines for <a href="https://coincu.com/193228-youtube-tiktok-twitter-face-complaints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital asset marketing</a>, which will go into effect on October 8, 2023.</p>



<p>The FCA issued these restrictions on June 8, citing a poll that found that 10% of 2000 participants owned some type of crypto asset or another and that crypto ownership in the UK quadrupled from 2021 to 2022.</p>



<p>The FCA made the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/letter-to-cryptoasset-firms-financial-promotions-regime.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a> in a letter sent to crypto firms on Tuesday and signed by Victoria McLoughlin, Head of Digital Assets Supervision, Policy, and Competition in the Department of Market Interventions, and Lucy Castledine, Director of Consumer Investments Supervision, Policy, and Competition. The UK financial watchdog stated in this letter that the new regulations apply to any enterprises, domestic or international, offering digital assets to UK people. Even if the <a href="https://coincu.com/200034-uk-bill-to-help-seize-crypto-used-for-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK</a> is just a portion of the goal, the restrictions will be applicable to international enterprises.</p>

<p>A financial promotion, according to the FCA, is any offer or incentive to participate in investing activity or claims management activity that is conveyed in the course of business. Starting on October 8, 2023, crypto asset marketing may be conveyed by an authorized person or an unauthorized person with the permission of an authorized person.</p>



<p>The last two alternatives are to transmit the promotion via a crypto business licensed under UK money laundering regulations or to use the FSMA&#8217;s Financial Promotion Order exemption. The guidelines encompass website, mobile app, and social media postings, as well as online advertising.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The prolonged Ripple case raises concerns and controversy among the crypto community.</em></li>



<li><em>Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton clarifies statements amid criticism.</em></li>



<li><em>Anticipation grows for summary judgment in Ripple vs. SEC case.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The duration of the XRP case between Ripple Labs and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is causing alarm on Crypto Twitter, and Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has been caught in the thick of it.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>It all started when a Twitter user known as Mr. Huber pointed to a comment made last year by Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse had previously said that a decision on the case would be made in weeks. Additionally, XRP lawyer Deaton had said that the litigation would be concluded shortly. Yet it&#8217;s been more than a year since that remark, and no judgment has been issued. As a result, Mr. Huber said that there had been some contradictions in the information disseminated to the public.</p>



<p>In answer, <a href="https://coincu.com/120624-john-deaton-says-jay-clayton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deaton</a> attempted to clarify that he is a regular speaker who may need to be more eloquent. As a result, anybody who cites him out of context does so at their own risk.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Also, go back and look at EVERYTHING I said,<br>Not just one word. I said there was one case that Judge Torres ruled SJ at the same time as her Daubert ruling, one time her SJ ruling came 2 months after the Daubert ruling, one case her SJ ruling came 4 months after the Daubert…</p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1676252819542917120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 4, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Deaton advised Huber to consider every remark he had previously made concerning a potential summary judgment in the Ripple vs. SEC case rather than focusing on a single phrase or statement.</p>



<p>Notwithstanding his prediction of an early summary judgment, the lawyer remembers conflicting summary judgment deadlines set by Judge Analisa Torres.</p>



<p>At one point, the judge presiding over the <a href="https://coincu.com/196351-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-2nd-circuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple vs. SEC case</a> issued a summary judgment along with her famed Daubert finding. On another occasion, her summary judgment decision arrived two months after the Daubert decision.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-230.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-230-1024x683.png" alt="The Ripple Lawsuit Saga: Crypto Twitter In Uproar As Verdict Delays Raise Concerns" class="wp-image-200045" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-230-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-230-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-230-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-230-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-230-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-230.png 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The Ripple Lawsuit Saga: Crypto Twitter In Uproar As Verdict Delays Raise Concerns 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>He went on to cite additional instances where there was a 4-month or 6-month time gap between her summary judgment finding and the Daubert ruling. Moreover, he said that he was startled but not surprised that the litigation lasted beyond June.</p>



<p>It seems that not only the XRP community but the entire crypto community in the world is eagerly awaiting the summary judgment of the famous historical lawsuit in the crypto world. Besides, there is more and more controversy surrounding the <a href="https://coincu.com/197931-ripple-another-lawyer-withdraws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple lawsuit</a> as it is still dragging on.</p>

<p>Bill Morgan, a pro-XRP attorney, recently commented on a Twitter discussion between Coinbase&#8217;s top legal officer and John Deaton. Morgan emphasized anomalies in the exchange&#8217;s handling of assets, like XRP, as the two addressed the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s remedial action on Coinbase and the support that the exchange has gotten from financial institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The UK Parliament has approved a law to confiscate and freeze crypto in money laundering cases.</em></li>



<li><em>The bill includes measures against terrorism and assistance to police in seizing crypto assets.</em></li>



<li><em>The law is in the final stages of approval and is part of the UK government&#8217;s efforts to combat illicit cryptocurrency usage.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The upper chamber of Parliament has approved a new law that aims to allow authorities in the <a href="https://coincu.com/127075-the-united-kingdom-eliminate-illegal-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK</a> to confiscate and freeze crypto in money laundering cases.</strong></h5>

<p>The House of Lords approved the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill, which was initially <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-crackdown-on-fraud-and-money-laundering-to-protect-uk-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposed</a> in September of last year, today, putting it one step closer to becoming law.</p>



<p>Although the House of Lords did not update the bill&#8217;s crypto provisions, it was revised during earlier proceedings to ensure that the measures applied to terrorist cases and measures to assist police in seizing property that may help identify crypto related to crime were introduced. In addition, an amendment was made to guarantee that courts might request that authorities confiscate and freeze cryptocurrency used in criminal activity.</p>

<p>The bill&#8217;s progress comes only days after King Charles III, the UK&#8217;s constitutional monarch, <a href="https://coincu.com/198977-breaking-uk-now-admits-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed</a> the Financial Services and Markets Bill 2023 into law. The Act contains rules for the regulation of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. It also contains procedures for monitoring cryptocurrency marketing, which the Financial Conduct Authority intends to implement by October 8, 2023.</p>



<p>However, the new bill&#8217;s adoption by the UK&#8217;s upper house means it only needs a few more stages to become law: a successful review by the lower chamber, the House of Commons, agreement on further revisions by both chambers and approval by King Charles III.</p>

<p>Many amendments to the bill have been proposed by UK politicians in recent months. They introduced measures in November to allow public authorities to confiscate digital assets related to terrorist activities and to seize properties that may aid in the identification of cryptocurrencies linked to a crime.</p>



<p>The government said in March that combatting illicit usage of cryptocurrency as part of its three-year economic crime program. The government has sent crypto tactical consultants to police departments around the country to assist in the identification and seizure of digital assets linked to the crime.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Hong Kong government is considering creating its own stablecoin, HKDG, to strengthen the city&#8217;s digital economy and increase financial sector efficiency.</em></li>



<li><em>Experts suggest a government-backed HKDG could offer more confidence and reduced risk compared to private stablecoins, potentially competing with major stablecoins like USDT and USDC.</em></li>



<li><em>The launch of HKDG could be a significant step towards de-dollarization and encourage other sovereign currencies to follow suit, promoting global financial market diversity.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government&#8217;s continued promotion and adoption of digital assets puts it ahead of nations or areas such as the United States and <a href="https://coincu.com/199716-singapore-to-ban-crypto-staking-lending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Singapore</a>. Stablecoins, which bridge the gap between conventional banking and the digital economy, are becoming more significant in this setting.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong SAR government is actively fostering the development of digital assets and the digital economy, owing to the fast expansion of the global digital asset market.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, the Hong Kong dollar stablecoin has the potential to increase the efficiency and inclusivity of Hong Kong&#8217;s financial sector. Its stability, unrestricted convertibility, high security, open source, and cross-border liquidity can facilitate a broader spectrum of financial innovations. The introduction of the Hong Kong dollar stablecoin would surely boost the economy and contribute to the city&#8217;s competitiveness in the digital economy.</p>



<p>But, industry experts believe the government&#8217;s present attitude of enabling private institutions to produce Hong Kong dollar stablecoins is too cautious. This technique may result in stablecoins with limited market influence, as shown by Singapore&#8217;s XSGD.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-225.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="842" height="596" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-225.png" alt="Hong Kong Considers Launching HKDG Stablecoin To Boost Digital Economy" class="wp-image-200029" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-225.png 842w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-225-300x212.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-225-768x544.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-225-120x86.png 120w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-225-750x531.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px" title="Hong Kong Considers Launching HKDG Stablecoin To Boost Digital Economy 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to the experts, a Hong Kong dollar stablecoin backed by the city&#8217;s foreign currency reserves and government restrictions might offer a second layer of security. A stablecoin like HKDG might compete with major stablecoins like <a href="https://coincu.com/196860-tether-to-launch-usdt-on-kava/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USDT</a> and USDC, which have market capitalizations of $830 billion and $280 billion, respectively. Considering Hong Kong&#8217;s $430 billion in foreign currency reserves, a government-backed HKDG provides more confidence and reduced risk.</p>



<p>The projected HKDG might potentially be a major step toward de-dollarization. Although it may not be able to threaten the US dollar&#8217;s dominance on its own, it may be able to do so inside the digital asset ecosystem. The successful deployment of HKDG might motivate other sovereign currencies to follow suit, fostering global financial market diversity.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-226-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-226-1024x683.png" alt="Hong Kong Considers Launching HKDG Stablecoin To Boost Digital Economy" class="wp-image-200030" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-226-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-226-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-226-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-226-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-226-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-226.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Hong Kong Considers Launching HKDG Stablecoin To Boost Digital Economy 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>In short, the appeal for a government-backed stablecoin like HKDG emphasizes Hong Kong&#8217;s potential and need to build a more dominating position in the fast-rising digital economy.</p>



<p>This approach contrasts sharply with the efforts of other nations and regions, such as the United States and Singapore, which have steadily improved their digital asset rules. <a href="https://coincu.com/198148-hong-kong-rating-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Kong</a> has shown to the rest of the world its acceptance and openness to the digital asset market.</p>

<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has recently announced that Lawrence Wong, Singapore&#8217;s Minister of Finance, will serve as the chairman of the board of directors of MAS and the chairman of the Investment Strategy Committee of the Singapore Government Investment Corporation. This announcement comes as the current chairman, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, steps down from his position after serving as chairman for twelve years. Wong, who has been serving as Deputy Chairman of MAS since June 2021, will take over the position on 8 July 2023.</p>



<p>As the agency responsible for regulating cryptocurrencies in Singapore, MAS plays a crucial role in the country&#8217;s cryptocurrency industry. With Wong&#8217;s appointment as chairman of the board of directors, industry experts are speculating on how this change in leadership will impact the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in Singapore.</p>

<p>In addition to Wong&#8217;s appointment, Gan Kim Yong, Singapore&#8217;s Minister for Trade and Industry, will also be appointed to the MAS Board and serve as Deputy Chairman. These changes in leadership highlight the Singaporean government&#8217;s continued commitment to promoting a strong and stable financial regulatory environment.</p>



<p>Singapore has been a leader in the cryptocurrency industry, with the government actively promoting the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. With the appointment of Lawrence Wong as chairman of the board of directors of MAS, the country is poised to continue its leadership in the industry and support the growth of innovative financial technologies.</p>

<p>The first stage, Pre-Launch, is focused on ensuring all mainnet parameters are correctly configured. The network will be tested with a few permissioned validators and operators to ensure a smooth launch before moving on to the next phase.</p>



<p>During the Limited Launch phase, a complete set of verified operators will be introduced to ensure high performance for validators. The focus will shift to onboarding whitelisted non-verified operators during the Launch stage, including up to 100 operators.</p>



<p>The final stage, Permissionless Launch, is the true spirit of ssv.network, aiming to achieve a fully operational launch for everyone to join. This includes the registration of permissionless operators and validators to the network, allowing everyone to use the open protocol to build or stake.</p>

<p>To ensure a successful launch and continued growth, ssv.network has established a robust flow between various parties, including the SSV DAO, the core team, builders, verified operators, operators, community and ambassadors, auditors, and internal testers. Each of these parties plays a critical role in building a strong ecosystem.</p>



<p>Taking a phased approach to the rollout of a DVT Network is necessary to ensure that the many actors and stakeholders in the network are aligned. Launching a network comes with a considerable amount of complexity, and facilitating validators’ trustless and permissionless operation on a meshlike network is no easy task.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>John Deaton is a Coinbase (XRP) holders&#8217; attorney and filed an amicus brief on behalf of 75,000 XRP holders in the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. </strong></h5>

<p>Recently, he shared an update on the XRP v. SEC lawsuit. According to Deaton, a total of 2,331 customers have joined to potentially be heard as amici curiae in SEC v. Coinbase. This move is significant because it allows users to speak up for themselves and not let the SEC or XRP speak for them.</p>



<p>Deaton&#8217;s involvement in the lawsuit dates back to June when the SEC initiated its lawsuit against <a href="https://coincu.com/199950-bitget-to-launch-new-product/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/199950-bitget-to-launch-new-product/" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP</a>. At that time, Deaton expressed his interest in participating in the lawsuit, stating, &#8220;Some of us just don&#8217;t want the SEC gaslighting the Court that it&#8217;s protecting us.&#8221; To establish a putative class of customers and crypto account holders who use the Binance and Coinbase platforms, Deaton made available an online form. He noted that if there is enough interest, a request to participate might be made, and amicus status could be granted to ensure users&#8217; voices are heard.</p>

<p>Coinbase filed its answer and notice of intent to file a motion to dismiss the SEC&#8217;s complaint against it. Coinbase argues that the SEC lacks authority to pursue civil claims because crypto assets traded on its platform are not &#8220;investment contracts&#8221; and, thus, not securities. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will respond to Coinbase&#8217;s initial legal defense on July 13, according to a recent court ruling. </p>



<p>The hearing date has been moved up due to a defense tactic used by Coinbase, in which the exchange filed its initial answer 40 days before the deadline of Aug. 7. Additionally, the court changed the pretrial conference to a premotion conference and moved it from Aug. 24 to July 13 at 2:00 p.m. UT. It will be interesting to see how this lawsuit unfolds and what impact it will have on the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.</p>

<p>While central banks are researching or trialing CBDC pilots, the feasibility of current models is being questioned. In particular, there hasn&#8217;t been an actual CBDC model that is technically a replacement for cash and they all have several flaws. Issuing a CBDC would be a mammoth undertaking for multiple reasons.</p>



<p>The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) is working on a &#8220;unified ledger&#8221; system for global interoperability. However, Aboualfa raised concerns about the complexity of establishing trading pairs and difficulty in maintaining a peg between CBDC brands issued by commercial banks. He used the Silicon Valley Bank as an example, saying that if it had issued a CBDC, consumers would have lost confidence as soon as it fell into distress, causing its token to lose parity with other dollar-pegged CBDCs.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CBDCs.webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="959" height="505" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CBDCs.webp" alt="CBDCs" class="wp-image-199998" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CBDCs.webp 959w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CBDCs-300x158.webp 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CBDCs-768x404.webp 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CBDCs-750x395.webp 750w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" title="CBDCs Fall Short as Cash Replacement, Copper Research Reveals 26"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The researcher explained that CBDCs can be issued in two different ways, directly from a central bank or via commercial banks. While central banks don&#8217;t have the talent or the infrastructure to run a fully automated decentralized equivalent to cash, commercial bank-issued CBDCs could lead to chaos in decentralized open markets if scandalous news hits one of the banks. Consumer confidence issues could arise if tokens have specific commercial bank branding.</p>



<p>Aboualfa pointed out that the crucial factor of CBDC interoperability has not been adequately considered. Arguing current designs point to multiple blockchains with intermediaries controlling the flow, he questioned how everyone is supposed to agree on the design and structure of a CBDC worldwide at the same time. The designs and models need to allow for integration, not vendor lock-in, and every central bank will have different considerations and requirements.</p>



<p>CBDCs are still in their early stages and there is much work to be done in order to make them a viable cash equivalent for daily transactions. There are concerns about the feasibility of current models, complexity of establishing trading pairs, and difficulty in maintaining a peg between CBDC brands issued by commercial banks. Interoperability and integration are key factors that need to be addressed to ensure that CBDCs can be used effectively in a global context.</p>
