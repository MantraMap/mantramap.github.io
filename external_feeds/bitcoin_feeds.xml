Prices rose as traders continued to react to a recent tweet from Elon Musk. Another notable gainer was polkadot, which rose nearly 7% higher.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) was a notable mover during Friday’s session, as the meme coin climbed to a multi-month high. This occurred as price continued its reaction to a recent Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1681691639922806784?s=20">tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.06855 on Thursday, DOGE/USD surged to an intraday peak of $0.07639 earlier today.</p>
<p>This resulted in dogecoin hitting its strongest point since May 6, when its price peaked above $0.0800.</p>

<p>One of the catalysts behind today’s move was a breakout of the 62.00 level on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is now at 64.24, with an upcoming resistance point of 66.00 a possible target for buyers.</p>
<p>Earlier momentum has marginally faded, with DOGE now trading at $0.074.</p>

<h2>Polkadot (DOT)</h2>
<p>Additionally, polkadot (DOT) also rallied to end the week, as the token rose by as much as 7% in today’s session.</p>
<p>DOT/USD jumped to a high of $5.69 on Friday, which was a day after the price fell to a bottom at $5.15.</p>
<p>As a result of this rally, polkadot peaked at its highest level since last Friday, when it reached a then two-month high of $5.74.</p>

<p>The token edged lower after bulls were unable to extend gains towards a key resistance level of $6.00.</p>
<p>Overall, this appeared to come as price strength failed to surge past its own ceiling at the 60.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the indicator is now closing in on this point, and in the event it breaks beyond this zone, DOT will likely climb past the $6.00 mark.</p>

The U.S. attorney asserts that Bankman-Fried intended to discredit the government&#8217;s key witness by disseminating the diary content.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX Co-Founder Allegedly Leaked Caroline Ellison’s Diary Excerpts</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) isn&#8217;t pleased with a New York Times (NYT) article that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ex-alameda-ceo-caroline-ellisons-google-docs-diary-exposes-struggles-prior-to-ftx-collapse/">published excerpts</a> from former Alameda Research CEO <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/caroline-ellisons-testimony-claims-ftx-boss-sbf-directed-her-to-co-mingle-customer-funds-since-2019/">Caroline Ellison</a>’s online diary. A <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.176.0.pdf">letter</a> to presiding judge Lewis Kaplan alleges the information was leaked by defendant Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced FTX co-founder. Although the department acknowledges the NYT article “does not indicate who provided the documents to the article’s authors,” prosecutors suspect the defendant was responsible.</p>
<p>U.S. attorney Williams states:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is apparent that documents were shared by the defendant with the article’s reporters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors suspect the leak was disseminated to discredit Ellison, who will testify against Bankman-Fried in October. The government is requesting an order that “limits extrajudicial statements by parties and witnesses.” Bankman-Fried&#8217;s alleged actions are said to pose a &#8220;core concern&#8221; with “disseminating material related to the ‘testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses.’”</p>

<p>The Department of Justice details that leaks like these could potentially contaminate the jury pool and possibly &#8220;deter other witnesses from testifying.&#8221; The NYT article describes how Ellison&#8217;s romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried became problematic, and she questioned her suitability for leading Alameda Research.</p>
<p>“By selectively sharing certain private documents with the New York Times, the defendant is attempting to discredit a witness, cast Ellison in a poor light, and advance his defense through the press and outside the constraints of the courtroom and rules of evidence: that Ellison was a jilted lover who perpetrated these crimes alone,” Williams&#8217; letter to Kaplan concludes.</p>

Ethereum was also down on Friday.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) remained in the red on Friday, as the cryptocurrency moved back below the $30,000 level.</p>
<p>After hitting a high of $30,406.45 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to a bottom at $29,638.10 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This decline resulted in bitcoin moving near Tuesday&#x2019;s floor at $29,525, which was a one-month low.</p>

<p>The latest sell-off came as the relative strength index (RSI) dropped below a key support point at 49.00.</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is tracking at 48.09, with the 46.00 mark a potential target for sellers.</p>
<p>Additionally, the 10-day (red) moving average has begun separating from its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could be a sign of an upcoming downturn.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>After making a strong rebound on Thursday, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was largely lower in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD edged to a bottom at $1,879.73 earlier today, which comes a day after peaking around $1,920.</p>
<p>Friday&#x2019;s sell-off briefly sent ethereum below a support level of $1,880, however bulls have since moved to stabilize this floor.</p>

<p>Unlike with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum&#x2019;s 10-day (red) moving average remains upwards facing, which could be a sign of sentiment in the market being bullish.</p>
<p>In order to validate this theory, there will first have to be a breakout on the RSI, in particular of a ceiling at 52.00.</p>
<p>The index is currently tracking at 49.86.</p>

Anatoly Aksakov, who was involved in the recent adoption of the new digital ruble legislation, highlighted some of the advantages of programmable central bank money as he sees them.</strong></p>
<h2>Central Bank of Russia to Cap Digital Ruble Payments at CBDC Launch, Aksakov Expects</h2>
<p>Russia’s recently adopted digital ruble law allows the Bank of Russia to limit the use of its central bank digital currency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>) and, according to the head of the parliamentary Financial Market Committee, Anatoly Aksakov, the monetary authority will set some restrictions after its initial introduction.</p>
<p>The legislation was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-state-duma-passes-digital-ruble-law/">passed</a> by the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, last week. On Wednesday, the Federation Council, the upper house of the Federal Assembly of Russia, approved the bill in turn. It will enter into force once it’s signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Parlamentskaya Gazeta newspaper, Aksakov pointed out that the digital incarnation of the Russian ruble will allow government authorities and the currency’s users to control how their money is being spent by others through smart contracts.</p>

<p>“For example, you give money to a child who goes to school, stipulating that the money can only be spent on breakfast, books or textbooks, and nothing else. Accordingly, no matter how great their desire is to use it for other purposes, it will be impossible to do so,” Aksakov explained.</p>
<p>“That is, the intended use of the money allocated by the parents to their child will be prescribed,” the lawmaker added. Which means no harmful sweets for pupils with parents’ digital rubles, the official publication of the Russian parliament elaborated.</p>
<p>The same principle will apply to the allocation of state money for the implementation of specific programs, Anatoly Aksakov emphasized. He believes this will increase the efficiency of the use of budgetary funds. Businesses can also take advantage of the programmable CBDC in their transactions, the lawmaker is convinced.</p>

These will be related to the termination of derivatives with clients and arrangements to compensate retail customers.</strong></p>
<h2>ASIC Revokes Financial Services License of Crypto Exchange FTX Subsidiary</h2>
<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) announced it had canceled the financial services license of FTX Australia, a company owned by the failed crypto exchange FTX which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy in the United States last fall.</p>
<p>“ASIC has cancelled the Australian financial services (AFS) license held by FTX Australia Pty Ltd (FTX Australia), effective from 14 July 2023,” the regulatory body said in a <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-193mr-asic-cancels-afs-licence-of-ftx-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> published Thursday on its website.</p>
<p>Under the cancellation terms, FTX Australia will be permitted to provide limited financial services related to the termination of existing derivatives with clients until the end of July 12, 2024, the Commission noted and also highlighted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The cancellation has no effect on requirements for FTX Australia to continue as a member of Australian Financial Complaints Authority, and to have arrangements for compensating retail clients.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Bahamas-headquartered FTX, which was one of the world’s largest digital asset exchanges, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the State of Delaware on Nov. 11, 2022, amid liquidity issues. Its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was extradited to the U.S. where he faces a lawsuit for alleged fraud.</p>
<p>Also on Nov. 11, Australian authorities appointed three voluntary administrators of FTX Australia and its subsidiary, FTX Express Pty Ltd which, according to the securities regulator, operates a digital currency exchange not regulated by ASIC.</p>
<p>FTX Australia’s AFS license was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/australia-suspends-financial-services-license-of-local-ftx-entity/">suspended</a> by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on Nov. 14, 2022. The suspension, initially imposed until May 15, 2023, was later extended to July 24, 2023.</p>

The round, led by Dragonfly, aims to help issue Ethena&#8217;s decentralized stablecoin product in Q3 2023, which was inspired by an article written by former Bitmex CEO Arthur Hayes.</strong></p>
<h2>Stablecoin Protocol Ethena Raises $6.5 Million in Seed Funding Round</h2>
<p>Ethena, an Ethereum stablecoin protocol, has <a href="https://twitter.com/ethena_labs/status/1681592637537816578?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> $6.5 million in its seed round. The funding round led by Dragonfly Capital also had the participation of former Bitmex CEO <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-predicts-bitcoin-bull-market-as-us-economy-worsens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur Hayes</a> and some derivatives exchanges such as Deribit, Bybit, Okx, Gemini, and Huobi. Ethena&#8217;s goal is to bring to fruition a stablecoin that has no connection with the traditional financial system.</p>
<p>The protocol was inspired by the &#8220;<a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/dust-on-crust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dust on Crust</a>&#8221; Arthur Hayes article, where he explains how a stablecoin can be constructed using <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delta-neutral</a> techniques, derivatives, and onchain collateral. Ethena uses the concept of the &#8220;Nakadollar,&#8221; which Hayes proposed using Bitcoin, and applies it to Ethereum instead, looking to turn this cryptocurrency &#8220;into the first crypto-native yield-bearing stablecoin which is not reliant on the banking system.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Ethena, this stablecoin has a potential market of more than 130 billion, given that they view their permissionless savings return product as &#8220;the largest market opportunity that crypto can provide for the world.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Usde and the Internet Bonds</h2>
<p>Ethena projects to issue their financial instruments in two phases. The first one includes the rollout of usde, an on-chain collateral derivatives-based stablecoin product, estimated to be available by Q3 2023, using the funds raised during this round.</p>
<p>A later phase will include issuing what Ethena calls the internet bond. The internet bond is projected to behave as a traditional U.S. treasury without being linked to any central bank or financial institution, building on staked Ethereum deposits and usde, developing &#8220;the first globally accessible and permissionless crypto savings instrument.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dragonfly general partner Tom Schmidt reinforced the relevance of a truly decentralized, stable, and capital-efficient stablecoin product due to the growth of the usage of stablecoins around the world for savings and remittance-related uses.</p>
<p>Schmidt stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ethena has a breakthrough design that remedies these issues while also benefiting a broad user-base. We&#8217;re thrilled to be partnering with them to bring their vision to life.</p>

According to importers, the Argentine government considers freight costs exceeding 15% of the value of the merchandise imported as an inconsistency.</strong></p>
<h2>Central Bank of Argentina Delays Dollar Disbursements to Importers</h2>
<p>The government of Argentina is now being accused of delaying the delivery of dollars to Argentine importers by using freight costs as an excuse. According to Argentine economist Ignacio Olivera Doll, the government is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/gobierno-niega-dolares-que-dio-para-importar-mercado-sin-bozal#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using</a> a limit for the cost of freights that hadn&#8217;t been applied before, as a basis for these actions.</p>
<p>The government has denied dollar requests for freight payments whose costs exceed 15% of the value of the merchandise transported. Argentine importers, as a result of exchange controls, need to receive dollars via government approval to conduct their operations.</p>
<p>Customs General Manager Guillermo Michel denied this, stating that the payments system was working as usual. Nonetheless, he explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>It happens some parameters are distorted with reality and historical margins. Some importers want to transfer transport amounts higher than those authorized.</p></blockquote>
<p>Numerous payments have been delayed due to this inconsistency during the last two weeks, as the government is being drained of its dollar and yuan reserves to provide importers with already approved resources. According to recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-argentinas-reserves-bleed-central-bank-of-brazil-would-be-able-to-manipulate-digital-real-in-cbdc-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, Argentina&#8217;s net reserves have touched historically low levels, reaching -$7 billion.</p>
<h2>Chinese Yuan-Based Sales Also Rationed</h2>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not only dollar-based disbursements that are being affected by the measures put in place by the Argentine government regarding reserve expenditures. The allocation of yuan reserves to companies that have adopted it as a settlement currency to pay providers has also slowed.</p>
<p>Ambito <a href="https://www.ambito.com/economia/el-banco-central-regula-la-venta-yuanes-mientras-se-negocia-el-fmi-n5773465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that yuan-based allocations have also been reduced in the last few days, going from an average of $90 million per day to less than $10 million daily on July 14 and 17. This reduction might be related to the failure of the government to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about the anticipated disbursement of at least $4 billion.</p>
<p>Argentina has to pay $2.7 billion to the IMF by the end of July. If the government does not reach an agreement for the anticipated disbursement, it might have to use part of the approved Chinese swap line to pay, as it did last month when it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-argentina-settles-imf-payment-in-yuan-brazilian-cbdc-to-be-launched-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used</a> $1 billion in yuan to complete a payment to the IMF.</p>

Among them, 22 nations have formally applied for membership. He believes that the BRICS group could expand to include more than 50 countries.</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS Group Attracts More Than 40 Nations</h2>
<p>Anil Sooklal, South Africa&#8217;s top diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, and officials from the South African foreign affairs department shared the latest stats on BRICS membership applications in a press conference in Johannesburg on Thursday. South Africa will host this year’s BRICS summit. The economic bloc comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Sooklal revealed that 22 countries have formally asked to join the BRICS. He was also quoted by Reuters as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>An equal number of countries … have informally expressed interest in becoming BRICS members &#8230; (including) all the major global south countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Countries interested in joining the BRICS include Argentina, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Comoros, Gabon, and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>The BRICS leaders’ summit will take place on Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg, with one of the key topics on the agenda being the discussion of BRICS expansion. Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, will not be attending in person.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sooklal emphasized the rapid expansion of the BRICS bloc. The diplomat was quoted by IOL news outlet as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the expansion of BRICS, it could increase to include more than 50 countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the topics that has received worldwide attention is the proposed common BRICS currency. Russian news outlet RT recently <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that the BRICS nations are launching a gold-backed currency that will be announced at the August summit. However, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, has insisted that the BRICS <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">does not have an immediate plan</a> to create a common currency to challenge the dominance of the USD.</p>
<p>According to IOL, Sooklal said the topic of BRICS currency is not on the summit agenda. He further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will expand on addressing the idea of deepening interaction in trading in local currencies. Countries want to have greater flexibility and to be less dependent on the dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brazil&#8217;s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in June that he intends to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-to-push-de-dollarization-agenda-at-brics-meeting/">raise the issue of de-dollarization</a> at the summit. He has been vocal about countries ditching the U.S. dollar in global trade and using their national currencies instead. The Brazilian leader has also expressed support for the creation of a common BRICS currency.</p>

<h2>JPMorgan on De-Dollarization Threat</h2>
<p>Global investment bank JPMorgan has warned that the dominance of the U.S. dollar could be at risk due to rising tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as concerns about political instability within the United States.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s strategists, led by Jan Loeys and Joyce Chang, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/jpmorgan-strategists-says-market-fails-to-reflect-threats-to-dollar-dominance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> in a report published on Tuesday that the markets are not adequately factoring in the risk of a “rapid and deep” decline in the U.S. dollar&#8217;s status as the preferred currency for global reserves and trade. They detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>If U.S.-China tensions intensify and we get more global fragmentation, it would likely lead to de-globalization in trade and finance … In finance, it could also lead to de-dollarization.</p></blockquote>
<p>The strategists pointed out that the main factor that could jeopardize the dollar&#8217;s dominance is the political dysfunction within the U.S. They cautioned that this dysfunction could hinder efforts to manage the national debt and prevent the government from stabilizing the economy during a crisis. The U.S. recently averted <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-revises-debt-default-date-us-government-could-exhaust-funds-by-june-5/">defaulting</a> on its debt obligations at the last minute as politicians sparred over debt ceiling limits.</p>
<p>Moreover, the JPMorgan strategists emphasized the potential danger arising from an intensifying rivalry between the U.S. and China, which they described as a possible &#8220;Cold War 2.0.&#8221; They noted that China&#8217;s ambitious economic reforms, which include measures like easing capital constraints and promoting market liquidity, could erode the dollar&#8217;s dominance.</p>
<p>JPMorgan has also warned that a shift away from the U.S. dollar or destabilizing shocks to its value could have broad consequences across multiple asset classes. The bank noted that this could lead to a decrease in the dollar&#8217;s value, lower equity multiples, and higher bond yields.</p>
<p>While the USD may lose its dominance, the strategists believe that it is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-expects-dollar-dominance-to-persist-even-if-china-overtakes-us-as-worlds-largest-economy/">unlikely to be completely replaced</a> as the primary reserve currency within the next decade. Instead, they anticipate a more plausible scenario of “partial de-dollarization,” in which China gradually assumes a more significant role in place of the greenback among nations that are not aligned with the U.S.</p>
<p>Various individuals, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-predicts-end-of-us-dollar-dominance-as-more-countries-de-dollarize/">S&amp;P Global economist</a> Paul Gruenwald, have foreseen the potential decline of the dollar&#8217;s dominance. Nobel laureate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nobel-laureate-paul-krugman-says-us-dollar-dominance-wont-last-forever-but-doubts-chinese-yuan-can-replace-usd/">Paul Krugman</a> also recently said the dollar&#8217;s dominance won&#8217;t last forever but he doubts that the Chinese yuan could replace the greenback.</p>
