					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum price started a fresh decline from the $1,940 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH retested $1,825 and is showing a few bearish signs. Ethereum struggled to settle above the $1,925 and $1,940 resistance levels. The price is trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,895 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it clears the $1,800 support zone. Ethereum Price Drops Again Ethereum’s price started a fresh increase above the $1,850 zone. ETH struggled to settle above the $1,925 and $1,940 resistance levels, similar to Bitcoin at $29,500. A high was formed near $1,939 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a sharp decline below the $1,900 and $1,880 levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,895 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A low is formed near $1,825 and the price is now consolidating losses. Ether price is now trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $1,850 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,939 swing high to the $1,825 low. The next major resistance seems to be forming near $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,939 swing high to the $1,825 low is also near the $1,900 level.

					<description><![CDATA[In the last week, the crypto market has been on an upswing, with most assets recording little amount of market gains. However, CSPR, the native token of the Casper Network, is one of the biggest gainers, surging by 13.9% over the last seven days.  While fairly popular, CSPR has been one of the most impressive tokens of 2023, with a staggering profit record. Chart data from Coingecko shows that the altcoin soared by 60% in the month of April, moving its total market gains in 2023 to a stunning 114.4%. At the time of writing, CSPR is trading around $0.058, with a 6.5% price jump in the last 24 hours. Its daily trading volume, valued at $14.98 million, is up by 41.65%. Meanwhile, its market cap value is set at an impressive $682.12 million.  CSPR Trading At $0.058 &#124; Source: CSPRUSDT Chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: Cardano Price Analysis: $0.46 Hinges On Breaching This Level What Is Casper (CSPR), The Future-Proof Blockchain?  Casper is a developer-friendly, business-centered public blockchain designed to serve as a platform for the secure, fast, and efficient development of sustainable blockchain-based products.  Touted as the future-proof blockchain, Casper is the brainchild of product developer Medha Parlikar and angel investor Mrinal Manohar. The Casper mainnet was launched in 2021, and it runs on a unique variant of the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm known as the Highway Protocol. The Highway Protocol functions as an energy-efficient and flexible consensus protocol, which enables networks to finalize transactions in a non-binary manner, thus allowing blocks on Casper to be created in a faster time than other blockchains.  In addition, Casper offers users upgradeable smart contracts, another unique network feature that allows developers to modify their already deployed contracts, enabling businesses to build blockchain products that adapt to consumer needs and market trends.  Casper is also popular for its low gas fee structure supported by its advanced PoS mechanism. As earlier stated, its native token is known as CSPR and is utilized for payment of network fees, staking, and rewards for network validators.  Related Reading: Render Delivers With 40% Gain As RNDR Dominates Sunday Charts Will CSPR Soar Higher?  Due to CSPR&#8217;s remarkable performance, there is much speculation on the ability of the token to maintain its current bullish momentum as investors try to determine profit-making opportunities. According to the popular crypto prediction site, Coincodex, the investor sentiment presently surrounding CSPR is quite bullish. Meanwhile, its Fear and Greed Index hovers around 60, indicating the token may be a favorable investment at the moment. Coincodex predicts that Casper will rise by 11.42% in the next five days, hitting a price of $0.065. However, their projections do not indicate a long-term faith in CSPR, as they expect the token to have slumped by 30% in the next month. That said, investors are reminded these predictions are merely speculations and should not be relied on as investment advice.  Featured Image: Tino Group, chart from Tradingview.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[XRD, the native token of the Radix network, looks set to end the month in great form, having recorded an impressive 14.2% price surge in the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the cryptocurrency is the 46th-largest token, with a current market cap of $1.1 billion. Meanwhile, blue-chip cryptocurrencies BTC and ETH have also gained 5.2% and 1.5%, respectively, in the last seven days. Related Reading: Radix (XRD) Soars 18% On Heels Of Milestone RCnet Success Radix Up By 167% In 30-Day Price Rally The past week’s headlines were dominated by the First Republic Bank’s ongoing crisis and the anticipated return of Bitcoin’s price to 30k. As a result, the market performance of most altcoins, including Radix, has largely gone under the radar.  CoinGecko data reveals that RDX is one of the best-performing tokens in the last seven days. Interestingly, a broader look at the market shows that this bullish run stretches as far back as a month. In the past 30 days, XRD has rallied a staggering 167% price increase, reaching a 12-month high of $0.15 level during the period. This price upswing came with a boost in market capitalization, enabling Radix to break into the top 50 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. As of this writing, XRD is valued at $0.111545, tallying a 5.1% price jump in the past 24 hours. However, it is worth noting that the coin’s trading volume slipped by 16.40% in the same period, indicating a recent dip in market activity. XRDUSD trading at $0.10774 &#124; Source: XRDUSD chart from TradingView Milestone Radix Upgrade, Babylon, To Launch In July It appears that the recent price rally of Radix is connected to the impending upgrade slated for July. According to Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, Radix’s March fundraiser and the highly-anticipated upgrade seem to have heightened interest in the XRD token.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XRD, the native token of the Radix network, looks set to end the month in great form, having recorded an impressive 14.2% price surge in the past week. According to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/radix" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data from CoinGecko</a>, the cryptocurrency is the 46th-largest token, with a current market cap of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, blue-chip cryptocurrencies BTC and ETH have also gained 5.2% and 1.5%, respectively, in the last seven days.</p>

<h2>Radix Up By 167% In 30-Day Price Rally</h2>
<p>The past week’s headlines were dominated by the First Republic Bank’s ongoing crisis and the anticipated return of Bitcoin’s price to 30k. As a result, the market performance of most altcoins, including Radix, has largely gone under the radar. </p>
<p>CoinGecko data reveals that RDX is one of the best-performing tokens in the last seven days. Interestingly, a broader look at the market shows that this bullish run stretches as far back as a month.</p>
<p>In the past 30 days, XRD has rallied a staggering 167% price increase, reaching a 12-month high of $0.15 level during the period. This price upswing came with a boost in market capitalization, enabling Radix to break into the top 50 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.</p>
<p>As of this writing, XRD is valued at $0.111545, tallying a 5.1% price jump in the past 24 hours. However, it is worth noting that the coin’s trading volume slipped by 16.40% in the same period, indicating a recent dip in market activity.</p>

<h2>Milestone Radix Upgrade, Babylon, To Launch In July</h2>
<p>It appears that the recent price rally of Radix is connected to the impending upgrade slated for July. According to Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, Radix’s March fundraiser and the highly-anticipated upgrade seem to have heightened interest in the XRD token.</p>
<p>Price action reveals that the XRD gained more than 15% on March 23, the day the fundraiser was announced. A week after, the coin would <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/radix-xrd-price-on-52-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience a remarkable price surge</a> in the wake of the Release Candidate network (RCNet) rollout.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Among the top gainers on Sunday, CoinMarketCap shows that Render (RNDR) has achieved a 41% growth over the past week. The crypto actually dominated the roster of the day&#8217;s leading coins. Render (RNDR) has been among the top performing crypto assets in the last few weeks. Render allows owners of the increasingly powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) industry to deliver computing power during periods of low demand. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential Source: CoinMarketCap Render (RNDR) &#8211; At A Glance The Render (RNDR) Network is a blockchain-powered, decentralized, high-performance, distributed-computing platform. It was developed to help businesses in the film, animation, gaming, and architecture industries complete complicated rendering projects quickly and affordably. To fulfill the need of large-scale rendering projects, the RNDR Network offers a scalable and decentralized solution by letting users leverage underutilized GPU capacity from other network participants to speed up their rendering processes. The RNDR coin is the in-network currency that may be exchanged for computer power, staked for network rewards, and used to elect leaders. In sum, the RNDR Network utilizes blockchain technology and distributed computing in an effort to completely overhaul the rendering process. Network Gains Traction And Attention It&#8217;s no surprise that Render has been getting a lot of attention lately, what with the proliferation of the metaverse and the growing need for rendering services in a wide range of enterprises. So, the recent uptick in RNDR should not come as a surprise: widespread consensus among the rendering community to get ready for the inevitable increase in demand. Render debuted in 2017 and spent the first half of 2018 in private sale. Render takes advantage of Ethereum&#8217;s built-in security features when uploading and transferring nodes to operators, as the network is based on the Ethereum blockchain.

					<description><![CDATA[Over the past few weeks, the price of Cardano has experienced significant volatility. The altcoin initially rose from $0.37 but was later rejected at $0.45. However, over the last 24 hours, there has been a slight increase of 1.3%, while the weekly chart indicates a 6.2% price increase. The technical analysis of ADA suggests that the bulls are attempting to take control of the price. Demand and accumulation showed signs of recovery. Related Reading: XRP May Rally Over 10% Upon Breaching Two Critical Levels Despite the slow progress in the ADA price, there is a critical resistance level that must be surpassed to trigger a rally. For the bulls to gain further momentum, buying strength must increase significantly in the upcoming trading sessions. Additionally, major altcoins have been stagnant due to Bitcoin&#8217;s difficulty in reaching $30,000. If BTC reclaims this level, it could propel ADA bulls to drive up the price in the subsequent trading sessions. Furthermore, the market capitalization of ADA has recovered, indicating that buying pressure is returning to the market. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.40. The overhead resistance was $0.42. This level has proven to be a significant hurdle for Cardano in the past, and multiple attempts to break through it have been unsuccessful. However, if ADA manages to move above this resistance level, it could trigger a rally and push the price towards $0.46. On the other hand, if the price falls from its current level, the support level stands at $0.39. If ADA fails to remain above this support level, it could lead to a drop in price to $0.36. The amount of ADA traded in the last session turned green, indicating an influx of buyers. Technical Analysis While there has been a slight uptick in demand for ADA, the buying strength on the daily chart has seen a slight downtick. The Relative Strength Index remains above the half-line, suggesting that buyers still have control of the market. However, Cardano&#8217;s movement below the 20-Simple Moving Average line indicates that sellers may take over soon as the demand is not adequate. This reading implies that sellers are driving the price momentum in the market. ADA formed sell signals in line with other indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence showed red histograms under the half-line, indicating a signal to sell, based on price momentum and reversals.

					<description><![CDATA[Since 2020, XRP has struggled to remain relevant and valuable to its investors. The US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s attack on the project brought a drastic decline that no one expected. However, amid the ongoing case, XRP showed resilience, leading supporters to commend it as an asset to watch.

But today, the global market cap is up by 0.06%. XRP surpassed the first five assets with a 2.33% price gain in 24 hours.  XRP Price Gains Even With Declining Network Activities  The current price outlook for XRP is positive. The controversial asset trades above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages.  XRP price is $0.4814, with a 2.33% increase in 24 hours.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 2020, XRP has struggled to remain relevant and valuable to its investors. The US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s attack on the project brought a drastic decline that no one expected.

					<description><![CDATA[Cosmos (ATOM) demand has risen these past few days, resulting in a significant performance. According to CoinMarketCap data ATOM price has fallen to $11.69 after gaining momentum. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Down 4% As Developer Accuses Terraport Of Rugpull The current market cap of ATOM is $3.3 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $100 million. However, the trading volume is still down by 31.18%, indicating reduced network activity.  Reason Behind The Surge In Cosmos? Cosmos is a constantly growing network of interconnected blockchains created with developer-friendly application components.  Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is the technology that connects these apps. The SDK platform Cosmos offers allows programmers to produce top-notch decentralized apps (dApps). Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential Other developers have also constructed applications on top of it, such as MM Finance and VVS Finance. Cosmo&#8217;s (ATOM) recent price surge could be attributed to its influx of developers topping that of Ethereum.  The other reason for the ATOM price increase might be the announcement from dYdX that it is building an independent blockchain on the Cosmos ecosystem instead of Ethereum. Also, Bitcoin price soared above $29,000, pushing the market cap of all cryptocurrencies to surpass $1 trillion. Many crypto assets, including ATOM, recorded price growth due to correlation to BTC.  ATOM Price Action Below is the technical analysis of ATOM price action on the 4-hour trading timeframe. And also the possible resistance and support zones. Cosmos has broken through the short-term resistance level of $11.69 and is currently trading between $10.571 and $15.484 support and resistance levels. ATOM must break through the $15.484 primary resistance level to confirm the bullish momentum. However, the bears are trying hard to break the $10.571 support level but couldn’t due to the high bullish momentum. If the bull&#8217;s strength is not strong enough to push ahead, the bears might take over the trend and cause a trend reversal. What Do The Technical Aspects Suggest? ATOM’s 50-Day SMA&#8217;s change in direction caused the market&#8217;s structure to change. If the bullish momentum doesn&#8217;t pick up, the trend may change to a potential bearish market.  The 50-Day SMA established a Death Cross by crossing below the 200-Day SMA, indicating a potentially bearish signal and suggesting a selling opportunity. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis indicator enables traders to determine the momentum and strength of the price movement of an asset within a period. At the time of analysis, the RSI of ATOM/USDT is at 61.74 above the neutral zone. Therefore, this shows that ADA is neither in the overbought nor oversold zone. However, the buyers are building momentum to take ADA to the overbought zone while the seller pushes it down despite weak momentum.

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) is in a downtrend as it sheds some of its recent price gains. Despite the price decline, it is experiencing a surge in transaction volume on the network. The network holds the enviable reputation of being a developer&#8217;s hub, with several exciting projects launched on its network.  However, it is still subject to the general economic factors influencing cryptocurrencies, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  Crypto Analyst Reviews ADA’s Performance A crypto analyst on Twitter, Elite XBT, noted that Cardano transaction volume has increased since the start of 2023. However, he stated that market volatility had put the price under significant pressure.  According to the chart, the transaction volume fell below 10B ADA in January 2023. However, it has risen above 20B ADA and possibly reclaimed its 50B ADA at its all-time high (ATH) value last year. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Down 4% As Developer Accuses Terraport Of Rugpull According to another analyst, the increase in transaction volume is a function of increased activities from the whales and institutional holders. He believes the increased volume is a bullish sign and supports ADA&#8217;s swing into an uptrend. Also, Input Output Global (IOG), responsible for Cardano&#8217;s research and development, shared its weekly development report. The report revealed that Cardano’s network had processed 65.4 million transactions within the past week. Notably, Cardano surpassed 4 million wallets on its network in March 2023. It indicates the continued growth potential of the Cardano network as more investors sign up.  Twitter user Alexander Legolas also believes that the current trend would shift from bear to bull as the protocols and upgrades become more attractive to users. What Next For ADA? ADA is still trading in the red today, forming a second consecutive red candle on the daily chart. The bears have returned to push their price down in the last two days. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 51.24 in the neutral zone. Notably, the indicator is moving downwards due to bearish pressure. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential ADA&#8217;s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) has dropped below its signal line, a bearish sentiment. However, despite its price slump, ADA has remained above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA). It implies that its short and long-term outlook remains bullish, and the decline might be a brief retracement for consolidation. The $0.3512 support will prove critical to prevent a further decline and might act as a price pivot to resume the uptrend. However, ADA must overcome the $0.4186 resistance to continue its uptrend.  ADA will likely resume its uptrend in the coming days based on the positive activities and increased transactions on its network to fuel the rally.

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin is trading in the green today, between the $89.78 and $90 price level, to consolidate on yesterday’s closing price of $89.73. LTC started the year trading at $70 on January 1, 2023. It moved to $80 by January 10 as the bulls seized control. The crypto traded at $100.44 on February 1 for the first time in 2023. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Down 4% As Developer Accuses Terraport Of Rugpull However, market volatility has forced the asset to retest its old lows and is currently trading in the $89-$90 price range. A closer look at the daily chart would reveal its price action and next possible moves. Litecoin Price On An Uptrend LTC has formed a green candle on the price chart today, a slight recovery from the bearish trend noticed on the chart on April 28. However, today&#8217;s price change is not by a wide margin as it remains a sideways trend despite its gains. LTC is trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a short and long-term bullish sentiment for the asset. Its Relative Strength Index is 48.18 in the neutral zone. Also, the indicator is moving sideways, reflecting the sideways trend on the daily chart.  Litecoin has found strong support at the $88.25 level preventing further price decline for the asset. Other critical support levels are $65.39 and $47.5. Its resistance levels are $94.35 and $103.42. The $90 price level is a psychological resistance level that Litecoin is testing today. The coin will likely pivot off the $88.25 resistance level to trade above the $90 price level if the bulls prevail. However, the sideways trend might persist in the short term. Litecoin Halving Historically Bullish Litecoin undergoes halving every four years as a fork from the original Bitcoin blockchain. The Litecoin halving event occurs every 840,000 blocks and will drop LTC miners&#8217; rewards from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC. Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential Blockworks reports that Litecoin historically pumps six months before its halving occurs. LTC peaked at 320% gains approximately 45 days before each halving, then gave up most of those returns a month after the halving event. NEWS: Litecoin halvings coincide with major price changes — but different from bitcoin.https://t.co/zDyxpS8YkI &#8212; Blockworks (@Blockworks_) April 24, 2023 LTC ended the year after each halving, gaining between 80% to 110% on its pre-halving price. Therefore, this event seems to promote positive price action for the asset. Although the hype around halving usually affects price action, other macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and regulation, also affect trends. However, halving events always usher in price volatility and uncertainty. The aim is to reduce the circulating supply of the token and increase scarcity. Given its historical data, the halving event will occur around August 2023 and may affect Litecoin in one way or another. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview]]></description>

<h2><strong>Litecoin Price On An Uptrend</strong></h2>
<p>LTC has formed a green candle on the price chart today, a slight recovery from the bearish trend noticed on the chart on April 28. However, today&#8217;s price change is not by a wide margin as it remains a sideways trend despite its gains.</p>
<p>LTC is trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a short and long-term bullish sentiment for the asset. Its Relative Strength Index is 48.18 in the neutral zone. Also, the indicator is moving sideways, reflecting the sideways trend on the daily chart. </p>
<p>Litecoin has found strong support at the $88.25 level preventing further price decline for the asset. Other critical support levels are $65.39 and $47.5. Its resistance levels are $94.35 and $103.42.</p>

<p>The $90 price level is a psychological resistance level that Litecoin is testing today. The coin will likely pivot off the $88.25 resistance level to trade above the $90 price level if the bulls prevail. However, the sideways trend might persist in the short term.</p>
<h2><b>Litecoin Halving Historically Bullish</b></h2>
<p>Litecoin undergoes <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/litecoin.asp#:~:text=A%20Litecoin%20halving%20refers%20to,are%20given%20for%20each%20block." rel="nofollow">halving</a> every four years as a fork from the original Bitcoin blockchain. The Litecoin halving event occurs every 840,000 blocks and will drop LTC miners&#8217; rewards from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC.</p>

<p>Blockworks reports that Litecoin historically pumps six months before its halving occurs. LTC peaked at 320% gains approximately 45 days before each halving, then gave up most of those returns a month after the halving event.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEWS: Litecoin halvings coincide with major price changes — but different from bitcoin.<a href="https://t.co/zDyxpS8YkI" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/zDyxpS8YkI</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>LTC ended the year after each halving, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwpoYf33q9s" rel="nofollow">gaining between 80% to 110%</a> on its pre-halving price. Therefore, this event seems to promote positive price action for the asset. Although the hype around halving usually affects price action, other macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and regulation, also affect trends.</p>
<p>However, halving events always usher in price volatility and uncertainty. The aim is to reduce the circulating supply of the token and increase scarcity. Given its historical data, the halving event will occur around August 2023 and may affect Litecoin in one way or another.</p>
