<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Bybit will offer crypto exchange and digital asset custody services to users in Cyprus after bagging a license in the country.</li><li>The trading venue sets up shop in Cyprus ahead of the implementation of MiCA, the first crypto regulatory regime in a major jurisdiction.</li><li>Bybit enters Cyprus as Binance exits the country amid global regulatory woes and uncertainty in the U.S. following successive crackdowns by the SEC.</li></ul>



<p>Bybit, one of the world&#8217;s largest centralized exchanges, has obtained a crypto license to offer its services in Cyprus. The move comes ahead of the EU&#8217;s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) which comes into effect by mid-2024. </p>



<p>Regulators in the country have approved Bybit to “offer a full suite of services&#8221;, per a statement from the trading venue. Bybit CEO and co-founder Ben Zhou remarked that the license signals a mix of global expansion and compliance with &#8220;robust regulatory frameworks. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We wholeheartedly support the regulatory objective of building a cryptocurrency industry that is both compliant, secure, and transparent, ultimately benefiting all those seeking financial freedom,”</p></blockquote>



<p>Bybit exited the Canadian market in May due to a regulatory shift in the country. Canadian users will lose access to Bybit&#8217;s trading platform by July/August this year.</p>



<h2>Binane Bows Out Of Cyprus, Bybit Rolls In</h2>



<p>Bybit&#8217;s entrance into the country follows the exit of crypto&#8217;s largest centralized exchange &#8211; Binance. Binance <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-under-investigation-in-france/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-under-investigation-in-france/" rel="noreferrer noopener">deregistered</a> its local arm ahead of <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">MiCA&#8217;s implementation</a> expected next year. The leading crypto exchange also withdrew its crypto license application in Austria per <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-oesterreich/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-oesterreich/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a> today. </p>



<p>The island nation, like a handful of jurisdictions around the world, has noted plans to develop its local crypto industry into a global hub for digital asset innovation. In June 2022, the policymakers in the country tried to pass a bill on digital assets meant to clarify standards for the industry. Ultimately, the bill lost steam and was binned in 2023.</p>

<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s largest bank HSBC officially enabled the trading of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are listed on the region&#8217;s local stock exchange.

<p>HSBC became the first bank in the special administrative region in China to allow easy access to Bitcoin and Ether ETF trading. According to Wu, users will be able to trade three ETFs currently listed including CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF.</p>



<p>The giant bank also launched a Virtual Asset Investor Education Centre to sensitize investors on risk and disclosure related to crypto asset investment. </p>

<ul><li>FTX has sued K5 Global to recover the $700 million invested in it by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</li><li>Bankman-Fried transferred vast sums of money from his trading firm to K5 and other related ventures in 2022.&nbsp;</li><li>The investment reportedly allowed the disgraced FTX founder to gain access to politicians and celebrities in the United States.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt crypto exchange has accused Bankman-Fried of investing billions without proper due diligence.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Bahamas-based bankrupt crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-judge-says-hide-customers-identities/">FTX</a> has sued California-based investment firm K5 Global, founded by a former advisor to top U.S. politician Hillary Clinton. The crypto exchange is looking to claw back a whopping $700 million from K5. The amount was transferred to the investment firm by the crypto exchange’s disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried last year. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX’s Bankman-Fried Invested In K5 To Gain Access To Politicians and Celebrities</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-sues-ex-clinton-aides-investment-firm-700-million-2023-06-22/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, FTX sued K5 Global and its co-founder Michael Kives who previously worked for former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The bankrupt crypto exchange’s latest move was part of an effort to recover the $700 million that was transferred by Bankman-Fried to K5 Global and its associates in 2022 as part of an investment. The funds for this investment were reportedly misappropriated from the crypto exchange. </p>



<p>As per the lawsuit filed in Delaware Bankruptcy Court, internal notes from Bankman-Fried revealed that he was captivated by what Kives and his investment firm had to offer. The disgraced founder described it as “something of a one-stop shop for relationships” that he felt should be utilized by his crypto firm. The weeks following these internal notes reportedly saw the former crypto billionaire sign a term to invest billions of dollars in K5.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>K5 was under the impression – like many others – that SBF was completely legitimate and they were entering into a fair, long-term, and mutually beneficial business relationship. Our belief is that the lawsuit is without merit.” </p><cite>K5 Global spokeswoman </cite></blockquote>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s term sheet also included a $125 million payment for Michael Kives and K5 co-founder Bryan Baum. The latest lawsuit also accused Bankman-Fried of failing to conduct sufficient due diligence before extending vast sums of money to K5 and associated ventures. He reportedly made the investments in order to secure access to high profile personalities, including politicians and celebrities. </p>

<ul><li>A class action lawsuit filed by Celsius investors has been amended to include crypto market maker Wintermute Trading.&nbsp;</li><li>The lawsuit accused Wintermute of aiding CEO Alex Mashinsky in duping Celsius investors.&nbsp;</li><li>The defunct crypto lender’s investors have claimed that the market maker engaged in wash trading to inflate CEL’s value.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A class action lawsuit filed by investors of the Celsius Network has named crypto market maker Wintermute Trading. Wintermute, one of the biggest liquidity providers in the crypto market, has been accused of helping <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arrington-coinbase-acquire-celsius-assets/">Celsius</a> founder and CEO Alex Mashinsky of duping the defunct crypto lender’s investors. </p>



<h2><strong>Celsius Investors: Wintermute Engaged In Wash Trading To Pump CEL</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-23/celsius-investors-claim-crypto-market-maker-wintermute-aided-wash-trading" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, plaintiffs who filed a class action lawsuit against Alex Mashinsky and other Celsius executives amended their complaint to include Wintermute Trading Ltd. The investors have accused the London-based crypto market maker of engaging in wash trading and other malpractices since as early as March 2021. As per the amended complaint, improper activities were adopted to inflate the value of the crypto lender’s native CEL token as well as other loan products. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When deciding whether to trade in CEL Tokens, a reasonable investor would consider it important to know that the Executive Defendants and Wintermute were engaging in manipulative trading with respect to the CEL tokens, and ensuring that the reported trading volumes reflected real market demand.” </p><cite>Amended complaint by Celsius investors</cite></blockquote>



<p>Lawyers representing the disgruntled investors claimed that Wintermute&#8217;s trading activities corrupted the price of the CEL token as well as the trading volume reported by the crypto lending platform. They further accused the market maker of colluding with the lender to engage in a strategic pattern to deceive the latter’s investors. The amended complaint also accused Wintermute of playing a key role in the failed attempt by Mashinsky to prop up the CEL token in May 2022 following the collapse of Terra. Wintermute didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment by Bloomberg. Attorneys representing Alex Mashinsky declined to comment. </p>

<ul><li>Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority has ordered Binance to cease its operations in the country.&nbsp;</li><li>The regulator has taken issue with the exchange offering crypto services from non-EEA countries.&nbsp;</li><li>The FSMA has indicated that the crypto exchange may have to face criminal charges for its actions.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange has been asked to return all crypto assets belonging to Belgian customers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Financial Services and Markets Authority of Belgium has ordered Binance to immediately cease its operations in the country and stop offering crypto and custody services to Belgian customers. The order comes amid mounting legal troubles for the crypto exchange, which was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month for illegally operating a securities exchange in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance May Be Liable For Criminal Charges In Belgium</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.fsma.be/en/news/fsma-orders-binance-cease-immediately-all-offers-virtual-currency-services-belgium" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA), <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-under-investigation-in-france/">Binance</a> has been ordered to take immediate measures to return crypto assets belonging to Belgian clients. The regulator directed the crypto exchange to contact their clients and entertain any instructions related to the return of their assets. The FSMA accused Binance of violating a law that prevents firms from non-European Economic Area countries from offering services in Belgium. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Persons or firms governed by the law of a country that is not a member of the European Economic Area are prohibited from offering or providing, within Belgium, by way of a professional activity – even if supplementary or ancillary – exchange services between virtual currencies and legal currencies or custody wallet services.</p></blockquote>



<p>As per the FSMA, several requests were made to Binance for information related to its operations from an EEA member country. The exchange reportedly failed to demonstrate that the crypto services being provided in Belgium were carried out from a legal entity governed by an EEA country. The regulator further stated that the Crown Prosecutor of Brussels had been informed of Binance’s acts which are liable to constitute a criminal offense.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">1, 2, 3…</p>&mdash; CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1672325217719406592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">June 23, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>There was no official response from Binance at the time of writing. However, CEO Changpeng Zhao took to Twitter to share his famous “4” tweet, which he uses to convey to his followers any ongoing FUD against his crypto firm. “1, 2, 3…..” Zhao tweeted.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Documents released by the FDIC revealed the top depositors at the failed Silicon Valley Bank.&nbsp;</li><li>Venture capital giant Sequoia and stablecoin issuer Circle were among SVB’s top depositors.&nbsp;</li><li>The FDIC went past its $250,000 deposit insurance and provided covers of up to $1 billion for the bank’s top clients.&nbsp;</li><li>The latest revelations came after the regulator mistakenly released unredacted documents related to SVB’s collapse.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Documents from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have revealed the identities of the top depositors at Silicon Valley Bank, the ill-fated crypto-friendly bank that was shut down by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) in March this year following liquidity and solvency concerns.</p>



<h2><strong>FDIC Provided $1 Billion Backstop To Sequoia Capital</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-23/fdic-insured-billions-in-deposits-for-sequoia-other-top-svb-customers" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, documents from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed that venture capital giant Sequoia Capital and stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial were among the top depositors at Silicon Valley Bank. Other high-profile clients in the failed bank’s top 10 list included Chinese tech firm Kanzhun, Altos Labs, Marqueta Inc, and Roku Inc. USDC issuer <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-taps-former-cftc-chair-legal-chief/">Circle</a> was the largest depositor, with an exposure of over $3.3 billion. Sequoia held over $1 billion with the failed lender. </p>



<p>The FDIC, which only insures deposits up to $250,000, decided to guarantee accounts over $250,000 when SVB was shut down by regulators. Interestingly, the regulator covered Sequoia’s $1 billion deposit with the failed bank. Kanzhun Ltd, which had a deposit of $902 million, also got a backstop for more than $900 million from the banking regulator. According to Bloomberg, the insurance to the deposits of high-profile SVB clients prevented a “catastrophic blow” to the tech and crypto sectors. However, the FDIC provided excessive insurance to high-profile clients that were “in no real danger”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The identities of Silicon Valley Bank’s top depositors were revealed after the FDIC accidentally released an unredacted document related to the bank’s collapse. The document was released in response to a Bloomberg News Freedom of Information Act request by the media house.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>BlockFi received a temporary halt on its $50 million settlement payment to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, per court filings from Thursday.</li><li>The bankrupt crypto lender was instructed to pay its outstanding $30 million fine after reimbursing its debtors.</li><li>BlockFi was fined $50 million by the SEC and another $50 million by 32 state regulators for breaking securities laws.</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has directed bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi to prioritize its obligation to repay customers over its outstanding $30 million fine to the securities watchdog, court documents <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/blockfi/Home-DocketInfo" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/blockfi/Home-DocketInfo" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filed</a> on Thursday revealed. </p>



<h2>BlockFi Fined For Securities Violations</h2>



<p>In February 2022, the SEC fined BlockFi $50 million in penalties for offering unregistered securities services to American investors. At the same time, regulators from 32 states also accused the company of violating securities laws and issued fines amounting to $50 million.</p>



<p>On Thursday, the SEC filed to delay the remaining $30,284,696 fine &#8221; in order to maximize the amount that may be distributed to investors and avoid delay in such distribution.&#8221; It&#8217;s currently unclear if state regulators will follow the SEC&#8217;s footsteps or if they will demand their respective fines regardless.</p>



<p>The crypto lender<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-bankruptcy-files-chapter-11/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-bankruptcy-files-chapter-11/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> filed for bankruptcy</a> months later in November after Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s FTX imploded the very same month. BlockFi reported a balance sheet hole greater than $1 billion in the bankruptcy filing. The lender owes over 100,000 creditors with liabilities as much as $10 billion.</p>



<p>A court approval in January 2023 allowed the lender to begin selling off its remaining assets to create liquidity for the money owed to creditors and regulators alike. In May, the company decided to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-liquidate-crypto-lending-platform/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-liquidate-crypto-lending-platform/" rel="noreferrer noopener">liquidate</a> its crypto lending business after unsuccessful attempts at securing fresh cash injections from new investors.</p>



<p>A New Jersey judge also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-custodial-account-300-million/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-custodial-account-300-million/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruled</a> that users with funds in BlockFi custodial accounts could receive up to $300 million in repayment. </p>

<p>Crypto custody firm Prime Trust has suspended withdrawals and deposits on its platform. The news came just hours after a deal to be acquired by rival custody firm BitGo fell apart earlier today. BitGo announced earlier today that it had terminated the acquisition deal after considerable effort and work to find a path forward with the crypto custodian. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After considerable effort and work to find a path forward with Prime Trust, BitGo has made the hard decision to terminate its acquisition of Prime Trust. This decision was not made lightly and BitGo remains committed to our mission to deliver trust in digital assets.</p>&mdash; BitGo (@BitGo) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitGo/status/1671869979321577472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">June 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2><strong>Nevada Regulator Directs Prime Trust To Suspend Operations</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://support.stably.io/en/articles/8039846-prime-trust-halting-deposit-withdrawal?_ga=2.224471130.1963557396.1687454592-813931187.1687454592&amp;_gl=1*1iirsmx*_ga*ODEzOTMxMTg3LjE2ODc0NTQ1OTI.*_ga_R2T8PD7439*MTY4NzQ1NDU5Mi4xLjEuMTY4NzQ1NDcxMS41My4wLjA." rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by one of Prime Trust&#8217;s primary custody client Stably, the Nevada Financial Institution Division issued an order to the crypto custody firm following which it halted all deposits of fiat and digital assets for custody. The custodian also halted all withdrawals of fiat and digital assets. The order was followed by an advisory from the firm for all clients to stop sending custody assets to the crypto custody firm. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Prime Trust is actively engaging the NV FID to determine the next steps to remediate any concerns and return to business as usual as soon as possible. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience and ask you to be patient with us while we work with the regulators to provide more clarification on the next steps.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Prime Trust’s troubles led to significant issues for, Stably. The firm had to stop onboarding, withdrawals, and deposits of Stably Ramp, as well as Stably Prime. The latest development comes just two weeks after BitGo <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-custodian-bitgo-buys-prime-trust/">announced</a> a preliminary agreement to acquire Prime Trust for an undisclosed amount. The custody firm’s Nevada Trust Company was poised to join BitGo’s existing global network of regulated trust companies in multiple jurisdictions, including Germany and Switzerland. The deal would’ve also seen the crypto custodian’s infrastructure map over 1:1 with BitGo’s services. </p>

<p>According to a CoinDesk Korea <a href="https://www.coindeskkorea.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=91862" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coindeskkorea.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=91862" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> on Thursday, Haru Invest is set to remove 100 workers from its payroll by Friday, June 23.</p>



<p>Haru Invest is a crypto yield platform based in South Korea that allows users to earn interest on their digital assets. Earlier this month, the startup suspended customer withdrawals due to a problem with its service partners.</p>



<h2>100 Haru Invest Employees Laid Off</h2>



<p>CEO Lee Hyung-soo reportedly shared the news about layoffs via a video call with employees. “I made that decision,” Lee told staff this week. “Due to the recent situation, normal company management is difficult,” Lee added about the ongoing trouble at Haru Invest.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://haruinvest.com/blog/a-letter-from-ceo-hugo-lee/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://haruinvest.com/blog/a-letter-from-ceo-hugo-lee/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from June 20 also stated the company plans to cooperate with customers pursuing legal action against the South Korean platform. Haru Invest also plans to sue B&amp;S Holdings for fraud among other allegations, suggesting that the problem might have originated from the holding company. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are pursuing legal action against B&amp;S Holdings for fraud, embezzlement, and other allegations. In the course of these legal actions, we are also gathering facts, including determining the extent of the damage. We will share relevant information based on our fact-finding at the appropriate time.</p></blockquote>



<p>Due to safety concerns after Haru Invest paused operations, the company’s office was left empty as CEO Lee directed workers to work from home.</p>

Rug pulls refer to when projects or startups market a product to investors and disappear with the proceeds without delivering on their promise.

<p>MakerDAO has invested a whopping $700 million to acquire United States Treasury bonds in a bid to diversify its holdings. The decentralized finance protocol’s latest purchase is part of a broader plan to diversify the assets backing its $4.5 billion dollar-pegged DAI stablecoin by including more traditional financial assets such as government bonds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>MakerDAO Brings Total US Treasuries Holdings To $1.2 Billion</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/crypto-project-buys-700-million-of-t-bills-to-diversify-assets" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, MakerDAO’s bid to diversify its holdings has brought its total U.S. Treasuries holdings to a whopping $1.2 billion. This figure marks a significant increase since the DeFi lending protocol&#8217;s first government bond purchase of $500 million back in October 2022. The investment in these assets is the protocol’s way of increasing exposure to low risk, liquid traditional assets. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Through the diversification of its collateral pool with this U.S. Treasury ladder strategy, Maker is taking advantage of the current yield environment and putting its assets to work. Given the success of the initial deployment and today’s robust bond market, this increase in Maker’s real-world asset exposure is a strong, reliable, and flexible solution that will generate more revenue for the protocol.” </p><cite>Monetalis CEO Allan Pedersen</cite></blockquote>



<p>The plan to acquire the latest batch of U.S. Treasuries was finalized earlier this month after the community behind Maker <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/makerdao-buy-1-28-billion-us-treasuries/">approved</a> a proposal to increase the upper limit of a real-world asset (RWA) vault. The $1.25 billion vault is managed by digital asset manager Monetalis Clydesdale. The Monetalis Group reportedly completed the purchase of the U.S. Treasuries on behalf of MakerDAO.  This purchase marks the final step of the Endgame Plan which was unveiled by Maker&#8217;s founder Rune Christensen.</p>
