<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) ceded some minor ground early in the Asian session as the pair faded to the 22700 area after trading as high as the 23375.60 area, its strongest print since August 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were elected above the 22042.59 area during the recent appreciation, an upside price objective related to buying pressure around the 16326.16 and 17927.36 areas.&nbsp; The fresh 5-month high represented a test of the 23300.64 area, an upside price objective related to buying pressure that strengthened around the 20333.33 area.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to buying pressure around the 16326.16 area include the 23544, 23808, 25455, 25774, 27609, and 28004 levels.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to buying pressure around the 15460 area include the 23980, 24224, 26612, 26931, 29244, and 29639 levels.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade said that crypto will play a major role in its foreign trade transactions.</p>
Crypto outlook improving
<p>The economic environment for crypto seems to be improving, as the Federal Reserve appears to be committed to toning down its hawkish rate rises throughout 2023, with a pivot to come sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Even with what could be seen as some quite harsh regulation coming into play at some point in certain jurisdictions across the world, E.G. MiCA in Europe, many are starting to see how Bitcoin and crypto can play a part in economies.</p>
<p>For the foreign trade minister of the United Arab Emirates to come out and say that &ldquo;Crypto will play a major role for UAE trade going forward,&rdquo; is a pretty huge statement of intent, and one that will get many governments to focus even more keenly on the sector.</p>
<p>Thani Al-Zeyoudi, the UAE&rsquo;s minister of state for foreign trade, was being interviewed for Bloomberg Television while attending the Davos conference. The minister outlined how his country was trying to attract projects with its favourable outlook on crypto. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most important thing is that we ensure global governance when it comes to cryptocurrencies and crypto companies. We started attracting some of the companies to the country with the aim that we&rsquo;ll build together the right governance and legal system, which are needed.&rdquo;</p>

Global governance for crypto?
<p>Global governance for crypto might be a difficult feat to achieve, given that there are many differing views on just how to regulate the sector. For example, the US SEC has dithered for years over the question of whether most cryptocurrencies constitute securities. Failure to clear up conflicts on the subject and impose proper regulation, has allowed some bad actors to operate in the crypto sector.</p>
<p>Also, given that the US and Europe have very large and influential banking sectors, there is much internal pressure on lawmakers to over-regulate or even ban crypto. This is not likely to sit well with countries, perhaps like UAE, that have a more progressive approach.</p>
<p>Another of the UAE&rsquo;s ministers, Omar Sultan Al Olama, who is also attending the World Economic Forum at Davos, backed up the line of his ministerial colleague by affirming that his nation was &ldquo;committed&rdquo; to becoming a world cryptocurrency hub.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Amidst mutterings of the crypto market starting it&rsquo;s road to recovery in 2023, following one of the worst downturns in many years, some tokens have not only survived the storm, but have emerged triumphant and ready to take advantage of the space left bare of competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast emerging as one of the leading players in the blockchain space, Taboo has managed to create quite a name for itself and has built quite a community, boasting over forty-six thousand loyal investors currently behind the project. It has so far managed to get things right, and the market cap is a testament to this fact. While thousands of other projects perished and went bankrupt, Taboo went to work and ramped up its investment, knowing there would be an opportunity to rise from the ashes. Market volatility and the recent crash seemed to have little effect on the project, often referred to as the Playboy of Crypto.</p>
<p>And just as the recent rally took the TABOO brand to the top of the trending lists on platforms such as Coin Market Cap and Coin Gecko, the news of further marketing came.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only will the hugely successful billboard campaign take place once again, but the second Mansion Event is set to be bigger and better in 2023 with the Tier 4 holders and celebrity guests all queuing up for a place. Think Dozens of Supermodels, Luxury Villas, Super Yachts and Celebrity DJs and you&rsquo;ll start to realize just what Taboo has in store for any investors holding more than $10k of this hugely undervalued token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those unaware, Taboo is more than just a platform offering bold content. It&rsquo;s meant to empower content creators, provide them a platform to showcase their talent and earn a decent income in the process. The fiat currency part of the market is unsafe, is under strict observation of the authorities, has no laws protecting those employed in the industry, often leaving them at the mercy of the local administration, and does not offer a steady source of revenue. It is where Taboo emerges as a viable solution offering all the involved parties a safe and encouraging environment where they can explore their Taboo fantasies and heart&rsquo;s desires.</p>
<p>The start of all things Taboo</p>
<p>The project, having been launched back in 2021, has been the talk of the town ever since its inception. Anyone even reasonably acquainted with the blockchain space knows about Taboo and the potential held by it. The Adult Entertainment industry has a conservative estimate of $15 billion in annual revenue within the US alone, but it&rsquo;s never found a way into the crypto space until now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A brief overview of the project</p>
<p>Taboo, unlike other projects, offers curated content from the finest creators in the industry. It aims to create scarcity in an oversaturated market. Not every supermodel or adult start can feature on the platform. Instead, they have to undergo a thorough screening process, and only after approval is received will they be featured. For the user part, Taboo has created a tier system consisting of 4 tiers. The higher the tier a user is subscribed to, the more content is accessible to them.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Tier 1 - The first tier is free of cost and grants access to teasers from the higher tiers, as well as basic content added to Tier 1 by content creators. The transaction fee for this tier is 10%.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Tier 2 - The first paid tier on Taboo, Tier 2, requires users to hold $1000 in their wallet or stake an equivalent amount on the platform. It grants access to NSFW content level, nudes, and strip teases, besides offering the option to video chat with content creators. Users on this tier get a 10% discount on purchases from the official store.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Tier 3 - To access this tier, users need to hold or stake at least $5,000, which grants access to XXX areas of the platform. It includes video NFTs, explicit pictures, access to exclusive events, and a 3x chance at winning in Taboo giveaways.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Tier 4 - The highest tier on Taboo, Tier 4, is where the real fun takes place. With $10,000 held in the wallet or staked, users get access to everything available on the three lower tiers, in addition to the possibility of meeting their favorite content creators at parties held by Taboo in their exclusive mansions. Users on Tier 4 are charged the lowest transaction fee, at 2.5%.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Version 2 of the marketplace was launched last year offering a marketplace of delicious content as well as full staking functionality. Currently, depending on the lockup period, long term investors can see returns up to 20% APY on their stakes with interest calculated daily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taboo is currently in talks with several top exchanges and will list on many more throughout 2023, thus providing an additional boost to the Taboo token and the overall exposure of the project. Furthermore, Taboo plans to lend out ad space on the website and across the platform to other projects, which will ensure that Taboo generates substantial revenue as the project benefits from the increased traffic.</p>
<p>Every aspect of Taboo has been well planned and, in a way, ensures the long-term sustainability and viability of the project. For those who haven&rsquo;t yet, join Taboo and be a part of the revolution sweeping the world of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not official, but the green shoots of the beginning of a new crypto bull market are beginning to be seen.</p>
<p>The FUDish news has continued to rain down on the crypto sector. We aren&rsquo;t too long after the FTX implosion, and already another domino, in the shape of crypto lender Genesis, is toppling down.</p>
<p>However, in the midst of the bad news crypto is starting to motor. Bitcoin is currently in fifth gear, and is plunging headlong through resistance after resistance.</p>
<p>The king of the cryptocurrencies put on a spurt earlier this morning and attained a price of $23,300 before pulling back to currently sit at around $22,700. The bull flag it was in was broken to the upside, which was less likely considering that the flag was slanted upwards, instead of the more typical downwards slant.</p>
<p>$24,000 to $25,000 now beckons - a resistance area that is incredibly important, given that a consolidation above this could see Bitcoin magnetically pulled upwards to the next resistance at $30,000.</p>
<p>Such heights just couldn&rsquo;t have been envisaged only 3 or 4 weeks ago, as Bitcoin scraped along a local bottom and seemed as though it might take a further plunge down to the next $14,000 support.</p>
<p>It does make sense though, that when the entire world was screaming for Bitcoin and crypto to come crashing down and find new lows in a bear market that would just drag on for years, that the market would do the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Many analysts point to the fairly rapid softening of inflation as a reason for the crypto market surge, and this might have something to do with it. However, the charts across the entire crypto market were looking extremely oversold, and it had got to the point where breakouts were only a short time away.</p>
<p>Retail investors sitting on the sidelines with any cash may well have piled in, in the hope of at least making something in a year that many have said will be recessionary.</p>
<p>Of course, Bitcoin really isn&rsquo;t about this. Those who are just after a quick buck just might get their fingers burned when the correction finally does come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for those who just wish to have a part of their portfolio outside of the fiat monetary system, and in something that has scarcity and is actual hard money, then Bitcoin is one of the only assets to be in for the longer haul.</p>

<p>Avraham Eisenberg, the attacker behind the Mango Markets hack, was charged today by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC charged Eisenberg with offenses related to fraud and market manipulation connected with the hack, which took place in October 2022. Eisenberg, a United States citizen, was arrested in Puerto Rico in December and will be moved to New York to face the litany of civil and criminal charges against him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eisenberg is alleged to have manipulated the platform&rsquo;s market and token, resulting in the loss of approximately $116 million worth of crypto assets. Heisenberg boasted about the Mango Markets hack in a Twitter thread, describing the hack as a highly profitable trading strategy. As a result of the hack, Mango Markets was rendered insolvent as a result of the hack, which Eisenberg and a team of users executed. During an appearance on the Unchained Podcast, Eisenberg defended his actions, calling them legal market actions that utilized the protocol as designed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week. I believe all of our actions were legal open market actions, using the protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way they are.&rdquo;</p>

Charges Brought Against Eisenberg&nbsp;
<p>Eisenberg has already been charged by the US Department of Justice and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). According to the SEC, Eisenberg has violated several federal securities laws provisions, including some anti-fraud and anti-market manipulation provisions. The SEC also stated that it viewed the Mango Markets governance token, the MNGO, as security, something a lot of people in the crypto ecosystem would dispute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC, under current chair Gary Gensler, has increased scrutiny on the crypto space and has often highlighted that it views all crypto assets as securities. The SEC&rsquo;s chief of crypto assets and cyber unit, David Hirsch, stated in a press release,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As our action shows, the SEC remains committed to rooting out market manipulation, regardless of the type of security involved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other charges brought against Eisenberg by the SEC are similar to the ones brought in by the Department of Justice and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission. The DOJ has charged Eisenberg with market manipulation, including commodities fraud and manipulation. On the other hand, the CFTC has charged him with commodities fraud and manipulation, which also includes several violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The press release explained,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we allege, Eisenberg engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme to artificially inflate the price of the MNGO token, which was purchased and sold as a crypto asset security, in order to borrow and then withdraw nearly all available assets from Mango Markets.&rdquo;</p>

The Mango Markets Hack&nbsp;
<p>The Mango Markets hack took place in October, with Eisenberg targeting the native MNGO token and artificially inflating its price. He then took several loans, managing to drain the Mango Markets treasury for $110 million. He then tried to use the stolen MNGO governance tokens to manipulate the protocol&rsquo;s DAO to vote for his solution to return the tokens, following which the DAO offered Eisenberg a deal that let him keep $47 million worth of crypto assets as a bounty if he returned the rest of the assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC alleged that the Mango Markets hack was orchestrated from Puerto Rico, following which Eisenberg disappeared for some time before reappearing in the United States. Eisenberg had attempted to execute a similar attack on Aave in November. However, that attempt failed, with the hacker losing millions worth of crypto.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 21st January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, will list Speed Service Mobility (SSM) on January 27, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the SSM/USDT trading pair will be officially available for trading at 7:00 UTC on January 27, 2023.</p>
<p>Utilizing the power of blockchain technology, Speed Service Mobility (SSM) innovates the Electric Vehicle (EV) ecosystem by integrating various services such as EV charging, game, NFT, and more. Its native token SSM will be listed on LBank Exchange at 7:00 UTC on January 27, 2023, to further expand its global reach and help it achieve its vision.</p>
<p>Introducing Speed Service Mobility
Speed Service Mobility (SSM) is a project that aims to revolutionize the Electric Vehicle (EV) industry. There are four visions SSM wants to achieve. First of all, in order to solve the problem of the shortage of EV chargers, the SSM platform is applied to the existing personal chargers to convert to shared chargers, and the easy-to-use shared chargers will be developed in a similar form to personal chargers, so that individuals can easily install/operate them and become charging providers. This enables users in the EV ecosystem to form a shared community together.</p>
<p>Additionally, in order to prevent the excessive occupation and monopoly use of chargers, monetary (points/virtual assets) compensation or royalties based on token economics are given to actively guide users to make positive changes and realize the construction of autonomous EV infrastructure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the chargers operated/managed by different charging operators can be organically linked with each other. By providing "roaming service" to all charging operators, they can offer services that have no difference from each other, the accessibility of users can be improved and the technical problems of linkage between charging operators can be solved.</p>
<p>Last but not least, in order to help users actively use clean energy to achieve efficient energy use, SSM uses the battery of EV that has charged in advance as an energy storage device in case of insufficient daily power supply. Users who help to reduce the load during peak hours will get rewarded.</p>
<p>In addition to EV charging services, SSM also expects to attract consumers by providing games. The standard practice of the game industry is in-game purchases &ndash; personal upgrades or personalized products in the form of digital goods. The more players participate, the more additional benefits these purchases will generate. This unique in-game currency often adds value through enhanced functions, making it possible to adopt the universally accepted in-game payment standard, and providing special discounts when players purchase specific points in advance.</p>
<p>SSM will also attract subscribers with rich experience through NFT. This will help SSM create a single digital identity for all experiences, meaning that users can change their avatar skins and experience levels, or transfer other in-game items to create a more integrated SSM passenger experience. Therefore, in addition to accessing (interactive) SSM content libraries (games, experiences), subscribers can also access other functions.</p>
<p>In short, the core of SSM project is to improve the utilization rate of infrastructure by sharing personal charging tools for charging electric vehicles. In order to solve the problem of unauthorized or long-term occupation caused by a wrong understanding of the use method of public chargers, the use of an authentication system and possession penalty are proposed to prevent misuse of public charging infrastructure and promote and seek user convenience. In addition, through the use of two-way chargers, users are guided to participate in the use of clean energy, inhibit the use of electricity during the period of maximum load, reduce power consumption, increase the value of environmentally friendly travel means, reduce carbon emissions, and directly contribute to improving the environment.</p>
<p>About SSM Token
SSM is the native token of Speed Service Mobility project. It is used as a reward and payment method in the ecosystem, and can be traded not only on the SSM platform, but also on the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on Klaytn network, SSM has a total supply of 1 billion (i.e., 1,000,000,000) tokens, of which 20% is provided for token sale, 15% is allocated to the finance department, 15% is allocated to the team, 5% is provided for the fans and supporters, 20% is provided for the community, and the remaining 25% is allocated for the ecosystem.</p>
<p>SSM token will be listed on LBank Exchange at 7:00 UTC on January 27, 2023, investors who are interested in the Speed Service Mobility investment can easily buy and sell SSM token on LBank Exchange by then. The listing of SSM token on LBank Exchange will undoubtedly help it further expand its business and draw more attention in the market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 21st January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, listed GroveC (GRV) on Jan 19, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the GRV/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading.</p>
<p>As a decentralized and secure green crypto, Grove is here to create a healthier and wealthier future for all. Its native token GroveC (GRV) has been listed on LBank Exchange at 12:00 UTC on Jan 19, 2023, to further expand its global reach and help it achieve its vision.</p>
<p>Introducing Grove
The energy consumption and electronic waste generated by traditional cryptocurrency mining methods has wide-reaching environmental consequences. As the world looks for greener solutions to tackle climate change, the public perception of cryptocurrency hampers its massive, untapped potential to be a driving force for positive change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grove is a project that aims to reverse that negative view with its Grove Green Plan and help crypto realize its latent potential. It is the guiding outline for the hybrid 'green crypto' blockchain ecosystem and a planet-friendly investment business built to pursue the mission of a healthier and wealthier future for all.</p>
<p>The ecosystem of Grove consists of 3 major components, one of which is GroveKeeper, the digital asset wallet providing an easy-to-use and secure method for investors to obtain and hold their cryptocurrencies and NFTs. With multiple layers of insurance and access to a DApps browser to facilitate buying, selling and swapping of coins and tokens as well as staking and farming for passive income generation, GroveKeeper will be a platform that maximizes usability while utilizing cutting-edge cybersecurity methodologies to protect users.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also GroveSwap, the decentralized exchange (DEX) utility of Grove. Users can buy, sell, swap and trade various cryptocurrencies across three blockchains with as-low-as-feasible network fees on each transaction. Investors are guaranteed a fast, reliable and safe experience as any project successfully listed on GroveSwap must be audited, interviewed and provide documentation regarding operational wallets and the deliverability of their project aims and utilities.</p>
<p>In addition to GroveSwap, the centralized exchange (CEX) GroveX is another capstone of Grove&rsquo;s crypto-industry utilities. As a robust, easy-to-use exchange for first-time investors or seasoned industry veterans, GroveX will be available online through mobile apps and support tokenomics for listed projects. This makes it more attractive to list on for developers and far more rewarding for the communities that support projects to engage with.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;GreenOasis&rsquo; program within GroveX is a unique support platform for Grove&rsquo;s fellow &lsquo;green crypto&rsquo; projects, offering support and partnership incentives that would help eco-friendly but potentially very niche projects receive awareness and attention in the broader market by leveraging the brand name power of Grove.</p>
<p>With a team of professionals and entrepreneurs, known to be the best in the field, Grove strives to create wealth, for all Grovers, by harnessing the opportunities of a secure, decentralized digital currency in an environmentally conscious way. By compensating nature for years of abuse, Grove will create a healthier, wealthier future for all.</p>
<p>About GRV Token
GroveC (GRV) is the native token of Grove ecosystem. Its blockchain is a fork of the BSC architecture. With its 'Proof-of-Stake' approach, this token supply protocol is counter to the environmentally harmful 'Proof-of-Work' mining approach. The GRV blockchain facilitates an entire ecosystem of digital finance utilities, as well as allowing other projects to develop on the same network. A portion of Grove Business profits will be provided for burning the GRV supply, ensuring ongoing value to holders.</p>
<p>Holders of GRV are invited to play an integral role through community engagement in future developments within its Digital Asset ecosystem. Users can also participate in Staking and Farming, which are passive income utilities available to GRV across all networks. The Annual-Percentage-Yield (APY) structure fixes the return rate for the duration of the Staking or Farming pool. Coins held in this way will be rewarded a proportionate amount of passive token generation of GRV.</p>
<p>GRV has a total supply of 100 million (i.e., 100,000,000) tokens. It has been listed on LBank Exchange at 12:00 UTC on Jan 19, 2023, investors who are interested in the Grove investment can easily buy and sell GRV token on LBank Exchange right now. The listing of GRV token on LBank Exchange will undoubtedly help it further expand its business and draw more attention in the market.</p>
