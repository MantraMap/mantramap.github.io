<p><em>Cardano price is holding the $0.265 support against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-aim-fresh-uptrend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.305 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Cardano price saw a decent upward move from the $0.240 support against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair was able to climb above the $0.265 and $0.280 resistance levels.</p>
<p>However, the bears were active near the $0.300 zone. A high is formed near $0.305 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $0.288 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2300 swing low to the $0.3050 high.</p>
<p>ADA is now trading near $0.282 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-recovery-possible-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $0.270 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.295 zone. The next major resistance is near the $0.305 level. A clear move above the $0.305 resistance might start a steady increase. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise toward the $0.325 resistance or even $0.345.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.272 level. The next major support is near the $0.265 level. A clear move below the $0.265 level might send the price toward the $0.248 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2300 swing low to the $0.3050 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $0.240 support, below which the bears could aim for a test of $0.230.</p>

<p><em>Ethereum price is rising above the $1,850 level against the US Dollar. ETH/USD could rise further if it clears the $1,920 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, Ethereum saw a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-could-recover-to-1900/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">decent increase</a> above the $1,800 level against the US Dollar. ETH price was able to gain pace for a move above the $1,850 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>The bulls even pushed the price above the $1,880 resistance zone. A high was formed near $1,936 before the bears appeared. There was a minor downside correction below the $1,900 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1,620 swing low to the $1,936 high.</p>
<p>Ether’s price is now trading above $1,850 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-consolidates-below-key-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,840 on the 4-hours chart.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,900 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,920 zone. A clear move above the $1,920 level could send the price toward $2,000. Any more gains could even send the price toward the $2,120 resistance zone or $2,200 in the near term.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support is near the $1,840 level and the trend line. The next major support is now near the $1,800 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1,620 swing low to the $1,936 high.</p>
<p>A break below the $1,800 support could push the price to $1,740. Any more losses could lead the price towards $1,650.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul Grewal – the chief legal executive of Coinbase, arguably the biggest and most popular crypto exchange in the U.S. – has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/coinbases-chief-legal-officer-humbles-himself-before-pepe-coin-horde-after-newsletter-provides-incomplete-history-of-meme/ar-AA1b4eLQ" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">made a public apology</a> to the creators of a new meme token called $pepe for claiming the image associated with the token has largely been tied to alt-right hate groups.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Issues Public Apology</h2>
<p>$pepe features the image that has come to be known as Pepe the Frog, an odd and somewhat misshapen picture of an amphibious creature with big lips, big eyes, and a strange little smile on his face. No doubt you’ve seen this image at some point in your life, though over the past few years, the image has largely been associated with QAnon and other conservative organizations, which has led some to believe it’s somehow utilized by hate groups and similar platforms.</p>
<p>Coinbase is certainly one of the companies to believe that as just a few weeks ago, the top trading platform issued a newsletter claiming so. However, the firm is now taking a lot of flak for its lack of eloquence and for allegedly not including any reference to a story in which the image’s initial creator, a man named Matt Furie (who created the picture back in 2010), is working hard to take the image back and ensure it isn’t used by any other organizations that can be labeled political in any way.</p>
<p>Grewal has since issued an apology, saying the newsletter was premature and didn’t try hard enough to include all the appropriate information regarding both the image and the token it’s now associated with. Coinbase said in the statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The newsletter] did not provide the whole picture of the history of the meme, and we apologize to the community.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the currency has certainly found a strong audience – the $pepe meme token has seen its market cap explode in recent weeks – many platforms are refusing to list it, <a href="https://techreport.com/crypto-news/pepe-suffers-price-decline-as-coinbase-denies-listing-a-look-at-5-coins-that-could-be-the-next-pepe/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Coinbase included</a>. Also, not long ago, Gemini – a competing exchange in New York founded by the Winklevoss Twins of “The Social Network” fame – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-is-finding-new-support-thanks-to-meme-tokens/" data-wpel-link="internal">issued a statement accompanying</a> the $pepe asset warning traders of the alleged risks that potentially come with using or investing in it.</p>
<h2>Be Aware!</h2>
<p>The warning read:</p>
<blockquote><p>$pepe is a new meme token. $pepe has no defined utility. Its value may be derived only from the continued willingness of market participants to demand and trade the token, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value should participants choose to no longer demand or trade $pepe. The token may also be subject to extreme price volatility if large, concentrated holdings of $pepe are liquidated in a short period of time.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other news, Coinbase has hired former <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-05-12-2023/card/coinbase-gearing-up-for-battle-with-sec-hires-former-sen-toomey-other-ex-lawmakers-O0W5YDOz3BSzsqTiyG2G?mod=Searchresults_pos3&amp;page=1" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">senator Pat Toomey as an</a> advisor.</p>

<p>Positive signs are emerging for bitcoin on technical charts. The world’s number one digital currency by market cap is holding <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-holds-above-200-week-average-as-dollar-index-rallies-most-since-february-1032327294" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">a key support level</a> that could insinuate bullish trends will again emerge for the asset in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Gains Traction</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> fell by nearly six percent in mid-May. However, the asset – at the time of writing – has since risen by more than one percent and is trading in the low $27K range. Some believe this is because bitcoin has been largely tied to USD as of late, a sudden and interesting change for the world’s top digital currency. With the dip the dollar has taken in value, this could be why BTC has endured a small slip.</p>
<p>Alex Kuptsikevich – senior market analyst at FX Pro – said in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>By defending this key average, the bulls have convinced the market of the sustainability of the long-term bullish trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further stated that there are many cautious buyers in the mix as of late, and if they’re going to come back to the trading scene, bitcoin will need to reach a price of at least $28,500.</p>
<p>Others, by contrast, are a little more positive in their sentiment towards BTC and say that as the dollar continues to heal itself and rise through the price ranks, bitcoin will as well. Ilan Solot – co-head of digital assets at Marex – explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the dollar is due for a bounce as markets take back some Fed easing implied in the futures curve. My fundamental FX framework: currencies are driven by real growth differentials and political considerations over longer cycles, but in the short term, it’s all about playing relative central bank policy (changes in nominal rates). Depending on how violent the dollar upswing gets, it could cause some short-term damage to assets like commodities and crypto.</p></blockquote>
<p>His words were seconded by analysts at Swiss Block Insights, who mentioned in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The DXY could hit anywhere from 104 to 107 considering it crossed over the 102 level since mid-March… This month-long structure will eventually break, and both assets will experience price discovery. Bitcoin to the upside, and DXY to the downside.</p></blockquote>
<h2>More Wallets Holding onto Coins</h2>
<p>Solot further pointed out that there are many long-term wallets that have held coins for at least a six-month period prior to press time. Many of these wallets have accumulated new assets, suggesting they feel the digital currency space is going to endure more bullish trends in the coming future and likely experience greater price explosions.</p>
<p>2023, for the most part, has been quite different from 2022, which is arguably the worst year on record for BTC and crypto. The previous 12 months saw the world’s main crypto asset lose more than 70 percent of its value.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is being driven crazy by a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2023/05/13/memecoin-mania-propels-bitcoin-transaction-fees-to-highest-level-in-two-years/?sh=76bae3936c4e" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">new standard known</a> as BRC-20, which basically enables the establishment of new tokens like meme currencies on its blockchain.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Meme Tokens&#8230; A Perfect Match?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has always been a straight-up digital asset. While it has a blockchain network supporting it (like all cryptocurrencies), this network doesn’t necessarily attract developer interest the way something like Ethereum does. Bitcoin, by all accounts, is slow and old-fashioned, whereas Ethereum is new, fresh, and infused with low fees and higher speeds thanks to its <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/merge/" data-wpel-link="internal">many upgrades</a> over the past year.</p>
<p>Meme coins are often built atop the Ethereum network given this is what its blockchain has been built for – the establishment of new applications and currencies. However, things appear to be changing. Developers are suddenly flocking to bitcoin thanks to this new BRC-20 standard, and it looks like the world’s oldest and most popular digital currency is paving the way for a whole new line of assets.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Andre Serrano – product lead at the Stacks Foundation – commented positively on BRC-20, claiming it could open a whole new string of doors for BTC and ultimately make it comparable to Ethereum. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>BRC-20s expand the design space for tokenized assets on bitcoin. They have revealed strong demand for bitcoin block space, which will benefit bitcoin’s security and fee market. While BRC-20s are still in their infancy, infrastructure is rapidly emerging to improve the user experience and functionality, which will likely result in increased interest and adoption for bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ordinals/" data-wpel-link="internal">called Ordinals</a> were unveiled on the BTC blockchain thanks to this new protocol, but with the rising popularity of meme coins, it seems these are the assets everyone keeps flocking to and the assets that are ultimately finding new homes on the BTC network.</p>
<p>Among them is a new token called $pepe, which is based on the now popular “Pepe the Frog” meme that’s often tied to conservative groups. The currency is making serious waves and has seen its market cap explode over a very short period.</p>
<h2>$pepe Is Getting Big, but It&#8217;s Scaring People</h2>
<p>Despite this, many listing exchanges and platforms – such as the Gemini exchange in New York – are offering disclaimers on their sites discussing the assorted risks that may come with the asset. Gemini’s disclaimer reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>$pepe is a new meme token. $pepe has no defined utility. Its value may be derived only from the continued willingness of market participants to demand and trade the token, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value should participants choose to no longer demand or trade $pepe. The token may also be subject to extreme price volatility if large, concentrated holdings of $pepe are liquidated in a short period of time.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Satoshi Airlines, a groundbreaking blockchain-based travel agency, is proud to announce the development of the world&#8217;s first fly-to-earn application through its Global Distribution System (GDS), an innovative airline reservation system.</p>
<p>With a mission to revolutionize the travel industry and connect a global community of travel enthusiasts to the decentralized web, distributed apps, and blockchain technology, Satoshi Airlines is set to transform the way people travel and earn rewards.</p>
<p>Combining gamification, fly-to-earn, and blockchain technology, Satoshi Airlines aims to incentivize millions of smartphone users worldwide to embrace a more exciting and rewarding travel experience.</p>
<p>The concept revolves around a low entry barrier, enabling users to participate without owning NFT assets by renting them from other users and splitting their earnings at a rate determined by the asset owners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Satoshi Airlines is not just another travel agency. We are on a mission to create an immersive web3 gamified fly-to-earn ecosystem, where users can travel by air while being rewarded at the same time,&#8221; said the spokesperson for Satoshi Airlines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to help millions of web3 and crypto enthusiasts explore the world like never before, while introducing the decentralized finance sphere to travelers who may be unfamiliar with blockchain and cryptocurrency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Driven by careful market analysis and an understanding of emerging trends, Satoshi Airlines recognized the rising popularity of blockchain technology and the increasing demand for unique digital assets like NFTs.</p>
<p>By combining these elements with the travel industry, the company identified an incredible opportunity to create a fly-to-earn application that engages smartphone users worldwide in a fun and rewarding travel experience.</p>
<p>The Satoshi Airlines application introduces a web3 air travel lifestyle app with social-fi and game-fi elements.</p>
<p>Users can choose between two modes: BASIC and PRO. NFT cardholders gain access to all functions in the PRO mode, allowing them to maximize their earning potential.</p>
<p>Non-NFT holders can still enjoy the BASIC mode, which grants them access to plane selection and travel distance-based compensation, albeit at a slightly lower rate compared to NFT holders.</p>
<p>To boost the potential of Satoshi Airlines as a blockchain-based travel application, the company has incorporated game features that make traveling more engaging and interactive.</p>
<p>The flight reservation engine, provided as a dedicated app, allows NFT cardholders to earn rewards based on the distance they fly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Satoshi Airlines has developed Uranus Chat Bot, an AI-powered assistant that offers customized airfare and travel destination recommendations.</p>
<p>This chatbot enhances the user experience by providing personalized and tailored assistance throughout the travel journey.</p>
<p>As Satoshi Airlines pioneers the fly-to-earn business model and expands into the hotel, travel, and AI chatbot sectors, the company aims to provide a sustainable service that bridges the gap between NFT and WEB3.0 game elements with fly-to-earn and travel-to-earn features.</p>
<p><strong>About Satoshi Airlines:</strong></p>
<p>Satoshi Airlines is a visionary blockchain-based travel agency that combines gamification, fly-to-earn, and blockchain technology to revolutionize the travel industry.</p>
<p>With a mission to connect a global community of travel enthusiasts to the decentralized web, distributed apps, and blockchain technology, Satoshi Airlines aims to provide a fun and rewarding travel experience for millions of smartphone users worldwide.</p>

<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>After forming a base above the $0.078 level, Stellar Lumen price started a fresh increase against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair broke the $0.082 resistance zone to move into a positive zone.</p>
<p>The price even cleared the $0.0850 resistance and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). The upward move was such that the price spike to $0.0900 before the bears appeared. A high was formed near $0.0923 and the price is now consolidating gains.</p>

<h2>Ripple Price Analysis</h2>
<p>After struggling to stay above $0.525, Ripple price started a fresh decline against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair gained bearish momentum below the 0.515 support zone.</p>
<p>The bears were able to push the price below the $0.50 support. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $0.4910 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4550 swing low to the $0.5263 high.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ron DeSantis – the republican governor of Florida – has <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-bans-193615323.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">signed a new bill into</a> law preventing the issuance and use of centralized bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in his state.</p>
<h2>Ron DeSantis Says &#8220;No&#8221; to CBDCs</h2>
<p>Just over a week ago, DeSantis <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-defends-crypto-and-bashes-the-idea-of-cbdcs/" data-wpel-link="internal">issued his thoughts on</a> CBDCs and made his dislike of these assets clear. He stated in a press conference:</p>
<blockquote><p>The danger of the digital currency is that they want to make that the sole currency. They want to put everything in a central bank digital currency. I think that that’s fundamentally wrong, so we’re recognizing the dangers with this agenda.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeSantis said he was concerned about CBDCs given they would be issued by standard institutions, thus allowing monetary executives and ultimately government figures to spy and look in on what people were doing with their money and how they were spending their hard-earned dollars. DeSantis said Joe Biden and the rest of the democrats are working hard to ensure crypto doesn’t have a future in America given it’s not an industry they can control. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>They don’t like crypto because they can’t control crypto. They want to get rid of crypto, which my view is if you want to invest in crypto, it’s up to you. You can do it. You can make those decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, DeSantis has put his words into action and signed a new bill ensuring that CBDCs cannot be issued in the state of Florida, nor can they be utilized by residents of the region. He commented that he believes all Floridians have a right to privacy and autonomy, something central bank digital currencies will eventually get in the way of. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone with their eyes open could see the danger this type of an arrangement would mean for Americans who want to exercise their financial independence and would like to be able to conduct business without having the government know every single transaction they&#8217;re making in real time.</p></blockquote>
<p>One can easily see DeSantis has a point. Crypto was initially designed to give people full independence and control over their finances. The reason crypto is decentralized is because it was built to ensure no middlemen, prying eyes, or third parties could enter the arena and tell users what they could and could not do.</p>
<h2>No Prying Allowed!</h2>
<p>Central bank digital currencies go against this very notion in that they take on a form similar with USD or other forms of fiat currencies. They will be issued by banks, meaning the same companies that shut certain people out or charge people for specific services will be able to do so again, only this time, in a whole new industry.</p>
<p>The idea is to have limited government control and invoke more strength in everyday people.</p>
