<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swapping is the act of exchanging one <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> or token for its equivalent value in another. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you want to buy something that requires DAI but only has ETH to spend, you can exchange your ETH for DAI using the crypto swap service. You can use Bitcoins and other altcoins to swap from one currency to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should note that trading and swapping are not synonymous. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you trade cryptocurrency, you&#8217;re executing an order book trade. Only the trading pairs available on the given exchange can be used to execute a trade. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in swapping, you just pay with a different cryptocurrency than the one you want to acquire</span></p>

Though these cryptocurrencies started as a joke, the increasing utility of those tokens has attracted more investors in the market. Thus, here are three top memecoin you can invest in before entering 2023</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin(DOGE)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/1/1Fmv4WMw.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the current downtrend, <a href="https://coingape.com/dogecoin-doge-price-target-in-mid-term-going-into-2023/">Dogecoin price</a> has fallen 89.51%, down from its all-time high of $0.7376, and trades at $0.077. However, the technical chart shows the price action has nearly turned sideways, suggesting the bearish momentum is getting exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the $0.056 level has acted as strong bottom support and has maintained this lateral walk for the past six months. Moreover, the RSI slope is rising despite a consolidation phase in doge, reflecting the underlying bullishness is growing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the Dogecoin price is trying to sustain above the $0.073 local support. Moreover, the low price rejection attached to this week’s candle indicates the buyers try to rebound from this support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sustained buying, the price rise may rise to $0.0157 by the mid-2023</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiba Inu Coin(SHIB)</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/w/wWo3BznJ.png" alt="TradingView Chart" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the all-time high of $0.00008845, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/this-range-breakout-may-bring-directional-rally-in-shiba-inu-coin-buy-now/">Shiba Inu coin</a> plunged 90.62% down to current reach the current price of $0.00000828. Thus, similar to dogecoin, the SHIB has been in a sideways rally for the past seven months indicating the buyers are defending the lower levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the SHIB coin is retesting the June bottom support of $0.000008. Moreover, the coin shows the formation of a falling wedge pattern in the weekly time frame chart. In theory, this is a bullish continuation pattern that encourages a strong bull run on the breakout of its resistance trendline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the market sentiment favors, this bullish breakout may lead the SHIB price to $0.000001 by the first quarter of 2023.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogelon(ELON)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EGb6hgBO.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sharp downfall in Dogelon from the all-time high of $0.00003263 has slumped its market value 99.10% down to reach $0.0000002912. However, a seven months consolidation in ELON indicates the prices are trying to bottom at $0.00000023 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the weekly chart shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a>. This continuation pattern could release the trapped bullish momentum and trigger a direction price rally. Currently, the price has been wobbling between the converging trendlines waiting for a breakout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning the bullish divergence in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI indicator</a>, which reflect strength in the ongoing price trend, the ELON price is likely to break the overhead trendline. This bullish breakout may increase prices by 92% to reach $0.000000566 by mid-2023.</span></p>

Beginning with the collapse of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/luna-2-0/">Terra ecosystem</a> in May to the recent debacle of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> crypto exchange, the market has gone through it all. These catastrophic events have further motivated the U.S. SEC to take a stricter stance on crypto-related firms and crypto assets as a whole.</p>
<h2>Gensler&#8217;s Jibe On Proof of Reserves</h2>
<p>Gensler also objected to <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-reserves-por/">proof-of-reserves</a> reports, which some cryptocurrency businesses create to demonstrate that they have sufficient cash on hand to support consumer deposits. According to Gensler, the strategy, which has been adopted by significant <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> companies including the crypto giant <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a>, falls short of the disclosures required to safeguard investors.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are some in this field that have talked about ways to give customers confidence that their crypto is really there. They should do that by coming into compliance,</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC</a> chairman&#8217;s comments suggested that the regulator&#8217;s attention will continue to be focused on the financial reporting practices of these crypto businesses, instead of a mere PoR report posted on their website.</p>
<p><em><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/binances-mysterious-trades-worth-22-trillion-found-latest-analysis/">Binance’s Mysterious Trades Worth $22 Trillion Found In Latest Analysis</a></em></p>
<h2>SEC&#8217;s Crypto Crackdown</h2>
<p>In a recently telecasted interview, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gary-gensler/">Gary Gensler</a>, stated that the agency&#8217;s patience was thinning out on digital-asset exchanges and other crypto firms that sidestepped its restrictions.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-us-sec-sets-eyes-on-audit-firms-working-with-crypto-companies/">SEC Sets Eyes On Audit Firms Working With Crypto Companies</a></em></p>
<p>On Thursday, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States&#8217;</a> financial watchdog, sued two more prominent crypto executives for their alleged roles in the failure of the FTX exchange. The SEC announced that it had settled fraud charges with Gary Wang, a co-founder of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a>, and Caroline Ellison, who ran the FTX’s trading arm, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a>. The Hong Kong-based trading firm allegedly used billions in FTX customer deposits to fund its risky bets.</p>
<p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler was quoted as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>The runway is getting shorter. The casinos in this Wild West [implying to crypto companies] are non-compliant intermediaries,</p></blockquote>
<h2>Gensler Warns Crypto Investors</h2>
<p>Despite his refusal to name the companies under scrutiny or speculate on the direction the FTX investigation may take, Gensler issued a number of industry-wide warnings. The SEC chairman has claimed that most tokens are basically merely unregistered securities trading on the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a>. He asserts that they must adhere to the strict trading and investment guidelines set forth by the organization in order to remain compliant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of those thousands of cryptocurrencies listed on exchanges and websites that track digital asset markets are thinly traded cryptocurrencies&#8221;, Gensler said. He further went on to claim that, insiders on these projects can “sell the public on an idea while they’re potentially fraudulently pumping up the price”.</p>

In theory, this pattern itself resembles an established downtrend but provides a direction bullish rally upon the breakout of its resistance trendline. Here’s how this pattern may influence ETH’s future price.                                                                     </span></p>
<h2><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parallel channel pattern governs the ongoing downfall</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $1230 breakout will resume the prior recovery rally and set ETH for a 12% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.45 Billion, indicating a 39% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/1/1TNJ4oP8.png" alt="Ethereum Price" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On November 10th, the Ethereum price rebounded from the pattern support trendline and triggered a new bull cycle. However, this new recovery face could never surpass the $1350 barrier as the crypto market witnessed sudden selling pressure in mid-December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent sell-off was triggered by the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">FUD surrounding Binance,</a> the largest exchange by volume. Therefore the ETH price tumbled 13% from the mentioned resistance and breached local support of dollar 1230.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the Ethereum price is trying to sustain below the breached support. If the selling pressure persists, the ETH price will <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-price-prediction-will-eth-witness-a-deeper-correction/">tumble 20%</a> down to revisit the $1000 or $980 support.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the last downfall was mainly due to panic selling, a daily candle closing above $1230 resistance will hint at the resumption of the prior bull cycle.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, a potential bullish breakout from the overhead trendline will signal an early sign of price recovery. If the market sentiment supports buyers, an ideal target from this pattern will push the prices to $1500.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>RSI</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: While the Ethereum price walks sideways in a short-term trend, the<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/"> daily RSI slope</a> rising indicates growth in bullish momentum. Thus, this bullish divergence indicates a higher possibility for prices to revisit the $1350 level.</span></p>
<p><b>EMA&#8217;s: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the downsloping EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) offer additional resistance to stall the potential price rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1219</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $1230  and $1300</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $1150 and $1080</span></li>

The price speculation can be attributed to a number of reasons surrounding the crypto project, which is in a dire attempt to minimize its gigantic supply of 6 trillion tokens and to reinstate the UST peg back to $1.</p>
<h2>LUNC As Reserves?</h2>
<p>The crypto community is abuzz with the news of LUNC being the next <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/shiba-inu-shib/">SHIB</a>, which would see a massive number of buy orders from <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2">crypto exchanges</a> and other firms in regard to their reserves. This particular news has been brewing for quite some time now, and caught more steam on Friday. However, there has been no official announcement and is yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>Reports of crypto giant Coinbase buying LUNC worth $245 million (unconfirmed) flooded social media platforms like Twitter, which further pushed the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency&#8217;s</a> price to climb up for two consecutive days. Moreover, this comes in the midst of market obstacles including an increased number of <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-dcg-bankruptcy-assets/">businesses filing for bankruptcy</a> due to the FTX collapse and the weakening macroeconomic environment.</p>
<h2>Airdrop Pumps LUNC Price</h2>
<p>Earlier, as reported on CoinGape, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> also completed its second round of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/airdrop-2/">airdrop</a> distribution to Terra Classic (LUNC) and Terra ClassicUSD (USTC) holders, which was related to the “Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan 2” devised by <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/do-kwon">Do Kwon</a>. In May of 2022, the initial airdrop was already successfully completed.</p>

However, on-chain data indicates a sharp fall in selloffs by miners and whales.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price currently trades near $17,000. The U.S. PCE data for November comes in at 5.5%, which fell from 6.1% in October. As a result, the BTC price falls slightly with respect to volatility in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY).</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price To Rally Above $17,000 Before the New Year 2023?</h2>
<p>According to on-chain data, the Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Transactions for All Miners and All Exchanges metric indicates a fall in selling pressure from miners. While miners have sold their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to recover from financial constraints, miners are trying to hold onto their Bitcoin holdings.</p>
<blockquote><p>Moreover, miners&#8217; transactions to <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchanges</a> have continued to drop since the start of the year. Interestingly, the transactions were more when the price was considerably higher.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, it doesn&#8217;t mean miners can&#8217;t sell more BTC holdings at the moment. Historically, when transactions go as low as the previous <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a> cycles, the possibility of Bitcoin price forming a bottom is higher.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next thing restricting the Bitcoin upside momentum is selloffs by whales. However, on-chain data indicates <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-whale-trade-activity-in-a-key-turn-is-it-bullish-or-bearish/">retail investors are buying</a> more while whales are selling. It is causing Bitcoin to become more distributed on the network. Instead of whales having most of the BTC supply, it&#8217;s better to have more investors having it.</p>

<h2>Crypto Analysts Are Also Bullish</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst CredibleCrypto predicts the Bitcoin price can move above $17K before the 2022 end. He asserts that Bitcoin is holding the 16.3K-16.5K range and BTC dominance has begun moving up. He also completely agrees with BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes that the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-price-100k-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price can hit $100K</a> by the 2023 end or early 2024.</p>
<p>Moreover, popular analyst <a href="https://coingape.com/popular-analyst-predicts-bitcoin-btc-eth-ada-link-price-for-new-year-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rekt Capital suggests traders</a> to keep an eye on the Bitcoin price closing the month above $17,150, which will start a bullish upside move in 2023.</p>

A section of crypto analysts and traders have been expressing anguish on the whole scenario. This is in the context of the huge loss incurred due to the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> collapse. In a matter of few days, the FTX exchange went down from a valuation of $32 billion to just $1 billion. The news of FTX liquidation crisis brought the FTX token (FTT) price dropping in a rapid pace.</p>

<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) Bail One Of The Largest</h2>
<p>In the context of FTX falling down from a valuation of $32 billion to $1 billion, the SBF bail is being touted as one of the largest in the history of white collar crimes. This comes after SBF recently revealing that he holds no more than in $100,o00 in cash. He made the comments following the FTX bankruptcy announcement. While announcing the FTX bankruptcy, the company also announced SBF&#8217;s resignation as the company CEO. Following this, John J. Ray III took charge as the new FTX CEO to see the company through the bankruptcy process.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Funny how SBF is able to post the $250M bail not long after saying he only had $100k. So he probably is using stolen customer deposits to stay out of jail.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

With sustained selling, the BTC price will get further discounted, and interested investors can accumulate at a cheaper price. Thus, here are three reasons why you buy bitcoin in this correction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/l44W9JLM.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tradingview</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1)Long Retracement is Common in Bitcoin</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing downfall, the <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-how-much-your-1000-invested-in-bitcoin-10-years-ago-will-be-worth-today-btc/">Bitcoin price</a> has tumbled 75.49% from an all-time high of $68,789. Though several investors think that it is an aggressive downtrend, the historical records show this long correction is common for Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 17th December 2017, Bitcoin reached a high of $19660, but the following correction plunged the price 84% to reach around $3150. Similarly, the coin price turned down from the $13850 mark in late June of 2019 and slumped 72% down before starting the next bull cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the market participant believing that Bitcoin will eventually rise higher can look for entry opportunities in this current dip.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2)RSI Indicator Rising</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">Relative Strenght index(RSI)</a>, measuring the speed and magnitude of the coin’s price action, reflects the underlying ongoing trend. Therefore, the RSI slope is rising despite the last two lower lows in Bitcoin price, indicating demand pressure is rising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bullish divergence indicates the Bitcoin price is likely to witness a near-term recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3)Bitcoin Price Following A Bullish Continuation Pattern</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekly time chart showcases the Bitcoin price resonating inside a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern</a>. The core concepts of this pattern suggest the losing bearish momentum as the price action wobbles better two converging trendings indicate the seller&#8217;s failure to bolster deeper correction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the coin price is expected to eventually break the overhead trendline and trigger a directional price rally. Thus, if the market sentiment improves, the ideal target for this pattern would be $25460.</span></p>
<p><strong>Current Price Action</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the November second week&#8217;s downfall, the Bitcoin price gave a massive breakdown from the combined support of 0.786 FIB and $18250. Furthermore, the recent recovery in the Bitcoin price must be a retest phase to validate the resistance power of the breached level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, If the selling pressure persists, the Bitcoin price may drop to the $13850 or $12500 mark.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance Levels: $18250 and $21850</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support Levels: $13850 and $12500 </span></li>

And, with the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">cryptocurrency market</a> going through a turbulent period this year, it has ultimately resulted in increased opportunities for the XRP token in 2023.</p>
<h2>Favorable Technical Indicators</h2>
<p>The price of XRP sits on top of a strong demand area, which is marginally above $0.30. Since June, Ripple&#8217;s XRP tokens have maintained this support and according to data, as XRP price rises to trade at $0.35, bulls will be aiming for a pre-Christmas breakout.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I looked behind and realised we had been walking an incredible journey with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XRP</a> for a long time. It wouldn&#39;t be possible without you.</p>
<p>RSI is at the lowest ever, like 2017 w/ a price on the support, above $0.33.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Information gathered from fxstreet, also reveals that the top of the falling wedge, as per the XRP/USDT 1W chart, is being tested by the price of XRP. A clear close above the upper trend line might indicate a breakout with a potential beginning of a new uptrend.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132787" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23192655/XRPUSDT_2022-12-20_17-40-43-638071460610942546.png" alt="" width="1088" height="704" /></p>
<h2>Massive Whale Accumulation</h2>
<p>Whales in the crypto market has been seent to amass more XRP tokens by taking advantage of the recent price fall the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> experienced. In addition, as per a report, over the course of the past five weeks, the percentage of XRP held by whale addresses has increased from 16.7% to 18.3%.</p>

<p>In particular, as of December 23, the number of XRP whale and shark addresses holding 1 million to 10 million tokens hit a new all-time high. The number climbed up to a staggering 1,617 addresses, as per data from <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://app.santiment.net/projects/ripple" rel="nofollow">Santiment</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132785" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23185213/20221223_183247.jpg" alt="" width="2474" height="1812" /></p>
<h2>XRP Smart Contracts Coming Soon</h2>
<p>Matt Hamilton, who formerly served as the director of developer relations for Ripple, has hinted that <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/smart-contract/">smart contracts</a> may soon be available on the cutting-edge XRP Ledger.</p>
<p>According to Hamilton, the cutting-edge features such as &#8220;fungible tokens, NFTs, escrows, multisig, and DEX&#8221; are already incorporated into the blockchain.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well, most functionality needed (fungible tokens, NFTs, escrows, multisig, DEX) are all built in. </p>
<p>But yes, smart contracts are in development</p>
<p>&mdash; Matt Hamilton (@HammerToe) <a href="https://twitter.com/HammerToe/status/1605721014813573120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Win Verdict In XRP Lawsuit?</h2>
<p>Despite the strong fundamental prognosis for the XRP price, the outcome of the legal dispute that Ripple has been involved in with the U.S. SEC will eventually determine the price&#8217;s final course.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-files-motion-to-seal-docs/">Ripple Seeks Virtually No Redaction For Summary Judgment</a></em></p>
<p>However, prominent crypto experts predict significant price movement in XRP with a positive outcome in the court case. U.S. lawmaker and congressional candidate <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/UtahPolitician" rel="nofollow">January Walker</a> recently emphasised the significance of <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-attorney-drops-new-schedule-in-ripple-lawsuit/">Ripple possibly outmanoeuvring the SEC</a> in the ongoing dispute. According to Walker, a settlement would be detrimental to the Web3 environment.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If Ripple settles it will be a loss for the whole world &amp; WEB3.</p>
<p>&mdash; January Walker (@UtahPolitician) <a href="https://twitter.com/UtahPolitician/status/1602291659328221184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Both sides have handed in their closing arguments, and it appears as though a decision will be made sooner rather than later. A victory for Ripple can most certainly lead to an increase in the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/">XRP</a>.</p>

<h2>Ripple&#8217;s XRP Price Rally In 2023?</h2>
<p>With a growing list of global partnerships like Balmain Thread and Travelex to name a few, Ripple is aiming towards becoming the de-facto crypto solution for facilitating cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Additionally, the crypto giant recently partnered with a Seattle-based Web3 startup called Stably, to launch its <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-usd-stablecoin-officially-launches-xrp-ledger/">first-ever stablecoin called USDS</a> on its XRP Ledger.</p>

<p>Many crypto analysts confirm that the strong fundamentals as well as favorable technical metrics do indicate a potential price rally for the XRP token in the coming year of 2023.</p>

Ray III filed a motion in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Thursday to enforce an automatic stay or extend the stay orders on Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s 56 million shares of Robinhood Markets, worth $440 million. FTX investigation indicates Robinhood shares are the property of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> company and affiliates.</p>
<h2>FTX Files Motion To Seek Authority Over SBF&#8217;s Robinhood Shares</h2>
<p>According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.291.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">court filing</a> on December 22, FTX has filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The exchange claims Robinhood&#8217;s 56 million shares that SBF bought are the property of FTX and the shares must stay locked until the resolution of competing creditors&#8217; claims.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/blockfi-files-lawsuit-against-sbfs-holding-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crypto lender BlockFi </a>and individual creditor Yonathan Ben Shimon want to gain control of the shares via separate court proceedings in New Jersey and Antigua. Sam Bankman-Fried also tried to gain control of Robinhood shares in December, shortly before his arrest. SBF&#8217;s request in a court in Antigua is still pending and he may try to get control of Robinhood shares worth $440 million.</p>
<p>FTX wants the judge overseeing the bankruptcy case to enforce the shares to remain frozen while the company tries to figure out how to repay all its creditors. FTX stated that Robinhood shares are held in a brokerage account at EDFM for non-debtor company Emergent Fidelity Technologies. Emergent is 90% owned by Sam Bankman-Fried and appears to have no other business.</p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Released on Bail</h2>
<p>While FTX debtor seeks control of assets related to FTX and Alameda Research, <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-founder-sbf-released-on-250-mn-bond-placed-under-house-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBF was released on a $250 million bond bail</a> on Thursday. The bail was prearranged that saw SBF placed under house arrest in his Palo Alto home owned by his parents Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, prominent Stanford University law professors.</p>
<p>Interestingly, after SBF&#8217;s bail, FTX Token (FTT) price jumped over 15%. The FTT price is currently trading at $0.9831. The 24-hour low and high are $0.8356 and $1.13, respectively.</p>

Traders expect a minor upside move near Christmas to push the BTC price above $17K.</p>
<p>Conversely, analysts believe Bitcoin price could see an upside move near Christmas, but a <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-crypto-on-chain-analysts-dismiss-santa-claus-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Claus rally for a move above $18K</a> is difficult this time. However, several experts and analysts do believe in a massive bullish rally in 2023 and BTC price hitting $100K.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is currently trading at $16,845. The 24-hour low and high are $16,755 and $16,895, respectively. Thus, the BTC price is up just 1% in the last 24 hours. However, the price shows more volatility.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Price Can Rally Above $17K</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst CredibleCrypto in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CredibleCrypto/status/1605663205065269248" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on December 22 predicts the Bitcoin price can move above $17K before the 2022 end. He asserts that Bitcoin is holding the 16.3K-16.5K range and BTC dominance has begun moving up.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132574" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132574" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-132574" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/22141227/Bitcoin-price-prediction.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Price Prediction" width="725" height="355" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132574" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price Prediction.

<p><a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-is-19k-still-possible-or-btc-to-fall-below-15k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CredibleCrypto earlier shared</a> two scenarios for Bitcoin (BTC) price as it tagged the $16.5K support level again. He remains bullish on Bitcoin rising over $19K in the short term. Bitcoin price will move above $17K and then a rejection or bullish continuation can be seen. However, Bitcoin needs to hold the level for an upside move.</p>
<p>Moreover, he fully agrees with BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes that the Bitcoin price can hit $100K by the 2023 end or early 2024.</p>
<h2>Why Bitcoin Price Can Hit 100K in 2023</h2>
<p>Experts believe 2023 will be a better year for the stock market as well as the crypto market as the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> shifts to buying treasuries. Felix Zulauf of hedge fund Zulauf Consulting and Arthur Hayes <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWp4fq9pH88" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> massive bullish rallies in mid-2023, possibly in April-May, will bring a turnaround of events that could reverse the cycle.</p>
<p>Technology stocks will rebound first, which saw massive selloffs in this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a>. The liquidity will be added as the economy goes bad, said Zulauf. Hayes asserts Bitcoin will hit $100K in late 2023. However, it all depends on the Fed&#8217;s pivot.</p>

South Korean prosecutors investigating the Terra-LUNA crisis have <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-founder-and-fugitive-do-kwon-is-in-serbia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracked Do Kwon in Serbia</a>. However, Serbia has no extradition treaty with South Korea. On Friday, South Korean media reported that Do Kwon has cashed in Bitcoin worth nearly $190K in Serbia.</p>
<h2>Terra Founder Do Kwon Using LFG Bitcoins?</h2>
<p>Terra co-founder Do Kwon has exchanged Bitcoin worth $190K from the Luna Foundation Guard for cash in Serbia, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202212236022B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> South Korean media Korea Economic Daily&#8217;s Hankyung on December 23.</p>
<p>The South Korean media cited that Digital Asset, which claims to be tracking on-chain data for 7 months, reported a transfer of 9.64 BTC from the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) wallet to the Binance wallet on November 8. Also, the company confirmed a transfer of $10,000.</p>
<p>Moreover, it also reported that Do Kwon moved about 6983 BTC from a Binance&#8217;s LFG wallet to an unidentified wallet. However, the cash-in was not recorded this time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prosecutors are aware of Do Kwon&#8217;s entry into Serbia, where deposits and withdrawals of virtual assets are easy. Prosecutors also believe that he will continue to need funds to continue to be on the run and for daily needs. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinatmradar.com/country/189/bitcoin-atm-serbia/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinATMRadar</a>, there are two cryptocurrency kiosks in Serbia&#8217;s capital Belgrade.</p>

When the end of the year approaches, there is always a signature pump that most people anticipate; you might want to use some of that profit as a present for yourself. Here are the top 5 crypto tokens you should own to celebrate the holidays and the new year.</p>
<h2>Top 5 Crypto Tokens to Purchase for an Exciting Christmas Season in 2022</h2>
<h3>Polygon (MATIC)</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon (MATIC)</a></strong> has had the most interesting year of any cryptocurrency, and it&#8217;s starting to grow quickly as the end of the year approaches. Most web2 companies are quickly adopting <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a> thanks to the network. However, the MATIC token is likely to see a price increase before the end of the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132760" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23165523/MATIC_1D_graph_coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="Polygon (MATIC)" width="1161" height="500" /></p>
<h6>Source: Coinmarketcap</h6>
<p>Polygon&#8217;s price today is $0.803817, with a market capitalization of $ 7 B and a 24-hour trading volume up by 23.29%. Now it stands at $205 million. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 8,734,317,475 MATIC.</p>
<h3>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h3>
<p>Shiba Inu is one of the cryptocurrencies that experts and enthusiasts in the field will continue to awe of. How <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/shiba-inu-shib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiba Inu</a></strong> has survived and changed over the years has piqued the interest of many people. It even appeared on the global top tokens list. The creators of this meme coin devised a plan and thought through the token&#8217;s journey in detail.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132761" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23165714/SHIB_1D_graph_coinmarketcap2.jpg" alt="Shiba Inu" width="1161" height="500" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Source: Coinmarketcap</h6>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s price today is $0.000008333, with a market capitalization of $ 4.5 B and a 24-hour trading volume up by 36.69%. Now it stands at $98 million. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 549,063,278,876,302 SHIB.</p>
<h3>Avalanche (AVAX)</h3>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is another <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> alternative blockchain that is well-known for its increased scalability. The token, like most other cryptocurrencies, suffered some value loss during the bear rally. However, in the spirit of AVAX&#8217;s Christmas colors, the price pump is something most people look forward to. Avalanche still has strong fundamentals, and the network can recoup some of its lost value once the market begins to pick up volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132762" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23165751/AVAX_1D_graph_coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="Avalanche" width="1161" height="500" /></p>
<h6>Source: Coinmarketcap</h6>
<p>Avalanche price today is $11.83, with a market capitalization of $ 8.5 B and a 24-hour trading volume up by 3.90%. Now it stands at $93.8 million. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 311,161,778 AVAX.</p>
<h3>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h3>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> is a meme coin you should have in your portfolio because it is constantly pumping. The meme coin is currently known for reacting to anything involving Elon Musk. However, it will make for a good purchase this Christmas because he is appearing in the news more frequently. You can still expect to profit from the cryptocurrency asset, despite being overpriced due to insane price pumps.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132763" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23165830/DOGE_1D_graph_coinmarketcap11.jpg" alt="Dogecoin" width="1161" height="500" /></p>
<h6>Source: Coinmarketcap</h6>
<p>Dogecoin&#8217;s price today is $0.07784, with a market capitalization of $ 10 B and a 24-hour trading volume up by 164.35%. Now it stands at $676 million. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 132,670,764,300 DOGE.</p>
<h3>Toncoin (TON)</h3>
<p>As the year comes to an end, the Telegram Open Network has recently begun to gain popularity. A network that Telegram had previously abandoned is the layer-1 blockchain. Even so, the network is gaining the notoriety it deserves, which has affected the value of its native token, TON. The token has increased significantly over the past few weeks, and additional interesting price trends may be on the horizon.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132764" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23165911/TON_1D_graph_coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="Toncoin" width="1161" height="500" /></p>
<h6>Source: Coinmarketcap</h6>
<p>Toncoin price today is $2.41, with a market capitalization of $ 2.9 B and a 24-hour trading volume up by 8.64%. Now it stands at $52 million. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 1,221,401,181 TON.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ajay Kumar Choudhary, executive director of the Reserve Bank of India, stated at an interactive session on &#8220;Digital Rupee: A Way Forward&#8221; that the introduction of digital currency would significantly increase system operational efficiency and promote financial inclusion.

<p>Digital rupee would add resilience linked to innovation in the way payments are made, claims Choudhary. According to him, it will also foster innovation in the field of international payments. In the future, the marketplaces will produce more enormous cases in accordance with their own needs. CBDC will provide the public with the desired experience while upholding consumer protection and averting negative social and economic repercussions, he added.</p>
<h2>Will it replace current payment system?</h2>
<p>Digital currency, according to Choudhary, will cover the strategic need at this moment. According to him, digital currency is more likely to supplement existing systems of payment than to replace them. It would give users a different option as a means of payment.</p>

<p>In order to create a system that is inclusive, competitive, and responsive to innovation and technological changes, he said, the Reserve Bank of India will take steps to ensure that the issuance of CBDC follows a calculated and proper approach with adequate safeguards to tackle any potential difficulties and risks.</p>
<p>According to the central bank digital currency (CBDC) tracker, nearly 105 nations—representing 95% of global GDP—have taken steps to integrate digital currency into their economic systems, Choudhary said, adding that about 50 nations are in an advanced stage of exploring the possibility of doing so, while 10 nations have already done so fully.</p>

<h2>Difference in UPI and digital currency</h2>
<p>When comparing digital currency with UPI, Choudhary noted that while UPI is a payment method, digital money issued by the central bank is a liability for the RBI, similar to physical currency. He noted that the respective bank is responsible for any transaction made through UPI.</p>

However, filings suggest that the commission is still in pursuit of shielding the vital Hinman documents. Meanwhile, crypto whales are still moving millions of XRP tokens.</p>
<h2>Can SEC still protect Hinman docs in XRP lawsuit?</h2>
<p>Attorney James Filan reported that SEC filed its <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0uullf9dlvxz3lm/SEC%20Motion%20to%20Seal%20Summary%20Judgment%20Documents.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">motions to seal some documents</a>. However, the SEC’s list is still carrying the Hinman Documents.<a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> Read More XRP news here</strong></a></p>
<p>The commission is still arguing that the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-update-hinman-conflict-to-delay-summary-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hinman emails and documents</a> are privileged even after losing assertions multiple times. The SEC mentioned that it wants to keep the emails from public view otherwise it would be “foreclosed” from making “such argument” in the future.</p>
<p>As per the filing, the commission produced these crucial internal documents after the judge denied the SEC’s objections. The watchdog claimed that the memos were protected by the deliberative process or attorney client privileges.</p>
<p>However, the SEC is still maintaining that the Hinman speech Documents are protected by the earlier mentioned privileges. It added that the clear lack of relevance of these documents to the Summary Judgement motion should be weighed against the impact.</p>
<p>The SEC highlighted that the release of these documents would not affect their ongoing deliberations on a wide variety of issues. These documents reflect internal discussions and deliberations by several SEC officials.</p>
<h2>Whale on an XRP buying spree?</h2>
<p>As per the data provided by WhaleAlert, <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-whales-holding-at-ath-amid-awaited-summary-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crypto whales have moved</a> around 275 million XRP (approx worth $97 million) in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>The largest transaction recorded by the trackers has been of moving 150 million XRP tokens. A whale added $52.1 million worth of XRP was moved from Binance to an unknown wallet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the crypto community is wondering whether SBF continues to have access to the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> user funds. The speculation around user funds was sparked after the news of $250 million bail bond coming to the rescue of the former FTX CEO. However, a New York released SBF based on a personal recognizance bond backed by some collateral from his parents.</p>

<h2>Explained: What Was SBF Bail Based On</h2>
<p>The defendant&#8217;s agreement involved a secured bond of $250 million backed by SBF&#8217;s parents&#8217; home in Palo Alto, California. Allan Bankman and Barbara Fried were named as surety owners in the security bond. This means SBF parents would have to forfeit the ownership of their Palo Alto home if the agreement is broken. The bond will be deemed as forfeited in case SBF:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8211; fails to appear for court proceedings<br />
&#8211; fails to comply with various conditions OR<br />
&#8211; is convicted of crime</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Steven McClurg, co-founder of Valkyrie Funds, wondered how SBF parents were allowed to put their home as collateral.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">So <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SBF_FTX</a> parents, who bought a home in Bahamas with stolen FTX funds, will use their other home as collateral on the $250mm bail?</p>

Enjoying Life is a non- profit organization that provides humanitarian aids across the war struck country, Ukraine.</p>
<p>His team at Hold Security broke into Solaris, one of the biggest online drug markets in Russia, and redirected cryptocurrency owed to traffickers and the site&#8217;s owners and transferred to Enjoying Life.</p>
<h2>How was Holden able to steal Bitcoins?</h2>
<p>He was able to seize control of a large portion of the internet infrastructure that supported Solaris, many administrator accounts that ran the illegal marketplace, the website&#8217;s source code, a user database, and drop-off locations for drug delivery. However, he denied to give details about it. He claimed that his team had a short period control on the Solaris Wallet, which is used an exchange for the Bitcoin <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Also read</strong>: <a href="https://coingape.com/why-american-billionaire-investor-bullish-bitcoin/">Why This American Billionaire Investor Is Still Bullish On Bitcoin?</a></p>
<p>The money was coming and going quickly from the wallet, hence, they could manage only 1.6 bitcoin. The worth of which is 25,000 USD. His team The Hold Security is also donating 8000 USD to the charity.</p>
<p>The owner of the charity also confirmed that they have received the Bitcoin transaction. Holden also showed several screenshots with Forbes, which when verified confirms the transaction.</p>
<h2>Holden&#8217;s relation to Ukraine</h2>
<p>Holden is a Kyiv resident, who left the city in 1980s following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster that created havoc in the country. In the month of February this year, Russia invaded Ukraine and war broke out. Holden simply wants to serve the people of his war torn country.</p>

<p>While talking to Forbes on stealing Bitcoin, Holden took a dig on Russia and said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Maybe Russians without their drugs would soberly look at their country and do something. Maybe the Kremlin won’t defend their country’s drug trade and fix the drug problems instead of invading Ukraine.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Holden currently has a sizeable data repository on Solaris&#8217; users and operations, which he thinks might be utilised to locate any Russian cybercriminals utilising the site as a base of operations. He has so far managed to maintain influence over a number of market segments.</p>

However, they are a rapidly expanding market segment for NFTs.</p>
<h3>What are Sports NFTs?</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/top-5-sports-personalities-who-owns-nft-in-2022-here-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports NFTs</a></strong> are <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a>-based digital assets that are verifiably one-of-a-kind and are used to represent digital trading cards, sporting events, and digital memorabilia. However, other kinds of sports-related items. In addition to giving fans a new way to interact with their favorite teams and athletes. Although, the issuance of sports NFTs gives athletes, clubs, and sports brands a new avenue for monetization.</p>
<p>Many fans are willing to spend a lot of money to acquire limited edition virtual memorabilia of their favorite baseball player or basketball team, for instance. Because of this, sports NFTs frequently trade for tens of thousands of dollars (or more), and some of the rarest items now have significantly higher values.</p>
<h2>Where can you buy sports NFTs?</h2>
<p>Sports NFTs can be purchased in a variety of markets. Some of the busiest <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT marketplaces</a></strong> for items related to sports are:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenSea</li>
<li>Autograph</li>
<li>Rarible</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why are sports fans drawn to NFTs?</h2>
<p>The use of NFTs is intended to promote deeper interactions between fan clubs. Virtual collectibles or player cards enable fans to get together and trade stickers featuring special highlights from their favorite athletes. These cards come in a variety of rarities, some of which have a price tag of $1,000. That thrills fans, as it has done for decades in a physical setting, and they are delighted to purchase expensive sports player trading cards.</p>
<p>Using NBA Top Shot by Dapper Labs as an example, the lowest asking price for Ja Morant&#8217;s dunk series 1 is $475,000 on this platform&#8217;s NFT marketplace. Lebron James exceeded his record-breaking 32 with $535,000. The price tag on Derrick Rose&#8217;s storied 59 is currently $1 million.</p>
<h3>Leading NFT Sports Card Brands</h3>
<p>A few sports NFT brands have emerged to capture the majority of the sports NFT market in addition to well-known athletes, like Rob Gronkowski, releasing collections that make headlines.</p>
<ul>
<li>NBA Topshot</li>
<li>NFL All-Day</li>
<li>UFC Strike</li>
<li> Sorare</li>
</ul>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132746" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23151933/Le-Bron.jpg" alt="Le-Bron" width="1200" height="750" /></p>
<h2>What Are the Benefits of NFTs to the Sports Industry?</h2>
<p>NFTs transform the idea of sports memorabilia by enabling fans to own the cards of their favorite players and even game videos. They give sports organizations the chance to build enduring bonds with their supporters.</p>
<p>The way sports organizations interact with their fans is also changed by NFTs. Teams can increase fan engagement by giving members special benefits and occasionally even a way to have a say in key governance decisions.</p>
<h3>Sports Leagues Have a New Source of Revenue</h3>
<p>Sports teams may receive additional income if they issue non-fungible tokens. Traditionally, the primary sources of revenue for a sports business have been ticket and merchandise sales, media rights, and sponsorships. Even in the midst of a pandemic, teams can use NFTs to tokenize game tickets, stream live games to token holders, or plan holder-only events in the metaverse.</p>
<h3>Athletes&#8217; Individual Branding</h3>
<p>To interact with their fan base, athletes can launch their own <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT collections</a></strong>. In a manner akin to trading cards, athlete NFTs foster a relationship between the player and their ardent fans. Fans can display mementos of their favorite players on social media, for instance, to display their team colors.</p>
<p>Additionally, by issuing non-fungible tokens on their own, athletes can protect their intellectual property rights. As NFT creators, they are entitled to royalties from the sales of their NFTs, which could provide them with a comfortable cushion and wealth for retirement.</p>
<h3>Top 5 most expensive NFTs in Sports</h3>
<ul>
<li>LeBron James Statue — $35 million</li>
<li>MLB Champions Brett Gardner — $21.28 million</li>
<li>Jermall Charlo Lions Only GOLD ULTIMATE — $19.1 million</li>
<li>Michael Jordan SportPunk — $5.06 million</li>
<li>Rare Diego Maradona 2020-21 — $4.3 million</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been an increase in the number of non-fungible token applications in the sports sector, and this trend is likely to continue. Digital assets give organizations new opportunities to interact with their devoted fans and open up fresh revenue streams. Even though unique badges are still enjoyed by sports fans to own, trade, and wear, NFT sports use cases today go far beyond digital collectibles.</p>
