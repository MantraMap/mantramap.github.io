<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has unexpectedly terminated its sponsorship agreement with the Argentina national football team.</em></li>



<li><em>The deal, signed in early 2022, was controversial as the exchange competed with the Chiliz/Socios fan token project for sponsorship rights.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance&#8217;s decision comes amidst growing regulatory challenges, declining profits, and recent layoffs at the exchange.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceArg/status/1680971083904700416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terminated</a> its sponsorship agreement with the reigning World Cup champion, Argentina. The unexpected move was announced on Twitter, stating that the exchange had ended its sponsorship of the Argentina football team.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit" class="wp-image-203516" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1161.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The sponsorship agreement between the exchange and Argentina was signed in early 2022 for a period of five years. The exact value of the agreement was not disclosed. As part of the deal, Binance&#8217;s logo was set to appear on the team&#8217;s training jerseys and stadiums during friendlies featuring Argentina.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Binance has decided to end its association with the AFA (Argentine Football Association). We regularly evaluate the results of our partnerships around the world and unfortunately, despite being offered time and opportunity, AFA has not fully met its contractual obligations, which goes against our business values ​​and our association principles. Binance remains committed to growing in Argentina and continues to engage with local partners, including prestigious universities, with the goal of continuing to expand educational efforts and strategic business alliances,&#8221; the exchange stated.<a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceArg/status/1680971083904700416" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The sponsorship deal itself was surrounded by controversy, as Binance competed with the Chiliz/Socios fan token issuance project to become the sponsor for the Argentina team, including star player Lionel Messi. Socios, feeling aggrieved, sued the Argentine Football Federation (AFA), seeking to be the sole fan token partner until 2026.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1162.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1162-1024x768.png" alt="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit" class="wp-image-203518" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1162-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1162-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1162-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1162-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1162-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1162.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>This termination of sponsorship comes at a challenging time for Binance. The exchange has faced regulatory and legal challenges globally, resulting in <a href="https://coincu.com/202996-binance-fired-1000-people-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a> of over 1,000 employees. The <a href="https://coincu.com/203495-binance-cuts-benefits-and-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declining profits</a> of the company have also led to the cessation of certain employee benefits.</p>



<p>In addition to the Argentina football team, the exchange sponsors other teams and issues fan tokens for S.S Lazio (Italy), FC Porto (Portugal), and Santos FC (Brazil). The exchange has also partnered with the Confederation of African Football to sponsor the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) and collaborates with the F1 Alpine team. Binance&#8217;s NFT platform has partnered with Cristiano Ronaldo to release NFT collections for fans.</p>



<p>In recent years, Binance has faced various legal and business challenges. The exchange has been sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is rumored to face potential criminal prosecution by the US Department of Justice. It has encountered regulatory troubles in several countries, including the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Cyprus, Brazil, Austria, France, Germany, and Australia.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163.png" alt="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit" class="wp-image-203519" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1163-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Terminates Sponsorship Deal With Argentina Amid Falling Profit 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>These developments have impacted the exchange&#8217;s market share, particularly in the US, where its <a href="https://coincu.com/197963-binanceus-lost-as-judge-rejects-its-accusations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US</a> platform has lost a banking partner, limiting its ability to handle USD transactions. The exchange has also reportedly laid off a significant number of employees, although Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has disputed the accuracy of the reported figures.</p>



<p>In late June, several key members of Binance&#8217;s senior management resigned, including the Chief Counsel, Chief Strategy Officer, and Vice President of Legal Compliance. These departures are believed to be linked to the ongoing investigation by the US Department of Justice into Binance&#8217;s activities.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is facing financial challenges as it grapples with falling profits and regulatory issues.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Cuts Benefits Of Employees Amid Regulatory Challenge" class="wp-image-203507" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1158.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Cuts Benefits Of Employees Amid Regulatory Challenge 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/202996-binance-fired-1000-people-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, the company recently made headlines for laying off over 1,000 employees, and now it has been revealed that Binance is also reducing employee benefits as part of its cost-cutting measures.</p>



<p>According to the<em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-cuts-back-employee-benefits-citing-decline-in-profit-51d51cf7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, Binance has decided to cut back on several employee benefits, including mobile-phone reimbursement, fitness reimbursement, and work-from-home expenses. These changes were communicated to employees through an internal message viewed by the publication. The message cited the current market environment and regulatory climate, which have led to a decline in profit, as the reasons for scaling back on benefits. The exchange hinted that further cost-cutting actions may be necessary in the future.</p>



<p>The decision to reduce benefits comes at a time when Binance is facing regulatory challenges in multiple jurisdictions. The exchange has been <a href="https://coincu.com/200786-binance-in-crisis-executives-flee-storms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embroiled</a> in lawsuits from regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). These legal battles have taken a toll on Binance&#8217;s financial performance and market share.</p>

<p>During a company meeting on its sixth anniversary, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1679951762906595330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assured</a> employees that the exchange remains profitable and has not been impacted by the SEC lawsuit. However, he cautioned that additional layoffs could occur every three to six months, and he expressed uncertainty about when the cut benefits would be reinstated.</p>



<p>The recent layoffs and benefit reductions have raised concerns among employees and industry observers. Some former employees have reported that several hundred customer-service employees were let go, adding to the already significant number of layoffs. CZ disputed the reported numbers and stated that layoffs are a regular occurrence in any company.</p>

<p>Binance&#8217;s regulatory struggles have not been limited to the United States. The exchange has faced challenges in Europe, leading to its exit from certain markets due to regulatory hurdles. These issues have contributed to a decline in Binance&#8217;s market dominance and raised questions about its ability to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://coincu.com/200804-binance-abandons-dutch-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> adjusts its operations to address financial strain and regulatory pressures, the industry will closely monitor its future actions. Rebuilding market share and ensuring compliance with regulations will be key priorities for the exchange as it seeks to regain stability in the highly competitive cryptocurrency market.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>SEC Chair</em> Gary Gensler<em> comments on the recent court ruling in the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Ripple, expressing both satisfaction and disappointment with the outcome.</em></li>



<li><em>The court ruling determined that institutional sales of Ripple&#8217;s tokens violated federal securities laws, while sales on exchanges and programmatic sales were not considered securities.</em></li>



<li><em>The ruling&#8217;s implications for retail investors and the potential for an appeal raise uncertainty about the future regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has publicly addressed the recent court ruling in the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Ripple, stated that while he was disappointed with a district court&#8217;s decision in the Ripple case regarding retail investors, he was pleased with the portion of the order that found institutional sales of the tokens did violate federal securities laws.</strong></h5>

<p>Last week, Ripple <a href="https://coincu.com/202599-ripple-wins-against-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved</a> a partial victory as the court ruled that institutional sales of the XRP tokens violated federal securities laws, while sales on exchanges and programmatic sales did not qualify as the sale of securities. The ruling was based on the SEC&#8217;s inability to establish that speculative investors had a reasonable expectation of profits from the efforts of others.</p>



<p>During a talk on artificial intelligence at the National Press Club, Gensler was asked about the ruling&#8217;s impact on his stance on cryptocurrency and whether it necessitates federal legislation for regulatory oversight. He expressed satisfaction with the court&#8217;s decision to recognize the importance of investor protection for institutional investors. However, he voiced disappointment regarding the ruling&#8217;s implications for retail investors and stated that the SEC is still assessing the opinion.</p>



<p>Gensler reiterated similar sentiments in an interview with <em><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/sec-chair-warns-ais-potential-201110024.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo Finance</a></em> later in the day. He acknowledged the court&#8217;s recognition of XRP as a security for institutional investors and its consideration of fair notice. He mentioned that the SEC is continuing to evaluate the ruling and its implications.</p>



<p>The SEC chair declined to provide further details on the SEC&#8217;s requirements for being confident about spot <a href="https://coincu.com/202973-sec-now-acknowledges-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs), citing ongoing litigation and the need to avoid prejudging the applications before the regulatory body.</p>

<p>When questioned about the SEC&#8217;s regulatory approach, Gensler highlighted that the SEC has engaged in rulemaking, including notice and comment rulemaking and special purpose broker-dealer licensing. He also acknowledged the existence of the European Union&#8217;s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, which emphasizes rulemaking.</p>



<p>This public response from Gensler marks the first time he has addressed the Ripple case since the court ruling. His expressed disappointment with the verdict&#8217;s impact on retail investors coincided with a drop in the price of Ripple&#8217;s XRP, following a brief nearly 100% rally in response to the mixed verdict.</p>

<p>The ruling&#8217;s nuanced differentiation between private sales to accredited investors and programmatic sales to exchanges has raised concerns among experts, including former SEC official <a href="https://coincu.com/203157-xrp-security-or-not-former-sec-official-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Reed Stark</a>. Stark believes the ruling is on &#8220;shaky ground&#8221; and anticipates an appeal. He criticized the ruling&#8217;s potential creation of a new category of &#8220;quasi-securities&#8221; dependent on investor sophistication, deeming it counter-intuitive and inconsistent with SEC case law.</p>



<p>The possibility of an appeal introduces uncertainty regarding the final outcome of the case and the future regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Customers Bank emerges as a top banking partner for the US crypto industry after the closure of Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank.</em></li>



<li><em>The bank offers the Customers Bank Instant Token (CBIT) platform for 24/7 payments, attracting clients from both crypto and other industries.</em></li>



<li><em>Customers Bank also downplays its crypto connections but continues to serve major crypto players while focusing on risk management and expanding its payments business.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Customers Bank, a small Pennsylvania-based bank, has become a preferred banking partner for the US crypto industry, attracting a wave of new clients after the collapse of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="978" height="733" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153.png" alt="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry" class="wp-image-203489" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153.png 978w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153-750x562.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" title="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>With its platform Customers Bank Instant Token (CBIT), the bank offers 24/7 payments for its crypto clients, similar to Silvergate Capital&#8217;s now-closed Silvergate Exchange Network. The closures of Silvergate and Signature Bank left little competition for Customers Bank, positioning it as a leading player in the market.</p>



<p>According to a <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-17/after-ftx-and-silvergate-customers-bank-cubi-becomes-crypto-s-favorite-bank#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em> report, Customers Bank has partnered with hundreds of digital asset firms, including major exchanges, market makers, and stablecoin issuers. It managed to attract new clients from the crypto sector as well as technology, venture capital, and fund finance sectors after the collapse of Silvergate and Signature Bank. The bank&#8217;s staff worked tirelessly to onboard these new clients, positioning the bank as a reliable and trusted banking partner.</p>



<p>However, the bank is now downplaying its connections to the crypto industry. The bank has decided to limit crypto-related deposits on its Customers Bank Instant Token platform to no more than 15% of its total balance sheet. Deposits on the platform accounted for around 13% of the bank&#8217;s total deposits at the end of Q1 2023. Customers Bank&#8217;s CEO, Sam Sidhu, has emphasized that the bank&#8217;s focus is on strengthening and deepening customer relationships across multiple industries, rather than relying solely on crypto-related deposits.</p>

<p>The US regulatory environment surrounding the crypto industry has become more stringent, with increased scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and warnings from bank industry regulators about the risks of doing business with the crypto sector. As a result, Customers Bank is cautious about openly promoting its crypto business and is focused on managing risk and ensuring regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Customers Bank continues to do business with major players in the crypto industry, including Circle Internet Financial, <a href="https://coincu.com/203024-us-sec-coinbase-listing-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase Global</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/180802-rumor-paxos-set-to-exit-canadian-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paxos Trust</a>, GSR, <a href="https://coincu.com/200316-crypto-bank-anchorage-digital-sees-80-jump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anchorage Digital</a>, and <a href="https://coincu.com/197226-bitgo-wont-buy-back-prime-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitGo</a>. However, the bank is exploring a broader plan to expand its payments business and build stronger customer relationships beyond the crypto sector.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-1024x683.png" alt="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry" class="wp-image-203491" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154.png 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>While the bank&#8217;s role as a banking partner for the crypto industry brings attention from regulators, the bank believes it has measures in place to manage risk effectively. It holds CBIT deposits in US currency and spreads large deposits among multiple banks to ensure FDIC coverage for its depositors.</p>



<p>The emergence of Customers Bank as a leading banking partner highlights the challenges faced by the crypto industry in accessing reliable banking services. The industry is still seeking more alternatives and broader support from traditional fiat banks to address its banking needs.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>UK&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is introducing new social media guidance to combat illegal and non-compliant financial promotions.</em></li>



<li><em>The FCA aims to modernize regulations and address the use of social media in promoting financial products and services.</em></li>



<li><em>The FCA will also collaborate with the Advertising Standards Authority to increase scrutiny over illegal promotions, including those related to cryptocurrencies, and educate consumers about the risks involved.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/social-media-guidance-set-revamp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its intention to enhance regulations surrounding financial promotions on social media platforms.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="587" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1024x587.jpg" alt="UK Financial Conduct Authority Plans To Strengthen Regulations On Crypto Promotions" class="wp-image-203481" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-300x172.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-768x440.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1536x881.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-2048x1174.jpg 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-750x430.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1140x654.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="UK Financial Conduct Authority Plans To Strengthen Regulations On Crypto Promotions 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>The proposed guidance aims to modernize the information provided by firms when advertising financial products or services online, taking into account the evolving landscape of social media advertising in the financial industry.</p>



<p>One of the key objectives of the new guidance is to support the FCA&#8217;s Consumer Investments Strategy, which aims to reduce the number of retail consumers investing in high-risk investments without appropriate risk tolerance or vulnerability characteristics by 2025.</p>



<p>In addition to addressing illegal and non-compliant financial promotions, the FCA will also focus on curbing promotions by financial influencers that may harm consumers. This includes a particular emphasis on influencers promoting cryptocurrency assets on social media platforms.</p>



<p>To tackle these issues, the <a href="https://coincu.com/196130-binance-unregister-in-uk-fca-before-war-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FCA</a> plans to collaborate with the Advertising Standards Authority to increase oversight and scrutiny of illegal financial promotions and advertising practices. The regulators also aim to educate both consumers and influencers about the risks associated with promoting financial products.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="500" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151.png" alt="UK Financial Conduct Authority Plans To Strengthen Regulations On Crypto Promotions" class="wp-image-203483" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151.png 900w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151-300x167.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151-768x427.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1151-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="UK Financial Conduct Authority Plans To Strengthen Regulations On Crypto Promotions 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>Starting from October 8, the FCA will implement several measures, including banning incentives for investing in cryptocurrencies such as &#8220;refer a friend&#8221; bonuses. Firms will be required to provide clear risk warnings and introduce a mandatory 24-hour cooling-off period to allow first-time investors sufficient time to make informed investment decisions.</p>



<p>The FCA&#8217;s efforts to regulate online financial promotions have gained momentum due to the rising influence of &#8220;finfluencers&#8221; and the potential risks associated with online consumer harm. The partnership with the Advertising Standards Authority has already resulted in changes to advertising policies of major technology companies, ensuring that only FCA-approved financial promotions are permitted. The FCA plans to continue engaging with industry stakeholders to strengthen consumer protection measures.</p>

<p>The consultation on the new social media guidance will be conducted over the next eight weeks. This initiative aligns with the FCA&#8217;s commitment to reducing harm and establishing higher standards within the financial industry.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the FCA <a href="https://coincu.com/167266-uk-fca-issues-warning-letters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> warning letters to against crypto atm operators. The banking watchdog and West Yorkshire Police have teamed together to take on operators of cryptocurrency ATMs in Leeds, in northern England.</p>



<p>The agency also <a href="https://coincu.com/200049-fca-announces-strict-measures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alerted</a> crypto companies about upcoming financial marketing guidelines for UK clients. It said that crypto enterprises in the nation would have four legitimate avenues to comply with its guidelines for digital asset marketing, which will go into effect on October 8, 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Chainlink&#8217;s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) goes live on multiple blockchains.</em></li>



<li><em>CCIP enables decentralized finance protocols and SWIFT connectivity for international transfers.</em></li>



<li><em>The protocol also offers simplified token transfers and an ARM Network for added security.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chainlink&#8217;s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is now live for early-access users on multiple blockchains, including Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon.</strong></h5>

<p>The protocol, <a href="https://blog.chain.link/ccip-mainnet-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed</a> to facilitate cross-chain applications and services, has been tested by partners such as Aave and Synthetix and is now transitioning to mainnet general availability.</p>



<p>On July 20, all developers will be able to access CCIP through five testnets: Arbitrum Goerli, Avalanche Fuji, Ethereum Sepolia, Optimism Goerli, and Polygon Bombay.</p>



<p>CCIP allows for seamless interoperability between different blockchains, enabling decentralized finance protocols and other applications to adopt cross-chain functionality. It has been a key element in Chainlink&#8217;s partnership with SWIFT, the global banking network used for international money transfers, which plans to connect with various blockchains using CCIP.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-1024x538.png" alt="Chainlink&#039;s New Protocol Is Now Live For Seamless Blockchain Interaction" class="wp-image-203476" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Chainlink&#039;s New Protocol Is Now Live For Seamless Blockchain Interaction 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>The protocol offers simplified and programmable token transfers, making it easier for tokens to be securely transferred and managed across different chains. Simplified Token Transfers provide a plug-and-play solution with audited token pool contracts, handling tasks such as burning, minting, locking, and unlocking tokens across chains while ensuring token sponsors retain control over their Token Pool contract. This enhances the security and composability of native tokens within protocols.</p>



<p>Programmable Token Transfers enable additional instructions to be included with token transfers, allowing for actions such as swapping or staking assets upon arrival at the destination chain. This ensures that tokens can be utilized immediately according to predefined instructions, enhancing the efficiency and functionality of cross-chain transactions.</p>



<p>To ensure the integrity and security of cross-chain operations, Chainlink has implemented an Active Risk Management (ARM) Network. The ARM Network acts as an independent layer that continuously monitors and validates the behavior of the primary CCIP network. It utilizes a separate implementation of the Chainlink node software in Rust, providing client diversity and minimizing external dependencies to prevent supply chain attacks.</p>



<p>Chainlink&#8217;s CCIP aims to solve the challenge of interoperability in the blockchain ecosystem, allowing applications and protocols to seamlessly interact across different chains. By providing simplified and programmable token transfers, along with an independent security layer through the ARM Network, CCIP offers a robust and secure cross-chain solution for the decentralized finance space and beyond.</p>

<p>As CCIP moves towards wider adoption, Chainlink is actively working on payment models to support the monetization and long-term sustainability of its services. These models aim to reduce payment friction for users and provide a greater amount of fees to support Chainlink&#8217;s service providers. Additionally, as Chainlink Staking expands, a portion of user fees for services like CCIP will be directed to stakers, enhancing the crypto-economic security of the network.</p>



<p>With the launch of CCIP on multiple blockchains and the growing adoption by leading protocols, Chainlink is further solidifying its position as a key player in the blockchain interoperability space. The protocol&#8217;s ability to facilitate cross-chain applications and services opens up new possibilities for decentralized finance and other blockchain-based ecosystems, fostering innovation and collaboration across different networks.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/198659-chainlink-data-feeds-go-live-on-celo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, Chainlink data streams are now available on the Celo mainnet, allowing developers to construct powerful DeFi apps by providing access to crucial data and services. This advancement is likely to significantly alter the DeFi ecosystem by providing additional chances for developers to implement creative solutions. Additionally, integrating Chainlink data feeds into Celo&#8217;s blockchain would improve platform security by guaranteeing that data is securely delivered straight to the blockchain.</p>

<p>In May, Pika Protocol&#8217;s Discord server fell victim to a compromise orchestrated by scammers. By posting a malicious link in the server&#8217;s announcements channel, they managed to steal over $220,000. A similar pattern emerged with Orbiter Finance, where scammers used a phishing attack to access a team member&#8217;s Discord token and subsequently siphoned off more than $760,000.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/196353-jeffrey-huang-refuted-zachxbts-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZachXBT</a> further alleges that Soup, who inadvertently revealed his wallet address (0x21bc8046245880e9d3ec5ed808048a93518e933a), profited significantly from these illicit activities. Soup reportedly confessed to having made around $1 million, while his partners profited even more. Despite the financial harm inflicted on projects and individuals, Soup appears to show little remorse.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1678384917657296898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous investigations</a> into crypto-related crimes, including allegations against YouTuber Blue, ZachXBT has established a reputation as a crypto crime fighter. After being sued by Jeffrey Huang, also known as <a href="https://coincu.com/196939-machi-big-brother-stated-zachxbt-framed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Machi Big Brother</a>, for making allegations about &#8220;pump and dump&#8221; schemes, ZachXBT <a href="https://coincu.com/196101-the-war-between-jeffrey-huang-zachxbt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> substantial donations for legal defense.</p>



<p>ZachXBT has shared additional information about Soup with the victims in the hope that legal action can be taken against the scammer. The exposed activities shed light on the ongoing challenges posed by phishing scams within the crypto community and the importance of remaining vigilant against such threats.</p>

<p>US Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to request an investigation into Elon Musk&#8217;s Tesla&#8217;s connection to Twitter. The letter raises concerns over potential conflicts of interest, misappropriation of corporate assets, and negative impacts to Tesla shareholders. Warren specifically calls for a probe into Tesla&#8217;s board of directors regarding the lack of independence from Musk and possible violations of securities laws and exchange rules.</p>



<p>The nine-page letter was sent on Monday to SEC chair Gary Gensler. Warren&#8217;s concerns echo similar ones she expressed to Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm in 2022. She notes that the inaction and incomplete disclosures raise questions about possible violations of securities laws and exchange rules, which fall under the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Warren expressed concern about Tesla&#8217;s use of employees from Tesla and SpaceX to aid the social media platform, stating that it could represent possible violations of state and federal labor laws. She also stated that Tesla had failed to properly inform shareholders of how the two companies would work in connection.</p>



<p>Although a new Twitter CEO has been appointed, Warren believes that Musk still maintains control as the CTO and executive chairman of Tesla. Thus, maintaining the conflict of interest.</p>

<p>While the cryptocurrency community was taken aback by the revelation, some skeptics argue that the claim comes as no surprise given Sun&#8217;s reputation in the industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Archblock Founder Claims Justin Sun Was Secret TUSD Acquirer in Lawsuit (Not exactly a shocker) <a href="https://t.co/ybTPmSOmtk" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ybTPmSOmtk</a></p>&mdash; db (@tier10k) <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1680959101814161409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the lawsuit, the founder of <a href="https://www.archblock.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.archblock.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Archblock</a>, whose identity remains undisclosed, asserts that Sun acquired TUSD, a popular stablecoin, through covert means. The lawsuit alleges that Sun utilized various entities and individuals to carry out the acquisition, deliberately concealing his involvement. If proven true, such actions would raise serious concerns about Sun&#8217;s transparency and integrity within the cryptocurrency space.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="482" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-1024x482.png" alt="image 1139" class="wp-image-203452" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-1024x482.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-300x141.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-768x361.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-750x353.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Archblock Founder Claims Justin Sun Was Secret TUSD Acquirer In Lawsuit 24"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The lawsuit further accuses Sun of manipulating the cryptocurrency market through his undisclosed acquisition of TUSD. By secretly amassing a significant amount of the stablecoin, Sun would have had the power to influence its value and potentially manipulate other related markets. This revelation, if substantiated, could have far-reaching implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>



<p>Although these allegations are yet to be proven in a court of law, they have sparked intense discussions within the crypto community. Many individuals argue that Sun&#8217;s past controversies, including the canceled lunch with Warren Buffett and allegations of plagiarism, have already cast doubt on his credibility. As such, the claims made in the lawsuit do not come as a complete shock to those who have been following his career closely.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="385" height="1024" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140-385x1024.png" alt="image 1140" class="wp-image-203453" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140-385x1024.png 385w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140-113x300.png 113w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140.png 546w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" title="Archblock Founder Claims Justin Sun Was Secret TUSD Acquirer In Lawsuit 25"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, it is important to note that Justin Sun and his legal team have not yet responded to the allegations. Until the evidence is presented and thoroughly examined, it is crucial to approach the situation with caution and maintain a neutral standpoint.</p>



<p>This lawsuit serves as a reminder of the need for transparency and accountability within the cryptocurrency industry. As the market continues to mature, investors and users alike expect leaders and influencers to uphold the highest ethical standards. Should the allegations against Justin Sun be proven true, it would undoubtedly have a significant impact on his reputation and potentially reshape the way he is perceived within the crypto community.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1024x576.png" alt="UniswapX" class="wp-image-203444" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="UniswapX Launches: Empowering Traders with Next-Level Cross-AMM Capabilities 27"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This new protocol has been designed to allow trading across automated market makers (AMMs) and other liquidity sources. The details of this project were released through a press release, while Uniswap Labs CEO, Hayden Adams, was scheduled to make an announcement about it on Monday at the EthCC conference in Paris.</p>



<p>According to DefiLlama, Uniswap currently has around $3.8 billion of collateral or &#8220;total value locked&#8221;. Uniswap has stated that<a href="https://uniswap.org/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://uniswap.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> UniswapX</a> addresses many of the problems that are faced by on-chain trading and self-custody swapping. The features of UniswapX include &#8220;better prices&#8221; through the aggregation of liquidity sources. The press release also claims that UniswapX offers gas-free swapping, protection against maximal extractive value (MEV), and no cost for failed transactions.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="800" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1.jpeg" alt="UniswapX 1" class="wp-image-203445" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1.jpeg 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-75x75.jpeg 75w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-350x350.jpeg 350w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-750x750.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="UniswapX Launches: Empowering Traders with Next-Level Cross-AMM Capabilities 28"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Uniswap has announced that in the coming months, UniswapX will expand to gas-free cross-chain swaps. UniswapX will initially be launched in &#8220;opt-in beta&#8221; on the Uniswap Labs interface for the main Ethereum network, with plans to expand to other chains and the Uniswap wallet &#8220;in the near future&#8221;. However, the company has not yet announced when a final version of UniswapX will be available.</p>



<p>Liquidity pools are a lifeline for swappers looking to execute trades on DEXs, but these pools can sometimes dry up. UniswapX aims to solve this problem by engaging with third-party fillers that can fill swaps directly or route users to appropriate AMM pools. These third-party fillers will have to compete with Uniswap itself, which will help to drive down prices for traders.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2.png" alt="UniswapX 2" class="wp-image-203446" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2-750x563.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="UniswapX Launches: Empowering Traders with Next-Level Cross-AMM Capabilities 29"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Fillers will cover the gas fees on behalf of swappers, which removes the need for swappers to own a blockchain&#8217;s native network token, such as ETH or MATIC, to participate in trading. This also removes any financial responsibility for unsuccessful transactions. According to Uniswap, fillers incorporate gas fees into overall swap prices. They also have the option to reduce transaction costs by aggregating multiple orders, thereby fostering a competitive environment for achieving the most favorable price.</p>



<p>Uniswap has promised that UniswapX will help to thwart MEV – a scheme that is usually loathed by swappers. This is done by allowing network operators to capitalize on their ability to preview queued transactions.</p>
