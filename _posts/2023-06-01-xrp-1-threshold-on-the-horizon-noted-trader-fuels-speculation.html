Is $XRP finally going to $1? — DonAlt (@CryptoDonAlt) May 31, 2023 In recent developments, XRP, the native coin of Ripple, has been displaying promising signs, as evidenced by remarkable spikes in address activity observed over two consecutive days.  This surge in address activity indicates a heightened level of interest and engagement with the cryptocurrency.
