During this event, zkLink will shut down its servers for 72 hours, inviting users to try the emergency asset recovery feature, and earn rewards for taking part in the test.</p>"The Dunkirk Test is like a fire drill for crypto users. We will simulate a sudden shutdown of the zkLink infrastructure, so that users can learn how to recover their assets,&rdquo; said Vince Yang, co-founder of zkLink. &ldquo;We believe the &lsquo;Dunkirk Test&rsquo; could set a new benchmark for safety in the crypto industry.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange Luno&rsquo;s vice president of corporate development and international, Vijay Ayyar, is leaving the company as it prepares to exit Singapore. </p>
<p>CNBC reports that Vijay Ayyar, a senior executive at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, has resigned from his position. Ayyar was one of the exchange&rsquo;s earliest employees and, until his resignation, served as vice president of corporate development and international.</p>
<p>Ayyar, who has worked at Luno for seven years, steps down as the firm prepares to suspend its operations in Singapore, where he is based.</p>
<p>Luno, owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), announced last month that it would no longer offer its services in Singapore. It also withdrew its license application to operate in the city from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
<p>The exchange explained the move is part of an &ldquo;evaluation of [its] global strategy and presence.&rdquo; Adding that the decision would&nbsp;not affect other regions&nbsp;it operates in.</p>
<p>Mr Ayyar told CNBC that his decision was not related to Luno&rsquo;s leaving Singapore but rather to join another firm that operates in the Web3 and crypto space.</p>
<p>He said in a WhatsApp message to the news outlet:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be leaving Luno after seven years at the company. Given the time I&rsquo;d spent at Luno, just seemed like it was time for another challenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A spokesperson at the exchange confirmed the news to CNBC, saying:</p>

<p>Vijay will be leaving after seven years. His role is a global one and isn&rsquo;t tied to&nbsp;anything related to our Singapore closure. He&rsquo;s leaving to pursue a new opportunity in the industry.</p>

Luno CEO Steps Down
<p>In March, Marcus Swanepoel, co-founder of Luno, announced that he is stepping down as CEO to become the firm&rsquo;s executive chairman. Luno&rsquo;s chief operating officer, James Lanigan, will become the new CEO.</p>
<p>The news of Swanepoel&rsquo;s resignation comes just months after Luno announced it would let go of 35% of its global workforce.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Mastercard announced the launch of a service that will ensure transactions between crypto users&rsquo; wallets are verifiable and compliant. </p>
<p>Mastercard will launch a new product, the &ldquo;Mastercard Crypto Credential,&rdquo; to improve user verification standards and reduce the risk of fraud in the crypto space. Mastercard Crypto Credential will provide secure transactions between users Mastercard has verified.</p>
<p>To achieve this, users will be issued a &ldquo;Mastercard crypto credential unique identifier&rdquo; that will enable them to immediately verify if an address they want to send money to has been verified by the company and operates in compliance with Mastercard&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<p>The payment processing giant said in a statement:</p>

<p>Mastercard Crypto Credential will establish a set of common standards and infrastructure that will help attest trusted interactions among consumers and businesses using blockchain networks. There are several use cases that Mastercard Crypto Credential can unlock, as consumer and business verification needs vary widely based on market and compliance requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mastercard Crypto Credential employs technology from CipherTrace, a blockchain analytics platform Mastercard agreed to acquire in 2021.</p>
<p>The new service will ensure transactions between users&rsquo; wallets are verifiable and compliant and begins with cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>Raj Dhamodharan first announced Mastercard Crypto Credentials at Consensus 2023, where he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If two people want to transfer value from one country to another country, the level of compliance and verification needed is complex.&rdquo; Adding, &ldquo;So how do you identify those wallets. And how do you exchange enough information about the other party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mastercard partnered with wallet providers Bit2Me, Lirium, Mercado Bitcoin and Uphold to roll the service out. The payments giant and its partners are currently working on a project to facilitate transfers between the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean corridors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Aptos Foundation has unveiled its first round of grant recipients, awarding more than $3.5M to 50 project teams focused on scaling the Aptos blockchain. Through the grant, the foundation aims to foster a collaborative and innovative environment for developers and entrepreneurs in the Aptos ecosystem and the broader Web3 landscape.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Grants were distributed across four categories, with notable recipients including Mokshya and Pontem for Developer Tooling, Aries and KYCDao for Infrastructure; Overmind and Aptos Eden for Education, as well as Tsunami and Topaz for Ecosystem. The Aptos Foundation claims that it prioritizes public good services, infrastructure, while encouraging open-source development projects.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Bashar Lazaar, Head of Ecosystem and Partnerships at Aptos Foundation, will lead the growth of the grant program as the Grants &amp; Ecosystem Lead, bringing in business development experience from Consensys.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fundamental that we continue cultivating strong relationships with our community of developers and entrepreneurs to foster a collaborative, sustainable and innovative environment for the success of Aptos and the broader web3 ecosystem,&rdquo; shares Lazaar.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The foundation received over 500 applications, with the chosen projects meeting criteria based on idea merit, potential value for the broader ecosystem, and the team's ability to execute. </p>
Movement On the Chain
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Aptos blockchain has been generating significant attention in the crypto space, due to its innovative architecture and strong development team. Aptos has already secured substantial funding from notable investors, formed a partnership with Google Cloud, and attracted interest from numerous developers and projects.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As such, Aptos' blockchain comes in as a new solution aimed at addressing the challenges faced by current blockchain infrastructures such as outages, high costs, low throughput limits, and security concerns. Developed by a global team of over 350 developers, Aptos incorporates innovative features in consensus, smart contract design, system security, performance, and decentralization. Its design principles prioritize scalability, safety, reliability, and upgradeability.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Aptos has a feature set that includes the integration of the Move language for secure transaction execution, a data model that enables flexible key management and hybrid custodial options, a pipelined and modular approach for transaction processing, support for atomic transactions without upfront knowledge of data access, a modular architecture that enables frequent upgrades and on-chain change management, as well as open experimentation with initiatives to scale from individual validator performance through internal and homogeneous state sharding.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Aptos ecosystem has been growing rapidly, with projects such as Blocto, Solrise, Pontem Network, Laminar, Econia, Empo, Hanson, and Liquidswap already developing on the platform.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Researchers from Indiana University and the University of Maine have proposed a new tax framework for cryptocurrency losses in the United States. The study suggests that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) should adopt recommendations to prevent taxpayers from offsetting crypto losses against other capital gains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Currently, IRS guidelines treat cryptocurrency losses similarly to those of other capital assets, making them deductible against capital gains but not against other income types. However, the researchers argue that cryptocurrency losses should be regulated differently, as the government's deduction policy effectively shares the risk created by investors' activities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Authored by Jeffrey A. Maine from the University of Maine School of Law and Xuan-Thao Nguyen of Indiana University's Robert H.

<p class="md-end-block md-p">In simple terms, the proposal means losses from one type of activity, such as cryptocurrency investments, cannot be used to offset or shelter income from another activity.

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The authors also argue that by offering loss deductions on capital gains, the government may inadvertently encourage investment in cryptocurrency over other economically valuable investments.

<p class="md-end-block md-p">As of 2021, the IRS provided guidance that cryptocurrencies are treated as property for federal tax purposes.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Researchers from Indiana University and the University of Maine have proposed a new tax framework for cryptocurrency losses in the United States. The study suggests that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) should adopt recommendations to prevent taxpayers from offsetting crypto losses against other capital gains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Currently, IRS guidelines treat cryptocurrency losses similarly to those of other capital assets, making them deductible against capital gains but not against other income types. However, the researchers argue that cryptocurrency losses should be regulated differently, as the government's deduction policy effectively shares the risk created by investors' activities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Authored by Jeffrey A. Maine from the University of Maine School of Law and Xuan-Thao Nguyen of Indiana University's Robert H.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s FOMC meeting could decide whether the crypto rally continues or whether an end to the uptrend gets confirmed.</p>
Decision time
<p>It&rsquo;s the FOMC meeting again, where the Fed Chairman announces whether the interest rate will rise, stay put, or fall, and the market hangs on his every word as though he were a sage of ancient times.</p>
<p>How Jerome Powell can still retain respect after getting inflation completely wrong when it first took off, and then making the most violent and abrupt interest rate rises in history, is a question that could rightly be asked.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the market does have to pay heed because this man and his agency are still playing the role of God for the markets. Yet another 25 basis point interest rate is firmly on the cards for tomorrow, although given the dire straits of some of the banks, this raise is still not cast in stone.</p>
A future pause is likely
<p>However, according to Angelo Kourkafas, CFA, investment strategist at Edward Jones, who spoke to the IBTimes, the 25 basis points are likely, but he believes that the Fed will probably pause thereafter.</p>

<p>"The statement may leave the door open for more tightening, but the May hike will likely be the last. The stress in regional banks, the recent drop in two-year Treasury yields below the fed funds rate and the inverted yield curve are all signs that policy is turning overly restrictive."</p>

<p>So where does this leave Bitcoin and the crypto market?</p>
Bad news for crypto?
<p>Ratcheting up interest rates yet another 0.25% cannot be good for crypto overall. On top of this latest rise, Bitcoin is still battling with heavy resistance at $30,000. It has been rejected several times now and does appear weaker.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the price is still holding strong at around $27,000 to $28,000, and it would be just like the market to send Bitcoin crashing through the resistance when everyone expects the price to start retracing.</p>
<p>All the same, it does look as though Bitcoin will move lower, even if it is only to the strong support at $25,000. Do expect altcoins to get a real battering though if this is the case.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Republican Patrick McHenry recently said that US crypto legislation could be put together in the next couple of months.</p>
Pro-crypto Congressmen and Senators
<p>Speaking at Consensus 2023 on Friday, Congressman McHenry, who is the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said that a bill to regulate crypto could be signed by President Joe Biden and passed into law within the next year.</p>
<p>He gave the belief that the legislation could be put together in the next few weeks and commented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we plan to do over the next two months is report a deal out,&rdquo;</p>
<p>McHenry gave Gary Gensler, chairman of the SEC, a rather torrid time in last month&rsquo;s House oversight hearing, in which he accused Gensler&rsquo;s approach to crypto of being &ldquo;nonsensical&rdquo; and suggested that Gensler was more focused on enforcement rather than trying to give clarity to the industry.</p>
<p>Another pro-crypto leader on the same Consensus panel as McHenry was Senator Cynthia Lummis. She gave the view that the House was more likely to pass legislation through a lot quicker than the Senate.</p>
US far behind on crypto regulation
<p>As things stand, the US appears to be far behind other countries and regions as regards crypto legislation. Europe has passed the MiCA regulations, which will come into effect as law in 2024, while the UK, the Middle East, and parts of Asia are also much further down this path.</p>
Opinion
<p>The very negative stance on crypto by the Biden administration could be one very good reason for the legislative delay in the US. It could be argued that having a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto could give the sector that aura of respectability and legitimacy that those in the higher echelons of government and its financial agencies are trying to avoid at all cost.</p>
<p>Even if the legislation that is eventually imposed can be harsh and suppressive for the industry, the mere fact that crypto might become fully compliant and regulated would probably open the floodgates of institutional funding and investment into a space that is seen by many as having the most innovate technology, besides AI, in the world today.</p>
<p>This in turn would threaten the likes of banks, which are becoming pretty much obsolete in this day and age. Look for the massive wealth in the banking industry to be used to slow and try to derail the majority of crypto firms that might be seen as hot competition for the banks.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Poloniex LLC has agreed to pay a fee of $7.6 million to settle with the US Treasury Department&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) for violation of sanctions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exchange had been scrutinized for violating multiple sanctions and not maintaining proper KYC (Know Your Customer) practices between 2014 and 2019.&nbsp;</p>
The Case Against Poloniex&nbsp;
<p>The Office of Foreign Asset Control announced the settlement on Monday. According to the sanctions watchdog, Poloniex&rsquo;s list of sanction violations can be traced all the way back to 2014, when it operated an online trading and settlement platform. Poloniex had racked up over 65,000 violations of several sanctions programs. As a result, the exchange allowed users from sanctioned countries such as Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Crimea, and Syria to execute trades worth up to $15 million between 2014 and 2019, according to the OFAC press release. The press release stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poloniex trading platform allowed customers apparently located in sanctioned jurisdictions to engage in online digital asset-related transactions&mdash;consisting of trades, deposits, and withdrawals&mdash;with a combined value of $15,335,349, despite having reason to know their location based on both Know Your Customer information and internet protocol address data.&rdquo;</p>

No Compliance Program In Place&nbsp;
<p>According to the authorities, Poloniex commenced operations in 2014. However, it did not have a sanctions compliance program in place until May 2015. Furthermore, when it put a compliance program in place, the program was not retroactive. According to documents from the Treasury Department, this allowed customers from sanctioned jurisdictions already on the platform to continue using its services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although Poloniex made efforts to identify and restrict accounts with a nexus to Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Crimea, and Syria pursuant to its compliance program, certain customers apparently located in these jurisdictions continued to use Poloniex&rsquo;s platform to engage in online digital asset-related transactions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In its report, the Office of Foreign Asset Control stated that Poloniex was a small startup when most of the alleged violations occurred. Furthermore, it stated that Circle significantly improved the exchange&rsquo;s sanctions compliance issues when it owned the company. Both were factors considered when deciding the severity of the penalty imposed. Circle and Poloniex both cooperated with the OFAC investigation, another factor that was taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p>
The Settlement&nbsp;
<p>According to the United States Treasury report, the maximum monetary penalty for the violation of multiple US sanctions is $19,692,872,800. In this case, the OFAC determined that the violations on the part of Poloniex were non-egregious and not voluntarily self-disclosed. OFAC guidelines stipulated that the minimum civil monetary penalty applicable in this case be set at $99,237,000 with a settlement amount of $7,591,630.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Poloniex had previously agreed to a $10.3 million settlement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC had filed the case against Poloniex in 2017, charging the firm with several violations of investor-protection clauses under Federal Securities Laws.</p>
<p>A consortium of various entities currently owns Poloniex. This includes Justin Sun, the creator of Tron. The issuer of the USDC stablecoin, Circle, briefly acquired Poloniex in 2018. However, the company sold Poloniex within two years of its $400 million acquisition. Poloniex had also announced a strategic partnership with Huobi. The partnership was aimed at boosting Huobi&rsquo;s token ecosystem. Incidentally, Tron creator Sun is also an advisor to Huobi.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem was hit by yet another hack, as decentralized perpetual market Level Finance was hacked for $1.1 million by an unknown attacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incident adds to a growing list of crypto and DeFi exploits that have taken place so far in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
Yet Another Attack On DeFi
<p>Level Finance disclosed the news of the attack to its followers on Twitter. According to the team at the perpetual marketplace, the attacker manipulated a &ldquo;claim multiple&rdquo; bug in one of Level Finance&rsquo;s smart contracts. This allowed them to siphon off over 214,000 LVL tokens from the exchange, which they then swapped into BNB tokens. The exploit resulted in the loss of over $1 million to Level Finance. However, the team assured users that other smart contracts were unaffected and were isolated from the exploit in question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Level Finance team also stated that the liquidity pools and the DAO treasury were also unaffected and deployed a patch only 12 hours after the attack. Level Finance will be conducting a thorough post-mortem of the attack and hope to offer some insight into how the attack was executed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An exploit targeted our Referral Controller Contract. - 214k LVL tokens drained to exploiters&rsquo; address. - Attacker swapped LVL to 3,345 BNB - Exploit was isolated from other contracts. - Fix to be deployed in 12 Hrs. - LP&rsquo;s and DAO treasury UNAFFECTED.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Level Finance is a decentralized and non-custodial perpetual market created on the BNB Chain. Currently, its Total Value Locked (TVL) is around $32 million, a sharp drop from the $41 million before the attack.</p>
PeckShield Dissects The Attack&nbsp;
<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield revealed that the smart contract &ldquo;LevelReferralControllerV2&rdquo; had a bug that allowed the hacker to make repeated referral claims during the same epoch. Level Finance later confirmed this in an updated statement on Discord. According to data from BSC Scan, Level Finance&rsquo;s v2 controller contract reported multiple calls of the &ldquo;claim multiple&rdquo; function registered over the past 48 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems the @Level__Finance&rsquo;s LevelReferralControllerV2 contract has a bug that allows for repeated referral claims from the same epoch. So far, 214k LVLs have been drained and swapped into 3,345 BNB (~1M).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Level Finance has temporarily suspended the referral program in an effort to contain the exploit.&nbsp;</p>
DeFi Exploits On The Up&nbsp;
<p>2023 has seen a considerable increase in the number of hacks, with several having taken place over the first four months of the year. While not as bad as 2022, this could change with a couple of large exploits, which could leave DeFi reeling again. According to crypto security and auditing firm CertiK, crypto scams, exploits, flash loan attacks, and exit scams have cost the crypto space a staggering $103 million in April alone. According to CertiK, the total loss during the ongoing year stands at $429 million, a figure which could continue rising.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the most significant hacks of 2023 are those of Sentiment and Euler Finance. Euler Finance&rsquo;s hack saw the attacker siphon off $197 million, while sentiment reported that hackers managed to steal $1 million. However, both protocols successfully negotiated with the hackers and recovered most of their funds.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem was hit by yet another hack, as decentralized perpetual market Level Finance was hacked for $1.1 million by an unknown attacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incident adds to a growing list of crypto and DeFi exploits that have taken place so far in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
Yet Another Attack On DeFi
<p>Level Finance disclosed the news of the attack to its followers on Twitter. According to the team at the perpetual marketplace, the attacker manipulated a &ldquo;claim multiple&rdquo; bug in one of Level Finance&rsquo;s smart contracts. This allowed them to siphon off over 214,000 LVL tokens from the exchange, which they then swapped into BNB tokens. The exploit resulted in the loss of over $1 million to Level Finance. However, the team assured users that other smart contracts were unaffected and were isolated from the exploit in question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Level Finance team also stated that the liquidity pools and the DAO treasury were also unaffected and deployed a patch only 12 hours after the attack. Level Finance will be conducting a thorough post-mortem of the attack and hope to offer some insight into how the attack was executed.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Nigeria&rsquo;s securities regulator is considering granting exchanges that deal in asset-backed licenses to operate. The SEC, however, has no intention of allowing crypto trading. </p>
<p>Bloomberg reports that Nigeria&rsquo;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering permitting tokenised coin offerings on licensed digital exchanges backed by assets, including equity, debt, and property, but has no plans of permitting crypto trading.</p>
<p>Abdulkadir Abbas, head of securities and investment services at the agency, informed Bloomberg of SEC&rsquo;s plan and added:</p>

<p>We always like to start, as a regulator, with a very simple clear proposal before we go into the complex ones.</p>

<p>The regulator is processing applications for digital exchanges on a trial basis in an effort to broaden market participation in Nigeria, where the central bank currently restricts cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Digital exchanges will undergo one year of &ldquo;regulatory incubation,&rdquo; where they can offer limited services under the SEC&rsquo;s supervision. Abbas said to Bloomberg:</p>

<p>By the 10th month, we should be able to make a determination whether to register the firm, extend the incubation period or even ask the firm to stop operation.</p>

Nigeria May Officially Recognise Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies
<p>West Africa, particularly Nigeria, is responsible for the most significant volume of crypto transactions concluded on peer-to-peer platforms outside of the US. The SEC&rsquo;s decision may attract Nigeria&rsquo;s digital-savvy population to local assets such as equities which have, according to Bloomberg, been shunned for years.</p>
<p>Despite the central bank&rsquo;s restriction on cryptocurrencies, a new bill which would legally recognise the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is in the works. If passed, the bill would amend the 2007 Investments and Securities Act and further recognise Bitcoin as legal capital for investment purposes.</p>
<p>The SEC will wait to register digital asset exchanges until it agrees with the central bank.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has seen tremendous growth and volatility over the past year. Litecoin (LTC) and Polygon (MATIC) have been gaining traction due to their performance and unique use cases.</p>
<p>A new token with a unique real-world use case, Collateral Network (COLT) has emerged with a presale that has caught the attention of the market experts and crypto community. With predictions of 3000% plus growth predictions it is one that is not to be missed.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Does Litecoin have a good future?</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has been around since 2011, and it is one of the most well-established cryptocurrencies in the market.</p>
<p>A former Google engineer Charlie Lee designed Litecoin to be a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin (BTC). For that reason, many consider Litecoin a &lsquo;silver to Bitcoin's gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Litecoin uses a different mining algorithm than Bitcoin, allowing faster block processing times and lower transaction fees.</p>
<p>However, Litecoin still has some of the disadvantages of Bitcoin. Notably, Litecoin still uses a proof of work consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>Despite these disadvantages, the token&rsquo;s recent performance was good, especially after investors moved away from centralized tokens. Thanks to its strong reputation for decentralization, Litecoin has shown impressive growth in recent months. Litecoin, at the time of writing, is priced at $86.87.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s8">What is Polygon (MATIC) used for?</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to solve the network's scalability issues.</p>
<p>The token saw significant growth in 2021 and 2022, likely thanks to the rise in popularity of DeFi and NFTs. Polygon is a key tool to enable DeFi and other complex use cases on Ethereum.</p>
<p>For one, Polygon offers significantly lower transaction fees than the Ethereum network. This is due to its layer 2 architecture, which offloads a lot of the computational burden to a sidechain, resulting in lower gas fees.</p>
<p>At the same time, Polygon is compatible with Ethereum, which helps it attract the biggest blockchain developer community out there. This interoperability makes it easier for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on Polygon.</p>
<p>Therefore, cryptocurrencies like Polygon are crucial because of their role in the Ethereum ecosystem. Polygon enables complex Web3 applications on the network. Hence, as long as Ethereum keeps growing, Polygon will grow too.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Collateral Network (COLT) the crypto newcomer with huge potential</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) aims to disrupt the lending industry with its decentralized lending protocol for real-world assets. Collateral Network will enable users to borrow cryptocurrencies against physical assets. These assets include fine art, gold, watches, diamonds, and collectibles.</p>
<p>What is especially unique about Collateral Network is that it is the first project to mint NFTs against physical assets. Collateral Network fractionalizes them, allowing numerous members of the community to fund the loans.</p>
<p>This means that borrowers can quickly unlock cash from their assets, sometimes in as little as 24 hours. As loans are not based on future income borrowers are able to maintain their privacy as no credit checks are required.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Collateral Network provides investors with a low-risk alternative to holding stablecoins and provides them with the potential to earn passive income. All loans on Collateral Network are 100% backed by real assets, giving added security to investors.</p>
<p>Collateral Network&rsquo;s (COLT) presale is set for a further price increase from its current value of $0.014, and analysts predict a 3,500% (35X) price increase over the next few months. It is likely the price could 100X when it lists on major exchanges like Uniswap.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Venture capital firms have begun making exit targets for 2024, expecting another big bull run. Smaller investors should be doing the same thing and making price targets when they will realize profits. Two tokens, Avalanche (AVAX) and Uwerx have enormous upside potential between now and 2024. Analysts have given price predictions and reasons for backing the AVAX and WERX coins. </p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) Price Prediction Avalanche (AVAX) is one of the few alternative layer ones that continues to be popular with investors. Avalanche (AVAX) launched in 2020 and since has grown into a DeFi hotspot. Avalanche (AVAX) delivers sub-one-second finality and allows for massive scaling thanks to its subnet technology. Avalanche (AVAX) trades at $17.50, and analysts from priceprediction.net have given a price prediction range of $35.79 and $43.21 for the Avalanche (AVAX) coin. Why are analysts backing Avalanche (AVAX)? Avalanche (AVAX) hosts one of the most popular perpetuals DEXs, GMX (GMX), and many expect institutional adoption of Avalanche (AVAX) in 2024. Freelance Industry Growth To understand the potential of Uwerx, investors must first understand the sheer volume of the freelancing marketplace industry and the rapid growth in this sector. According to Forbes, more than 30% of business leaders reported using new talent platforms extensively, while another 30% reported medium usage. And analysts predict that both figures will be up next year when the survey is retaken. Freelancing has become a core part of the jobs market and witnessed the most significant growth of any market trend. Uwerx will exist in this rapidly developing space, making the upside potential enormous. A disruptor in a growing segment- a killer combination for growth prospects. Uwerx &amp; Disruption Uwerx aims to disrupt the freelance marketplace by introducing a streamlined and technologically superior alternative to the current market incumbents. Uwerx will drastically reduce fees, protect intellectual property rights, and help foster the growth of freelancers. Uwerx will employ transparent smart contracts instead of lengthy escrow services, releasing funds to workers immediately once pre-agreed conditions have been met instead of weeks later. Uwerx will leverage the immutable quality of distributed ledger technology to eradicate instances of fraud and build a more trusted platform. </p>
<p>SolidProof and InterFi Network have already audited the protocol, and analysts have given price predictions for the WERX coin ranging between $2.89 and $3.27 in Q1 2024. A significant move up from the WERX&rsquo;s tokens presale price of $0.00995. Presale Open Now Uwerx has opened its presale, and with a 25-year liquidity lock coming into effect when the presale closes, leading analysts to point to the long-term strength of the protocol and the vision of the founding team. They are backing both Avalanche (AVAX) and Uwerx, but off the record, many believe the growth potential of Uwerx massively outshines that of Avalanche (AVAX).

Uwerx will exist in this rapidly developing space, making the upside potential enormous. A disruptor in a growing segment- a killer combination for growth prospects. Uwerx &amp; Disruption Uwerx aims to disrupt the freelance marketplace by introducing a streamlined and technologically superior alternative to the current market incumbents. Uwerx will drastically reduce fees, protect intellectual property rights, and help foster the growth of freelancers. Uwerx will employ transparent smart contracts instead of lengthy escrow services, releasing funds to workers immediately once pre-agreed conditions have been met instead of weeks later. Uwerx will leverage the immutable quality of distributed ledger technology to eradicate instances of fraud and build a more trusted platform. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Investors have been watching narratives develop in crypto. The liquid staking narrative and the traditional market solutions narrative are two critical narratives. Lido DAO (LDO) leads the liquid staking narrative, and Uwerx, a young disruptive protocol, leads the traditional market solutions narrative with the freelancing industry clearly in its crosshairs. The Uwerx Presale Uwerx has opened its presale and given the world access to participate in the first stages of this disruptive protocol&rsquo;s journey. Uwerx will build a decentralized freelancing platform to represent the industry's current requirements, streamlining the service, reducing fees, increasing security, and putting freelancers first with intellectual property rights protection. According to Forbes, almost 90% of business leaders reported talent platforms would be somewhat or very important to their organization's future competitive advantage. Blockchain has a natural record-keeping application, and Uwerx looks to leverage this to solve a chronic pain point of traditional markets. Uwerx has the potential to displace Upwork and could become a future blue chip, according to several analysts. WERX Token Use Cases The WERX coin will power the entire Uwerx protocol and will provide several advantages to freelancers using the platform, such as access to premium features and boosted rewards. Freelancers will be able to create webinars showcasing their skills, and each webinar will require a small fee payable in WERX tokens. The WERX token will also be the medium of exchange of the Uwerx platform. All these use cases create strong natural buy pressure for the WERX coin, and this has led several senior analysts to give bullish price predictions for WERX, stating it could range between $4.20 and $4.75 in Q1 2024. A considerable move up from its presale price of $0.00995.Lido DAO (LDO) Price Prediction Lido DAO (LDO) is the largest and most popular liquid staking solution for Ethereum (ETH). Lido DAO (LDO) currently has millions of ETH locked in its staking contracts, and the Lido DAO (LDO) token allows holders to vote on governance proposals. Lido DAO (LDO) has maintained its market lead, but several analysts expect an extensive reshuffle of ETH holdings when withdrawals go live. Lido DAO (LDO) currently trades at $2.02, with analysts from priceprediction.net stating a range between $5.93 and $7.05 for the Lido DAO (LDO) token in 2024. Uwerx Versus Lido DAO (LDO) When it comes to growth potential, investors must understand market caps. Lido DAO (LDO) already has a bloated market cap making future growth much more difficult. Whereas Uwerx still has a relatively small market cap, allowing it to make explosive gains. Uwerx and Lido DAO (LDO) cannot be compared regarding upside potential. Uwerx has been audited by SolidProof, InterFi Network, and announced a 25-year liquidity lock post presale.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market was generally bad for most coins in 2022, but some recovered impressively in 2023. Unfortunately, Thorchain (RUNE) is not one of those projects. It has continued to perform badly despite the lessening bearish crypto sentiment. Convex (CVX), on the other hand, is on the back of an impressive recovery in 2023. Convex (CVX)'s price had dropped sharply in the second half of 2022, but it managed to bounce back in 2023, albeit slowly. Perhaps the best news is the upcoming launch of Sparklo (SPRK) an alternative investments platform that caters to precious metals.</p>
<p class="s6">Thorchain (RUNE) Records 50% Losses in Year-on-Year Performance</p>
<p>Thorchain (RUNE) was one of the crypto tokens that felt significant damage from the market crashes of 2022. it was trading at $7.6 in the final days of March 2022. More than a week later, Thorchain (RUNE) had lost 50% value thanks to a sudden market collapse caused by Terra's crash. Since then, Thorchain (RUNE) has been unable to maintain any strong rally to help it recover some of its lost value. Towards the end of the year, it had dropped to around $1.2. The only positive side for Thorchain (RUNE) is that its price has been far more stable in 2023. While Thorchain (RUNE) has not broken over the $1 mark in the past few months, it has also not broken below, which is a good sign.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s6">Convex (CVX) Finance Continues Impressive 2023 Rally in the Past Three Months</p>
<p>Convex (CVX) Finance has remained largely stable over the past three months, which is good for Convex (CVX) because the price has been rallying in 2023, and maintaining stability is a sign of good things to come. </p>
<p>Convex (CVX) was trading for as low as $3 by the start of 2023. It rallied to $6.4 by mid-February. Since then, the price has hovered between $5 - $6, especially in the last two months. Despite the slow performance of the market, Convex (CVX) is showing a strong rally coupled with some stability. It will be easier for Convex (CVX) to lock in price gains as the market becomes more bullish. Another reason for Convex (CVX)'s performance, especially in the past two months, could be its recently launched staking mechanism updates.</p>
<p class="s6">Sparklo (SPRK) Presale Entices Investors Towards Precious Metals</p>
<p>Since investors are looking for assets to protect their wealth, Sparklo is the perfect addition to the crypto market at this moment. Sparklo offers its users a simple, easy way to invest in precious metals. The platform is the world's first blockchain dedicated to trading in precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum. </p>
<p>Sparklo reimagines the way people invest in precious metals and revolutionizes it by adding fractionalized NFTs, which represent a person's portfolio. Investors with whole NFTs are allowed to take physical possession of their assets. Sparklo will handle all deliveries to any preferred location.</p>
<p>Sparklo is only in its presale, yet has caused so much excitement. It is expected to increase in price from &nbsp;$0.015 to $0.017 by the end of April. Like many others, we believe that Sparklo will be one of the best-performing assets in 2023. Buying now might be best because Sparklo is handing out 30 extra tokens as a bonus.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Casper (CSPR) has recorded an impressive performance in the first 4 months of 2023 despite coming out from a difficult year for the entire crypto market. Its price had fallen by over 50% by the end of 2022, but the coin was resilient and started growing slowly. </p>
<p>On the contrary, IOTA (MIOTA) performed well in the first two months of the year, but its value dropped sharply in the last few months. Finally, the upcoming launch of Sparklo (SPRK) becomes the main talk of the crypto community as it's expected to be among the top performers in 2023. Already, Sparklo (SPRK)'s price is expected to increase by the end of April 2023.</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) Opens up Gold Investments To The Crypto Community.</p>
<p>Sparklo is opening up the precious metals industry to the crypto community via the upcoming launch of its innovative trading platform, where users can easily buy or sell gold, silver, and platinum. Sparklo will be home to investors who like the financial benefits of investing in precious metals. Its user base would enjoy low trading fees, affordable portfolio maintenance costs, and wide access to investors. Sparklo's users would also have full autonomy over their holdings which high-end fractionalized NFTs will represent. Users who purchase whole NFTs will have the option of having the asset delivered to their preferred location. Sparklo's security is top-notch - Interfi has audited it, and the results are posted on Sparklo's website.</p>
<p>Despite generating intense buzz in the crypto community, Sparklo is still in its pre-sale. Even better, the coin's price is very low but probably not for long because of Sparklo's quick growth. Sparklo is already expected to move from $0.015 - $0.017 by the end of April 2023. Now might be the best time to join this incredible project because Sparklo will be giving out 30 extra tokens as bonus to new investors</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">Casper (CSPR) Recovers Impressively in 2023</p>
<p>Casper (CSPR) is pulling off an impressive price recovery in 2023. Casper (CSPR) had lost nearly 80% of its value following the first major market crash that happened in May 2022. Casper (CSPR) was trading at $0.069 when Terra's collapse caused a market-wide crash. It then dropped to $0.025.</p>
<p>Casper (CSPR) tried to regain its lost value by rallying back to $0.05 before falling sharply again in November 2022. By the start of 2023, it started a slow but sustained recovery, which picked up momentum around late March. Only a few weeks later, Casper (CSPR) jumped to its current price zone, around $0.05. </p>
<p class="s7">IOTA (MIOTA) Drops significantly despite January Rally</p>
<p>IOTA (MIOTA) token has sharply dropped in the past few months despite an impressive rally in the first two months of 2023. IOTA (MIOTA) was trading at $0.15 in the final week of 2022. By January 2023, it had started a slow rally that turned fast a month later. </p>
<p>By early March, IOTA (MIOTA) was trading at $0.239 before a price correction had taken the price down to $0.19 before it bounced back. What is interesting about IOTA (MIOTA)'s market performance is that it hasn't dropped to a price lower or at the same position it was at the end of 2022. Perhaps the coin might see a sharp rally as the market sentiment becomes more bullish.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>First Republic Bank has failed and has been taken over by JP Morgan, further monopolising the industry. Bitcoin is at a crucial point.</p>
A modest benefit - Jamie Dimon
<p>The second biggest bank failure in US history has just taken place, and First Republic bank, which was the 14th biggest bank in the US, has gone into receivership and has been bought by JP Morgan Bank.</p>
<p>Already the biggest bank in the US, JP Morgan will now have an extra 84 banking offices across 8 States. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, said that his bank's purchase of First Republic Bank would &ldquo;modestly benefit&rdquo; the firm.</p>
Fed maintains its strategy
<p>However, as more banks are also facing similar struggles to First Republic Bank, if they are not considered to be &ldquo;systemically important&rdquo; they will also be allowed to be gobbled up by the bigger banking institutions, leading to further monopoly of the industry.</p>
<p>As the news of the latest bank to fail hits the headlines, the Federal Reserve says that it is still doggedly on course to raise interest rates another 25 basis points at its FOMC meeting which convenes this Wednesday. According to the CME&rsquo;s Fedwatch tool, the likelihood of this 0.25% raise is at 83%.</p>
<p>Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX tweeted that in his view the Federal Reserve would be obliged to turn on the printers again in order to backstop a larger proportion of the US banks. He also continues to maintain that BTC will go to $1 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">With that bloomie headline your bank is opening Monday under different mgmt. $FRC problem, no #banktermfundingprogram eligible collateral. Look for the Fed to fix that issue by backstopping a larger slice of US bank balance sheets. Money printer go brrr$BTC = $1mm pic.twitter.com/VTSViDeBeP</p>

</p>
BTC at critial level
<p>BTC is currently facing some of its own obstacles. The price is currently at $28,560 after a weekly and monthly close that saw the price draw back to $29,230. The price went down as far as the uptrend support at $28,250 before recovering to $28,500 at time of going to press.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin loses this trend it can potentially pull back to the extremely strong support at around $25,000. The 200 week moving average is the last solid line of defence, currently at just under $22,000.</p>
<p>If the Federal Reserve breaks the economy and forces the US into recession with its insistence on raising interest rates, the public could lose further trust in the banking system - and this is where Bitcoin can truly start motoring into its bull run.</p>
