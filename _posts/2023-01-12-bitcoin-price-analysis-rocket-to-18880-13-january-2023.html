<p>BTC/USD Extends Recent Surge:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 13 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) surged higher early in the Asian session as the pair appreciated above the 18800 level after Stops were elected above the 18385.36 level, a relative high that represented its strongest print in December.&nbsp; Stops were also elected above the 17933.40 area during the ascent, a level that represents the 78.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 18385.36 to 16273.40.&nbsp; If BTC/USD adds to recent gains, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp; Selling pressure intensified around the 17510.29 area recently and knocked BTC/USD lower to the 17315 level, a test of the 23.6% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 16670.82 to 17510.29.&nbsp; Additional downside retracement levels in the appreciating range include the 17189, 17090, 16991, 16868, and 16850 levels.&nbsp; Another technically significant range that traders are monitoring is the appreciation from 16326.16 to 17510.29, and corresponding retracement levels include the 17230, 17057, 16918, 16778, 16605, and 16579 levels</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, was off more than 3% in December, and is up approximately 12.9% month-to-date. Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas. &nbsp;Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Previous selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels may result in possible tests of the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
