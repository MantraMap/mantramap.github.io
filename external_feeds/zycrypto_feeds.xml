</ul>



<p>The cryptocurrency market has had a fair share of meme coins since Dogecoin (DOGE) broke into the scene in 2019, but it seems that three-dog-themed assets have established dominance.</p>



<p>The past 30 days have digital asset prices plunged to lows towards the end of last year and making a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-and-cardano-set-new-monthly-highs-after-scoring-double-digit-gains/">rebound</a> in the first two weeks of 2023. DOGE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have both recorded double-figure gains as the market flipped green with weekly highs of over 20%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As gains keep trickling in, the one-month trading volume of DOGE, SHIB, and Bonk coin (BONK) has surpassed $25 billion through BONK launched on Dec 25. DOGE trading volume amounts to $17.5 billion, while SHIB records $7.2 billion, leaving BONK with $885 million.</p>



<p>The top three meme coins still fall way short when compared with Bitcoin (BTC) and other top assets in terms of trading volume. BTC’s trading volume in the last 30 days stands at $618.8 billion.</p>



<p>According to data from CoinGecko, there are about 169 digital assets with variations of DOGE in the names and have a combined trading volume of $324 million.</p>



<p>DOGE sits at No 9 on the list of cryptocurrencies by market cap, currently trading at $0.08, still shy of its all-time high of $0.73 before Elon Musk Saturday Night Live appearance in 2021. SHIB is also down from its all-time high by over 60%, but its recent gains, along with proposed improvements, are giant leaps.</p>



<h2 id="h-shib-inspire-new-devs-in-2023"><strong>SHIB inspire new devs in 2023</strong></h2>



<p>The team behind SHIB has constantly promised new use cases in the coming months, along with technical upgrades. The Shiba Inu layer 2 network, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-renews-bullish-momentum-for-0-001-shib-as-massive-token-burn-expected/">Shibarium</a>, is an upgrade lauded in digital asset circles as the move to make SHIB more than a meme coin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shibarium is a layer 2 network that would run on Ethereum’s mainnet allowing developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) with lower transaction fees and added network scalability. The team behind SHIB <a href="https://zycrypto.com/new-shibarium-update-ignites-super-bullish-expectations-for-0-001-shib-price-among-the-community/">teased</a> its community on the launch on Jan 16, and its price is up by 25%, with bulls waiting in glee for the official launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has once again expressed concerns over the growing digital asset ecosystem. In particular, it cited the recent turmoil in the cryptocurrency sector as one of the global micro financial risks.</p>



<p>In its latest Financial Stability Report, the Indian central bank says a common approach is necessary to ensure consumer and investor protection and address future financial stability risks.</p>



<p><em>“In this context, various options are being considered internationally. One option is to apply the same-risk-same-regulatory-outcome principle and then to the same regulation applicable to traditional financial intermediaries and exchanges. Another option is to prohibit crypto assets since their real life use cases are next to negligible.”</em></p>



<p>The RBI’s report discusses several recent incidents from the broader crypto market to highlight volatility and risks for investors. It cites the recent brief pause in withdrawals of stablecoins at Binance, the implosion of the Terra/Luna ecosystem, and the collapse of Celsius and Three Arrows Capital to stress the point that crypto assets are “highly volatile.”</p>



<p>It says crypto assets have shown a correlation with equities. The claim that cryptocurrencies are a hedge against inflation stands exposed as crypto prices are also down at a time when inflation is high, the report said.</p>



<p>The Indian central bank, however, stated in its report that crypto market volatility had not affected the formal financial system.</p>



<p>“Although the crypto assets market remains volatile, there have not yet been any spillovers onto the stability of the formal financial system. The accumulated experience suggests that they form an unstable ecosystem, and there is growing evidence that they remain highly concentrated and interconnected,” it said. </p>



<p>RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has been a known and vocal critic of cryptocurrencies. Recently, he grabbed media headlines stating that if cryptocurrencies are allowed to grow, it can cause the next global financial crisis. He argues that cryptocurrencies have no underlying value, making them a purely speculative activity.</p>



<p>But despite RBI’s opposition and the government’s indecision about regulating the digital assets sector, various studies suggest that at least 7% of the Indian population holds digital assets. In the 2022 Chainalysis grassroots crypto adoption index, India stands among the top 10 countries.</p>



<p>The RBI launched a CBDC pilot for the wholesale segment on November 1 and for the retail segment on December 1.</p>



<p>Early this year, the Indian government introduced 1% TDS as the transaction tax on crypto trading. The industry decried the moving terming it exorbitant. However, the government did not relent. As a consequence, crypto trading on Indian exchanges became unattractive and complicated, driving away investors and bringing down trading volume sharply.</p>

<ul>
<li>The investment company has termed FTX’s case as outright fraud.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Before the collapse, SkyBridge had acquired $10 million worth of FTT tokens.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Skybridge Capital, the company founded by Anthony Scaramucci, has disclosed plans to repurchase a 30% stake it sold to FTX in the coming months. Scaramucci &#8211; who served as White House Director of Communications – told CNBC that Sam Bankman-Fried and his collapsed exchange may have committed fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8216;I think it&#8217;s very clear now that there was a fraud. We will, of course, have to let the legal system determine all of those things.</em> &#8220;<em>We are waiting for the clearance from the bankruptcy people, the lawyers, and the investment bankers to figure out exactly what we will be buying back and when</em>,&#8221; Scaramucci said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September, SkyBridge invested $10 million in FTT as part of the deal that would see the exchange acquire 30% of the investment firm. Two months later, FTX filed for bankruptcy, going down with an estimated loss of $10 million in investor’s funds. Amid the chaotic collapse of the exchange, Scaramucci – who flew to the Bahamas on a rescue mission – said then he was distressed but did not want to call it a fraud yet.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-skybridge-invested-10m-in-ftx-before-the-bankruptcy-per-reports"><strong>SkyBridge Invested $10M in FTX Before the Bankruptcy, per Reports&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Describing the situation, he remarked: &#8220;<em>…when I got to the Bahamas, it became clear, at least from some of the people that worked on the legal and compliance team, that perhaps there was more going on than it being a rescue situation. Therefore, when I left the Bahamas in the afternoon, I was actually distressed</em>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recovery efforts for the alleged stolen funds that moved from FTX to its trading arm Alameda are ongoing, although the exact amount of losses and the creditors owed remains unclear. This month, bankruptcy attorney Adam Landis told the court that FTX had recovered over $5 billion besides $425 million held by the Bahamian Securities Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Landis added that evidence pointed to the misappropriation of funds in parties, purchase of planes, houses, and political donations. Part of the funds also went to sport sponsorship deals, including FTX Arena naming rights in Miami, recounts the attorney. Judge John Dorsey has set until March to estimate recoveries and reorganize how the victims could get back their funds.</p>

<p>The start of 2023 has been marked with minimal price movements across most of the cryptocurrencies. However, on January 13, 2023, major cryptocurrencies rallied to the US inflation data, with Bitcoin testing the US$19,000 mark, Ether at US$1,400, and XRP and Cardano at $0.38 and $0.33, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. </p>



<p>The crypto rally continued on January 14, 2023, with Bitcoin trading at US$21,000, Ether trading above US$1,500 and XRP trading at US$0.40 The recent rally has seen the global cryptocurrency market cap reach the US$ 1 trillion mark, a rise of about 25%  since the beginning of 2023.  </p>



<h2 id="h-is-bitcoin-heading-to-25-000"><strong>Is Bitcoin heading to $25,000?</strong></h2>



<p>Several events may impact crypto prices within Q1 of 2023. The next Fed interest rate announcement is scheduled for February 1, 2023. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a scheduled release of its minutes on February 22, 2023. The FOMC minutes have provided investors with some of the rationales behind the Fed’s latest policy decisions.</p>



<p>Another Fed interest rate announcement is scheduled for March 22, 2023. Investors and traders will closely watch how regulators respond to the latest inflation data.</p>



<p>Some of the crypto challenges seen in 2022 are already spilling over into 2023. Crypto companies announcing more job cuts in 2023 include Crypto.com, Huobi, Coinbase, SuperRare, and Blockchain.com.</p>



<p>The contagion from the collapse of FTX carries over with the former CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) set to go on trial in October 2023. Two of SBF’s former associates, co-founder Gary Wang and the former chief executive of Alameda Research Caroline Ellison have already pleaded guilty to fraud charges. Other former executives are reportedly cooperating with federal prosecutors and investigators on the dealings within FTX.</p>



<p>Global Crypto regulation is, in general still fragmented and some way from implementation. During Q1 of 2023, the European Parliament is expected to vote on the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation that will take effect in 2024. MiCA is aimed at creating a harmonised crypto legal framework across the European Union (EU) and closing gaps in the existing EU financial services regulation.</p>



<p>The above events are likely to shape crypto price movements in 2023. It is not clear how long this crypto rally may last but the crypto markets are in much need of positive news following the challenges of 2022.</p>

<p>Bitcoin continued to trade upwards Friday, after growing over 21% in the past seven days and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/market-manipulation-former-sec-official-reveals-factors-propelling-bitcoins-latest-price-ascent/">reaching levels</a> not seen since the fall of FTX. At press time, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency was trading at $21,919, up 3.88% in the past 24 hours. </p>



<p>Likewise, nothing seemed to have changed for Ether (ETH), with the crypto asset barely adding or losing $50 in the past four days. In the past 24 hours, ETH grew by 4.71% and was exchanging hands at around $1,609 mid-day.</p>



<p>Other cryptos also remained hushed for most of the day, with BNB, XRP and Solana moving by a percentage point. Dogecoin, however, grew by over 4% in the past day to tap $0.088 before recoiling to $0.0857 at the time of this report.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been the biggest gainer among the top 15 cryptos by market cap, surging over 20% early Wednesday to tap $0.00001290. The so-called “Doge-Killer” spiked after Upbit, the largest crypto exchange in South Korea, announced that it had listed the meme token. According to a statement by the exchange, users will now be able to trade SHIB for the Korean Won. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00001290.</p>



<p>Overall, despite Wednesday’s gloom, last week’s surge helped boost most crypto prices, signalling investors have moved past the Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ongoing-market-fud-to-result-in-more-altcoin-rebound/">created by the FTX fallout</a> and subsequent contagion.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt that what&#8217;s gone on the last month has been a reputational killer for the industry,&#8221;</em> said Jeffrey Howard, Head of North America business development and Institutional Sales at OSL, a Hong Kong-based digital assets trading platform. According to Howards, while the FTX collapse may have spooked many, institutional investors were <em>“continuing to make new investments into their systems and into the market.”</em></p>



<p>Since Jan 1, the global crypto market cap has grown from $795.5B to $990.3B, marking a 24.4978% increase. On-chain, things also seem to be improving, suggesting that cryptocurrencies may push higher. Today, on-chain and social metrics platform Santiment noted that the top six crypto exchanges saw a substantial amount of bitcoin leaving to self-custody.</p>



<p><em>“The overall supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has dropped from 11.85% to 6.65% over the past year, a historic drop that illustrates the rise in interest in self-custody. Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Kucoin, and Bitstamp all reflect this $BTC exodus.” </em>Wrote Santiment.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Cryptoquant stated that there has been a significant increase in $ETH smart contracts in the last four months, adding that &#8220;this can be considered fundamental good news for Ethereum and the future of this blockchain.&#8221; Most investors look out for behavioural change in the two top cryptocurrencies to make decisions on the movement of the general crypto market.</p>

<p>Four individuals linked to the theft of £21m&nbsp;in Bitcoin from an Australian crypto exchange were sentenced by a UK court on Friday, Jan 13, bringing to closure a four-year-plus legal battle.</p>



<p>According to an announcement by The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the four, Stephen William Boys, 58, Kelly Caton, 44, Jordan Kane Robinson, 23, and James Austin-Beddoes, 27, had been charged with <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crackdowns-on-crypto-and-nfts-from-uk-regulators-to-intensify-in-2022/">stealing and laundering</a> Bitcoin and other crypto assets between 2017 and 2018 from an Australian-based crypto exchange Blackpool.</p>



<p>The four are said to have been part of a syndicate led by James Parker, who masterminded the theft after discovering and exploiting some vulnerabilities in the crypto exchange.</p>



<p><em>“James Parker identified and then exploited a loophole on the cryptocurrency trading platform which allowed him and his associates to dishonestly obtain credits worth £21 million at that time,”</em> read the announcement.</p>



<p><em>“Over three months, James Parker withdrew dishonestly obtained crypto assets worth £15 million from his trading account. His associates, Caton and Robinson, dishonestly withdrew £2.7 million and £ 1.7 million, respectively, from their accounts,”</em> it went on.</p>



<p>Following the heist, Parker went on to enlist the services of Boys, who helped him launder the said assets through offshore crypto firms and friends. And although Parker died in January 2021, the Crown Prosecution Service Civil Recovery Unit managed to arrest his accomplices after casting a wide net. Police also recovered 445 Bitcoin, then worth £22m during investigations, along with more than £1m in bank accounts, luxury watches, houses, cars and designer goods.</p>



<p><em>“The scale of the fraud, in this case, is absolutely staggering and led to the suspects literally having more money than they could spend,” </em>said Det Sgt David Wainwright of Lancashire Police’s Fraud Unit, describing the opulent lifestyle lived by Parker and his associates.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I would like to pay tribute to all the agencies who worked closely together to bring these people to justice,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>Parker’s accomplices were found guilty of fraud as well as converting and transferring criminal property, being sentenced to a total of 15 years.</p>



<p>Welcoming the sentence, Jonathan Kelleher of the CPS noted that cyber-enabled crime ‘presents an increasing threat to international economic stability, as well as to honest individual investors in cryptocurrency’. He further stressed the importance of international collaboration between law enforcement agencies to take down crypto-related syndicates.</p>



<p>Last November, Financial Times reported that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/over-150000-in-bitcoin-seized-from-uk-woman-arrested-for-fraud-and-money-laundering/">crypto fraud</a> in the UK climbed in 2022, citing data from the country&#8217;s police unit, Action Fraud. As per the data, the number of reported losses grew 16% to 10.03K last year. Earlier in September, the UK &nbsp;unveiled a bill to&nbsp;&#8220;seize, freeze and recover&#8221; crypto assets obtained illegally.</p>

<ul>
<li>Solana continues its bullish movement surging 58% in the past seven days as the entire crypto asset market cap reclaims $1 trillion.</li>



<li>BTC, ETH, ADA, and other assets reclaim gains not recorded in several months, capping off a perfect start to the year.</li>



<li>Shiba Inu-themed BONK coin and Helium proposed migration to Solana are factors behind the rise of SOL.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Solana (SOL) has been the most performing digital asset in the top 15 this year by market capitalization and no one saw it coming following a poor run and a disastrous end of 2022.</p>



<p>Solana has surged 58% last week as it maintains a brilliant start this year. Recent gains recorded by SOL have seen its price spike to $23.70 entering another week with hopes of further growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SOL was in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-why-solanas-future-is-still-bright-despite-sol-price-nuking-97-below-ath-vitalik-buterin/">turmoil</a> in 2022 with frequent downtimes and migrating projects culminating in a horrific December with the asset falling to a two-year low of $8.17 dropping out of the top 20 coins by market cap. The recent resurgence of SOL has seen a steady climb reclaiming its spot in the top 10 digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At No 10, SOL has displaced Polygon although the latter has also been up 3% in the past 24 hours. With a price of $23.7, SOL is at its highest since the FTX debacle which saw it suffer huge losses as a result of the exchange’s investments in the network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rise of SOL can be linked to the loud barks of its new Shiba Inu replica BONK coin. Recall that BONK made a flying start this year as it surged over 3,300% and now has a $57 million market capitalization. BONK continues to have a good year and it is currently 20% up in the past 48 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-wider-market-flips-green">Wider market flips green&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Solana’s rise is not in isolation as most top coins have continued to reclaim new levels not recorded in months. Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) surged 24% last week, erasing post-FTX losses and breaking past the $21,000 level. The recent uphill movement means BTC has recorded its best week since March last year.</p>



<p>Altcoins have also seen <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-and-cardano-set-new-monthly-highs-after-scoring-double-digit-gains/">massive</a> upticks this year as the crypto market cap tops $1 trillion. Ethereum (ETH) continues to hold tight over the $1,500 mark recording fair gains this week. Cardano, Dogecoin, and XRP have also been up this week marking a turnaround for digital assets. </p>

<ul>
<li>Kevin O’Leary has expressed concerns about the possible bankruptcy of unregulated exchanges following the collapse of FTX.</li>



<li>He cited the current massive outflows recorded by unregulated exchanges and other indices as factors behind his prediction.</li>



<li>Despite potential bankruptcies, he insists he will continue doubling down on his BTC holdings. </li>
</ul>



<p>The implosion of FTX has left negative footprints in the industry, but it has exposed several other projects running similar schemes in the wake of harsher scrutiny.</p>



<p>Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary has predicted the end of many unregulated exchanges saying that they would collapse like FTX if regulation is not beefed up. Speaking at an interview on KITCO, he stated that post FTX, unregulated exchanges will fall like dominos.</p>



<p>“<em>If you’re asking me if there’s going to be another meltdown to zero? Absolutely. One hundred percent it’ll happen, and it’ll keep happening over, and over and over again.”</em></p>



<p>At the moment, numerous unregulated digital asset exchanges are recording high daily volumes. Unregulated exchanges are exchanges that are not under the supervision of authorities and are not subject to regular audits.</p>



<p>O’Leary, who was a strong voice in support of FTX in the past, has now called for major audits to be carried out by exchanges if they deserve user assets.</p>



<p>“<em>If you&#8217;re not willing to be audited, you don&#8217;t have an audit, you don’t want to be transparent, you don’t want to disclose ownership, why should institutional capital stay? Of course, it&#8217;s not going to,” he added.</em></p>



<p>He cited the ongoing massive outflows recorded by unregulated exchanges as an indication of what is to come in the near future if the status quo remains.</p>



<p><em>”Well, all of these exchanges, all the unregulated exchanges are having massive outflows right now. Smart money has got the joke. They saw what happened at FTX, and they’re not sitting around for an explanation.”</em></p>



<h2 id="h-kevin-o-leary-still-bullish-on-btc"><strong>Kevin O’Leary still bullish on BTC </strong></h2>



<p>Despite losing millions in FTX coupled with failed attempts to save the exchange, O’Leary is still committed to buying more BTC with his “<em>buy the dip strategy.”</em></p>



<p>“<em>I have been going back into crypto markets lately. Any time Bitcoin drops below $17,000 I add to our positions there.” </em></p>



<p>O’Leary has long supported digital assets offering solutions to exchanges and web3 projects. The digital asset market, which has flipped green following a long bear run, could mean that O’Leary will not add more BTC to his portfolio soon as Bitcoin trades at $21,302 at press time. </p>

<ul>
<li>Only 13 validators voted to implement Polygon’s hard fork raising talks of centralization.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The hard fork has been successfully implemented and would keep gas prices low while improving transaction times.</li>



<li>Polygon’s management team has engaged its community, citing reasons for the low voter turnout.</li>
</ul>



<p>Polygon has successfully launched the “Polygon Delhi Fork” as part of its plans to improve transaction speed while keeping gas prices low.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several industry players have lauded the hard fork as the perfect <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-successfully-completes-performance-boosting-hard-fork-as-matic-targets-2-price-high/">technical</a> start of the year, but within the community, it was not short of controversy. Among crypto spaces, the move has been criticized as playing into the hands of a few centralized entities as opposed to what the network stands for.</p>



<p>The Polygon’s governance team, which described itself as a team that “supports the governance and decentralization of the Polygon product suite&#8221;, proposed the hard fork in December, which will require at least 67% of Polygon’s validators to implement. The rationale behind the move was also contested as a cross-section of the community opposed the move and criticized the management for not prioritizing more “<em>important technical upgrades.”</em></p>



<p>The issue was later set up for voting, but not everyone had access, as only the network’s 100 validators that run the nodes were invited to participate in the poll. Finally, it was revealed that only 15 validators voted in the poll, with 13 backing the upgrade with two dissenting.</p>



<p>With 13 votes out of 15, the network recorded 87% in favour of the resolution surpassing the needed 67%. It was later revealed that most validators had registered on the forum for voting, raising eyebrows with some users citing intent to exclude some voters. At the end of the day, only 13 validators decided the fate of the network.</p>



<h2 id="h-community-reacts-polygon-issues-statement"><strong>Community reacts, Polygon issues statement</strong></h2>



<p>In the past 48 hours, criticisms have been heaped on the centralized voting system following the network’s decision to uphold the decision by 13 validators. Several tweeps were on a roll with the issue expressing shock that only 15 votes were cast. “<em>Only 15 votes</em>?” “<em>Polygon is very centralized and are shy to admit it,” </em>were among comments circulating in digital asset spaces.</p>



<p>Polygon has addressed the issues raised, insisting that the initial poll was an “early feedback mechanism”,<em> </em>but as it recorded over 67%, it went ahead with the upgrade. The team also disclosed that 99 of 100 validators were updated at every stage of the process and a move to resist the upgrade would have created a catastrophic situation for everyone involved, as multiple networks would have been created.</p>

<li>The blockchain is planning to support affordable transportation in Sri Lanka.</li>



<li>The announcement comes amid consolidation in the price of most digital assets.</li>
</ul>



<p>Cardano blockchain announced Wednesday during the World Economic Forum in Davos that it is working on an automotive project in collaboration with eTukTuk and the government of Sri Lanka. Among the areas of collaboration is a development of an expansive charging infrastructure for affordable electric vehicles.</p>



<p>‘‘<em>We are thrilled to announce our launch with the support of the Sri Lankan government and major partners. Our network of charging stations along with our affordable etuk-tuks are coming soon to Sri Lanka.</em>’’ eTukTuk posted on Twitter.</p>



<p>Cardano is planning to use a peer-to-peer economic model to address the challenges facing electric transportation in developing countries &#8211; creating a multi-dimensional revenue model, including eTukTuks owned through the Cardano blockchain.</p>



<p>According to the announcement, the end game is to have the more than 1.2 million internal combustion engine tuk-tuks in Sri Lanka turned electric. Cardano also takes it as an opportunity to combat global carbon emissions through the partnership.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-project-is-touted-as-a-solution-to-carbon-emissions"><strong>The Project Is Touted as a Solution to Carbon Emissions</strong></h2>



<p>Tuk-tuks are a symbol of affordable mobility in the developing economies of Asia and Africa, notes the announcement. Still, at the same time, they contribute the most to air pollution. Sri Linka is seen as an important partner for Cardano because the country has passed a law that requires all government vehicles and commuter cars, including the three-wheelers, to be fully electrified by 2040.</p>



<p>Using Cardano as an interface, drivers and the users of etuk-tuks would be able to complete transactions, including payments for the services digitally. Further, the blockchain would incentivize users with rewards, with the revenues of the eTukTuk drivers expected to rise more than four times with the technology.</p>



<p>The announcement comes at a time when cryptocurrencies are consolidating following the new year’s price rally. ADA traded at an intraday low of $0.3268 Thursday and a high of $0.388. Major tokens have also parred some of their gains. From a weekly high of $21,488, Bitcoin touched a low of $20,355 on the weekly chart. Similarly, Ether has retraced from a high of $1,600.</p>

<p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of American multinational financial services company JPMorgan Chase has rubbished Bitcoin, terming the top cryptocurrency as worthless and hyped-up fraud.</p>



<p>Dimon was speaking Thursday on the sidelines of the ongoing World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. When asked by CNBC “Squawkbox&#8221; hosts about his take on Bitcoin and other crypto assets, the 66-year-old businessman said;</p>



<p>“<em>Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud. It’s a pet rock…crypto doesn’t do anything. You can own it (bitcoin) all you want. I don’t care about bitcoin, so just drop the subject.”</em></p>



<p>However, he expressed <a href="https://zycrypto.com/jp-morgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-believes-in-the-blockchain-but-doesnt-give-a-sht-about-bitcoin/">approval</a> for the blockchain, terming it as “different” from crypto, when pressed to explain what he made of BlackRock and other firms investing in the technology.</p>



<p><em>“Blockchain is a technology ledger system that we use to move information. We’ve used it to do overnight repo, intraday repo and to move money. So that is a ledger technology that we think will be deployable.”</em> He added.</p>



<p>Dimon, who has previously described Bitcoin as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-calls-bitcoin-worthless-asserts-regulation-will-kill-it/">“worthless”</a> and stated that neither he nor his clients care about the crypto asset, went on to dismiss the 21M bitcoin capped supply claims. Bitcoin’s limited supply of just 21 million coins has been one of the most important aspects of its existence as it ensures the pioneer cryptocurrency remains deflationary. According to Dimon, however, there was no guarantee that was the case.</p>



<p><em>“Oh yeah really, how do you know it’s going to stop at 21M? everyone says that,”</em> Dimon said, commenting on Bitcoin being a store of value, besides having a capped supply of 21M coins.</p>



<p><em>“Well maybe it’s going to get to 21M and Satoshi’s picture is going to come up laughing at you all. And by then Satoshi will have taken up millions of dollars,”</em> he joked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the crypto community has been responding to the businessman’s comments, with some describing his underrating as shallow.</p>



<p>“<em>As JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon calls bitcoin a &#8220;hyped-up fraud&#8221;&#8230; let us not forget that JPMorgan paid $2.6bn for their role in the Madoff fraud, the largest Ponzi Scheme in history. Bernie Madoff was able to launder billions of dollars through JPMorgan.”</em> Tweeted Peter Mark McCormack, host of the Whatbitcoindid podcast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>I think he really does not understand Bitcoin. His statement that there can be more than 21 million BTC is evidence of that,”</em> another wrote.</p>

<p>One of the four biggest banks in Australia, the National Australia Bank (NAB), has announced that it will soon roll out a new Australian dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum and Algorand. By doing so, NAB has become the second of the country’s major financial institutions to build a stablecoin.</p>



<h2 id="h-second-major-australian-bank-launches-stablecoin-project"><strong>Second Major Australian Bank Launches Stablecoin Project</strong></h2>



<p>The National Australia Bank is soon launching a stablecoin to enable customers to settle transactions on the blockchain in real-time using Australian dollars. It will also be used to purchase carbon credits and in overseas money transfers and repurchase agreements.</p>



<p>The stablecoin, dubbed AUDN, will debut on the Ethereum and Algorand blockchains in the middle of this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Howard Silby, NAB’s chief innovation officer, told the <em>Australian Financial Review </em>(<em>AFR</em>) that the decision to create the stablecoin, which is backed 1:1 by the Australian dollar, was based on the financial institution’s opinion that blockchain technology will play a major role in the next evolution of finance.</p>



<p>“We certainly believe there are elements of blockchain technology that will form part of the future of finance [&#8230;] From our point of view, we see [blockchain] has the potential to deliver instantaneous, transparent, inclusive, financial outcomes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>NAB will be the second of Australia’s big four banks to mint a stablecoin, after rival Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) built its own Australian dollar-pegged stablecoin, A$DC, in March.</p>



<p>The two banks initially planned to cooperate on a single nationwide stablecoin with the other two Big Four Australian banks, but the project never commenced because of competition concerns and the different stages each bank was at in its crypto strategy.</p>



<h2><strong>Australia Beefs Up Crypto Credentials</strong></h2>



<p>Australia has<a href="https://zycrypto.com/australia-accelerates-crypto-adoption-plans-ahead-of-2023/"> stepped up </a>its crypto oversight efforts in recent months, with the country planning to modernize its financial system and begin a review of how cryptocurrency assets are managed, with a view toward keeping practices up to date and safeguarding consumers.</p>



<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/21/asic-bolsters-its-cryptocurrency-team-and-looks-to-regulate-more-digital-assets">expanded </a>its crypto team in March 2022, following Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) security model and an array of collapses in the fast-growing industry.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Australia’s central bank expects to complete a pilot for its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) by mid-2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Optimistically speaking, Ripple chief <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-brad-garlinghouse-tells-where-crypto-market-is-headed-as-xrp-lawsuit-heads-for-conclusion/">Brad Garlinghouse</a> thinks the long-drawn-out battle between his company and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing its conclusion. Garlinghouse is hopeful about a successful resolution to the case within “single-digit months”.</p>



<h2 id="h-ripple-ceo-blasts-sec-s-embarrassing-behavior"><strong>Ripple CEO Blasts SEC’s “Embarrassing” Behavior</strong></h2>



<p>On January 18, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told <em>CNBC </em>at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, that a final decision about whether Ripple, the crypto company affiliated with the XRP cryptocurrency, violated federal securities laws could come as early as June. This is because both parties in the case have now filed and fully briefed their arguments before the presiding judge.</p>



<p>The action by the SEC was initially <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">filed </a>in December 2020 and accused the firm of conducting a $1.3 billion unlicensed securities sale with its XRP coin. It has been a lengthy fight, and Garlinghouse said he expects a court decision this year. “We expect a decision from a judge certainly in 2023. You don’t really have control over when a judge makes their decisions. But I’m optimistic that sometime in the coming single-digit months we’ll have closure there,” the Ripple boss opined.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse as well as most crypto pundits believe the judge will ultimately rule in Ripple’s favour relative to the law and the facts. Nonetheless, he did not pass up the chance to take a dig at the U.S. securities regulator. The Ripple chief observed that the SEC had displayed some pretty “embarrassing” behaviour throughout the course of the suit. “Just some of the things that have been happening, like you’ve got to be kidding,” he added.</p>



<h2><strong>Garlinghouse Sees Very Slim Chance Of Settlement</strong></h2>



<p>Brad Garlinghouse further noted that Ripple had met with the SEC on several occasions in its push for regulatory clarity, and the commission did not tell him they thought XRP was a security. However, the SEC betrayed Ripple when it lodged the scorching complaint.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse then urged the SEC to emulate some of the crypto-friendly jurisdictions such as the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, and the U.K., which have developed forward-looking cryptocurrency regulations that encourage innovation.</p>



<p>Regarding the possibility of reaching a settlement, Garlinghouse indicated Ripple would only <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-good-chance-sec-will-settle-with-ripple-to-avoid-exposing-hinman-documents-says-legal-expert/">agree to settle</a> if the U.S. agency clarified that XRP did not qualify as a security.</p>



<p>Yet, “the SEC and Gary Gensler have very outwardly said he views almost all crypto as a security,” Garlinghouse posited, “and so that leaves very little space in the Venn diagram for settlement.”</p>

<p>A 2022 <a href="https://crypto.com/research/2022-crypto-market-sizing-report">Crypto.com market sizing report </a>has revealed that 119 million new crypto owners were added in the period between January 2022 to January 2023. The figure represents a 39% increase, bringing the total number of global owners to 425 million.</p>



<p>The findings correspond with a 2022 Triple-A report that pegged global users at 320 million and predicted a rise beyond those figures before 2023. Triple A ranked the USA, Pakistan, India, Nigeria and Vietnam as the top 5 countries where crypto owners live.</p>



<p>On a further breakdown of the report, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/market-manipulation-former-sec-official-reveals-factors-propelling-bitcoins-latest-price-ascent/">Bitcoin</a> owners gained an impressive amount of new users representing a 26% increase, with Ethereum surging to 87 million users, representing a 263% increase over the last 12 months. The top two cryptocurrencies, with a combined market cap of over $587 billion, continued to hold up to 70% dominance of the total crypto market.</p>



<p>Findings point to the merge as the major propeller or Ethereum surge, as the transition from proof-of-work to energy-efficient proof-of-stake attracted many new users to the network. Other factors like staking and investments from investors pulled traffic in its direction as well.</p>



<p>Throughout its transition mid-last year, a section of the crypto community grew worried about a potential susceptibility to institutional censorship and control—two issues antithetical to the goal of crypto. Still, such fears have been eclipsed by a trove of exchange failures and other external factors costing the ecosystem over $2 trillion in losses. Ethereum, currently valued at $1,500, had just marked a long-awaited sharp rise since falling from its all-time high of $3,521 in March 2022 to a little over $900 in June.</p>



<p>Over the last three years, Bitcoin has continued to crawl back a significant portion of its dominance in the crypto market. The crypto market leader fell hard on its back in 2022, losing nearly three-quarters of its ATH value and a little over trillions of dollars in market capitalization over the last 15 months. To bring more clarity, a market capitalization dominance which stood at 65% in 2021 for the satoshi-based crypto, shrunk to a whopping 43% by mid-July 2021. With the current reports, however, hopes are high for the apex crypto to return to its winning streak as it stands at a 41% market cap dominance.</p>



<p>Bitcoin continues to chart an impressive price run beyond &#8211; and around $20,000 over the past two weeks.</p>
