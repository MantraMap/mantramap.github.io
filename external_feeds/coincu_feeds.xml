<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>A California judge determined that two Yuga Labs executives must be deposed or answer questions in court.</em></li>



<li><em>The action comes after a legal struggle that began in June 2022.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>The legal struggle for Yuga Labs, the author of the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club, and NFT artist Ryder Ripps continues.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Wylie Aronow</strong> and <strong>Greg Solano</strong>, two of Yuga Labs&#8217; founders, were <strong>ordered to be deposed by a federal court in California because they are not apex witnesses.</strong></p>

Yuga&#8217;s claim that it could not file a timely, routinely noticed motion is without substance. </p>



<p>Back in December, it might have presented a routine motion with an application to reduce time. Instead, <strong>Yuga sought relief two business days before the January 9 Aranow deposition</strong>, making it nearly impossible for the Court to rule before the January 9 deposition.</p>

<p><strong>Yuga Labs filed a lawsuit in June 2022</strong>, claiming that Ryder Ripps infringed Yuga&#8217;s intellectual property by using <strong>copycat NFTs</strong>. Ripps hired a lawyer and filed a counterclaim, claiming that each NFT is unique by design and hence cannot be replicated.</p>

<p>The news comes in the wake of an eight-count indictment of the former crypto millionaire accused of misusing FTX customer funds. Prosecutors claim that victims&#8217; rights must be preserved.</p>



<p>Coincu reported on January 5 that the DOJ is seizing assets linked to the bankrupt crypto company FTX, including some shares in the trading app Robinhood, officials said during a virtual court hearing in Delaware. <strong>Robinhood shares worth $450 million are stillÂ <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154618-ftx-seeks-help-ownership-robinhood-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the process of an ownership disputeÂ </a>between three parties</strong>, including SBF, the bankrupt cryptocurrency company BlockFi and FTX creditor Yonathan Ben Shimon.</p>



<p>The 30-year-old claims in an affidavit filed with the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court that he and FTX chief technology officer Gary Wang borrowed monies from FTX affiliate firm Alameda Research to create the shell company that controlled the Robinhood shares.</p>

<p>Despite the current business crisis caused by the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157136-ftx-revealed-the-address-of-167-million/"><strong>FTX crash</strong></a>, the Hong Kong government remains dedicated to the development of cryptocurrency infrastructure.</p>



<p>According to <strong>Paul Chan</strong>, <strong>the financial secretary</strong>, the local government and regulators are<strong> open to working with</strong> <strong>crypto and fintech businesses in 2023</strong>. On Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), Chan remarked at an event held by <strong>the state-run incubator Cyberport</strong> that Hong Kong has become <strong>a foundation connecting high-quality virtual asset enterprises.</strong></p>



<p>Over the last<strong> two months</strong>, the country government has received <strong>numerous proposals from crypto-related enterprises</strong> to establish global headquarters in Hong Kong, according to the financial secretary. Many industry firms have also <strong>expressed interest in expanding operations in Hong Kong </strong>or going public on local exchanges, according to Chan.</p>

<p>He added that <strong>the lawmakers passed laws in December </strong>to establish a <strong>licensing framework for virtual asset service providers</strong>. The new legal framework is intended to give bitcoin exchanges with the same level of market acceptance as traditional financial institutions already enjoy.</p>



<p>Chen allegedly stated at the event that Hong Kong officials and regulators are implementing <strong>a variety of pilot projects</strong> to investigate the potential benefits of virtual assets and explore related applications. He mentioned that one of the projects is the <strong>government&#8217;s issue of tokenized green bonds </strong>for subscription by institutional investors.</p>



<p>Over the last year, Hong Kong has increasingly reaffirmed its<strong> pro-crypto attitude</strong>, with the goal of being <strong>the most crypto-ready country by 2022</strong>. This nation launched its <strong>first two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for bitcoin futures in mid-December,</strong> raising more than <strong>$70 million </strong>ahead of their debut. The incident occurred shortly after the head of<strong> Securities and Futures Commission stated in October</strong> that the country is willing to differentiate its crypto regulating approach from the Chinese crypto ban that would be implemented in 2021.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">It is unclear exactly how theÂ softwareÂ gets onto the infected end devices of consumers.Â Godfather is known to display fakeÂ websitesÂ of regularÂ bankingÂ and crypto apps.Â If consumers log in via theseÂ websitesÂ , their login data is transmitted to the cyber criminals. </p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">The malware also sends push notifications to get the&nbsp;codes&nbsp;for two-factor authentication.&nbsp;With this data, the cyber criminals may be able to gain access to consumers&#8217; accounts and wallets.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Security experts claim that <strong>the virus may impersonate the Google Protect program, giving it access to the victim&#8217;s phone&#8217;s accessibility settings</strong>. The virus can increase the number of infected programs in its pool thanks to this access. It accomplishes this by recording keystrokes when users log in to apps that aren&#8217;t on its list of infected apps using the phone&#8217;s built-in screen capture features.</p>

<p>The notification made today is the most recent to alert people to <strong>the escalating danger presented by the GodFather virus</strong>. <strong>GodFather belongs to a group of Android-based trojans that target mobile banking and cryptocurrency apps, together with Gustuff.</strong> By showing phoney copies of popular banking and cryptocurrency trading websites, it deceives its victims. The virus can be used by cybercriminals to steal users&#8217; login information.</p>



<p>Additionally, <strong>SMS messages from the victim&#8217;s smartphone can be stolen by the GodFather spyware</strong>. As a result, malware may be used by hackers to get around two-factor authentication requirements.</p>



<p>To avoid such fake applications, Android users have been asked to research apps before installing them. It has also been recommended for Android users enable Google Play Protect. Additionally, according to <strong>PCrisk,</strong> machines with their language settings set to <strong>Uzbek, Russian, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Armenian, Tajik, Belarusian, or Moldovan cannot be infected by the virus</strong>.</p>

<p>Over the last<strong> 24 hours</strong>, more than<strong> $1.5 billion</strong> has come into <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159030-cardano-founders-will-open-new-hospital/">Cardano</a>, boosting the ADA cap to a daily high of <strong>$11.74 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>Significant purchasing pressure has led <strong>the value of ADA to skyrocket</strong>, with the coin trading at <strong>$0.32</strong> at press time, a gain of <strong>more than 14%</strong> in 24 hours. The asset&#8217;s price has risen by<strong> more than 28%</strong> in the last week.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ADA_1D_graph_coinmarketcap.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="461" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ADA_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-1024x461.png" alt="Cardano Received $1.5 Billion In One Day; The Value Of ADA To Skyrocket" class="wp-image-159057" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ADA_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-1024x461.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ADA_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-300x135.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ADA_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-768x346.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ADA_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-1536x692.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ADA_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-750x338.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ADA_1D_graph_coinmarketcap-1140x514.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ADA_1D_graph_coinmarketcap.png 1776w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Cardano Received $1.5 Billion In One Day; The Value Of ADA To Skyrocket 27"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Notably, after encountering resistance <strong>at $0.30</strong>, this level may serve as a significant support level as <strong>ADA advances towards the critical $0.50 level</strong>. However, if investors begin to take profits, the asset will face further uncertainty. It is worth mentioning that, historically, ADA has typically followed the overall market trend; hence, the present bull run remains uncertain.</p>



<p>The ADA&#8217;s momentum can be due to <strong>a variety of causes</strong>, the most important of which being the platform&#8217;s rapid growth. For example, the platform is seeing a steady increase in the number of smart contracts. For example, the number of Plutus smart contracts as of <strong>January 8 is 4,803</strong>,<strong> a rise of 780 smart contracts in December alone</strong>.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Cardano token has seen a <strong>spike in whales</strong>, with high-net-worth investors banking on the token&#8217;s upside potential. Furthermore, more activity is likely to fuel ADA&#8217;s upward momentum as the new year begins. According to reports, the network is anticipating the release of two stablecoins<strong> in the first quarter of 2023</strong>.</p>



<p>Members of the community are also looking forward to the highly anticipated <strong>Layer 2 scalability solution Hydra</strong>, which aims to boost transaction speeds with low latency and high throughput while maintaining low gas prices. Despite the fact that the price of ADA is rising,<strong> the forecasts for a bearish momentum are still more bullish</strong>. <strong>PricePredictions</strong>&#8216; machine learning algorithm predicts that the token will trade at roughly <strong>$0.275 </strong>by the end of this month.</p>

<p>The domestic coin market exchange <strong>Huobi Korea</strong> is planning to arrange its ties with the parent firm <strong>Huobi Global</strong>. It is a strategy to improve its domestic presence by changing its name to <strong>Huobi</strong> and purchasing shares.</p>



<p>According to industry sources on the 9th, <strong>Huobi Korea began planning to buy Huobi Global&#8217;s shares and alter its name</strong>. The organization intends to issue a call for new missions from both internal and external staff, and then finalize the mission after gathering feedback.</p>



<p><strong>Leon Lin, the founder of Huobi Global, held more than half of the existing Huobi Korea. Chairman Jo Guk-Bong and Korea Land Trust are the next largest stockholders</strong>. Jo, who also runs a cryptocurrency mining company, is scheduled to buy out Lin&#8217;s controlling ownership.</p>

<p>The change of name and purchase of shares was viewed as <strong>drawing a line with Huobi Global</strong> in the industry. Huobi Global is a global virtual asset exchange that competed with Binance and FTX. <strong>Former engineer Li Lin launched the largest virtual asset exchange in China in 2013.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Huobi Global has had difficulty as demand for Proof of Reserve (POR) increased</strong>. This is also why Huobi Korea chose to cut ties with Huobi Global. Previously, FTX declared bankruptcy owing to a shortage of liquidity, and Proof of Reserves (POR) agreements were established amongst virtual asset exchanges to prevent clients from withdrawing cash as a result.</p>



<p>The decision comes after a turbulent year for Singapore-based Huobi Global, which has seen its corporate structure shift. Earlier this month, <strong>it announced plans to slash <a href="https://news.coincu.com/158665-the-listing-pi-network-now-plans-to-lay-off/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/158665-the-listing-pi-network-now-plans-to-lay-off/" rel="noreferrer noopener">20%</a> of its workforce</strong>, with a representative stating that a <strong>very lean team will be maintained going forward</strong>.</p>

<p>The bank&#8217;s decision comes only a week after three US financial authorities advised against placing too much leverage on bitcoin. The volatile cryptocurrency market plummeted last year as a result of the high-profile failures of many large crypto businesses.</p>



<p>Metropolitan Commercial Bank does not have any crypto assets on its balance sheet and does not offer or sell them to consumers. The bank&#8217;s pullout from the crypto sector will have a <strong>minimal financial impact</strong> according to a <a href="https://investors.mcbankny.com/news-events/news/news-details/2023/Metropolitan-Bank-Holding-Corp.-to-Exit-Crypto-Asset-Related-Vertical/default.aspx" data-type="URL" data-id="https://investors.mcbankny.com/news-events/news/news-details/2023/Metropolitan-Bank-Holding-Corp.-to-Exit-Crypto-Asset-Related-Vertical/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>. <strong>Four active institutional crypto-related clients account for 1.5% of overall revenues and 6% of total deposits at the business.</strong></p>



<p><strong>MCB&#8217;s interactions with these customers are limited to debit cards, payment, and account services</strong>. The Company has no outstanding loans to any of these clients, no crypto-assets on its balance sheet, and no crypto-assets to market or sells to its customers. MCB has begun the process of winding down its connections with these clients in a systematic manner, which <strong>it hopes to finish by 2023</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>This decision will have no effect on clients&#8217; existing capacity to transfer or receive payments from crypto-asset firms</strong> with which they choose to conduct business, or on MCB&#8217;s service to customers who do not have crypto-asset-related activities as their primary line of business.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Todayâ€™s announcement of our exit from the crypto-currency related asset vertical represents the culmination of a process that began in 2017, when we decided to pivot away from crypto and not grow the business, Crypto-related clients, assets and deposits have never represented a material portion of the Companyâ€™s business and have never exposed the Company to material financial risks. We remain focused on growing our core business and delivering superior value for all of our stakeholders through high-touch, relationship-driven banking, supported by financial discipline and sound risk management.</p>
<cite>said Mark R. DeFazio, President and CEO of MCB</cite></blockquote>



<p>The bank offers debit cards, payment, and account services to its customers and has no outstanding debts. <strong>During 2023, the crypto sector is predicted to conclude client ties</strong>. Customers&#8217; ability to send or receive payments from crypto firms will not be impacted by the shift away from crypto.</p>
