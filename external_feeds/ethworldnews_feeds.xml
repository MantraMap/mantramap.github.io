<ul><li>Binance has confirmed that Euro withdrawals through the SEPA system will continue till September 25.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange previously stated that it had temporarily suspended Euro withdrawals and deposits via SEPA.&nbsp;</li><li>Some users may experience account closure, as part of the platform’s routine compliance checks.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange is currently working to secure an alternative before the September deadline.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance’s users in the European Union will be able to use the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) system to make Euro withdrawals from their trading account till next month. The crypto exchange confirmed earlier today that SEPA withdrawal and deposit service will remain live for users till September 25, 2023. The clarification came a day after the exchange stated that it had temporarily suspended EUR withdrawals and deposits.</p>



<h2><strong>Binance: Withdrawal Suspension Message Was Sent In Error</strong></h2>



<p>On August 20, Binance Customer Support on X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/1693567598284144950" rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> a user that EUR withdrawals and deposits via the SEPA system had been temporarily suspended. The decision was taken after a Euro provider stopped supporting the crypto exchange’s transactions. At the time, the exchange stated that there was no ETA on the restoration of SEPA transfers, and encouraged users to use alternative methods to trade crypto. </p>



<p>Earlier today, the Binance Customer Support account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1693659553383223553" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> that the SEPA suspension message in the now-deleted tweet was sent in error. The account confirmed that SEPA withdrawals and deposits would be available for existing users till September 25. However, the service has been disabled for new users since June 25, 2023. </p>



<p>The exchange added that in the run-up to the September deadline, some users may be asked for additional information as part of the platform’s routine compliance checks. These checks can potentially lead to “early account closures” for some users. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/srm-snm-yfii-down-25-binance-delisting/">Binance</a> reportedly plans to secure an alternate service provider before September 25. </p>



<p>Paysafe, Binance’s banking partner in Europe, confirmed to Decrypt earlier today that Euro withdrawals and deposits through the SEPA system would be available for European users till September. The decision to stop supporting the crypto exchange was reportedly taken back in June 2023 following a strategic review.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Friend.tech has called out a crypto news website that alleged that the platform’s database was leaked.&nbsp;</li><li>The Block previously reported that the details of over 100,000 friend.tech users had been leaked.&nbsp;</li><li>The social platform clarified that the user information was taken from its public API.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wrapper-versions-friendtech-coingecko/">Friend.tech</a>, the web3 social platform recently launched on Coinbase’s layer 2 Base, has called out crypto news website The Block for incorrectly reporting a database leak. The website published an article earlier today, claiming that a data leak had revealed the ETH addresses of more than 100,000 friend.tech users. </p>



<h2><strong>Friend.tech Says “Leaked” Addresses Were Publicly Available</strong></h2>



<p>Friend.tech took to X (formerly Twitter) earlier today to call out The Block for alleging a database leak that supposedly revealed information about 101,000 of its users, including wallet addresses on Base, X usernames, X name, etc. The news outlet cited a Github repository shared by Yearn Finance developer Banteng, which contained the user database in question.</p>



<p>Friend.tech clarified that the user information was gathered by scraping their public API, which reportedly shows the association between public wallet addresses and public Twitter usernames. “It’s like saying someone hacked you by looking at your public Twitter feed,” the social platform added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The news website has since altered its article and made corrections suggesting that the user data was publicly available and not obtained from a leak. However, the crypto community on X criticized the website for spreading FUD through inaccurate reports. The Block’s Director of Research got into a heated debate while defending the actions of his team. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think the debate goes into whether there was some public database (which should have been private) already linking the accounts and addresses that <a href="https://twitter.com/bantg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@bantg</a> found and published or whether Bantg manually scraped and connected the accounts and addresses together.</p>&mdash; Steven (@Dogetoshi) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1693623251249860755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">August 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The incident highlighted friend/tech’s popularity, given that it managed to accumulate more than 100,000 users since its launch on August 10, 2023. Data from <a href="https://defillama.com/fees" rel="nofollow noopener">DeFiLlama</a> showed that the fees generated by the social platform exceeded $25 million. Data from Dune Analytics showed that the platform’s cumulative trading volume was nearly $56 million. The social platform has added more than 17,000 new users over the past 24 hours. </p>

</div></figure>



<h2>Friend.tech Hype</h2>



<p>The mobile app launched with an invite-only beta a day after Base opened for public access. The platform allows users to tokenize their X (formerly Twitter) accounts and sell a feature called &#8220;shares&#8221;. Shareholders are then afforded access to a private chat room owned by the account whose shares they bought. Users have drawn comparisons with a similar dapp called Bitclout.</p>



<p>The project has garnered attention and participation from DeFi users, reaching over 100,000 unique users shortly after launch per a Dune Analytics dashboard. </p>



<p>Observers also raised eyebrows regarding the long-term value proposition of the project and its pricing mechanism. Friend.tech employs a bonding curve that prices each share based on the number of shareholders. This also means the price of each share could increase as more users buy the shares of an account.</p>



<p>Bitclout, another platform that tokenized users&#8217; social media presence, offered a similar platform that eventually faded after the initial hype.</p>



<p>Community members also raised privacy concerns after a so-called leak of users&#8217; on-chain addresses. &#8220;This is just someone scraping our public API that shows the association between public wallet addresses and public Twitter usernames&#8221;, the team responded.</p>



<p>Friend dot tech </p>



<p>The mobile-only social media decentralized app currently has no privacy policy page, leaving questions about the project&#8217;s approach to one of crypto&#8217;s most talked about topics. </p>

<ul><li>OpenSea is set to disable the royalty enforcement function on its platform starting next month.&nbsp;</li><li>The NFT marketplace will remove its Operator Filter, making royalties optional for new collections.</li><li>Royalties will be enforced for collections that enable the Operator Filter before August 31, 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>NFT creators online have expressed frustration with the policy change.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>OpenSea has reversed its policy on royalties for NFT artists by making creator fees optional, citing competition from rival marketplaces, including Blur, LooksRare, and Dew. The leading <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/polygon-suku-launch-nft-minted-on-twitter/">NFT</a> marketplace announced earlier today that the changes would go into effect on August 31, 2023. Post this date, NFT artists who sell digital art on the platform will receive royalties on secondary sales only if the buyer chooses to pay it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>OpenSea Operator Filter To Be Disabled&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to making royalties optional, the OpenSea Operator Filter will also be shut down, the NFT marketplace stated in a <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/articles/creator-fees-update" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>. Operator Filter, which was launched in November last year, is a tool used by NFT artists to restrict the sale of their collections to marketplaces that don&#8217;t enforce creator fees in secondary sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objective of the Operator Filter was to empower NFT creators by giving them control over their artwork and web3 business models. But OpenSea claimed that the tool required the participation of everyone in the web3 ecosystem, which did not happen, prompting the change in the royalty policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to OpenSea, the option creator fees would be more in line with the choice and ownership in the DeFi space. Starting August 31, the Operator Filter will not block any web3 marketplaces, making it easier for potential NFT buyers to identify secondary listings. This would include the creator’s preferred fees, as well as the option for buyers to modify the creator fees payment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, for NFT creators who enable the OpenSea Operator Filter for their collection before August 31, the NFT marketplace will enforce the creator’s preferred royalty on all secondary sales till February 29, 2024. This option will also be extended to existing collections on all non-Ethereum blockchains.</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase is set to suspend trading of USDT, DAI, and RAI in Canada at the end of the month.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange stated that the decision was based on recent reviews and internal listing standards.&nbsp;</li><li>Users will be able to deposit and withdraw the discontinued stablecoins following the suspension.&nbsp;</li><li>Crypto.com withdrew support for USDT in Canada earlier this year at the direction of the local securities regulator.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase is set to suspend the trading of three popular stable assets in Canada, including the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, Tether USD (USDT), at the end of this month. The other stablecoins include DAI and the Rai Reflex Index (RAI), a non-pegged Ether-backed stable asset commonly used on decentralized finance protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Will Allow Access To Suspended Stablecoins</strong></h2>



<p>In an email to its users earlier today, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-approval-crypto-futures-stock-5/">Coinbase</a> announced that it would suspend trading in Canada for USDT, DAI, and RAI on August 31, 2023. According to the crypto exchange, the decision was made based on recent reviews, which indicated that the stable assets did not meet the platform’s listing standards, which all assets are regularly monitored for. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="919" height="675" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225.png" alt="Coinbase Set To Suspend USDT Trading In Canada This Month 10" class="wp-image-583712" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225.png 919w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225-300x220.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225-770x566.png 770w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225-269x198.png 269w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-225-746x548.png 746w" sizes="(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px" title="Coinbase Set To Suspend USDT Trading In Canada This Month 12"></figure>



<p>Coinbase clarified that the trading suspension will not affect Canadian customers’ access to USDT, DAI, and RAI and that the users will be able to deposit and withdraw the stable assets from their wallets following the suspension. None of the stable assets had a considerable change in their prices following the announcement of the suspension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase’s announcement comes less than a week after it officially launched its services in Canada’s crypto market. The move came after months of collaboration between the California-based crypto exchange and Canadian regulators and policymakers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, fellow crypto exchange Crypto.com ended support for USDT after it was directed to do so by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). In December 2022, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) stated that value-pegged crypto assets, including Tether, qualified as securities in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ironically, Tether <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-makes-strategic-transition-to-meet-community-demands-and-foster-innovation/" rel="nofollow noopener">withdrew</a> support for Bitcoin Cash SLP, Omni Layer, and Kusama. The decision was reportedly part of a strategic transition based on the crypto industry’s demands. </p>

The SEC has until August 18th to file its motion.</p>



<p>This approval comes a day after Ripple Labs and co-defendants Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ripple-opposes-sec-interlocutory-appeal/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ripple-opposes-sec-interlocutory-appeal/" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposed</a> the SEC’s request for an interlocutory appeal, per court documents seen on August 16. </p>

<p>After the SEC files its motion on Friday, the digital asset company is expected to submit opposition arguments by September 1.  Thursday&#8217;s ruling allows the SEC to file a motion to appeal, not to be mistaken for Judge Torres&#8217;s approval of the appeal itself.</p>

<h2>SEC vs Ripple Headed To Trial</h2>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s interlocutory motion seeks to appeal a specific ruling from Judge Torres. Previously, Judge Torres issued a summary judgment in partial favor of Ripple Labs. The verdict said programmatic sales of XRP did not qualify as securities considering the Howey test. </p>



<p>However, XRP sales to institutional investors met the Howey standard for classifying securities. SEC vs Ripple Labs et all is scheduled for trial in the Southern District of New York by Q2 2024. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a deadline of December 4, 2023 for all parties to submit any filings and motions to exclude evidence from a jury, per court documents. </p>



<p>Garlinghouse and Larsen, Ripple co-founders, also face charges of aiding and abetting violations of U.S. securities laws. </p>

<ul><li>FTX’s stranded customers have expressed disappointment over the recent bankruptcy claim settlement.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt exchange recently reached a $175 million deal to settle bankruptcy claims with Genesis.&nbsp;</li><li>The deal was significantly lower than the original claim amount of nearly $4 billion.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange’s CEO John Ray III endorsed the settlement in the interest of concluding the Chapter 11 proceedings.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-ryan-salame-plea-deal-prosecutors/">FTX</a> has settled its bankruptcy claims against fellow bankrupt crypto Genesis. The agreement will allow the defunct crypto exchange’s sister firm Alameda Research to claim $175 million from the bankruptcy estate of Genesis. However, the claim amount is significantly less than the original claim of nearly $4 billion, which has caused considerable outrage among FTX’s stranded customers. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX CEO John Ray Supports Settlement With Genesis</strong></h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/genesis/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MjQ2MTUwMg==&amp;id2=-1" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> earlier today, Genesis’ lawyers requested Judge Sean Lane of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York to approve the proposed settlement. Genesis stated in the filing that the settlement would help speed up its Chapter 11 proceedings, which begin in early 2023. </p>



<p>In addition to paying $175 million to FTX’s bankruptcy estate, the proposed settlement would also waive Genesis’ claims of more than $226 million against the bankrupt crypto exchange. Genesis Global Capital previously revealed that the Bahamas-based exchange was its largest unsecured creditor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX made a parallel <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MjQ2MTQ0MA==&amp;id2=-1" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> where it’s current CEO John Ray III endorsed the latest deal with Genesis. Ray added that the settlement agreement saved both parties from a long and expensive legal process that would be harmful to their respective stakeholders. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It is my view that the Settlement Agreement is the result of these good faith arm’s-length negotiations between the Parties and that such negotiations were free of any collusion.”</p><cite>John Ray, CEO of FTX</cite></blockquote>



<p>FTX’s stranded customers took issue with the deal, given that it was significantly less than the original $3.9 billion claim. FTX 2.0 Coalition, a community of the exchange’s users working to restart the platform, described it as “the worst deal to date.” Other users alleged collusion between John Ray and Genesis’ executives and urged the Unsecured Creditors Committee to oppose the said deal. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>News of the $175 million settlement comes less than a month after both parties reached an in-principle agreement to resolve the claims they made amid their ongoing dispute. On July 28, legal representatives of FTX and Genesis informed Judge Lane that they had found common ground regarding a settlement and intended to proceed with documentation shortly.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Kaiko, Curve’s 3pool represents one of its “most important sources of liquidity for DAI, USDC, and USDT” and has seen $175 million since the hack.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">USDC has seen the most outflows of all the three stablecoins that make up the currency reserves in the pool. Since the exploit, liquidity providers have removed USDC coins worth $125 million from 3pool. DAI comes in second place with outflows that totaled $60 million, “$25mn of which came in just three transactions on July 31,” the report stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regarding Tether’s USDT, Kaiko found that it has remained roughly even in the Curve 3pool, despite the increased removal of the other stablecoins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Kaiko, this suggests that investors are becoming more skittish about USDT. This is because USDT makes up a disproportionate amount of the pool, so a run on USDT could cause the pool to depeg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that users are incentivized to remove USDT from the Curve 3pool is a sign that they are worried about the stability of USDT. This could lead to further outflows from the pool, which could put downward pressure on the price of USDT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The total currency reserves in Curve&#8217;s 3pool at press time was $3 million. USDT accounted for the largest share of the reserves, with $1.43 million, or 48.20%. USDC was the second-largest reserve, with $423,654, or 14.25%. DAI was the third-largest reserve, with $1.11 million, or 38%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amid the fear of a complete liquidation of Michael Egorov’s collateral on Aave following the hack, the count of transactions involving CRV has dropped since 30 July.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likewise, CRV has failed to draw in new demand as people continue to close their trading positions.

<ul><li>Ripple has filed a response in anticipation of an interlocutory appeal by the SEC.&nbsp;</li><li>The securities regulator is likely to request Judge Torres and the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals for an interlocutory appeal.&nbsp;</li><li>Ripple and its executives have opposed the anticipated appeal citing the failure of such an appeal to satisfy the prerequisites.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-appeal-ripple-ruling-xrp-do-kwon/">Ripple</a> has filed a response ahead of an interlocutory appeal expected from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its legal battle against the crypto giant. Ripple’s opposition to the securities regulator’s anticipated interlocutory appeal comes a month after it was handed a partial victory following the summary judgment on July 13, 2023. </p>



<h2><strong>Ripple: Immediate Appeal Won’t Terminate The Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>The law firm representing Ripple sent a <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/kihuQOR/latest-file-3-pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">letter</a> to Judge Analisa Torres, who is overseeing the lawsuit, to oppose the SEC’s anticipated motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal for the court’s July 13 order which granted the crypto firm’s summary judgment. </p>



<p>An interlocutory appeal is filed to appeal a ruling by a trial court amid ongoing proceedings for other aspects of the case. In other words, an interlocutory appeal is sought to appeal a certain ruling before a final judgment is passed by the court. </p>



<p>James Murphy, a popular crypto lawyer on X (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1683817505100374016" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> last month that an interlocutory appeal from the SEC was likely. According to Murphy, the mounting political pressure on SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the summary judgment’s potential impact on the SEC’s ongoing high-profile lawsuits against crypto giants Binance and Coinbase could prompt the securities regulator to make such a move. </p>



<p>However, the SEC would need the permission of Judge Torres, as well as the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, to proceed with an interlocutory appeal. This would require the regulator to demonstrate three things: First, the court’s previous ruling involves a controlling question of law. Second, there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion on that question, and lastly, an immediate appeal may advance the termination of the litigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ripple, along with Chief Executive Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen, opposed the anticipated appeal on the grounds that none of the above-mentioned prerequisites would be satisfied in the SEC’s anticipated interlocutory appeal.&nbsp;</p>
