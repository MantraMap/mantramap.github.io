			  <description><![CDATA[<p>South Korea will mandate all companies that own or issue cryptocurrencies to disclose their holdings in financial statements from 2024.</p>
<p>South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) issued draft rules requiring companies holding or issuing cryptocurrencies to disclose their holdings in financial statements from 2024.</p>
Local Crypto Firms to Disclose Holdings
<p>In a press statement, the FSC said firms would have to disclose information about their holdings' characteristics, quantities, business models and internal accounting policies. Additionally, domestic companies must disclose information regarding profits, book value, and the market value of their cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The new accounting standards are expected to take effect in January 2024.</p>
<p>In its statement, the FCA said:</p>

<p>The government is enhancing accounting transparency in virtual asset transactions by requiring companies to disclose detailed information, following the&nbsp;passage of the Virtual Assets Act&nbsp;in the parliament on June 30.</p>

<p>South Korean lawmakers passed legislation that protects investors and grants the FSC and The Bank of Korea the power to oversee crypto operators and asset custodians. The newly enacted Virtual Asset Users Protection Act also authorizes the power to impose penalties and liabilities for damages caused by unfair trading practices.</p>
Guidelines Seek to Provide Accounting Clarity
<p>Until now, firms and their auditors differed in their view regarding the timing and criteria for determining whether the sale of virtual assets to customers constituted profit.</p>
<p>Under the FSC's new rules, if companies sell assets, the sale will be regarded as profit after the company fulfils obligations to its holder.</p>
<p>The announcement added that the cost incurred in developing virtual assets and their platforms would not be considered intangible assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With industry-wide crackdowns from the likes of the SEC and exacting regulatory demands coming into force in Europe, it&rsquo;s never been more crucial to implement proper AML procedures.</p>
<p>The crypto industry has received bad press from various mainstream media sources citing how crypto can be used for all kinds of nefarious practices, money laundering in particular. Be that as it may, cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology, and therefore transactions are inherently transparent, and the trail of a suspected wrongdoer can usually be followed.</p>
<p>However, there are always ways and means that a bad actor, who wishes to circumvent anti-money laundering (AML) processes, can employ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One key aspect of AML compliance is the implementation of transaction monitoring systems, such as Know Your Transaction (KYT). KYT involves real-time monitoring of individual transactions to identify suspicious activities, while the verification of addresses helps assess the legitimacy of wallet addresses involved in cryptocurrency transactions, mitigating risks associated with high-risk entities.</p>
<p>In a September 2022 article, the World Economic Forum (WEF) reported a 1,964% increase in cryptocurrencies that are laundered by way of decentralised finance (DeFi). This percentage was equivalent to around $900 million in laundered value.</p>
<p>To combat this type of activity, blockchain analytics tools and experts have made their niche in the market and are being used by companies in their struggle to become and remain compliant. Companies that provide this kind of service normally also offer the ability for a client to be able to fully investigate blockchain transactions as part of their AML responsibilities.</p>
<p>As the crypto sector seeks clarity in the regulatory environment in order to become a more accepted part of the financial system, complying with AML requirements will surely be a non-negotiable item on this path.</p>
How Does Funds Tracing Work On The Blockchain?
<p>Blockchain analytics is a form of data science focused on the analysis, identification, and clustering of data on the blockchain, which is a digitally distributed public ledger. In other words, blockchain analytics is a method that companies use to investigate blockchain transactions and flag potentially fraudulent or illicit activities.</p>
<p>Blockchain analytics involves scraping data from crypto transactions, analysing wallets, and clustering wallets with similar typologies. Analytics providers can create a database and group wallets with similar typologies into clusters. This is an integral step when discovering both the source and destination of illicit funds. Law enforcement agencies and businesses utilise blockchain analytics to combat fraud, enhance compliance, and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>According to the US-based security website CSO Online a crucial part of the puzzle is identifying various addresses that might be linked to the same wallet, and then finding out who owns it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowing the exact entity behind a batch of addresses can be crucial, and blockchain intelligence companies have ways of finding that. They aggregate information from multiple sources, often using off-chain data to enrich their understanding of transactions. They look at dark web forums, social media posts, and court papers among others.&rdquo;</p>

How to Choose the Right Analytical and Business Protection Tools for Effective AML
<p>When it comes to selecting analytical and business protection tools for effective anti-money laundering, 4 key parameters should guide your decision-making process.</p>
<p>Firstly, prioritize a comprehensive and extensive database. The effectiveness of your AML or analytical solution relies on accurate risk identification and detection of suspicious activities.</p>
<p>Secondly, accessibility is essential, ensuring that businesses of all sizes can easily integrate the solution. The onboarding process should be user-friendly and the pricing structure should be affordable. This allows businesses to leverage AML services without facing significant barriers or excessive costs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, consider blockchain support. Your chosen provider should be compatible with a wide range of blockchains, including popular ones, enabling comprehensive monitoring and analysis across multiple networks.</p>
<p>Lastly, visualisation and user-friendliness play a vital role in selecting an analytics tool. The system should provide clear and intuitive visualisations of checks and analysis results. This simplifies the interpretation of data and facilitates informed decision-making.</p>
<p>Considering these 4 parameters when choosing analytical and business protection tools for effective AML will help businesses combat money laundering and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
A comparison of the top 7 AML tools
<p>For crypto projects looking to become properly compliant as regards AML it behoves them to do their research into the leading proponents of blockchain investigation. To this end, the top 7 tools in this industry niche are compared below. Both compliance and analytics tools are considered.</p>
Chainalysis (https://www.chainalysis.com)
<p>Probably the most prominent transaction monitoring and investigation tool out there is Chainalysis, used by government and private agencies to trace and understand blockchain activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainalysis uses its Reactor investigation software that seeks to connect the transactions with the entity behind them. In its transaction monitoring product called &ldquo;KYT&rdquo;, Chainalysis puts its identifications through a rigorous process and offers an API to access this data.</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expensive and inaccessible for small companies. Chainalysis is known to be costly, making it unaffordable for small businesses to access their services. The entry barrier for smaller companies is high, limiting their ability to utilize Chainalysis effectively.</p>
<p>Database&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainalysis boasts one of the most extensive and top-tier databases among all AML providers. Their database is known for its completeness, enabling thorough analysis and investigation of transactions.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wide range, including popular blockchains.</p>
<p>Chainalysis offers a broad set of cross-chain visibility, covering a diverse range of blockchains. They support and analyse some of the most popular and widely used blockchains, enhancing their ability to track transactions across different networks.</p>
<p>The possible drawback of the Chainalysis offering is the lack of cross-chain visibility and an inability to view all address connections in EVM-compatible networks.</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness</p>
<p>When it comes to visualisation and user-friendliness, Chainalysis falls within the average range. While their tools and interfaces are functional, they do not offer the highest level of user-friendliness compared to some other AML providers in the market.</p>
<p>It's important to note that Chainalysis is primarily used for transactional AML/CFT checks (&ldquo;KYT&rdquo;) Chainalysis also offers address screening; however it only shows a direct* exposure (meaning that it analyzes only direct transactions of a wallet).&nbsp;</p>
<p>*KYT transaction monitoring shows both direct and indirect exposure, while address verification is only for direct exposure.</p>
<p>Advanced tracing techniques include automatic peel chain detection and cross-chain graphing, all of which provide a comprehensive solution for de-anonymising wallet addresses.</p>
AMLBot (https://amlbot.com)
<p>AMLBot&rsquo;s one-stop solution includes the screening of all a client&rsquo;s incoming and outgoing transactions, plus wallets screening for AML compliance through integration of its API, with developers on hand to make sure the setup is seamless and conduct blockchain investigations in the case of discovered theft.</p>
<p>Add to this the easy signup and user-friendly interface, and you have an AML solution that is accessible for all businesses, including the medium and small enterprises.</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses</p>
<p>AMLBot offers accessibility to a wide range of businesses, including both B2B and B2C sectors. It provides an easy entry process and offers favourable conditions for businesses, making it accessible to all types of organisations.</p>
<p>Database</p>
<p>AMLBot boasts a broad database that integrates top databases from other AML providers, along with its own proprietary database. As a result, it has one of the most comprehensive and deep databases in the market, enabling thorough analysis and investigation.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company supports a wide range of popular blockchains and continuously adds new ones. This ensures that it stays up to date with emerging technologies and can effectively track transactions across various blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness&nbsp;</p>
<p>AMLBot prides itself on being highly user-friendly, providing clear and intuitive data visualisations. Users can easily interpret and analyse the data presented. Additionally, AMLBot has plans to release a new investigation visualisation tool, which will elevate its capabilities to the level of major companies in the industry.</p>
<p>Overall, AMLBot offers accessible entry for businesses, a deep and comprehensive database, support for popular blockchains, and user-friendly interfaces with clear data visualisations.&nbsp;</p>
Crystal (https://crystalblockchain.com)
<p>Crystal offers simple but powerful visualisation tools and intuitive dashboards, helping a business to screen and monitor all transactions for AML compliance. Crystal also boasts that by using its services a crypto business can achieve compliance in only a matter of days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not available for all types of businesses but more accessible than Chainalysis. Crystal offers limited accessibility when compared to some other AML providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Database&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crystal boasts a broad database that covers a wide range of information. Their database provides comprehensive data to support AML investigations and compliance efforts.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crystal supports the most popular blockchains in the industry. This enables users to track transactions and analyze data across multiple blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness</p>
<p>One of the best visualisations with average user-friendliness. Crystal stands out for its exceptional data visualisations, which are considered among the best in the industry. The platform provides visually appealing representations of data, aiding in the analysis and interpretation of information. However, in terms of user-friendliness, Crystal falls within the average range.</p>
<p>The Crystal platform does offer EVM compatibility across multiple networks, although cross-chain visibility is not provided. In addition, real risk scores aren&rsquo;t always accurately reflected.</p>
<p>Overall, Crystal offers a wide-ranging database, supports popular blockchains, and provides exceptional data visualisations. While it may not be as accessible for all types of businesses as some other providers, it offers a valuable toolset for AML investigations and compliance efforts.</p>
OKLink (https://www.oklink.com)&nbsp;

Their platform offers visually appealing representations of data, enhancing the user experience and facilitating the interpretation of information. The user-friendliness of OKLink's interface is rated at a high level, making it easy for users to navigate and utilise their tools effectively.</p>
<p>In summary, OKLink provides accessibility to businesses of all sizes, but their database is shallow, which can impact the accuracy of risk scores. They support a limited number of blockchains, potentially limiting their coverage. However, OKLink excels in data visualisation, offering excellent visual representations, and maintains a high level of user-friendliness on their platform.</p>
Metasleuth (https://metasleuth.io)
<p>The Metasleuth investigative tool is still in the Beta stage and accordingly it is free to the user. In fact it does appear to be a very user-driven tool given that user feedback and requests for added features are very much encouraged.</p>
<p>In addition Metasleuth allows analysis results to be shared with others for further analysis, thereby encouraging the creation of a collaborative community.</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>Metasleuth provides accessibility to businesses of all sizes and types, particularly it is useful for individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>Metasleuth supports 9 major blockchains, allowing users to track and analyse transactions across multiple networks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness&nbsp;</p>
<p>Metasleuth excels in data visualisation, offering one of the best visual representations in the industry. The user-friendliness of Metasleuth's interface is rated at a high level.</p>
<p>In summary, Metasleuth is a great B2C investigation tool. While it supports 9 major blockchains with cross-chain analysis capabilities, it lacks cross-chain visibility and the ability to view all address connections in EVM-compatible networks. However, Metasleuth provides excellent data visualisations and a highly user-friendly platform.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With industry-wide crackdowns from the likes of the SEC and exacting regulatory demands coming into force in Europe, it&rsquo;s never been more crucial to implement proper AML procedures.</p>
<p>The crypto industry has received bad press from various mainstream media sources citing how crypto can be used for all kinds of nefarious practices, money laundering in particular. Be that as it may, cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology, and therefore transactions are inherently transparent, and the trail of a suspected wrongdoer can usually be followed.</p>
<p>However, there are always ways and means that a bad actor, who wishes to circumvent anti-money laundering (AML) processes, can employ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One key aspect of AML compliance is the implementation of transaction monitoring systems, such as Know Your Transaction (KYT). KYT involves real-time monitoring of individual transactions to identify suspicious activities, while the verification of addresses helps assess the legitimacy of wallet addresses involved in cryptocurrency transactions, mitigating risks associated with high-risk entities.</p>
<p>In a September 2022 article, the World Economic Forum (WEF) reported a 1,964% increase in cryptocurrencies that are laundered by way of decentralised finance (DeFi). This percentage was equivalent to around $900 million in laundered value.</p>
<p>To combat this type of activity, blockchain analytics tools and experts have made their niche in the market and are being used by companies in their struggle to become and remain compliant. Companies that provide this kind of service normally also offer the ability for a client to be able to fully investigate blockchain transactions as part of their AML responsibilities.</p>
<p>As the crypto sector seeks clarity in the regulatory environment in order to become a more accepted part of the financial system, complying with AML requirements will surely be a non-negotiable item on this path.</p>
How Does Funds Tracing Work On The Blockchain?
<p>Blockchain analytics is a form of data science focused on the analysis, identification, and clustering of data on the blockchain, which is a digitally distributed public ledger. In other words, blockchain analytics is a method that companies use to investigate blockchain transactions and flag potentially fraudulent or illicit activities.</p>
<p>Blockchain analytics involves scraping data from crypto transactions, analysing wallets, and clustering wallets with similar typologies. Analytics providers can create a database and group wallets with similar typologies into clusters. This is an integral step when discovering both the source and destination of illicit funds. Law enforcement agencies and businesses utilise blockchain analytics to combat fraud, enhance compliance, and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>According to the US-based security website CSO Online a crucial part of the puzzle is identifying various addresses that might be linked to the same wallet, and then finding out who owns it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowing the exact entity behind a batch of addresses can be crucial, and blockchain intelligence companies have ways of finding that. They aggregate information from multiple sources, often using off-chain data to enrich their understanding of transactions. They look at dark web forums, social media posts, and court papers among others.&rdquo;</p>

How to Choose the Right Analytical and Business Protection Tools for Effective AML
<p>When it comes to selecting analytical and business protection tools for effective anti-money laundering, 4 key parameters should guide your decision-making process.</p>
<p>Firstly, prioritize a comprehensive and extensive database. The effectiveness of your AML or analytical solution relies on accurate risk identification and detection of suspicious activities.</p>
<p>Secondly, accessibility is essential, ensuring that businesses of all sizes can easily integrate the solution. The onboarding process should be user-friendly and the pricing structure should be affordable. This allows businesses to leverage AML services without facing significant barriers or excessive costs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, consider blockchain support. Your chosen provider should be compatible with a wide range of blockchains, including popular ones, enabling comprehensive monitoring and analysis across multiple networks.</p>
<p>Lastly, visualisation and user-friendliness play a vital role in selecting an analytics tool. The system should provide clear and intuitive visualisations of checks and analysis results. This simplifies the interpretation of data and facilitates informed decision-making.</p>
<p>Considering these 4 parameters when choosing analytical and business protection tools for effective AML will help businesses combat money laundering and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
A comparison of the top 7 AML tools
<p>For crypto projects looking to become properly compliant as regards AML it behoves them to do their research into the leading proponents of blockchain investigation. To this end, the top 7 tools in this industry niche are compared below. Both compliance and analytics tools are considered.</p>
Chainalysis (https://www.chainalysis.com)
<p>Probably the most prominent transaction monitoring and investigation tool out there is Chainalysis, used by government and private agencies to trace and understand blockchain activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainalysis uses its Reactor investigation software that seeks to connect the transactions with the entity behind them. In its transaction monitoring product called &ldquo;KYT&rdquo;, Chainalysis puts its identifications through a rigorous process and offers an API to access this data.</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expensive and inaccessible for small companies. Chainalysis is known to be costly, making it unaffordable for small businesses to access their services. The entry barrier for smaller companies is high, limiting their ability to utilize Chainalysis effectively.</p>
<p>Database&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainalysis boasts one of the most extensive and top-tier databases among all AML providers. Their database is known for its completeness, enabling thorough analysis and investigation of transactions.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wide range, including popular blockchains.</p>
<p>Chainalysis offers a broad set of cross-chain visibility, covering a diverse range of blockchains. They support and analyse some of the most popular and widely used blockchains, enhancing their ability to track transactions across different networks.</p>
<p>The possible drawback of the Chainalysis offering is the lack of cross-chain visibility and an inability to view all address connections in EVM-compatible networks.</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness</p>
<p>When it comes to visualisation and user-friendliness, Chainalysis falls within the average range. While their tools and interfaces are functional, they do not offer the highest level of user-friendliness compared to some other AML providers in the market.</p>
<p>It's important to note that Chainalysis is primarily used for transactional AML/CFT checks (&ldquo;KYT&rdquo;) Chainalysis also offers address screening; however it only shows a direct* exposure (meaning that it analyzes only direct transactions of a wallet).&nbsp;</p>
<p>*KYT transaction monitoring shows both direct and indirect exposure, while address verification is only for direct exposure.</p>
<p>Advanced tracing techniques include automatic peel chain detection and cross-chain graphing, all of which provide a comprehensive solution for de-anonymising wallet addresses.</p>
AMLBot (https://amlbot.com)
<p>AMLBot&rsquo;s one-stop solution includes the screening of all a client&rsquo;s incoming and outgoing transactions, plus wallets screening for AML compliance through integration of its API, with developers on hand to make sure the setup is seamless and conduct blockchain investigations in the case of discovered theft.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Singapore&rsquo;s leading investment conglomerate, Temasek, has reportedly called off its hunt for cryptocurrency-related investments for now.&nbsp;</p>
Temasek Waiting For Comprehensive Regulatory Framework
<p>Temasek CEO Rohit Sipahimalani has stated that the company is not interested in cryptocurrency investments due to the lack of regulatory clarity. This decision comes after the Singaporean state-owned conglomerate experienced a significant loss of $275 million in the aftermath of the FTX crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a recent interview, Sipahimalani highlighted the "regulatory uncertainty" surrounding the cryptocurrency sector, making it challenging for Temasek to risk a second investment in this ecosystem. However, he mentioned that the company would reconsider its stance if regulators implemented a comprehensive regulatory framework:</p>
<p>He noted,</p>

<p>"If you have the right regulatory framework, and we are comfortable with it, and you have the right investment opportunity, there&rsquo;s no reason for us not to look at it."</p>

MAS Tightens Regulatory Noose
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore is working toward establishing a framework of protection for local participants in the crypto industry. It is coming down hard on digital organizations by preventing their lending and staking services that are offered to retail investors. Additionally, the MAS is also leaning toward ruling that these firms should hold customers' assets in a designated trust by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Temasek is a leading investment giant in Singapore and holds around $500 billion of assets. The company had undertaken its first crypto venture by investing a sizeable $275 million with the FTX crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>
Early Stage Investment In FTX
<p>CEO Sipahimalani explained that the FTX investment was part of Temasek's strategy to explore new disruptive technologies,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Firstly, you got to remember that the FTX investment was a part of our early-stage investment strategy, where we invest in new disruptive technologies to see what&rsquo;s around the corner, so that we can bring that to our portfolio companies and benefit within our ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The CEO also revealed that the company went ahead with the FTX investment as the exchange&nbsp;&ldquo;had good technology, was gaining market share, and showed a willingness to engage with regulators and be licensed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, despite the investment giant&rsquo;s due diligence, its FTX bet did not work out. Temasek lost all of its invested $275 million and also took a hit to its reputation in the market. As a result, the team and senior managers responsible for approving the investment have taken full responsibility and faced reductions in their annual compensations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sipahimalani claimed,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we do early stage investing, there will be some losses, some write-offs, but, importantly for us, the whole portfolio of early stage investments should do well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CEO Sipahimalani explained that the FTX investment was part of Temasek's strategy to explore new disruptive technologies,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Firstly, you got to remember that the FTX investment was a part of our early-stage investment strategy, where we invest in new disruptive technologies to see what&rsquo;s around the corner, so that we can bring that to our portfolio companies and benefit within our ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The CEO also revealed that the company went ahead with the FTX investment as the exchange&nbsp;&ldquo;had good technology, was gaining market share, and showed a willingness to engage with regulators and be licensed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, despite the investment giant&rsquo;s due diligence, its FTX bet did not work out. Temasek lost all of its invested $275 million and also took a hit to its reputation in the market. As a result, the team and senior managers responsible for approving the investment have taken full responsibility and faced reductions in their annual compensations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sipahimalani claimed,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we do early stage investing, there will be some losses, some write-offs, but, importantly for us, the whole portfolio of early stage investments should do well.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Feds have charged a former engineer for the hack and $9 million exploit of a Solana-based cryptocurrency exchange.&nbsp;</p>
IRS And Homeland Security Charge Former Engineer
<p>New York prosecutors have charged a former senior security engineer at an international technology company, Shakeeb Ahmed, in the first-ever criminal case involving an attack on an unnamed decentralized exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The indictment alleges that Ahmed exploited a vulnerability in the exchange's smart contract, resulting in approximately $9 million worth of inflated fees. He then laundered the stolen funds through complex transactions on the blockchain.</p>
<p>IRS Agent Tyler Hatcher said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;As alleged, Mr. Ahmed used his skills as a computer security engineer to steal millions of dollars.&nbsp; He then allegedly tried to hide the stolen funds, but his skills were no match for IRS Criminal Investigation's Cyber Crimes Unit.&nbsp; We, along with our partners at HSI and the Department of Justice, are at the forefront of cyber investigations and will track these fraudsters anywhere they try to hide and hold them accountable.&rdquo;</p>

Manipulated Pricing Data To Inflate Fees
<p>The attack targeted a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange operating on the Solana blockchain. The exchange allowed users to exchange various cryptocurrencies and pay fees to those who provided liquidity. Ahmed&rsquo;s attack involved inserting fake pricing data into the smart contract, causing it to generate inflated fees in the range of $9 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After generating the fees, he engaged in token-swap transactions and bridged the fraud proceeds from the Solana blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain. He also converted the proceeds into Monero, an anonymous cryptocurrency that is hard to trace. Ahmed further attempted to cover his tracks by using overseas cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
Tracked Down Through Online Activities
<p>Following the attack, Ahmed approached the exchange, offering to return the stolen funds for a bounty fee of $1.5 million on the condition that the crypto exchange promised not to approach law enforcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, his actions did not go unnoticed by authorities. Investigators tracked his online activities, which included searches for information on the attack, criminal liability, and potential escape from the United States to evade charges.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Special Agent in Charge Chad Plantz said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Financial crime strikes at the core of our national and economic banking security.&nbsp; With an attack of this magnitude, it&rsquo;s crucial we ensure continued consumer confidence in our financial system&hellip;It&rsquo;s cases like these that demonstrate HSI&rsquo;s commitment and ability to work with a coalition of the willing to dismantle these complicated and technical fraud schemes and identify those responsible regardless of where they operate.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Vanguard Group, which manages $7.2 trillion in assets, has significantly ramped up its investments in the bitcoin mining sector, with its total stake now exceeding $560 million.</p>
Vanguards bitcoin mining investments
<p>The company has been snapping up shares of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, two major players in the Bitcoin mining space. Vanguard now holds 17.5 million shares of Marathon Digital, a 60% increase from its previous position. Given Marathon's current share price of $16.03, this puts the value of Vanguard's investment at a cool $280.5 million.</p>
<p>But Vanguard didn't stop there. It also boosted its holdings in Riot Blockchain, a Colorado-based Bitcoin miner. Vanguard now owns 17.9 million shares of Riot, an 18% increase from its previous stake. This additional investment is worth over $281 million, pushing Vanguard's total investment in Bitcoin mining firms to a whopping $560 million.</p>
An institutional change of heart
<p>This is all quite surprising given Vanguard's stance just two years ago. Back then, the company had been very sceptical about the long-term investment potential of cryptocurrencies. However, much water has since flowed under the bridge and now Vanguard has become the largest shareholder of Marathon Digital.</p>
<p>Not just Vanguard, but the broader financial industry, seems to be warming up to cryptocurrencies. Last week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described Bitcoin as an "international asset&rdquo;, and &ldquo;digitised gold". BlackRock, which manages $9.5 trillion in assets, recently applied to the SEC for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. It's also the second-largest investor in Marathon Digital.</p>
Bitcoin mining big business
<p>Bitcoin mining, once a niche activity, has evolved into a big business. Today's miners are large operations that use server farms and consume a lot of energy. In return for their efforts in verifying blockchain transactions, they're rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins. It's a high-stakes game, and it seems Vanguard is betting big on its players.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Space and Time (SxT), the decentralized data warehouse, has released a data query product that harnesses AI. Powered by Open AI&rsquo;s GPT-4, Prompt-to-SQL allows developers to generate queries using natural language prompts. It&rsquo;s the latest example of blockchain companies utilizing artificial intelligence, two technologies whose synergies are strong.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Space and Time is to make blockchain and off-chain data available to developers on demand, regardless of which network they&rsquo;re working on. Its Proof of SQL technology enables data to be delivered with cryptographic proof that queries are accurate and tamperproof. Prompt-to-SQL slots into this, making it easier for researchers, analysts, and developers to query data with no coding required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Decentralized Data on Demand
<p>With Microsoft funding to its name, Space and Time comes with a certain pedigree. Its technology, which makes use of zero-knowledge proofs, is already being provisioned to dapp developers building across multiple chains. The release of Prompt-to-SQL is a major milestone for SxT, not only in enhancing its core product, but in terms of the new user groups it supports.</p>
<p>As SxT CTO Scott Dykstra explains, &ldquo;AI-powered SQL is a game-changer for businesses that run a lean analytics team. Leveraging OpenAI decreases time-to-value for building data pipelines, analytics dashboards or simply writing SQL.&rdquo; The Space and Time co-founder highlights the benefit of being able to generate SQL or Python scripts using prompts and to ask natural-language questions about data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Made for Enterprise
<p>Initial applications for SxT&rsquo;s tech have primarily been for crypto-native developers creating consumer dapps. The real value of its Proof of SQL system, however, lies in its ability to open blockchain up to enterprises.</p>
<p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language designed for managing data in relational database systems. By making it available within an onchain environment, Space and Time has made blockchain more palatable to enterprises, who can create apps that pull in data from a broad range of sources, not just onchain feeds.</p>
<p>Houston is the name of the chatbot Space and Time has created for fielding data queries. Any time a user enters a prompt, the chatbot will process it and deliver an SQL query. The resultant output can be published to APIs, dashboards and AI/ML models in a single click.</p>
<p>According to ChainML CEO Ron Bodkin, whose company developed Houston, the bot provides &ldquo;industry-leading AI functionality to users, including technical documentation support, code generation, self-service analytics, research, and seamless navigation powered by a conversational interface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smart developers have long been aware of GPT-4&rsquo;s ability to help with their homework, providing capable code that can save time and brain power. The ability to plug artificial intelligence into SxT&rsquo;s Proof of SQL service, however, supports far more sophisticated use cases. By doing little more than entering text prompts, developers can access on- and off-chain data quickly and in a variety of convenient format</p>
<p>AI chatbots are commonly envisaged in the context of providing customer support and helping consumers with low-level tasks such as holiday bookings. With Prompt-to-SQL, Space and Time has shown it&rsquo;s equally adept at helping tech-savvy users perform more complex tasks.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The UK&rsquo;s FCA has shut down 26 cryptocurrency ATMs this year following a coordinated investigation with other law enforcement agencies. </p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s financial regulator, the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), shut down 26 of the 34 crypto ATMs it inspected since the start of the year.</p>
<p>Following a coordinated investigation with several other law enforcement agencies using powers under the country&rsquo;s money laundering regulations, the agency successfully &ldquo;disrupted&rdquo; 26 ATM sites it visited and inspected since the start of 2023.</p>
FCA: Comply with Regulations or Shut Down
<p>At the beginning of the year, the FCA warned all illegal ATM operators to comply with its regulations or dismantle their operations.</p>
<p>After issuing the injunction, the regulator inspected 36 crypto ATM sites in Exeter, Nottingham, and Sheffield, which it found operating without FCA registration.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">#Crypto ATMs operating without FCA registration are illegal. The action we&rsquo;ve taken over the past few months and wider work shows that we will act to stop illegal activity. #cryptocurrency https://t.co/KnMhiKAt21</p>
&mdash; Financial Conduct Authority (@TheFCA) May 5, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, spoke out against the operation of all cryptocurrency ATMs and warned users of the dangers of using unregistered ATMs. He said:</p>

<p>If you use a crypto ATM in the UK, you are using a machine that is operating illegally, and you may be handing your money over to criminals.</p>

<p>Smart further said users of illegal ATMs &ldquo;will not be protected&rdquo; by the UK government or ATM operators. He concluded by saying:</p>

<p>We will continue to warn the public and take appropriate enforcement action against unregistered crypto ATM operators.</p>

UK Takes a Tough Stance on Crypto ATMs
<p>Cryptocurrency ATMs gained popularity over recent years and allow users to sell crypto such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in exchange for cash.</p>
<p>The FCA believes illegal crypto ATMs pose a high risk and may be used to facilitate illegal activities such as money laundering. As such, the FCA said it was working with the National Economic Crime Centre in March to develop and coordinate a plan to act against ATMs operating illegally.</p>
<p>Mark Stewart, the Executive Director of Enforcement and Market oversight at the FCA, said at the time:</p>

<p>Crypto ATMs operating without FCA registration are illegal and, as today shows, we will take action to stop this. This operation, alongside last month&rsquo;s action in Leeds, sends a clear message that we will continue to identify and disrupt unregistered crypto businesses in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto products are not currently regulated, and they are high-risk. You should be prepared to lose all your money if you invest in them.</p>

<p>The regulator issued several warnings to unregistered ATM providers and ordered them to cease operations immediately, adding failure to comply would result in legal proceedings against them.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Libertify, creator of an automated risk assessment and portfolio management tool for crypto investors, said it has won the chance to enter the grand finale of this year&rsquo;s Hong Kong Fintech Fast Track, having beaten several other startups to the nomination at a semi-final event in Paris.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The startup describes itself as a &ldquo;wealth tech company&rdquo; and is led by its founder and CEO Steve Rosenblum, aimed at investors who want to protect their portfolios from the extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify protects investors by simplifying and automating the trading experience. Users simply connect their exchange account or decentralized crypto wallet to Libertify&rsquo;s app to take advantage of its &ldquo;crypto seatbelt&rdquo;. It allows them to benefit from a unique risk management tool that works by automatically diversifying their portfolio among volatile and stable assets, based on the user&rsquo;s level of risk tolerance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Libertify, crypto investors can assess and adjust how much of each of their assets should be exposed to market risk, while leaving the remainder in a stablecoin asset to protect against price declines. Libertify adjusts the exposure of the user&rsquo;s portfolio according to their risk profile, dynamically allocating assets based on the daily market risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app does this in a clever way, exchanging user&rsquo;s assets for an equivalent token. In the case of Bitcoin, instead of holding BTC the user will hold L-Bitcoin. In a blog post on Medium, Rosenblum explains how this works, saying these assets take into consideration how the market is changing each day and how much risk the investor is willing to take. &ldquo;This makes the market more stable by 25%, meaning investors are less likely to give up, which makes them more aware of their finances and helps them reach their goal of financial freedom,&rdquo; Rosenblum said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors can take advantage of the market whenever conditions become more favorable. Libertify&rsquo;s AI-powered alerts will notify users whenever it identifies an opportunity to make a profitable trade, or determines that action should be taken to protect against risk. For each alert, Libertify will also recommend the optimum sizing of each trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The promise of Libertify&rsquo;s app has already helped it to raise &euro;3.5 million in financing, and now the company is hoping to gain further traction with its participation in the 2023 Hong Kong Fintech Fast Track. The event, organized by Invest Hong Kong, a government department that promotes the territory as a leading business location, is now in its fourth year. It provides startups with the opportunity to scale their business and fast-track their success with access to prospective clients and strategic investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify was named as the winner of the Paris leg of the Hong Kong Fintech Fast Track semi-final stage, and will be joined in the grand finale in November by 11 other startups. At the final event, startups will be able to meet with representatives of more than 80 &ldquo;corporate and investor champions&rdquo; and explore business opportunities with them. The corporate and investor champions come from some of Hong Kong&rsquo;s most established and prestigious financial firms, including AMTD, AIA, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Standard Chartered, as well as technology providers such as Tencent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify&rsquo;s risk management app is already available for many of the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, and will soon expand beyond crypto to traditional financial markets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>ConsenSys has announced the launch of its layer-2 network Linea, as the Ethereum ecosystem welcomed yet another scaling solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linea incorporates zero-knowledge cryptography and has produced considerable scaling milestones during testing, achieving faster throughput and significantly lower transaction costs compared to the main Ethereum network.&nbsp;</p>
A New Scaling Solution&nbsp;
<p>Linea is ConsenSys&rsquo;s new layer-2 scaling solution that enables developers to build or migrate decentralized applications (dApps) for Ethereum. The layer-2 network utilizes zero-knowledge proofs and is EVM-compliant, meaning applications on the network can seamlessly interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Zero-knowledge (zk) cryptography helps facilitate greater scalability and improved transaction speeds, thus helping address network congestion and high gas fees on Ethereum. The rollup network implemented by Linea is commonly known as zkEVM, thanks to its compliance with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).&nbsp;</p>
A Highly Successful Testing Phase&nbsp;
<p>The Linea zkEVM has been launched after a lengthy and highly successful testing phase after it was revealed that the ConsenSys team had been working on the rollup for the past four years. The testing phase began when ConsenSys released a public testnet on the 28th of March, enabling the stress-testing of the new layer-2 technology. The testnet phase saw around 5.5 million unique wallets conduct 46 million transactions. ConsenSys noted several improvements when it came to Linea&rsquo;s performance, transaction costs, and user experience throughout its testing phase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ConsenSys has claimed that the fees on the network will be 15 times lower than those prevailing on the Ethereum main network. The alpha phase began on the 11th of July, with over 100 partners involved. Joseph Lubin, the founder and CEO of ConsenSys, talked about the number of layer-2 Ethereum scaling solutions and protocols and highlighted their importance when it came to driving the development of Web3 functionality and applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the Merge to Proof of Stake and the broad traction of the rollup-centric roadmap, Ethereum L2s are set to play a crucial role in making great advances in scalability and usability.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The announcement also highlights several decentralized finance (DeFi) applications migrating to Linea to take advantage of its fast finality, security from the Ethereum mainnet, and capital-efficient bridge. The network also offers users low gas fees, high throughput, and low latency, all of which are critical to power blockchain gaming, non-fungible tokens, and social applications. App developers can deploy their projects and applications on Linea&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; network as early as Friday. However, general users will have to wait until next week to access the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The launch of the Alpha mainnet will use several safeguards to protect decentralized applications, users, and the network itself. Measures include allowing only launch partners to execute calls over the network for the first week. ConsenSys plans to further open up the network during ETHCC, which is scheduled to take place in France from the 17th of July. It also plans to hold a bug bounty and monitor performance before opening up the network to end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ConsenSys also announced the launch of its Linea Ecosystem Investment Alliance (EIA). The alliance will see over 30 venture capitalist firms give advisory assistance and lend capital to ecosystem builders. Ethereum layer-2 solutions have become a major talking point in 2023, with Polygon also taking its zkEVM network public in March. Starknet has also highlighted plans to increase the throughput on its network this year. Starknet founder Eli Ben-Sasson is the pioneer behind zk-proofs.&nbsp;</p>
Key Features&nbsp;
<p>Linea has seen the introduction of several features and upgrades with its alpha mainnet phase. These include a dynamic fee mechanism and a new outer-proof system. The alpha mainnet phase also introduces a feature called &ldquo;batch conflation.&rdquo; This feature optimizes the number of layer-2 transactions and blocks that can fit into a layer-1 batch. This allows it to reduce fixed costs typically associated with layer-1 and help provide a cost-effective transaction experience. These upgrades will help Linea offer transaction costs that are far lower than Ethereum&rsquo;s main layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, MetaMask will also offer support for Linea soon, allowing users to access the network through the MetaMask Portfolio and Bridge, Swap, and Buy features. The MetaMask integration can be expected in the next few weeks and allow wallet users to interact with decentralized applications and protocols based on Linea.</p>

App developers can deploy their projects and applications on Linea&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; network as early as Friday. However, general users will have to wait until next week to access the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The launch of the Alpha mainnet will use several safeguards to protect decentralized applications, users, and the network itself. Measures include allowing only launch partners to execute calls over the network for the first week. ConsenSys plans to further open up the network during ETHCC, which is scheduled to take place in France from the 17th of July. It also plans to hold a bug bounty and monitor performance before opening up the network to end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ConsenSys also announced the launch of its Linea Ecosystem Investment Alliance (EIA). The alliance will see over 30 venture capitalist firms give advisory assistance and lend capital to ecosystem builders. Ethereum layer-2 solutions have become a major talking point in 2023, with Polygon also taking its zkEVM network public in March. Starknet has also highlighted plans to increase the throughput on its network this year. Starknet founder Eli Ben-Sasson is the pioneer behind zk-proofs.&nbsp;</p>
Key Features&nbsp;
<p>Linea has seen the introduction of several features and upgrades with its alpha mainnet phase. These include a dynamic fee mechanism and a new outer-proof system. The alpha mainnet phase also introduces a feature called &ldquo;batch conflation.&rdquo; This feature optimizes the number of layer-2 transactions and blocks that can fit into a layer-1 batch. This allows it to reduce fixed costs typically associated with layer-1 and help provide a cost-effective transaction experience. These upgrades will help Linea offer transaction costs that are far lower than Ethereum&rsquo;s main layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, MetaMask will also offer support for Linea soon, allowing users to access the network through the MetaMask Portfolio and Bridge, Swap, and Buy features. The MetaMask integration can be expected in the next few weeks and allow wallet users to interact with decentralized applications and protocols based on Linea.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX recently launched its claims portal, allowing users from around the world to file a claim.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the portal stayed live for around an hour before going offline for unknown reasons, leaving users in the lurch.&nbsp;</p>
Claims Portal Goes Live
<p>According to users on social media, the FTX claims portal went live on the 11th of July, with the page stating that users have until the 29th of September to submit their respective claims.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except as otherwise provided herein, all persons and entities, (including, without limitation, individuals, partnerships, corporations, joint ventures, and trusts) that assert a Customer Claim against any of the Debtors which arose on or prior to the Petition Date must file a proof of such claim so that it is actually received by Kroll Restructuring Administration LLC, the Debtors&rsquo; noticing and claims agent (the &ldquo;Claims Agent&rdquo;), on or before 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the 29th of September, 2023 (the &ldquo;Customer Bar Date&rdquo;).&rdquo;</p>

<p>The claims portal allowed customers of the bankrupt exchange to access their account information, following which they could file a petition which would be included in FTX&rsquo;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The claims portal is for those customers who had accounts with FTX.com, FTX.us, Blockfolio, FTX EU, FTX JP, and cryptocurrency exchange Liquid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to instructions available on the claims portal when it was online, customers would be redirected to the Kroll Restructuring Administration platform, where they would have to confirm their balances and submit an electronic proof of claim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be directed to the Kroll Restructuring Administration platform to confirm your balances as of the Petition Date and, if necessary, submit an electronic proof of claim.&rdquo;</p>

And Then Goes Offline&nbsp;
<p>However, barely an hour after it went online, the claims portal went offline for unknown reasons, leaving users dumbfounded. Before it went offline, the claims portal stated that users would be able to access their account balances as they were on the 11th of November, which was the day the FTX exchange filed for bankruptcy. However, users still have the option of filing their proof-of-claim through US mail and Kroll&rsquo;s online customer form. At the time of writing this report, the claims portal is still offline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The debtors&rsquo; party to the FTX bankruptcy case had announced in June that they were planning to launch a claims portal to handle customer claims and stated they would announce when the portal goes live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The FTX Debtors&rsquo; &ldquo;Customer Bar Date&rdquo; has been set for the 29th of September, 2023, at 4 p.m. ET. To streamline the process for customers, the FTX Debtors are finalizing an online claims portal at https://claims.ftx.com. FTX Debtors will announce when the portal is active.&rdquo;</p>

The FTX Collapse&nbsp;
<p>FTX was one of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges and suffered a spectacular collapse in November 2022, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The exchange suffered a crippling liquidity crisis at the time, as fearful customers pulled an estimated $6 billion from the exchange amidst concerns that their assets were at risk. The news that the FTX exchange and its sister concern Alameda Research had been sharing their assets in a bid to boost their balance sheets only served to hasten the collapse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bankruptcy proceedings are currently ongoing in a Delaware court. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s trial for allegations of fraud is set to begin in October, with the former CEO set to be tried on 8 criminal charges for now. FTX is estimated to owe its creditors over $3 billion, with prosecutors alleging that Bankman-Fried co-mingled customer assets and misled investors about FTX&rsquo;s risk management strategies and practices.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Aaave community members are poised to vote on whether to finally deploy gho ($GHO) on the Ethereum chain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Aave is a lending and borrowing platform which recently introduced its own native algorithmic stablecoin, gho. An stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by utilizing algorithmic mechanisms. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, stablecoins aim to minimize price fluctuations and provide a stable store of value. In the case of gho, an algorithm determines its supply and demand ratio.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Gho will be pegged to the US dollar and its supply will be managed by the Aave DAO as well as its interest and risk parameters. Userds mint gho by using assets they have supplied on to the protocol as collateral. Gho holders will then continue earning interest on their assets. The stablecoin has been on the Goerli testnet and has so far encountered no problems.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a governance post last June 6, Aave Companies released its proposal to deploy the stablecoin on Ethereum&rsquo;s mainnet. With its deployment, Aave expects stablecoin borrowing on the Aave Protocol to become &ldquo;more competitive and generate additional revenue for the Aave DAO by providing to the DAO treasury 100% of the interest payments made on GHO borrows.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Gho will be introduced via &ldquo;facilitators&rdquo;: the V3 Ethereum Pool Facilitator and the FlashMinter Facilitator. The former allows for gho lending against their collateral while the latter functions akin to a flash loan, which are loans not requiring any collateral. These facilitators can be other protocols or entities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Aave has recently launched its V3, which further optimized the yield generation and borrowing power of users&rsquo; assets. Apart from its plans to deploy gho to Ethereum, it is also eyeing the deployment of its V3 to Coinbase&rsquo;s Base network. Aave has been the leading lending platform with over $5.6 billion in total value locked (TVL), per DefiLlama. The $5b is split between its V2 ($3.9 billion) and V3 ($1.95 billion).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Rodeo Finance, an Arbitrum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, suffered a significant blow, losing $1.53 million in Ethereum due to a code vulnerability exploitation in its Oracle. This is the second exploit that the DeFi platform has endured in a span of a week, underscoring the escalating security issues facing such protocols.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The attacker manipulated a key function to siphon funds from Rodeo's interest-bearing USDC pool, taking advantage of a vulnerability that enabled them to force a swap. Initially, 290 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) was taken, before being bridged to the Ethereum network. The infiltrator used oracle manipulation to inflate their ETH value by swapping it for unshETH, a DeFi project aimed at promoting validator decentralization.</p>
Underlying Vulnerabilities Exploited
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The oracle manipulation permitted the conversion of WETH to unshETH at a rate not reflecting fair market value. The exploiter then seized the opportunity to return to the Ethereum network, further draining 230 WETH from the Rodeo vault. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Before returning to the Ethereum network, they sent 150 ETH into Tornado Cash, effectively masking their tracks. The remaining balance of 371 ETH was left in the wallet. Although 520 WETH was extracted from the Rodeo vault, only 472 WETH is counted as losses, due to the attacker initially funding the wallet with 50 ETH to facilitate the exploit. </p>
Repeating Exploits
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This episode of Rodeo Finance&rsquo;s exploitation comes shortly after the protocol suffered another security breach just last week, where a vulnerability in their mintProtocolReserves function led to a loss of approximately $89,000. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Rodeo Finance isn't alone in facing these security issues. The Arbitrum network in 2023 alone has witnessed a total of 21 recorded incidents of some form of exploit, leading to a collective loss of over $20 million. The recent Rodeo Finance exploit, causing a $1.53 million loss, is the fifth-largest recorded on Aribitrum this year.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">After the exploit, the total value locked (TVL) in the DeFi protocol, initially at $20 million, fell below $500. Notably, the price of the native token of the DeFi protocol plummeted by over 53% in the last 24 hours.</p>
