XRP is in the red today, losing grip of its recent gains as the bears act on its price. The bulls had sustained the price momentum driving XRP to $0.4688 on May 19. The asset traded within this range till May 24, when the bears dropped it to a closing price of $0.454. But today, XRP&#8217;s price has gradually declined to the $0.451 level as the bears continue to exert pressure on its price. More Bearish Trend For XRP XRP is in a downtrend today, forming a second consecutive red candle on the daily price chart with lower lows. The asset trades below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a short-term-bearish sentiment. The 50-day SMA indicates XRP&#8217;s average price over a specific period. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Green Today – What’s The Energy Behind The Glow? Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 46.71 in the neutral zone and descending, further confirming a bearish sentiment for XRP. The RSI has two critical regions the overbought region and the oversold region. RSI values between 70 and 30 are neutral.  Given the descending line of XRP&#8217;s RSI, the asset is entering the oversold region from which a trend reversal is imminent.  XRP&#8217;s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line, suggesting a bullish sentiment. However, the MACD displays negative values, and its histogram bars hint at a bearish reversal. The MACD identifies the trend direction of an asset and is often used to place trades. Currently, it displays a tentative sell signal in the market today. But XRP is trading above the 200-day SMA, suggesting a bullish trend in the long run.  The altcoin is trading at the $0.4504 support level as the bears seek to push it down. Bearish pressure at the $0.46591 resistance level pushed XRP into a downtrend.  A further decline will see XRP return to the $0.44446 support level and push it to the oversold region. XRP will likely record more price drops in the short term.  However, since it is still trading above its 200-day SMA, a long-term bullish sentiment, the bulls will rally again once they regain control of its price. XRP Updates Might Influence Price Action In Long term Ripple Labs&#8217; ongoing legal case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission is likely one of the reasons behind XRP&#8217;s price downturn. However, as the Ripple CEO said, the case may likely conclude soon.
