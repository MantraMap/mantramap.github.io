			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The floor price of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection has dropped to the lowest in the last 20 months.&nbsp;</p>
BAYC Drops Below 30 ETH
<p>The forecast does not look good for NFTs, as the most popular collection ever, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), has sunk to a 20-month low. According to a report from the data analytics platform, CoinGecko, the floor price of the NFT collection from the iconic Yuga Labs drastically fell to 27.4 ETH, which is around $53,000 on Sunday evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NFT marketplace OpenSea claimed that the collection&rsquo;s trading volume has dropped by a significant 38% in just 24 hours. It did recover from the bottom, however, slightly, settling around 29.5 ETH at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p>
50% Decrease Since April&nbsp;
<p>The floor price is the lowest value a seller is willing to accept for an NFT and is a crucial indicator of the NFT&rsquo;s demand and popularity. For the BAYC collection, the floor price has experienced a 50% decrease since April of this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, it was being traded at 64 ETH, equivalent to approximately $126,000. However, across the month, pseudonymous collector Franklin sold 27 NFTs from his BAYC collection, which must have compounded the lack of interest further, dropping the floor price to a five-month low of 55.6 ETH, or about $110,000.</p>
Collectors Questioning BAYC Investment
<p>This is tough news for the collection, which has almost always seen high demand. In fact, the last time its floor price was below 30 ETH was back in October 2021. However, soon after, the NFT boom hit, and BAYC&rsquo;s floor price skyrocketed to new all-time highs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bored Ape Yacht Club, a popular and highly sought-after NFT collection known for its unique pixelated ape characters, had garnered significant attention and fetched substantial prices in the past, its highest being 153.7 ETH (approximately $430,000) in April 2022.&nbsp; However, the recent drop in floor prices has caught many collectors off guard, leaving them questioning the future of the collection and the broader NFT market.&nbsp;</p>
Many Challenges For NFT Market
<p>Other than the overall bearish market, experts also believe that the initial frenzy and hype surrounding NFTs have subsided, leading to a decline in demand and, subsequently, lower prices. According to OpenSea, this could be a result of the long crypto winter that pulled down the price of Ethereum. As a result, this has affected the price of the NFT collections like BAYC, which are powered by Ethereum. Other collections affected by the crypto winter are&nbsp; MoonBirds, Azuki, Doodles, and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the BAYC collection itself has seen a surge in supply that has put additional pressure on the prices, leading to the significant drop witnessed recently.</p>
<p>Additionally, the increased regulatory scrutiny toward NFTs and the broader cryptocurrency industry has introduced an element of uncertainty, causing some investors to pull back and leading to a decline in prices.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Still above $30,000, bitcoin looks to be gathering strength to make that all-important break of the $31,000 level.</p>
<p>The crypto market is in calmer waters currently as it looks to bitcoin to make that definitive move past $31,000. Given the sheer scale of the resistance above, bitcoin will need to gather the help of all the bulls in order to be successful.</p>
Momentum still gathering
<p>One of its main weapons to surpass the resistance will be momentum, and short term Stochastic RSIs are resetting to the bottom as bitcoin traverses sideways.</p>
<p>The daily timeframe RSI would be a major help, and this is now passing the halfway point on its way down. Once at the bottom and the signal lines cross up this can be a major sign that bitcoin has the impetus to make the break.</p>
Bullish chart patterns
<p>Having started this particular attack on resistance on June 15, the price reached a high on June 23 before traversing sideways, forming a bull flag as it went. The measured move for the flag is $36,000, the next real level of resistance after $31,000.</p>
<p>Another, even more bullish chart pattern has reached completion. This is a potential cup and handle pattern that started to form in early June 2022. The cup was completed on April 14 this year, and now the handle has also been completed. The measured move for this would be a massive move to $46,000.</p>
Institutional buying just around the corner
<p>If one takes into account the potential for enormous institutional buying should the Blackrock Spot Bitcoin ETF, and others be approved, then the second of these technical targets wouldn&rsquo;t be out of bitcoin&rsquo;s reach.</p>
<p>In spite of impending regulation for cryptocurrencies and all sorts of log jams being thrust into the sector by traditional financial agencies that now see crypto as a real threat to fiat currencies, the mood in the crypto sector is certainly a lot better than it was back in the depths of crypto winter back in November last year.</p>
<p>Regulation should have the effect of bringing in much larger capital into the space, and although this is also likely to bring in a lot of the unfairness against the average investor and bias towards the institutions just as it is in the traditional financial system, it is to be hoped that the market and changing technology will bring about a more level playing field.</p>
<p>Even if a rejection for bitcoin happens now, instead of the widely expected breakthrough, this is only likely to be a temporary setback. Just a quick glance at how banks and fiat currencies are doing right now is enough to solidify that scenario.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Members of the Azuki decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) have initiated a Snapshot proposal to hold the project&rsquo;s founder accountable over allegations of misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The accusations arise from the release of Azuki&rsquo;s Elementals collection, which launched last month, with buyers complaining that the NFTs are extremely similar to the original set, sold in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
A Frustrated Community&nbsp;
<p>The latest collection, called Elementals, could only be minted by users who held the original Azuki collection and a side project called BEANZ. The new set of NFTs, which represented half a suite of a collection of 20,000 profile pictures (PFPs), sold out in less than 15 minutes. The sale was able to raise 20,000 ETH ($39.4 million) for Chiru Labs, the LA-based startup that is behind the NFT collection, having a mint price of 2 ETH ($3900). The original Azuki collection had a floor price of 6.3 ETH ($12,400).&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after the sale, some buyers began complaining that the new collection was too similar to the original Azuki PFPs sold in 2022. The Snapshot proposal states,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have provided support to Azuki during its highs and lows. We have contributed to building a sub-community and promoting the brand in various ways, mostly on social media such as Redbook, Twitter, and in our discord. Despite our efforts, we have only been given a similar profile picture to that of the original Azuki holders and nothing more. The team is blatantly scamming us with empathy checks and promises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If passed, the DAO proposal would look for a lawyer to initiate a suit against the pseudo-anonymous co-founder of Azuki, Zagabond. It would also seek a refund, with all funds directed towards the project&rsquo;s growth and supporting research required for the lawsuit. Zagabond is the pseudo-anonymous founder of Chiru Labs, Azuki&rsquo;s parent company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DAO claims that the Azuki team has done nothing but issue the community members a profile picture similar to that of the original Azuki holders and nothing more and is convinced that the team is scamming them. The DAO members are overwhelmingly in favor of filing a lawsuit against Zagabond, retrieving a refund of 20,000 ETH, and redirecting it towards the project&rsquo;s growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Azuki Dao hires a lawyer and files a lawsuit against Zagabond for rugging multiple projects. Azuki Dao retrieves a refund of 20,000E from the team and allocates it to the Dao to promote the growth of the entire Azuki community and provide rewards and incentives for artists, content creators, and builders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zagabond had admitted in 2022 that he had abandoned three NFT projects, Tendies, CryptoPhunks, and CryptoZunks. He had claimed at the time that he was not happy with the development of the projects in question, an admission that had generated significant controversy at the time. So far, voting data has revealed that over 60% of the DAO members have voted in favor of the proposal.</p>
Not An Official Organization&nbsp;
<p>However, it must also be noted that the Azuki DAO is not an official organization associated with the project. The group claims that it was formed to support the project, with the token being utilized for voting minted just over the weekend and airdropped to Azuki holders. Twitter user @tytaninc highlighted the same, stating that the group could have malicious intent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s more info on where the original tweet about the AzukiDAO came from. Most Azuki holders have never heard of this group and assume it&rsquo;s either fake or a group with malicious intent. The token for voting was minted two days ago, sooo there&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;</p>

Azuki Team Addresses Backlash&nbsp;
<p>The Azuki team addressed the backlash on Twitter, stating that it had missed the mark with the collection and that the mint process was extremely hectic. The team tweeted on their official handle,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time, we missed the mark,&rdquo; and acknowledging that &ldquo;the [profile picture NFTs] feel similar and, even worse, dilutive to Azuki. Azuki&rsquo;s vision is to build a decentralized brand. Doing so requires great communication and execution, both of which were lacking with the Elementals sale. We know that we lost a piece of trust today, but nothing gets us more motivated to make things right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The CEO of NFT gaming studio MyMetaverse, Simon Kertonegoro also criticized the project, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is absolutely the project&rsquo;s responsibility to create real products that can generate real revenue from outside markets. We need to normalize crypto and NFT projects as having real business models. They need to serve the wider market.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>McDermott Will &amp; Emery, the law firm representing Voyager&rsquo;s committee of unsecured creditors, has sent the group a staggering bill of over $5 million for the work it has done between the months of March and May.</p>
<p>The latest bill reinforces the perception in crypto circles that legal firms are raking in the money at the expense of the creditors they are representing.</p>
A Hefty Legal Bill
<p>The bill for legal services provided by the law firm was revealed in a legal filing submitted to the United States Bankruptcy Court of New York&rsquo;s Southern District on the 3rd of July, 2022. The latest bill brings the total compensation charged to the group of creditors to over $16 million, significantly above the $11.2 million initially budgeted as part of the restructuring process. The creditors have so far paid $8.9 million in legal fees to the firm. According to the filing, the blended hourly rate for all timekeepers stands at $1026.76.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest areas of billing from attorneys of McDermott Will &amp; Emery for the stipulated months in question include $1 million billed for nearly 917 hours of work on plan and disclosure settlement. This includes discussing sale options with debtors, meeting potential buyers, and examining objections that other stakeholders have presented. In previous fee periods, significant work was carried out on plan and disclosure settlement during a potential sale of Voyager assets to FTX. However, this deal collapsed when FTX itself filed for bankruptcy. This legal bill comes over, and above a $1.1 million bill that Voyager paid to the law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis for work it completed when representing the exchange.</p>
Law Firms Make Merry
<p>The market downturn has led to many crypto firms going bankrupt, something that has been highly profitable for law firms. Voyager itself had filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after the firm revealed it had considerable exposure to Three Arrows Capital, the collapsed crypto hedge fund. Voyager then tried to broker deals with several entities, including FTX and Binance. However, the FTX deal fell through after the Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The FTX bankruptcy was the largest bankruptcy in the crypto industry thus far.</p>
<p>Following these developments, Binance backed out of the potential deal in April 2023, citing a hostile regulatory climate prevailing in the United States, thanks to the position taken on crypto by current United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved a liquidation plan for Voyager which would see its customers being reimbursed $1.33 billion in digital assets.</p>
<p>The entire legal process has resulted in Voyager having to spend a fortune on legal fees. Last week, reports emerged that Kirkland &amp; Ellis, the law firm representing Voyager, charged the company $1.1 million for work it had completed in April of this year.</p>
One Man&rsquo;s Loss Is Another&rsquo;s Gain
<p>The crypto winter, which started with the de-pegging of Terra&rsquo;s algorithmic stablecoin UST and the collapse of its entire ecosystem, set off a domino effect in the crypto space. As a result of the collapse, the contagion spread, leading to the collapse of several prominent crypto entities. This list includes Vauld, Celsius, Hodlnaut, BlockFi, Voyager, and FTX, entities that were considered leading lights in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Lawyers and legal firms have taken full advantage, making a significant amount from the beleaguered firms in the form of legal fees. In December 2022, lawyers representing bankrupt crypto lender Celsius, one of the first casualties of the crypto winter, billed the firm nearly $53 million in legal fees for the period beginning since the firm filed for bankruptcy until October of the same year. Celsius had filed for Chapter 11 in Mid-July, 2022.</p>
<p>FTX, the biggest casualty of the crypto winter, has run up a legal bill of over $200 million since the time it filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. It is also worth noting that FTX going bankrupt impacted over 130 entities that were affiliated with the exchange.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>McDermott Will &amp; Emery, the law firm representing Voyager&rsquo;s committee of unsecured creditors, has sent the group a staggering bill of over $5 million for the work it has done between the months of March and May.</p>
<p>The latest bill reinforces the perception in crypto circles that legal firms are raking in the money at the expense of the creditors they are representing.</p>
A Hefty Legal Bill
<p>The bill for legal services provided by the law firm was revealed in a legal filing submitted to the United States Bankruptcy Court of New York&rsquo;s Southern District on the 3rd of July, 2022. The latest bill brings the total compensation charged to the group of creditors to over $16 million, significantly above the $11.2 million initially budgeted as part of the restructuring process. The creditors have so far paid $8.9 million in legal fees to the firm. According to the filing, the blended hourly rate for all timekeepers stands at $1026.76.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest areas of billing from attorneys of McDermott Will &amp; Emery for the stipulated months in question include $1 million billed for nearly 917 hours of work on plan and disclosure settlement. This includes discussing sale options with debtors, meeting potential buyers, and examining objections that other stakeholders have presented. In previous fee periods, significant work was carried out on plan and disclosure settlement during a potential sale of Voyager assets to FTX. However, this deal collapsed when FTX itself filed for bankruptcy. This legal bill comes over, and above a $1.1 million bill that Voyager paid to the law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis for work it completed when representing the exchange.</p>
Law Firms Make Merry
<p>The market downturn has led to many crypto firms going bankrupt, something that has been highly profitable for law firms. Voyager itself had filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after the firm revealed it had considerable exposure to Three Arrows Capital, the collapsed crypto hedge fund. Voyager then tried to broker deals with several entities, including FTX and Binance. However, the FTX deal fell through after the Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The FTX bankruptcy was the largest bankruptcy in the crypto industry thus far.</p>
<p>Following these developments, Binance backed out of the potential deal in April 2023, citing a hostile regulatory climate prevailing in the United States, thanks to the position taken on crypto by current United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved a liquidation plan for Voyager which would see its customers being reimbursed $1.33 billion in digital assets.</p>
<p>The entire legal process has resulted in Voyager having to spend a fortune on legal fees. Last week, reports emerged that Kirkland &amp; Ellis, the law firm representing Voyager, charged the company $1.1 million for work it had completed in April of this year.</p>
One Man&rsquo;s Loss Is Another&rsquo;s Gain
<p>The crypto winter, which started with the de-pegging of Terra&rsquo;s algorithmic stablecoin UST and the collapse of its entire ecosystem, set off a domino effect in the crypto space. As a result of the collapse, the contagion spread, leading to the collapse of several prominent crypto entities. This list includes Vauld, Celsius, Hodlnaut, BlockFi, Voyager, and FTX, entities that were considered leading lights in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Lawyers and legal firms have taken full advantage, making a significant amount from the beleaguered firms in the form of legal fees. In December 2022, lawyers representing bankrupt crypto lender Celsius, one of the first casualties of the crypto winter, billed the firm nearly $53 million in legal fees for the period beginning since the firm filed for bankruptcy until October of the same year. Celsius had filed for Chapter 11 in Mid-July, 2022.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Decoding the Poly Network Exploit: Key Lessons in Smart Contract Security</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The DeFi world was rocked recently as Poly Network, a decentralized finance protocol that facilitates asset transfers across various blockchains, fell prey to its second major hack. This incident is a stark reminder of the critical role of smart contract security in the rapidly evolving DeFi and crypto industry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On July 2nd, a breach affected Poly Network, with the exploit potentially impacting as many as 57 different asset types across 10 blockchains. According to security analysts, hackers allegedly leveraged a vulnerability in the smart contract system that allowed thgem to mint an unlimited amount of tokens. An estimated $42 billion worth of tokens were minted, although only about $5 million have been reportedly cashed out.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Poly Network isn't alone in its security woes. The DeFi and Web3 space has been marred by a series of similar exploits, with millions of dollars worth of digital assets lost to hackers. Many of these attacks, like the one against Poly Network, have leveraged vulnerabilities in smart contract systems. These programmable agreements, which execute transactions automatically when predetermined conditions are met, are a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem but also a prime target for cybercriminals.</p>
Severity of the Exploit: Understanding the Consequences
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Poly Network hack underscores the severity and potential consequences of smart contract vulnerabilities. In the immediate aftermath, the total value locked on Poly Network plunged from $277 million to $176 million, a clear indication of the loss in user confidence. The ripple effects of such an incident can be wide-ranging, from an erosion of trust in the protocol to a broader negative impact on the DeFi market. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Such a hack also highlights the risks involved in the relatively new field of cross-chain transactions. As more DeFi platforms aim to enable seamless transactions across various blockchains, ensuring the security of these cross-chain protocols is a challenge that cannot be overlooked.</p>
Analyzing the Exploit: Unpacking the Technical Details
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The recent Poly Network exploit underpins the role of effective security measures in ensuring the integrity of blockchain networks, especially given the sophistication and complexity of the attack vectors involved. By forging proofs and potentially compromising private keys or executing a multi-signature service attack, the hacker was able to manipulate the LockProxy cross-chain bridge contract.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To begin with, the attacker used the lock function to lock a small amount of Lever Token. The subsequent transaction, viewed on the Poly Network explorer, indicated that the action had been validated through the relay chain. However, when the hacker moved to the BNB chain and initiated withdrawal operations via the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function, the withdrawal quantity did not match the originally locked amount. Further examination of the relay chain network did not show any records of this transaction.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At this point, two possibilities were considered: the leakage of signatures or the modification of keepers, entities responsible for signing user withdrawals. Controlling a keeper would allow the attacker to initiate withdrawals with forged signatures, leading to unauthorized transactions. Analyzing the attacker's use of the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function indicated that keepers had not been modified, directing the suspicion towards compromised keeper private keys or a multi-signature service attack.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Following the trail, three keepers were identified as potential compromise victims, underlining a significant security risk. If proven true, this would mean the attacker could initiate withdrawals and create seemingly valid transactions, bypassing the protocols' security measures.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Such an exploit demonstrates the need for advanced security strategies, including enhanced private key management and robust signature verification processes. If overlooked, these vulnerabilities can provide potential entry points for attackers to exploit and wreak havoc on blockchain networks, as illustrated by the Poly Network case. With the DeFi and crypto industry still at an early phase of developmental maturity, it's vital for protocol developers to continuously learn from such incidents, fortifying their systems against potential breaches, and upholding user trust.</p>
Addressing Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Smart contract vulnerabilities can be mitigated, albeit not entirely eliminated. An effective approach involves a combination of preventive measures and reactive strategies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Preventive measures include rigorous testing of smart contracts before deployment and regular audits by external security firms. These audits can help identify and rectify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Code review and bug bounty programs, where programmers are rewarded for discovering and reporting software bugs, can also be instrumental in fortifying smart contract security.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">From a reactive standpoint, developers can use upgradeable smart contracts that allow for the modification of the contract's code post-deployment. This feature can be crucial for responding swiftly and effectively to discovered vulnerabilities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Moving forward, it's clear that smart contract security must be at the forefront of DeFi protocol development. As the case of Poly Network demonstrates, the stakes are high, and the fallout from a breach can be devastating. By embracing rigorous security measures and continually learning from past incidents, the DeFi industry can help mitigate these risks and foster a more secure and resilient ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Bitcoin (BTC) and its hard forks are captivating the market, with Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) soaring. However, amidst this frenzy, InQubeta, an AI altcoin, has piqued the curiosity of investors and is being selected as the go-to investment.</p>
<p class="s3">In this article, we will explain what makes InQubeta stand out in the crypto landscape. Join us as we delve into Bitcoin hard forks and explore why smart investors are doubling down on the AI token InQubeta.</p>
InQubeta (QUBE): The token not to miss out on
<p class="s3">Defying all expectations, smart investors are doubling down on InQubeta, despite the surge in the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV). The commitment to investment in its utility token, QUBE, is largely responsible for it being an AI altcoin and for its revolutionary idea of solving a critical problem in the industry.</p>
<p class="s3">InQubeta is the world's first crowdfunding platform built for AI businesses to raise capital as well as for investors to acquire interests in promising projects. Its marketplace will allow investors to invest in AI startups by purchasing fractionalized investment opportunities.</p>
<p class="s3">Its fractional investment model reinforced investors' commitment towards investment as its innovative idea allows ownership of fractions of AI startups and eliminates investment limits. In addition, the gains that come from being an investor and holder further bolster confidence in the project. For instance, as one of the fastest-growing industries, investors stand to gain ridiculously high profits by investing early in promising AI projects. Additionally, the coin is expected to benefit from the increasing adoption of AI, which means it will soar in the coming months, making it a more compelling investment.</p>
<p class="s3">To participate in the presale, you can click on the link below. It is currently in stage 1, and a token costs $0.00875.</p>
<p></p>
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) experiences a significant surge during Bitcoin&rsquo;s rally
<p class="s3">Bitcoin Cash (BCH) came about from a hard fork in the blockchain, aimed at increasing the block size limit to make it more scalable by enabling cheaper and faster transactions. Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s (BCH) price movement has been largely unimpressive this year, as it hovered for the most part below $146. </p>
<p class="s3">However, a price upturn on June 21 saw Bitcoin Cash trade above $200, although it has been experiencing a slight decline in price. Its rally came during Bitcoin&rsquo;s (BTC) rally, showing its dependency. However, despite Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s uptrends, investors are still keen on investing in or diversifying parts of their investments in InQubeta because of its immense growth potential.</p>
Bitcoin SV (BSV) trades in tandem with Bitcoin (BTC) as it rallies alongside
<p class="s3">Bitcoin SV (BSV) emerged after a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash blockchain, making it one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard forks even if not directly.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Bitcoin (BTC) and its hard forks are captivating the market, with Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) soaring. However, amidst this frenzy, InQubeta, an AI altcoin, has piqued the curiosity of investors and is being selected as the go-to investment.</p>
<p class="s3">In this article, we will explain what makes InQubeta stand out in the crypto landscape. Join us as we delve into Bitcoin hard forks and explore why smart investors are doubling down on the AI token InQubeta.</p>
InQubeta (QUBE): The token not to miss out on
<p class="s3">Defying all expectations, smart investors are doubling down on InQubeta, despite the surge in the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV). The commitment to investment in its utility token, QUBE, is largely responsible for it being an AI altcoin and for its revolutionary idea of solving a critical problem in the industry.</p>
<p class="s3">InQubeta is the world's first crowdfunding platform built for AI businesses to raise capital as well as for investors to acquire interests in promising projects. Its marketplace will allow investors to invest in AI startups by purchasing fractionalized investment opportunities.</p>
<p class="s3">Its fractional investment model reinforced investors' commitment towards investment as its innovative idea allows ownership of fractions of AI startups and eliminates investment limits. In addition, the gains that come from being an investor and holder further bolster confidence in the project. For instance, as one of the fastest-growing industries, investors stand to gain ridiculously high profits by investing early in promising AI projects. Additionally, the coin is expected to benefit from the increasing adoption of AI, which means it will soar in the coming months, making it a more compelling investment.</p>

<p></p>
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) experiences a significant surge during Bitcoin&rsquo;s rally
<p class="s3">Bitcoin Cash (BCH) came about from a hard fork in the blockchain, aimed at increasing the block size limit to make it more scalable by enabling cheaper and faster transactions. Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s (BCH) price movement has been largely unimpressive this year, as it hovered for the most part below $146. </p>
<p class="s3">However, a price upturn on June 21 saw Bitcoin Cash trade above $200, although it has been experiencing a slight decline in price. Its rally came during Bitcoin&rsquo;s (BTC) rally, showing its dependency. However, despite Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s uptrends, investors are still keen on investing in or diversifying parts of their investments in InQubeta because of its immense growth potential.</p>
Bitcoin SV (BSV) trades in tandem with Bitcoin (BTC) as it rallies alongside
<p class="s3">Bitcoin SV (BSV) emerged after a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash blockchain, making it one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard forks even if not directly. Bitcoin SV, which stands for &ldquo;Bitcoin Satoshi Vision,&rdquo; sought to restore what is considered the original vision of Bitcoin as outlined by its creator.</p>
<p class="s3">As Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard fork, Bitcoin SV often mirrors its price movement, which is currently on a rally. After Bitcoin SV&rsquo;s bearish descent from mid-May to the middle of June, Bitcoin SV regained bullish momentum and has been on a price swing. Despite its upswing, investors are still doubling down on InQubeta.</p>
Conclusion
<p class="s3">Despite the surge of Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard forks like Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash, InQubeta has emerged as a shining star and captured the attention of investors. Its trailblazing idea that combines AI with the limitless potential of blockchain technology, as well as exponential returns on investment, has led investors to double down.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to a recent report by the FATF, more than half of all UN member countries have still not implemented the Travel Rule.</p>
<p>As of June 2023, as reported by the FATF, more than half of the UN member countries have failed to enforce the Travel Rule. According to the Financial Action Task Force, the rule is necessary in order to close a loophole in crypto assets that might be exploited by money launderers and those funding terrorism.</p>
<p>According to an article in the Business Times Online, the Travel Rule is recommendation #16 of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) which lays down that all crypto companies must &ldquo;screen, record and communicate the information of all users of their platform&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This would have the effect of destroying any anonymity for crypto users, with the exception of those who are transacting in amounts less than $1,000.</p>
What is the FATF?
<p>The FATF is a 39-member body that gives financial recommendations to all UN nations. Given that it is an unelected body, financial decisions in each country are the responsibility of that country and the recommendations can be implemented or not by each country.</p>
<p>However, should any country choose not to implement all of the recommendations then it comes under &ldquo;increased monitoring&rdquo; of its financial activities.</p>
AML and terrorist financing
<p>According to the FATF, at the heart of all the recommendations are a desire to root out any money laundering or terrorist financing that might be taking place in a country&rsquo;s financial system. This purportedly gives it the right and full authority to investigate how money is dealt with everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The FATF is of the opinion that crypto assets can be used for the aforementioned illegal activities and therefore wants all countries to enforce the Travel Rule in order to negate any of these activities.</p>
Many jurisdictions ignore recommendations
<p>The fact that nearly three quarters of jurisdictions across the world have complied only partially or not at all with the FATF recommendations perhaps says much for a feeling that this non-elected agency is maybe interfering too much in the financial affairs of sovereign countries.</p>
<p>Also, given that the FATF is closely associated with the IMF and the World Bank, it might be seen as having a more &lsquo;Western&rsquo; bias that may not be as acceptable to certain jurisdictions across the world.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>South Africa&rsquo;s financial regulator has ordered crypto exchanges in the country to apply for licenses before the end of the year to continue operating. </p>
<p>Bloomberg reports South Africa&rsquo;s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) said cryptocurrency exchanges operating within the country must apply for licenses before year end to continue their operations.</p>
<p>FSCA Commissioner Unathi Kamlana said in an interview that the authority received about 20 applications since opening licenses a few weeks ago and expects more to be submitted before the deadline on November 20.</p>
<p>Kamlana said the FSCA plans to take &ldquo;enforcement action&rdquo; against exchanges that continue to operate without a license after the deadline, adding that firms could be closed down or fined. The Commissioner said:</p>

<p>There is potentially serious harm to financial customers when using crypto products, and therefore it makes sense for us to introduce the regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Time will tell the effectiveness of our measures, and we will continue to work together with the industry to refine and make changes where and if necessary.</p>

<p>Exchanges which operate in South Africa include Binance, the Digital Currency Group-owned Luno, and the Pantera Capital-backed VALR. All these exchanges need to secure licenses if they wish to continue their operations.</p>
Regulators Step Up Crypto Oversight
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s tightened crypto oversight comes after a string of bankruptcies in 2022 caused the market to spiral. The collapse of FTX was the catalyst which heightened scrutiny of crypto firms and exchanges.</p>
<p>EU regulators formally signed its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) into law on May 31, with measures set to take force in 2024. European legislators also formally enacted another law on anti-money laundering, which mandates crypto providers to authenticate their customers&rsquo; identities when conducting wire transfers.</p>
<p>The UK also voted to pass into law its Financial Services and Markets bill, which will see the country on its way to dealing with crypto as a &ldquo;regulated activity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) retraced part of its recent pullback early in the Asian session as the pair moved back above the 31000 figure after trading as low as the 30870.63 area, representing a test of a downside price objective related to recent selling pressure around the 31333 and 31097 areas.&nbsp; The recent sell-off to the 29417.14 area represented a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; This depreciation occurred after BTC/USD rallied higher to the 30277 area, its strongest print in several trading sessions, and increased the possibility of a test of the 28604.83 area.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In an attempt to combat fraud, Belarus is looking to put an end to peer-to-peer crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;Crypto-Friendly&rdquo; Belarus Cracking Down?&nbsp;
<p>In an effort to combat fraud and tighten its grip on cryptocurrency transactions, the Belarusian government is contemplating a ban on peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trading. The proposed crackdown aims to protect consumers and prevent illegal activities within the cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P2P crypto trading refers to the exchange of cryptocurrency between two individuals directly, without the involvement of a third party like a crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belarus, known for its relatively lenient stance on cryptocurrency, embraced blockchain technology and even legalized cryptocurrency mining and exchange activities in 2017. It has been called one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the world, as it offers a tax exemption for individuals and businesses conducting crypto transactions. A year ago, President Lukashenko even signed a decree to ratify the free circulation of cryptocurrencies in the country.&nbsp;</p>
Trying To Curb Money Laundering
<p>The country&rsquo;s Ministry of Internal Affairs released a statement on Sunday revealing that malicious actors were using the P2P crypto services to transact dirty funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statement read,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since the beginning of the year, employees of the cybercrime counteraction units have stopped the activities of 27 citizens who provide illegal cryptocurrency exchange services. Their total illegal income amounted to almost 22 million rubles ($8.7 million).&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, the proposed ban seeks to restrict the direct exchange of cryptocurrencies between individuals without any intermediary platform. By eliminating P2P trading, Belarus hopes to curb fraudulent schemes and money laundering attempts that have been prevalent in the country's crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The notice also explained that citizens would be able to conduct such financial transactions only through the registered exchanges in order to promote transparency and government control.&nbsp;</p>
How Will Ban Affect Belarus&rsquo;s Crypto Landscape?&nbsp;
<p>The decision comes amidst rising instances of fraud within the country's cryptocurrency sector. Scammers have taken advantage of the anonymous nature of P2P transactions to carry out various fraudulent schemes, defrauding unsuspecting individuals of their hard-earned money.</p>
<p>Although critics have argued that a blanket ban on P2P crypto trading may stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the industry, it is interesting to note that the country has recently renewed its crypto tax exemption law to be in effect till 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the proposed ban on P2P crypto trading in Belarus is still in the discussion stage. The government is expected to consult with industry experts and stakeholders to carefully weigh the potential consequences before finalizing any regulatory measures.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Vara Network, the Layer1 built using the Substrate framework, has released details of its latest testnet. A raft of new improvements have been specified that will make the forthcoming testnet smoother and equipped with subtle fixes that should simplify program creation and dapp deployment.</p>
<p>The majority, if not all, of the upgrades to Vara&rsquo;s stable testnet will be beyond the comprehension of the average user, but developers with experience of working in Rust will grasp the benefits they confer. Vara has listed the most important upgrades to its testnet, but the full list, including bug fixes, is extensive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Vara Steps Things Up a Notch
<p>The optimization of Vara&rsquo;s testnet is a crucial stage that will support a much larger goal: to launch a highly scalable Layer1 network that can host multitudes of dapps, with no trade-offs in terms of fees, security, or throughput. To achieve this, there&rsquo;s much work to be done on the testnet, where bugs are to be squashed, stability ensured, and new features added.</p>
<p>Most of the improvements being incorporated into the latest build of Vara&rsquo;s stable testnet concern smart contracts. The team developing Vara Network have been largely focused on incorporating features that make it easier to run programs and to debug them when issues are encountered. Chief among these is the introduction of automatic replies from programs.</p>
<p>As the Vara team explains in a blog post outlining the testnet changes, &ldquo;With this new update, your active program will always send a reply to an incoming message, even if its execution encounters a hiccup.&rdquo; Devs working on the Vara testnet are also now relieved of adding in boilerplate code over and over thanks to a new autogenerated metahash function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Small Changes That Make a Big Difference
<p>Many of the upgrades to Vara&rsquo;s new testnet may seem slight, but combined they make for a significant improvement to the current iteration. There&rsquo;s a new reply deposit feature, enabling devs to provide a gas deposit from the current message to handle a future reply message. The async send functions also benefit from a new deposit argument, which Vara is billing &ldquo;a game-changing improvement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The status code retrieval in functions that handle replies or signals has also been improved and it&rsquo;s now much easier to restart paused programs thanks to new extrinsics for program reactivation. The msg::origin function has been removed from gstd for security purposes, as has the obsolete delay argument which is no longer contained within function signatures related to sending replies.</p>
<p>One of the biggest improvements to Vara&rsquo;s latest testnet is the enhancement to the metadata file format supported. It will now accommodate multiple languages aside from Rust. Finally, the Vara team has made numerous bug fixes that should improve the running of dapps and contracts deployed on its testnet. All told, these changes should bring the testnet to a state much closer to that resembling the mainnet, whose deployment looms closer.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the Winklevoss twins has demanded a payment of $1.47 billion from Digital Currency Group (DCG)&rsquo;s Barry Silbert.&nbsp;</p>
Winklevoss Calls Out Silbert
<p>In an interesting turn of events, Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, has made a final offer demanding a payment of $1.47 billion from DCG&rsquo;s CEO Barry Silbert. He also threatened the latter with legal action if the final payment offer was not met by the deadline of July 6, 4 PM ET. Winklevoss claimed that the legal action would include a detailed report of Silbert&rsquo;s personal liability in hiding Genesis&rsquo;s insolvency issues and filing a Turnover Motion to force the immediate payment of the $630 million payment owed to creditors.&nbsp;</p>
DCG&rsquo;s Credit Struggles
<p>When Genesis&rsquo;s parent company DCG got caught up in the credit crisis of 2022, the latter entered into negotiations with creditors. However, the company did miss a $630 million payment to Genesis in May, which has now led to Cameron Winklevoss penning the open letter to Silbert, with the final offer of a $1.47 compensation. This substantial amount reflects the magnitude of the alleged damages and underlines the seriousness of the accusations against DCG and Silbert.</p>
&ldquo;Game Over&rdquo;: Winklevoss
<p>Winklevoss posted the open letter on Twitter on Monday, claiming that Silbert had never had any intentions of resolving the matter with the creditors in mind ever since the company had halted its withdrawals. He claimed that instead of working on a proper resolution to return their funds to the Earn users, Silbert and his team have dedicated the last eight months to buy time, to &ldquo;raise money and stiff creditors and Earn users again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I write to inform you that your games are over. In addition to dragging out a resolution, they have ballooned professional fees to over $100 million, all of which have gone to lawyers and advisors at the expense of creditors and Earn users. Enough is enough.&rdquo;</p>

$1.2B Owed To Earn Customers
<p>The demand comes amidst allegations of fraud involving Barry Silbert, founder of DCG, and has sparked widespread speculation within the cryptocurrency community. Gemini had previously lent customer funds to Genesis under the Earn program. Winklevoss claimed that more than 232,000 Earn users have over $1.2 billion of assets trapped in Genesis. Other than this amount, DCG also owes a further $2.1 billion to creditors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Winklevoss closed out the letter by writing,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've seen a lot of bad behavior from you and your colleagues over the last 9 months, but perhaps the most disturbing part is something you said to me this Fall that you're a victim in all of this. It takes a special kind of person to owe $3.3 billion dollars to hundreds of thousands of people and believe, or at least pretend to believe, that they are some kind of victim.&rdquo;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the Winklevoss twins has demanded a payment of $1.47 billion from Digital Currency Group (DCG)&rsquo;s Barry Silbert.&nbsp;</p>
Winklevoss Calls Out Silbert
<p>In an interesting turn of events, Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, has made a final offer demanding a payment of $1.47 billion from DCG&rsquo;s CEO Barry Silbert. He also threatened the latter with legal action if the final payment offer was not met by the deadline of July 6, 4 PM ET. Winklevoss claimed that the legal action would include a detailed report of Silbert&rsquo;s personal liability in hiding Genesis&rsquo;s insolvency issues and filing a Turnover Motion to force the immediate payment of the $630 million payment owed to creditors.&nbsp;</p>
DCG&rsquo;s Credit Struggles
<p>When Genesis&rsquo;s parent company DCG got caught up in the credit crisis of 2022, the latter entered into negotiations with creditors. However, the company did miss a $630 million payment to Genesis in May, which has now led to Cameron Winklevoss penning the open letter to Silbert, with the final offer of a $1.47 compensation. This substantial amount reflects the magnitude of the alleged damages and underlines the seriousness of the accusations against DCG and Silbert.</p>
&ldquo;Game Over&rdquo;: Winklevoss
<p>Winklevoss posted the open letter on Twitter on Monday, claiming that Silbert had never had any intentions of resolving the matter with the creditors in mind ever since the company had halted its withdrawals. He claimed that instead of working on a proper resolution to return their funds to the Earn users, Silbert and his team have dedicated the last eight months to buy time, to &ldquo;raise money and stiff creditors and Earn users again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I write to inform you that your games are over. In addition to dragging out a resolution, they have ballooned professional fees to over $100 million, all of which have gone to lawyers and advisors at the expense of creditors and Earn users. Enough is enough.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Thailand has followed in Singapore&rsquo;s footsteps by banning crypto exchanges from offering lending and staking services to retail investors. </p>
<p>Thailand becomes the second Southeast Asian nation to ban crypto staking activities for retail investors.</p>
Thailand Bans Lending and Staking Services
<p>The Thai SEC announced it is banning crypto exchanges from offering lending and staking services. On Monday, the securities agency issued new rules for digital asset service providers aiming to improve investor protection.</p>
<p>According to the Thai SEC:</p>

<p>It is forbidden to advertise or persuade the general public or do any other act in the manner of supporting the deposit staking &amp; lending service.</p>

<p>The regulator explained the ban applies to &ldquo;depository services that offer returns to depositors and lenders,&rdquo; meaning exchanges are outright banned from offering such services. The SEC&rsquo;s new rules will take effect on July 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, the SEC also introduced a mandatory trading risk disclaimer which exchanges must make clearly visible to customers.</p>
<p>The risk disclaimer reads:</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are high risk. Please study and understand the risks of cryptocurrencies thoroughly, because you may lose your entire investment.</p>

<p>Further, the Thai SEC requires exchange operators to ensure users acknowledge trading risks before consenting to use such services. Finally, the SEC introduced investor suitability assessments to determine how much users may invest in crypto.</p>
Singapore Bans Lending and Staking for Retail Investors
<p>The Thai SEC&rsquo;s ban follows an announcement from Singapore&rsquo;s Monetary Authority (MAS) which also seeks to ban such services for retail investors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulator said in a statement on Monday that it determined staking activities are unsuitable for the retail public given the &ldquo;extremely high risk and speculative nature&rdquo; of those activities.</p>
<p>The MAS said:</p>

<p>Regulations alone cannot protect consumers from all losses, given the extremely high risk and speculative nature of digital payment token trading.</p>

<p>In addition to the ban, the MAS will require crypto exchanges to safeguard customer assets in a trust before the end of the year.</p>

<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today announced new requirements for Digital Payment Token (DPT) service providers to safekeep customer assets under a statutory trust before the end of the year. This will mitigate the risk of loss or misuse of customers&rsquo; assets, and facilitate the recovery of customers&rsquo; assets in the event of a DPT service provider&rsquo;s insolvency.</p>

<p>Thailand and Singapore&rsquo;s new investor protection rules come after the 2022 crypto lending crisis caused several firms to go bankrupt, costing investors billions of dollars.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The UK Financial Conduct Authority has taken the big four banks to task because they have set their savings rates too low, to the detriment of customers.</p>
A paltry return on savings
<p>When the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has to publicly shame the big UK banks because their pitiful easy-access savings rates for customers are between 0.7% to 1.35%, then you get an idea of how badly the banks are treating their clients.</p>
<p>At a time when the Bank of England has only recently raised the base rate again from 4.5% to 5% there is absolutely no excuse for the banks to continue to give their customers such a paltry return on their cash.</p>
<p>HSBC, Natwest, Barclays and Lloyds are the big 4 banks in question here, and according to Reuters, the top brass from these banks have been invited to the FCA on Thursday in order to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted a person familiar with the FCA&rsquo;s position who said:</p>

<p>"We do think there is more value that can be provided to consumers, we are not happy with some of the lower savings rates we see, and we want banks to be supporting customers&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;. and people to be able to make informed choices,"</p>

<p>With UK inflation staying at 8.7% for the second month in a row, consumers are up against it. Food inflation is around 30% and with the average 5-year fixed mortgage rate above 6% the UK economy is starting to scream.</p>
<p>In this kind of environment, for the banks to be just looking out for themselves is grossly wrong. These are the banks that are judged as too big to fail, and will get bailed out/in if/when they get to the point of collapse.</p>
<p>The question has to be asked: Why would anyone with any extra money put it into a bank? The official inflation rate of 8.5% is well over 10% if you take into account how items included in inflation are manipulated over the years.</p>
<p>Therefore, to receive around 1% for savings that are losing around 10% a year does not make the slightest bit of sense. The only way the banks are able to get away with this is because people are just not informed as to how they can best deploy their savings.</p>
An alternative
<p>On that note, Bitcoin rose more than 100% since the beginning of the year. There is no guarantee that this will continue, and there is a lot of volatility in what is still a very tiny asset class.</p>
<p>However, the investor has to make a choice between a fiat currency that will go to zero with 100% certainty, and Bitcoin, which is the scarcest and most secure asset in the world. Anybody who might think to make this choice should educate themselves fully on the matter.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Open Network (TON) has announced the release of an on-chain encrypted messaging feature, allowing private messages between TON users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, users could post on-chain messages. However, these were unencrypted and available to the public.&nbsp;</p>
Encrypted Transaction Messages&nbsp;
<p>The announcement was made on the 3rd of July by the TON Foundation. The TON blockchain network was forked from code that was created by the team behind the Telegram instant messaging app. However, the project was abandoned in 2020, but not before the team open-sourced TON&rsquo;s code. This allowed others to pick up from where the original team left off. The current network was created by the TON Foundation, a non-profit organization that seeks to promote TON among developers and users. According to the TON Foundation, the network gives users far greater scalability and transaction throughput than other options available in the Web3 ecosystem while also offering a high level of decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TON has always allowed users to send personalized messages when conducting transactions or sending NFTs to each other. However, these messages were completely public. With the introduction of the new feature, users can encrypt the messages end-to-end, meaning only the intended recipient will be able to view the message. The feature is a welcome addition to TON&rsquo;s already highly secure platform. Furthermore, to increase the availability of the new service, the charge to send an encrypted message through the TON blockchain has been set at 0.006 Toncoin (TON) per transaction. Core developer at the TON Foundation, Anatoly Makosov, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When sending Toncoin, Jettons, or NFTs on TON, you have always been able to include a text for the recipient such as &lsquo;for coffee&rsquo; or &lsquo;happy birthday,&rsquo; thereby personalizing the interaction. Now this popular feature [...] is available with full encryption.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further added&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even in the event of an apocalypse and the failure of conventional messenger servers, you will retain the ability to send messages via the decentralized TON blockchain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In such a scenario, TON could serve as a reliable and secure method of communication.&nbsp;</p>
TON Working Towards Accelerating Ecosystem&nbsp;
<p>The TON Foundation has been at the heart of rebuilding the TON ecosystem and attracting Web 3.0 developers and builders. In April 2022, TON users collectively donated $1 billion to the foundation and its efforts to advance the TON ecosystem. The donations in question were made over a ten-day window starting on the 7th of April, 2022. In total, around 527 million TON, equalling just over $1 billion, were donated by users, primarily TON whales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2023, the TON Foundation enlisted the blockchain data platform Chainalysis with plans to utilize its Crypto Incident Response Service to provide round-the-clock support in the event of a hack or exploit. By partnering with Chainalysys, TON can access a robust and proven way to combat hacks or other unauthorized intrusions.</p>
