			            <description><![CDATA[BCH is the undesputed top performer within the top 100 crypto assets for the past week, following a triple-digit price surge.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot can change in the cryptocurrency industry within a week, and the waves indeed fluctuated in the past seven days. The market rejoiced recently as several multinational financial giants filed for a Bitcoin Spot ETF, but the tides could be turning now, according to a WSJ report from Friday.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s unpack.</p>
<p>BlackRock shook the crypto market two weeks ago when it filed an application to release a BTC Spot ETF in the States, which would make it the first such product greenlighted by the SEC.</p>
<p>Being the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, its actions had immediate consequences as ARK Invest <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cathie-woods-ark-amends-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-to-copy-blackrock/" data-wpel-link="internal">changed</a> its own application to copy that of BlackRock, while Fidelity reapplied less than a week later.</p>
<p>That also impacted the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price trajectory as BTC skyrocketed from $26,500 last week to roughly $31,000 earlier today. However, a Wall Street Journal report emerged on Friday claiming that the SEC found the recent filings &#8220;inadequate,&#8221; which prompted speculation that they could be rejected, similar to all previous ones.</p>
<p>BTC reacted immediately with a sharp price dump that drove it south by $1,500. As a result, the asset charted a 10-day low of $29,500 (on Bitstamp). It managed to bounce off rather quickly and reclaimed some ground. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s still uncertain at around $30,000.</p>
<p>This price decline erased all of BTC&#8217;s weekly gains. In comparison, numerous altcoins have charted notable 7-day price increases, such as ETC (15%), SOL (15%), Aave (18%), XLM (24%), and Bitcoin SV (36%).</p>
<p>The one that stands out the most, though, is Bitcoin Cash. The BTC hard fork has soared by over 110% on a weekly scale and earlier today charted a 14-month high above $320 amid <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-cash-trading-volume-on-upbit-skyrockets-as-bch-soars-120-weekly/" data-wpel-link="internal">massive trading volumes</a> on smaller markets, such as the South Korean one.</p>

<h2>This Week’s Crypto Headlines You Can’t Miss</h2>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Dumps Below $30K as SEC Warns That Recent BTC Spot ETF Filings Are ‘Inadequate’ (WSJ)</strong>. As mentioned above, the WSJ <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dumps-below-30k-as-sec-warns-that-recent-btc-spot-etf-filings-are-inadequate-wsj/" data-wpel-link="internal">cited</a> people familiar with the matter who claimed that the SEC believes the most recent BTC Spot ETF filings could have been &#8220;inadequate.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Fidelity Refiles Bitcoin Spot ETF Application After BlackRock</strong>. But before that, Fidelity Digital Assets <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fidelity-refiles-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-after-blackrock/" data-wpel-link="internal">followed</a> BlackRock&#8217;s example and reapplied for a Bitcoin Spot ETF less than a week after the world&#8217;s largest asset manager.</p>
<p><strong>FTT Explodes 35% on FTX Revival Idea</strong>. Just several months after the once-prominent crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy, the new CEO hinted that FTX could be revived at some point. As a result, the native token <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftt-explodes-35-on-ftx-revival-idea/" data-wpel-link="internal">jumped</a> to a 2-month high.</p>
<p><strong>MicroStrategy Buys 12,333 BTC for $350 Million at $28K Per Bitcoin</strong>. Perhaps fueled by BlackRock&#8217;s filing, the largest corporate holder of BTC decided to double down by <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-buys-12333-btc-for-350-million-at-28k-per-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">allocating</a> another $350 million and accumulating 12,333 BTC.</p>
<p><strong>Robinhood Cuts Staff Again as Trading Volume and Engagement Dwindle</strong>. The Vlad Tenev-spearheaded trading company continues to struggle as it <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/robinhood-cuts-staff-again-as-trading-volume-and-engagement-dwindle/" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> the lay-off of another 150 employees (7%). This is the second round of cut-offs for the Wall Street-traded firm in less than a year.</p>
<p><strong>Swiss Prosecutors Freeze $26M Worth of Do Kwon Assets Following his Prison Sentence (Report)</strong>. After being sentenced to four months in prison in Montenegro, Kwon&#8217;s situation has reportedly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/swiss-prosecutors-freeze-26m-worth-of-do-kwon-assets-following-his-prison-sentence-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">worsened</a> as $26 million worth of his assets were frozen</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Shortly after the news broke, BTC dropped to a 10-day low under $30,000.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission has reportedly issued a warning that the recent Bitcoin Spot ETF filings by financial giants, such as Fidelity and BlackRock, could lack comprehensive details.</p>
<p>The agency has a long history of rejecting such products in the States, and its current war on crypto is likely not helping.</p>
<ul>
<li>BlackRock made the headlines a few weeks ago when it filed to launch a Bitcoin Spot ETF in the States, which, if approved, would be the first such product in the country.</li>
<li>The company&#8217;s record is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrocks-etf-success-rate-with-the-sec-is-575-to-1-what-about-its-bitcoin-application/" data-wpel-link="internal">quite spectacular</a>, with only one proposed ETF rejected by the SEC almost a decade ago.</li>
<li>The move was regarded as a hugely positive development for the industry that could open the doors for others as well, and Fidelity <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fidelity-refiles-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-after-blackrock/" data-wpel-link="internal">reapplied</a> shortly after.</li>
<li>However, a new report by the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, claims that the US securities regulator is not keen on approving either of these applications.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-says-spot-bitcoin-etf-filings-are-inadequate-390336e8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to the WSJ, the SEC has informed Nasdaq and CBOE that the applications filed on behalf of BlackRock and Fidelity are not &#8220;sufficiently clear and comprehensive.&#8221;</li>
<li>Given that the agency has used that justification in the past to reject multiple Bitcoin Spot ETF applications, the news was followed by a sharp price drop from BTC.</li>
<li>The cryptocurrency flirted with the $31,000 level today, but it plummeted by over a grand within an hour after the report came out to a 10-day low of under $30,000.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Litecoin also noted an uptick in mining difficulty that surged above 26 million.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Litecoin&#8217;s upcoming halving is less than five weeks away, which is expected to happen on August 2, 2023, at block 2,520,000. Leading up to the much-anticipated fact, the network hash rate has already reached a historic high, thereby serving as a positive catalyst for the Litecoin miners</p>
<p>As a result of this increased confidence, LTC was up by more than 15% over the past week, climbing near the crucial $100 mark.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/litecoin-hashrate.html#3y" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a> compiled by Bitinfohcharts, Litecoin&#8217;s hash rate &#8211; which is a measure of computing power on the network &#8211; hit a fresh high of 797.72 tera hash/second (Th/s) this week.</li>
<li>Notably, the hash rate figures have been on a steady rise despite severe turbulence in LTC&#8217;s price trajectory over the past month.</li>
<li>A similar trend was observed during the previous halving event when Litecoin&#8217;s hash rate climbed the then-all-time-high of 523 Th/s before significantly sliding down. It wasn&#8217;t until mid-2022 that the metric picked up pace yet again to fresh highs.</li>
<li>Besides the hash rate, Litecoin&#8217;s mining difficulty, recorded at 26.38 million, is also hovering new its recently established ATH. Such a trend depicts a growing challenge for miners to discover new blocks and rake in rewards.</li>
<li>The upcoming halving, expected to happen on August 2, 2023, specifically at block 2,520,000, will slash the block rewards to half from 12.5 LTC per mined block to 6.25 LTC per mined block.</li>
<li>This reduction in supply and future scarcity has not only boosted the prices higher but has also triggered an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/litecoin-sees-increased-network-activity-ahead-of-halving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">increased</a> network activity.</li>
<li>LTC&#8217;s price has also been on a roll lately. The past 24 hours alone brought a massive 15% surge, which helped the asset jump to almost $100 as of now.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given the crypto market’s fast-moving nature, fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Dogecoin ($DOGE) defied all the odds and turned early investors into millionaires during its bull run, launching an era of meme-based cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Now investors are looking for the next wave of meme coins that could be the fabled crypto &#8220;millionaire makers.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Millionaire Learns Valuable Lessons in the Meme Coin Landscape</h2>
<p>Dogecoin was the first meme coin to gain significant mainstream attention, solidifying its place in the history of the crypto market.</p>
<p>From January 2021 to May 2021, the $DOGE price rocketed over 10,000%, marking the first time a crypto asset driven by social media hype had experienced such an astronomical surge.</p>
<p>This event forever altered the perception of what is possible in the world of cryptocurrencies since it demonstrated the immense power of community-driven enthusiasm.</p>
<p>One notable outcome of Dogecoin’s unprecedented surge was the emergence of the legendary “Dogecoin millionaire” – an individual who transformed an early $DOGE investment into a life-changing fortune.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/dogecoin-investor-is-no-longer-a-millionaire-but-still-buys-the-dips.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a> article, Glauber Contessoto invested $250,000 in $DOGE in February 2021, and by April 2021, he became a millionaire on paper.</p>
<p>However, despite his initial success, Contessoto’s decision to hold onto his Dogecoin investment without taking profits proved to be a risky move.</p>
<p>As the hype around Dogecoin subsided, the price of the meme coin came crashing down – eroding a significant chunk of his paper gains.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-29.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-257943" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-29.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="497" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-29.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-29-300x248.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-29-50x41.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Fast forward to the present day, and Contessoto has embraced his past and become an <a href="https://twitter.com/ProTheDoge" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">influential voice on Twitter</a> – sharing insights and offering advice to fellow crypto enthusiasts.</p>
<p>In retrospect, many experts suggest that he could have benefited from taking profits during the peak of Dogecoin’s surge and diversifying into other promising projects.</p>
<p>By realizing gains at the right time, Contessoto may have mitigated the potential losses incurred during the $DOGE downfall, yet this wasn&#8217;t the approach he took.</p>
<p>Ultimately, hindsight serves as a stark reminder that effective risk management is key to maximizing outcomes in the crypto market – something that meme coin investors may wish to bear in mind going forward.</p>
<h2>Which Meme Coins Could Be the Next With Potential?</h2>
<p>With Dogecoin setting a precedent for what’s possible with meme coin investing, investors are eagerly searching for the next “millionaire makers” in the market.</p>
<p>Two promising candidates have recently emerged, Wall Street Memes and Thug Life, aiming to capture the imagination of meme coin enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Raises $11.5m As Investor Excitement Reaches Fever Pitch</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> is a community-driven project that leverages the immense power of the Reddit subculture.</p>
<p>The core values of Wall Street Memes are designed to resonate with investors who have rallied behind meme cryptos in the past, making $WSM a particularly appealing prospect.</p>
<p>Since emerging last month, Wall Street Memes has made itself known to the masses – raising a staggering $11.5 million through its ongoing presale.</p>
<p>The presale has been an instant hit due to its 30-stage setup, which increases the $WSM price incrementally between stages.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-24.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-257942" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-24.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="297" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-24.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-24-300x148.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-24-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Currently, $WSM is available to purchase for just $0.0307 – although with over two-thirds of the presale allocation already gone, investors may need to act fast to take advantage of these prices.</p>
<p>The low purchase price has led to tremendous growth and momentum behind the project, evidenced by the influx of new members to the Wall Street Memes <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the project has already been on the radar of some high-profile crypto influencers; for example, Michael Wrubel, who boasts over 310,000 subscribers, posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTdUPbXVujc&amp;pp=ygUYd2FsbCBzdHJlZXQgbWVtZXMgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video breakdown</a> of the project.</p>
<p>Overall, Wall Street Memes looks set to continue growing – positioning itself as a potential meme coin leader.</p>

<h2>New Contender Thug Life Disrupts Meme Coin Market with Huge Presale Launch</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life ($THUG)</a> is another brand-new meme coin that has gained huge attention from retail investors.</p>
<p>This fresh project centers around hip-hop culture and the essence of resilience while fostering a sense of camaraderie within the community.</p>
<p>The $THUG token has generated significant buzz through its presale phase launch, which has amassed over $140,000 in just two days.</p>
<p>Early investors can buy $THUG tokens for just $0.0007, presenting an appealing opportunity for those seeking the next meme coin sensation.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture5-11.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-257941" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture5-11.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="602" height="357" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture5-11.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture5-11-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture5-11-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Importantly, the Thug Life team has already pledged to lock liquidity for three months once the token makes its DEX debut – protecting investors from rug pull scenarios.</p>
<p>Also, 70% of the total $THUG supply has been set aside for presale investors, demonstrating the team&#8217;s commitment to fostering a strong community.</p>
<p>This setup seems to be bearing fruit, with over 2,400 people following the Thug Life <a href="https://twitter.com/thug_life_token" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a> already.</p>
<p>In addition, crypto influencer Jacob Bury uploaded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVtbCRWEmgA&amp;t=1s&amp;pp=ygUQdGh1ZyBsaWZlIGNyeXB0bw%3D%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video</a> discussing $THUG, stating that he thinks the token’s price could 10x after its DEX listing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the future looks exceedingly bright for Thug Life – setting the stage for a solid second half of 2023.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; New York, New York, June 30th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>Memecoin Mooky is gearing up for its final presale phase, having raised $900,000 to date. More than just a novel crypto token, Mooky aims to support the environment through a major tree-planting campaign.</p>
<p>Mooky will be a community-driven platform whose governance lies in the hands of its token holders. While the MOOKY token draws its cues from other successful memecoins, the project has a more ambitious mandate. Mooky was conceived to increase awareness of global environmental challenges and to provide real-world solutions.</p>
<p><img src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_1688110387jD2jn6a98F.jpg" /></p>
<p>The project aims to raise enough funds to sustain an extensive reforestation initiative in key locations around the world. As part of its commitment to nature, Mooky has earmarked donations to charities working on sustainable environmental causes.</p>
<p>From a crypto-economic perspective, the MOOKY token features zero tax and low slippage, providing ample incentives for traders to get involved. Underpinning the project is a deep lore that aligns with Mooky’s core goals.</p>
<p>Mooky is based on the concept of a mythical land called Pygmy. This fantastical realm has stunning landscapes, abundant vegetation, and wildlife. As settlers came to the island, they destroyed the vegetation and polluted the air. The monkeys of Pygmy decide to fight back peacefully, teaching the settlers how to respect nature and live harmoniously. Under the leadership of Mooky, they become united and restore nature.</p>
<p><div class="embed"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IiPyd5VoQIg"></iframe></div></p>
<p>To support the project’s development while providing greater opportunities for community participation, Mooky has created a collection of 1,000 NFTs. Each NFT is linked to a tree planted in the real world. Holders can access the Ventures Club, which grants access to exclusive rewards and events.</p>
<p>With five days left in the <a href="blank" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$MOOKY token presale</a>, there is still ample opportunity for crypto holders to get involved and capture the upside to a project that combines memes and nature to great effect.</p>
<h2>About MOOKY</h2>
<p>MOOKY is a community-driven initiative launched in 2023 that embraces the spirit of digital innovation to make a positive impact on the environment. More than just a meme token, MOOKY represents a global community united by a common goal: to inspire change and contribute to global tree-planting efforts.</p>
<p>MOOKY also stands as a symbol of creativity in the digital space, offering unique 3D NFTs that are each linked to real-world tree-planting initiatives. These NFTs serve not only as digital collectibles but also as an entry ticket to the exclusive Mooky Ventures Club, a vibrant community of environmentally conscious enthusiasts.</p>
<p>MOOKY is more than a digital token; it&#8217;s a movement aiming to better our environment while fostering a unique and engaging digital ecosystem. Join MOOKY in its journey to make a difference and follow the community on various social channels to stay updated.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[According to Coinbase, the lawsuit is at best government overreach and at worst an abuse of due process.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Merely a few weeks after the SEC sued the platform for facilitating unregistered trading with 12 tokens that the agency considers to be securities, Coinbase’s legal representatives have filed for a complete dismissal of the lawsuit, citing concerns regarding the legal authority of the regulator.</p>
<h2>Prior Approval Disregarded</h2>
<p>One of the principal arguments laid out by Coinbase’s legal team is that six of the twelve cryptocurrencies at the heart of the lawsuit had already been <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/4oVJN5EioULD0QnSyg01b8/2b1f34594a800c727fb61a384f37e74a/SEC_v._Coinbase__Coinbase_Answer_to_Complaint__As-Filed_.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">greenlit</a> by the SEC back in 2021. At the time, the six cryptocurrencies in question had been confirmed to not be securities by the SEC, which reviewed 240 digital assets that were listed on the exchange shortly after.</p>
<p>Since the SEC had already confirmed that the tokens in question were not considered securities, Coinbase argued that the current lawsuit is merely the result of internal policy changes that were not communicated to the companies the watchdog wishes to regulate.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The SEC’s about-face is not a product of material changes to Coinbase’s business since 2021; none are alleged. Nor is it due to new information. Nowhere in its Complaint does the SEC suggest that Coinbase hid anything in the many years of cooperative discussion that preceded it becoming a public company. Nor is the reversal a product of legislative change. […] The only change is in the SEC’s position regarding its powers.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Out of Scope</h2>
<p>Not only are the charges brought against Coinbase possibly unfounded, but they are also outside of the scope of existing law and regulatory precedent, argued Coinbase representatives.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@coinbase</a> filed our answer and notice of intent to file a motion to dismiss the <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@SECGov</a> case against us. You can read our response for yourself – our arguments speak for themselves. 1/2 <a href="https://t.co/Ld2ZEejhyM" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/Ld2ZEejhyM</a></p>
<p>— paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1674271484263661569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Coinbase’s leadership has repeatedly stressed that they are more than willing to entertain dialogue with regulatory bodies and stay well within the legal framework imposed upon them – so long as the given framework is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-responds-to-coinbase-request-for-crypto-clarity-wants-more-time/" data-wpel-link="internal">clearly</a> laid out.</p>
<p>In this case, however, Coinbase believes the tokens in question are outside of the SEC’s scope owing to them not being considered securities by the agency&#8217;s own admission. Even if the tokens were to come under the purview of the SEC, the current lawsuit represents a violation of Coinbase’s rights and an abuse of process.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Even if the SEC were correct that the assets and services it identifies are within the scope of its existing regulatory authority, this [legal] action must be dismissed on independent grounds that it violates Coinbase’s due process rights and constitutes an extraordinary abuse of process.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The request to dismiss charges is now pending with the judge, who will respond as he sees fit. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-shares-have-jumped-nearly-40-since-the-sec-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">stock</a> seems to be slowly recovering following the initial shock that sent it plunging to the depths.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[BCH skyrocketed to over $320 earlier today for the first time since April 2022.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While BTC pushed toward $31,000 and even briefly surpassed that level, several altcoins have been on a massive roll in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash stands out as the most notable performer, having surged by over 30% on a daily scale to over $300 for the first time in over a year.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s BCH&#8217;s Show</h2>
<p>The altcoins started a massive run-up last week before stalling for a few days. Today, though, the landscape for many of them is quite different.</p>
<p>While ETH, BNB, XRP, and TRX trade relatively quietly with gains of up to 3%, ADA, DOGE, and DOT have jumped by up to 5%.</p>
<p>However, SOL and LTC have taken the main stage with impressive 15% daily increases. As a result, SOL is up to $19, while LTC trades close to $100.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Bitcoin Cash has stolen the show with a mind-blowing 33% surge to $305. Moreover, BCH even tapped $320 earlier today, charting its highest price tag in 14 months.</p>
<p>ETC has also jumped by a double-digit percentage (13%) and has reclaimed $20.</p>
<p>Most other altcoins are also in the green, which has helped the total crypto market cap add over $30 billion in a day and near $1.2 trillion on CMC.</p>

<h2>BTC Tried $31K Again</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s most impressive price surge for the past few months came 10 days ago when the asset soared from $26,500 to over $30,000. It jumped to $31,500 in the following few days but failed there and remained relatively stagnant in a range between $30,000 and $31,000 ever since.</p>
<p>That changed yesterday when it briefly slipped below $30,000. However, that was short-lived, and the bulls took charge once again. They pushed the cryptocurrency north to $31,250 (on Bitstamp) earlier today, but it failed to continue upwards.</p>
<p>As of now, bitcoin trades just inches away from $31,000, and the rising altcoins have reduced some of its dominance over the market. Nevertheless, the metric is still above 50% on CMC.</p>
<p>The enhanced market volatility has resulted in over $130 million worth of liquidations as nearly 45,000 over-leveraged traders were wrecked in the past 24 hours.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Britain has taken another step towards having a fully regulated crypto framework with the royal approval of the Financial Services and Markets Bill.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On June 28, King Charles III granted Royal Assent to a landmark bill to “regain control of the financial services rulebook.”</p>
<p>The Financial Services and Markets Bill 2023 was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/uk-house-of-lords-approve-crypto-regulatory-bill/" data-wpel-link="internal">approved</a> by the upper chamber of the UK parliament on June 19.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/rocket-boost-for-uk-economy-as-financial-services-and-markets-bill-receives-royal-assent" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">bill</a> includes measures to bring crypto assets and stablecoins into the scope of regulation, giving them powers to oversee the digital asset sector.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1/ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1ec-1f1e7.png" alt="🇬🇧" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The UK’s Financial Services &amp; Markets Bill has received Royal Assent, the final step for this major legislation, which brings <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stablecoins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#stablecoins</a> into the regulatory perimeter, designates <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#crypto</a> as regulated activity &amp; supervision of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#crypto</a> promotions<a href="https://t.co/wG4D3sgDgz" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/wG4D3sgDgz</a></p>
<p>— Teana Baker-Taylor (@TeanaTaylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeanaTaylor/status/1674462519287590924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Rocket Boost for UK Economy</h2>
<p>The Treasury described the bill as a “rocket boost” for the UK economy, which has been battered during the pandemic and its exit from Europe.</p>
<p>It clarified that the bill “enables the regulation of crypto assets to support their safe adoption in the UK.”</p>
<p>Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Andrew Griffith, said: “2023 is proving to be a banner year for reforming our financial services.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“This landmark piece of legislation gives us control of our financial services rulebook, so it supports UK businesses and consumers and drives growth.”</p></blockquote>
<p>During the formulation of the bill, amendments were made to include crypto as a regulated financial activity and to supervise crypto promotions and advertising. Stablecoins have also been included in the bill’s oversight of payment regulations.</p>
<p>The legislation could entice more crypto companies to the UK from the United States, which is currently trying to push them out by ‘carpet bombing’ the industry with <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-responds-to-coinbase-request-for-crypto-clarity-wants-more-time/" data-wpel-link="internal">lawsuits</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of rolling out its own regulatory framework, policymakers in America have been grappling over which agency will control the asset class. Furthermore, the Securities and Exchange Commission and its chair <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-lawyers-claim-gensler-offered-to-be-company-advisor/" data-wpel-link="internal">Gary Gensler</a> have taken acted on their own to proclaim that all digital assets aside from Bitcoin are securities.</p>
<p>Congress has yet to officially classify them as such, and the uncertainty is causing an exodus of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-exchange-gemini-launches-eth-staking-pro-in-the-uk/" data-wpel-link="internal">companies</a>, talent, innovation, and capital.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Crypto markets remain in consolidation, having gained just 1% on the day. As a result, total market capitalization remains around $1.21 trillion at the time of writing.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin prices</a> have barely moved, and the asset was trading for $30,400 during the Friday morning Asian session. It has failed to break resistance at this level but has also yet to pull back again.</p>
<p>Ethereum, which has been weaker recently, was flat on the day at $1,846. The only altcoins showing any progress at the time of writing were Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).</p>
