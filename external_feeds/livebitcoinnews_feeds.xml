										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michigan has become a state where crypto <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/ag-nessel-and-michigan-state-police-issue-warning-on-the-dangers-of-cryptocurrency-and-bitcoin-scams/ar-AA19etOm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">fraud runs rampant</a>, and the region’s attorney general Dana Nessel is warning citizens about what they can do to ensure they never fall victim to digital currency <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">scammers</a> or fraud.</p>
<h2>Dana Nessel on How to Avoid Crypto Fraud</h2>
<p>In a statement, Nessel said older adults are often targeted by bad actors as they assume they’ll be unfamiliar with new technology waves or how applications work. Thus, they feel they’re the most vulnerable and can be convinced that a scam is, in fact, legitimate. Nessel said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency is a new, complex market that causes confusion among even seasoned investors, and bad actors are exploiting this arena to victimize people of all ages.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a press release, Nessel as well as the Michigan State Police said nobody should withdraw cash at branches they often use or go to. This is the easiest way to get caught in something you’ll wind up regretting later. Also, never lie to branch tellers or other bank employees about why you’re withdrawing money. Sometimes, telling them the truth is all that’s needed to get authorities in play and ensure scammers are taken down.</p>
<p>Also, if anyone receives a phone call that offers instructions on how to get money out of an ATM, that call should be ignored. If a person does wind up answering the call, never leave it open or let the cell phone lie around. Nessel said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Residents should be wary of unsolicited requests from strangers on the phone or internet and especially requests to make bank withdrawals or deposits at cryptocurrency kiosks or bitcoin ATMs.</p></blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, legitimate crypto investment opportunities will never come from people you know, nor will they be delivered via social media pages. Thus, if you’re told to send someone money through Facebook or a similar platform, these words shouldn’t be adhered to. Also, be sure to inform authorities right away if you receive such communication.</p>
<p>Detective First Lt. James Ellis – commander of the MSP Cyber Section – said Michigan is becoming a hotbed of crypto crime, and that the wave is increasing across the country. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Online exchanges are being exploited more frequently with the account holders’ crypto being stolen, like a bank robber stealing funds from your bank&#8217;s safe, but much easier. Bad actors are also calling and emailing victims directly, duping them out of their crypto and cash with get rich schemes, romance scams, or by creating false emergencies that must be dealt with immediately, playing on the victim&#8217;s emotions.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Never Trust Someone You Don&#8217;t Know</h2>
<p>He concluded by saying you should never let someone you don’t know access your computer or accounts. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Never allow anyone you don&#8217;t know remote access to your computer or accounts when they offer assistance to help.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, it was announced that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had filed a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cftc-sues-binance-alleging-financial-violations/" data-wpel-link="internal">lawsuit against Binance</a>, the biggest and most popular digital currency trading platform in the world. There are many Ripple fans out there who are concerned that the suit <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/28/new-fears-ripples-xrp-braces-after-bitcoin-and-ethereum-binance-shock-triggers-crypto-price-chaos/?sh=3853bc5a380f" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">could have drastic</a> effects on XRP, the platform’s native token, and that the asset could experience volatility like never before.</p>
<h2>How Will Ripple Be Classified?</h2>
<p>Ripple has added about 40 percent to its price since the beginning of the year, suggesting that while it has certainly enjoyed the effects of the bull run, it hasn’t witnessed its price or value expand as much as bitcoin or Ethereum have. However, there are many analysts out there that are continuing to argue in favor of it, and they believe the currency has what it takes to completely revamp the digital currency arena in ways nobody thought possible.</p>
<p>Genevieve Roch-Decter, the chief executive of capital market advisory company Grit Capital, explained in a recently emailed statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite new fears arising from the CFTC filing against Binance that XRP tokens could be considered commodities, XRP has surged over the last 24 hours in stark contrast to broader crypto markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons the present CFTC lawsuit against Binance is bringing so much attention to Ripple has to do with the latter’s present case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Not long ago, the SEC <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-sec-is-looking-to-file-legal-action-against-ripple/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed a lawsuit against</a> Ripple, claiming it violated numerous securities laws. Ripple has vowed to fight the lawsuit and at the time of writing, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-secs-case-against-ripple-could-result-in-a-massive-win-for-the-crypto-company/" data-wpel-link="internal">appears to be on the verge</a> of winning its case after gaining steam in a U.S. courtroom.</p>
<p>Many executives of Ripple – including chief technology officer David Schwartz – believe Ripple is more of a commodity, and thus shouldn’t fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC. This is why he and his team have agreed to fight the suit with all their might. On Twitter, Schwartz stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>XRP is a raw good that trades in commerce, and one XRP is treated as equivalent to every other XRP. That&#8217;s pretty much the definition of a commodity. No part of XRP&#8217;s value comes from anyone else&#8217;s legal obligations to XRP holders.</p></blockquote>
<h2>So Many Poorly Classified Tokens Out There</h2>
<p>The lawsuit between both the CFTC and Binance alleges that several digital assets in circulation right now – including bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Binance’s USD token – are all commodities, and thus should be regulated by the agency. Schwartz is clearly of the opinion that Ripple also falls into this category, and thus the SEC needs to butt out and mind its own business.</p>
<p>The SEC has been in the process of bullying several digital currency companies as of late including Coinbase, which recently <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">received a Wells notice</a> from the agency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rajeev Chandrasekhar – the minister of state for IT and electronics – <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/cryptocurrency-presents-a-legitimate-case-of-macroeconomic-risk-says-rajeev-chandrasekhar/ar-AA19cMAK" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said crypto could present</a> a “legitimate case of macroeconomic risks,” in a recent report. He also said that a world without crypto regulation is a dangerous one.</p>
<h2>Rajeev Chandrasekhar on Crypto in India</h2>
<p>Chandrasekhar commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a very legit case that crypto represents macroeconomic risks. It represents many other types of risks. FTX and other cases reaffirm that crypto is not business as usual and crypto is not innovation. In India, crypto is not illegal if you buy them through legitimate channels of LRS (liberalized remittances scheme) which are RBI-approved dispensation on foreign exchange. It is your choice to lose money or make money, and the government does not get in the business of where you invest in and what you invest in, but we certainly have the obligation to explain to the Indian citizens that you can&#8217;t exchange rupee for crypto.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>RBI is very clear on this and we should respect their views on how they chart out the crypto course and crypto roadmap. They have said CBDC (central bank digital currency) is the route, and I have no problem with that. It is the best way to do that without creating any downside risk to the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chandrasekhar also said that he’s not concerned about the lack of funding going to tech startups and crypto companies as of late. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Peaks and troughs and ups and downs and business cycles are very inherent in startups. We are seeing a cycle that would&#8217;ve played anyway… Also, people are getting smart about where value lies and where IP is. Certainly, COVID and over stimulus in [the] U.S. and European economies and [the] Russia-Ukraine war have caused some significant headwinds in risk aversion… People are a lot more careful and prudent, which is causing valuation corrections.</p></blockquote>
<p>His thoughts towards regulation are concerning in many ways given how many people working in a regulatory capacity today are not fit to be doing so. Look at the U.S., for example, where virtually everyone in the federal government that’s now voicing support for crypto regulation accepted bribes and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-gave-a-lot-of-money-to-democrats-what-will-they-do-with-it/" data-wpel-link="internal">campaign donation funds</a> from Sam Bankman-Fried, the man behind FTX.</p>
<h2>The Mystery Behind FTX</h2>
<p>It does not seem possible that these individuals could <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-did-the-ftx-fall-expose-a-government-conspiracy/" data-wpel-link="internal">have had such close</a> ties to a criminal and not seen the kind of shady practices occurring behind the closed doors of his exchange. The idea could be that FTX was a setup of sorts. That the exchange would collapse after everyone had their chance to benefit from it and then they could swoop in and make their mark by taking away everyone’s financial freedom.</p>
<p>Chandrasekhar concluded by hinting India is a prime country to have its hand in all new technological ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Saylor – the man behind software giant MicroStrategy and a major crypto bull – has paid off a $200 million+ loan <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/michael-saylors-microstrategy-snaps-another-164250827.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">obtained from the now failed</a> crypto bank Silvergate and has purchased even more bitcoin units, thus bringing the company’s total BTC holdings to nearly $4 billion.</p>
<h2>Michael Saylor Won&#8217;t Give Up on BTC</h2>
<p>On the one hand, this is a positive story. Saylor and MicroStrategy were literally billions of dollars in debt in 2022 thanks to the ongoing bear run. The price of bitcoin was hit extremely hard and wound up losing more than 70 percent of its value over the course of 12 short months, falling from its new all-time high of $68,000 per unit (achieved in November of 2021) and dipping into the mid-$16K range by the end of 2022. It was a sad and ugly sight to see.</p>
<p>Institutional players like MicroStrategy <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/microstrategy-dealt-heavy-blow-following-crypto-crash/" data-wpel-link="internal">suffered greatly</a>. The bitcoin-related decisions made by Saylor led to his <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/michael-saylor-btc-bull-and-microstrategy-chief-executive-steps-down/" data-wpel-link="internal">official step down from</a> the CEO position he had held with the company for over 30 years, and he switched over to the role of executive chairman. The fact that the company has managed to pull itself out of the doldrums and ultimately pay off one of its biggest loans is a good sign that things are perhaps picking up not just for the enterprise, but for the digital currency space.</p>
<p>However, as we’ve seen by now, Saylor’s love of BTC <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/it-appears-michael-saylor-will-never-reject-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">has gone a little overboard</a> at times, and he arguably rushes into things without really thinking about them as much as he should. Right now, BTC and its altcoin cousins are enduring a bit of a bull run, a solid change from 2022. It’s nice to sit back and watch, though it would be incorrect to assume that we’re fully out of the darkness and there isn’t more space to improve and heal.</p>
<p>The fact remains that BTC is nowhere near where it was a year and a half ago, and the idea that Saylor would simply jump all the way back into the bitcoin bin without allowing more time to go by is a bit concerning. It suggests that he hasn’t really learned his lesson from the past yet, and thus MicroStrategy could be in for more pain before it’s able to fully remove the bandages from its former wounds.</p>
<p>In late March, Saylor issued the following statement on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>MicroStrategy repaid its $205M Silvergate loan at a 22 percent discount.</p></blockquote>
<h2>So Many Banks Are Collapsing</h2>
<p>Silvergate was one of several banks to crumble and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-crashed-following-news-of-silvergate-shutdown/" data-wpel-link="internal">collapse in recent weeks</a>, with others being Silicon Valley and Signature.</p>
<p>The financial catastrophe has also spread to Europe, with institutions <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">such as Credit Suisse</a> being on the verge of crashing and burning before it was saved by a $3 billion-bearing UBS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Assets like bitcoin and Ethereum have soared in recent weeks, and the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/27/looming-300-trillion-crypto-earthquake-revealed-amid-huge-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-pump/?sh=7f1da0144277" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">sudden bull run is causing</a> many big financial players – such as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/fidelity-and-black-rock-keep-expanding-their-crypto-influence/" data-wpel-link="internal">Fidelity and BlackRock</a> – to increase their stakes in the crypto space and try to do more with digital tokens.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Could Give Rise to Further Tokenization</h2>
<p>The bull run has gotten so many people excited that according to a new report issued by crypto infrastructure provider Taurus, roughly $300 trillion in private assets could be digitized in the coming future. The report reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tokenization could open worlds not imagined yet to private assets in a similar way to how the internet and e-commerce transformed many industries over the last two decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>2023 is, thus far, turning out to be the complete opposite of 2022. While there’s still a long way to go and an even higher degree of healing to be had before assets like bitcoin are once again at their November 2021 highs, the space appears to be turning itself around from the horrible bearish conditions it faced during the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>2022 was arguably the worst year on record for crypto. During that time, assets like bitcoin lost more than 70 percent of their value, and they crashed and burned like nobody’s business. This led to the entire space losing more than $2 trillion in overall valuation. For many, the situation was particularly dire as they had likely put more than they could afford into the space, hoping to get rich over time.</p>
<p>Now, however, the prices of assets like bitcoin appear to be turning themselves around. The currency recently reached a nine-month high of about $28,000 per unit, and while the asset has again been rocked <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cftc-sues-binance-alleging-financial-violations/" data-wpel-link="internal">due to recent</a> (and negative) news surrounding Binance, it’s unlikely the asset will stay down for the count for long.</p>
<p>In the report’s early sections, Jacques Iffland – partner at Lenz &amp; Staehelin and chair of the Capital Markets and Technology Association (CMTA) – explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tokenization opens the door to a broad universe of new possibilities, which the financial industry is only starting to comprehend and embrace.</p></blockquote>
<p>Morgan McKenney – chief executive of the Provenance Blockchain Foundation – also threw his two cents into the mix, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Private funds are very restricted in terms of liquidity options, and by natively issuing shares on-chain, they can then open up marketplaces to give investors the opportunity to exit.</p></blockquote>
<h2>This Will Help Crypto Reach Its Ultimate Goal</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the tokenization of various assets could ultimately make them more accessible to the public and thus bring the initial dreams and goals of crypto closer to becoming realities.</p>
<p>The driving force behind crypto was that everyone should have a chance to invest and garner financial services and tools that will allow them to live applicable lives, something that standard financial institutions can often restrict.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three computer scientists in Germany <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/newly-formed-zerosync-association-brings-zero-knowledge-proofs-to-bitcoin/ar-AA19aD0K" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">have established a new</a> crypto-based, non-profit company in Switzerland called Zero Sync Association. The goal is to help scale bitcoin using what are known as zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs), which have already been hard at work through networks like ETH.</p>
<h2>Zero Sync Wants to Ensure Everything on the Blockchain Is Provable</h2>
<p>ZK proofs use cryptography to ensure the validity of information contained within the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> without revealing the data to outside parties or prying eyes. By using such proofs on the bitcoin network, nodes will be able to sync almost instantly rather than taking hours (or even days) like they do now. At the time of writing, the bitcoin blockchain contains roughly 500 gigabytes of data.</p>
<p>A prototype for the network is already in play. Presently, the prototype is validating things such as the ownership of various tokens and transaction histories, though the team behind it hopes things will vastly improve and expand in the coming weeks and months. Zero Sync co-founder Robin Linus explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s very much in the prototype stage, but the grand vision is that you download that one megabyte of proof, and that is as good as if you had downloaded the 500 gigabytes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bitcoin blockchain has always contained simple payment verification nodes, aka light clients. The concept is even mentioned in the initial BTC whitepaper that was introduced on Halloween of 2008. These nodes are limited and only work on things like mobile phones. They are not currently capable of downloading the entire blockchain. The whitepaper reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. Verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker.</p></blockquote>
<p>Continuing his interview, Linus said Zero Synch doesn’t simply trust the nodes as suggested in the whitepaper. Rather, the company is set on verifying the actual transactions that occur via the network through cryptographic proof. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>You don&#8217;t have to trust. That is the entire point. The proof proves it to you. That&#8217;s the great invention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Linus has been working with his business partner Lukas George for the past ten months (they started operating the company together in July of last year). The goal was to implement a full proof of the bitcoin blockchain, a subject prominently tackled in George’s graduation thesis.</p>
<h2>How the Founders Met</h2>
<p>The duo then added another co-founder – Tino Steffens – to the mix, and the company was born from there. Linus stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>From there, I started to learn more and more about cryptography. I developed some skills over time, and then Ruben recommended me to Geometry Research. They offered me the opportunity to build STARK proofs for bitcoin, and that&#8217;s also how I got in touch with Lucas.</p></blockquote>

<li>Bitcoin cash is attempting a recovery wave above the $115 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading near the $118 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $120 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair must clear $120 and $124 to start a steady upward movement in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is consolidating above $115 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-extend-losses-below-27000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $120 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price formed a decent support base above the $112 level. BCH started a decent increase and was able to clear the $115 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the $116.50 resistance level. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $136.18 swing high to the $111.66 low. It is now trading near the $118 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-risk-of-fresh-drop-to-100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $120 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $120 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $124 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $136.18 swing high to the $111.66 low, above which the price may perhaps rise toward the $130 level. Any more gains above $130 could set the pace for a move toward the $138 level.</p>
<p>If not, the price might decline again. Immediate support on the downside is near the $115 level. The first major support sits near the $112 level. The next major support is near $110, below which the bears might aim for $102. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $100 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is suing Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao after the crypto <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2023/03/27/cftc-sues-cryptocurrency-exchange-binance-founder-changpeng-zhao/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">exchange allegedly violated</a> the Commodity Exchange Act and other regulations.</p>
<h2>The CFTC Is Going After Binance</h2>
<p>The agency claims Binance has had no regard for current financial laws and has been violating them for the past several years. Heads of the CFTC are now seeking financial penalties and a permanent ban in the United States. CFTC chair Rostin Behnam claimed in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>For years, Binance knew they were violating CFTC rules, working actively to both keep the money flowing and avoid compliance. This should be a warning to anyone in the digital asset world that the CFTC will not tolerate willful avoidance of U.S. law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gretchen Lowe – principal deputy director and chief counsel to the CFTC’s enforcement division – also threw her two cents into the mix, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The defendants’ own emails and chats reflect that Binance’s compliance efforts have been a sham and Binance deliberately chose – over and over – to place profits over following the law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Binance is the world’s largest and most popular digital currency trading platform per its daily trading volume. In just the last few days alone, the company is alleged to have overseen roughly $9 billion in digital transactions. The company is also believed to have about 90 million users in multiple countries.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit against the exchange, the CFTC alleges that Binance is run by various corporate entities rather than a single governing body. This is designed to reportedly help it evade regulation and committee oversights. Right now, the lawsuit names three separate companies and/or divisions of Binance within its pages. They are Binance Holdings Ltd., Binance Holdings (IE) Ltd., and Finance (Services) Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p>The action has sent ripples throughout the space, with the price of bitcoin immediately descending from its nine-month high of around $28K to the high $26K range after the CFTC made the announcement. Ed Moya – an analyst at Oanda – <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-falls-after-cftc-sues-crypto-exchange-binance-for-allegedly-breaking-trading-rules/ar-AA198urA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">commented on the situation</a>, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many knew Binance had a bullseye on its back, but this is still unnerving some crypto traders. Binance&#8217;s success is needed to ensure a good part of the cryptoverse can grow.</p></blockquote>
<h2>So Many Agencies Are Attacking Crypto</h2>
<p>Dessislava Aubert – an analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko – said Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange, and thus any regulatory action against it would likely have hugely negative effects on the rest of the space.</p>
<p>It seems like lately federal agencies just want to prosecute and criminalize crypto companies as much as possible. Look at the recent track record of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example. The group has nailed companies like Kraken, slapping <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">them with heavy fines</a> and ending their staking divisions, and it’s now going <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">after Coinbase</a>.</p>
