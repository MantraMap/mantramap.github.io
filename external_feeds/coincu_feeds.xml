<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX has filed three lawsuits to recover its shares from SBF and his 2 associates</em></li>



<li><em>The company also sued and requested the recovery of $156 million and the remainder related to stock, options, and cash securities from Embed&#8217;s former founders and executives.</em></li>



<li><em>This is the first official action taken by FTX CEO John Ray against former management.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>FTX sued the company&#8217;s former management, SBF, Nishad Singh, and Gary Wang, for revoking its shares. This is the first official action taken by the new FTX CEO, John Ray, against previous management.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FTX (WRS and Alameda) sues Bankman-Fried, Singh and Wang to clawback the company&#39;s own stock.<br><br>This is new FTX CEO John Ray 3.0&#39;s first formal action against former management. <a href="https://t.co/CVu7jsro9B" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/CVu7jsro9B</a></p>&mdash; FTX 2.0 Coalition (@AFTXcreditor) <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1658982639594864643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to some court documents related to the lawsuit on May 17, FTX (especially WRS &amp; Alameda) sued the former shareholders of Embed and asked for the recovery of $6.9 million.</p>



<p>The company also filed a similar recall for Embed founder Michael Giles, asking to recover $156 million and the remainder related to shares, options, and securities.</p>



<p>Previously, Embed was acquired in March 2022 for $220 million, of which $157 million went to founder Michael Giles, while FTX&#8217;s recent Embed auction ended with a final bid of just $1 million.</p>



<p>The bankruptcy attorneys of this cryptocurrency exchange said at the trial that they had recovered more than $7.3 billion in cash and liquid cryptocurrencies and liquid investment securities raised more than $800 million since January in an attempt to salvage the bankrupt company&#8217;s finances.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-847.png"><img decoding="async" width="710" height="474" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-847.png" alt="FTX Sue Against SBF, Singh And Wang To Recover Company Shares" class="wp-image-188256" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-847.png 710w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-847-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" title="FTX Sue Against SBF, Singh And Wang To Recover Company Shares 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The exchange&#8217;s new CEO, John Ray, detailed inappropriate transfers at the crypto exchange and described it as a &#8220;complete failure&#8221; of the controls.</p>



<p>Looking to the future, FTX is in talks with stakeholders about options to restart its crypto exchange, and they could decide on that in Q2, Dietderich said. The restart of this exchange will have significant implications for customers who had crypto deposits at this bankrupt exchange but were locked out when the exchange announced bankruptcy.</p>



<p>FTX customers in Japan are the only ones able to withdraw any funds so far due to the country&#8217;s relatively tight crypto regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cryptocurrency exchange Bitget plans to hire 300 more employees across multiple divisions within the company.</em></li>



<li><em>This comes after the Q1 2023 operating report recorded 8% growth quarter-on-quarter for spot trading and a 27% increase for futures trading.</em></li>



<li><em>Bitget has a lot of activity moving forward despite much market volatility in April.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Forkast, Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitget said Wednesday that it plans to hire 300 more employees for operations, compliance, research and development, and support departments.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-846.png"><img decoding="async" width="1267" height="916" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-846.png" alt="Bitget Plans To Hire 300 More People After The Positive Report Of Q1 2023" class="wp-image-188249" title="Bitget Plans To Hire 300 More People After The Positive Report Of Q1 2023 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to Bitget&#8217;s first quarter report, the company has about 1,300 employees. Unlike many exchanges that have laid off employees during the &#8220;crypto winter,&#8221; Bitget announced last November that it wanted to increase staffing by 50%.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/blog/articles/bitget-transparency-report-quarter-one-twenty-twenty-three" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly report</a>, the company said its spot trading volume hit $59 billion in the first quarter of 2023, up 8% from the previous quarter. Futures trading volume reached $658 billion, up 27% month-on-month.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-845-1024x640.png" alt="image 845" class="wp-image-188248" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-845-1024x640.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-845-300x188.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-845-768x480.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-845-750x469.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-845-1140x713.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-845.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitget Plans To Hire 300 More People After The Positive Report Of Q1 2023 7"><figcaption>Bitget Plans To Hire 300 More People After The Positive Report Of Q1 2023 8</figcaption></figure>



<p>The company also says it has generated around $41 million in profits through copy trading, which allows investors to follow other professional traders for the same position.</p>



<p>The five-year-old exchange, which claims to have over 8 million users in 100 countries, launched a $100 million Asia-focused fund last month to support the development of blockchain projects, money electronic, and irreplaceable tokens.</p>



<p>While the cryptocurrency market was volatile in April, Bitget moved forward as it expanded its global footprint, generating insights into mainstream adoption and enhancing the utility and value of <a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/support/articles/12560603785107" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Biget&#8217;s native token (BGB)</a> with a new roadmap and updated white paper.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/blog/articles/Bitget-Launches-100M-dollar-Web-three-Fund-to-Support-Next-Generation-Crypto-Projects-in-Asia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has established</a> the $100 million Web3 Foundation to support pioneering crypto projects. The exchange has completed crypto registration in Lithuania, allowing the exchange to expand its services to new regions and users worldwide.</p>



<p>The exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/178538-dragonfly-completes-10-m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received </a>a strategic investment of $10 million from Dragonfly. These are important steps forward in our goal to expand access to cryptocurrencies for users around the world and support our work to build a robust and safe platform.</p>

<p>Pakistan&#8217;s Minister of State for Finance, Ayesha Ghous Pasha, recently announced that the country will ban the operation of cryptocurrency services and will never legalize cryptocurrency transactions. This decision comes as no surprise, as the State Bank and the Ministry of Information Technology have been working on banning cryptocurrencies in the country.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Crypto is a high-risk asset that no one benefits from. Major countries are now scrapping crypto. We recommend that cryptocurrencies be banned. Cryptocurrency will never be legalized in Pakistan.</p>
<cite>Minister of State for Finance Ayesha Ghous Pasha</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Central Bank of Pakistan and others are drafting the ban legislation. The ban will prevent Pakistani citizens from conducting any cryptocurrency transactions. Digital State Bank Executive Director Sohail Jabbar told the committee that the cryptocurrency market has shrunk from $2.8 trillion to $1.2 trillion. China has also banned cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies have always been controversial, with many experts arguing that they are a high-risk asset that no one benefits from. Major countries are now scrapping crypto. Chairman Committee Salim Mandviwala said that Pakistan&#8217;s billions of dollars had been invested in cryptocurrency. Dr. Ayesha Ghous Pasha replied that FATF has also imposed conditions.</p>



<p>This is a significant blow to the crypto market. However, it is not the first time a country has banned cryptocurrencies. The ban will affect investors and businesses that rely on cryptocurrency transactions. The Central Bank of Pakistan and others are drafting the ban legislation.</p>

<p>Voyager&#8217;s Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC) tweeted that it is working with Voyager to put this liquidation plan into effect as soon as possible and as early as May 19.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ At today’s hearing, the Court approved the liquidation procedures.

</div></figure>



<p>Once the plan goes into effect, the committee will be dissolved, the program administrator will take over the liquidated debtors, and we are still working toward the initial distribution of compensation by June 1.</p>



<p>Earlier, it was reported that a judge approved Voyager&#8217;s liquidation plan, which could return 35% of crypto assets to customers.</p>



<p>US Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles approved Voyager Digital&#8217;s proposed liquidation plan at a Manhattan court hearing, allowing the company to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186012-voyager-two-options-recovery-assets-1-334b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return</a> approximately $1.33 billion in crypto assets to customers, accounting for $1.3 billion, 0.35% of total deposits and closing restructuring under US bankruptcy law.</p>



<p>Voyager Digital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last July amid volatile crypto markets and defaulted on a large loan to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).</p>



<p>Following the bankruptcy, the crypto lending platform tried to sell its assets to FTX for $1.42 billion, but the deal fell through due to FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy last November. Last month, Voyager said it would liquidate its assets and close its business after Binance US rejected a deal to buy Voyager&#8217;s assets for $1 billion.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-840.png"><img decoding="async" width="2105" height="1579" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-840.png" alt="Voyager Digital Users Expect To Receive Initial Compensation Before June 1" class="wp-image-188234" title="Voyager Digital Users Expect To Receive Initial Compensation Before June 1 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The recovery of assets for Voyager customers largely depends on the outcome of the lawsuit with FTX. FTX is seeking to recover a $445.8 million loan repayment for Travel before bankruptcy.</p>



<p>If crypto lending platforms prevail in the FTX case, customers should expect a recovery rate of 63.74%, court documents show. Voyager Digital plans to reimburse customers in the same cryptocurrency that is in the customer&#8217;s account. For cryptocurrencies that Voyager does not support, as well as Voyager&#8217;s proprietary VGX token, the company will use stablecoin USDC to reimburse customers.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>CeFi users are interested in experimenting with DeFi protocols but are concerned about complexity, lack of understanding, and costs as barriers to entry.</em></li>



<li><em>Improved support and educational resources can increase CeFi users&#8217; willingness to trade on decentralized platforms.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Uniswap Labs recently <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/cefi-defi-uniswap-survey" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blog.uniswap.org/cefi-defi-uniswap-survey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surveyed </a>US retail users for using decentralized finance platforms. They found that many CeFi users are interested in experimenting with DeFi protocols but are concerned about complexity, lack of understanding, and costs as barriers to entry.</strong></h5>



<p>Despite these concerns, nearly half of surveyed CeFi users were motivated to experiment with DeFi protocols in the next 12 months. To overcome these barriers, products must focus on designing applications that simplify and abstract complexity unique to crypto. </p>



<p>Transaction fees and costs were also notable barriers to entry. Still, as Ethereum continues to scale and Layer 2 solutions see greater adoption, DeFi will become more economically accessible for price-sensitive users.</p>

<p>Additionally, improved support will help boost the comfort with DeFi. CeFi users cited “Better educational resources” and “Increased user support” as improvements that would increase their willingness to trade on decentralized platforms. Products that target this CeFi segment have already invested in these educational resources. </p>

<p>According to the blog, DeFi is a more straightforward and accessible tech stack for financial markets. It is transparent, self-custodial, and runs on publicly verifiable code instead of middlemen more interested in profits than consumers. However, DeFi is still unfamiliar to the average person as the internet was in the 1990s. </p>



<p>CeFi platforms often offer content and onboarding that helps beginners feel more comfortable exploring crypto. However, these CeFi products still suffer from the same lack of accountability and transparency that plagues the legacy financial system.</p>



<p>The survey focused on CeFi, DeFi, hybrid, and non-crypto users, and they received 1,860 responses whose demographics closely reflected US Census Demographics. The survey results reveal that DeFi can potentially attract a much wider audience. Still, educating and supporting users as they navigate this new landscape will require a concerted effort.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Circle Reserve Fund has added $8.7 billion in overnight repo agreements to its USDC reserves to reduce exposure in the event of a potential US debt default.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Circle Reserve Fund adds $8.7B in overnight <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/cash/en-us/insight-and-education/understanding-repurchase-agreements" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.blackrock.com/cash/en-us/insight-and-education/understanding-repurchase-agreements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repo agreements</a> to USDC reserves, reducing exposure to potential US debt default.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-835.png"><img decoding="async" width="808" height="639" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-835.png" alt="Circle Reserve Fund Protects USDC Reserves With $8.7B In Overnight Repo Agreements" class="wp-image-188218" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-835.png 808w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-835-300x237.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-835-768x607.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-835-750x593.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" title="Circle Reserve Fund Protects USDC Reserves With $8.7B In Overnight Repo Agreements 22"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The Circle Reserve Fund, managed by global investment management giant BlackRock, added <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/cash/en-us/products/329365/circle-reserve-fund" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.blackrock.com/cash/en-us/products/329365/circle-reserve-fund" rel="noreferrer noopener">$8.7 billion</a> in overnight repurchase (repo) agreements to the portfolio as of May 16. This move provides additional protection for the USDC reserve in the unlikely event of a U.S. debt default.</p>



<p>Overnight repo transactions are short-term collateralized loans where the borrower sells security, in this case, U.S. Treasuries, for cash, and agrees to buy back the collateral the next day for a slightly higher price. Big institutional investors with cash to spare park their funds with Wall Street dealers that need funding. The collateral for any such repo transactions excludes securities maturing within three days.</p>



<p>The US Treasury Department is set to run out of cash by early June unless the debt limit is raised. As a result, Circle&#8217;s fund ditched Treasurys that mature beyond the end of this month and rotated the assets into cash or government repo transactions. This move is designed to reduce Circle&#8217;s exposure through a potential breach of the ability of the U.S. government to pay its debts.</p>



<p>Circle&#8217;s decision is interesting, given that it is one of the largest stablecoin issuers that backs its USDC with real-world assets. The move to repo transactions implies that Circle is more concerned about the safety and liquidity of its assets than the yield they generate.</p>



<p>However, the impact of this move on the crypto market is unclear. The USDC is a critical part of the crypto ecosystem, as it is used as a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Any significant changes to the reserve could impact the stability of the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Recently, Grayscale Investments, the world&#8217;s largest digital currency asset manager, faced a dilemma when it <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/05/17/2671509/0/en/Grayscale-Investments-Shares-Update-Regarding-Grayscale-Filecoin-Trust-Registration-Statement-on-Form-10.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/05/17/2671509/0/en/Grayscale-Investments-Shares-Update-Regarding-Grayscale-Filecoin-Trust-Registration-Statement-on-Form-10.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">received </a>a letter from the SEC stating that Filecoin meets the definition of security under federal securities laws. </p>



<p>This has sparked a debate between Grayscale and the SEC regarding the status of FIL. The SEC staff requested that Grayscale withdraw its registration statement for the Filecoin Trust, citing that the underlying asset, FIL, meets the definition of security under federal securities laws.</p>



<p>Grayscale, however, disagrees with the SEC staff&#8217;s determination and contends that FIL is not a security under federal securities laws. Grayscale has pledged to provide a prompt explanation of the legal basis for its position, but it is uncertain whether this will convince the SEC staff. Suppose the SEC staff does not agree with Grayscale&#8217;s position. In that case, Grayscale may need to seek alternative accommodations allowing the Trust to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or consider dissolving the Trust.</p>



<p>The uncertainty surrounding the status of Filecoin has raised many questions among investors and industry experts. If Filecoin is classified as a security, it will be subject to more stringent regulations, which could significantly affect its performance and future prospects. Conversely, if it is not classified as a security, it will be exempt from additional regulations, which could increase investor interest and demand.</p>



<p>Investors can find the Trust&#8217;s Annual Report and other disclosures on the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=y6sQvRV1ndLaQdXq9mQX-wjFvUl9d7tU60vBicMyP0kLo-zhnywkEanYSQwlqH2QFu9JDEkIkpNa7bqaBtyITPLWqFXqXTo4R0nuNmVCZ53lNBO2PXWaU23av_yvCezZiIx2Hf64UE9GFns2kvxibvV4s1qP7anPQMoSb94l5bo=" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=y6sQvRV1ndLaQdXq9mQX-wjFvUl9d7tU60vBicMyP0kLo-zhnywkEanYSQwlqH2QFu9JDEkIkpNa7bqaBtyITPLWqFXqXTo4R0nuNmVCZ53lNBO2PXWaU23av_yvCezZiIx2Hf64UE9GFns2kvxibvV4s1qP7anPQMoSb94l5bo=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OTCQB website</a>.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Three key Uniswap contributors have begun negotiations to investigate a possible deployment on Coinbase&#8217;s Layer 2 blockchain Base.</em></li>



<li><em>If the proposal is approved, GFX Labs will be responsible for the technical implementation of the contracts on Base.</em></li>



<li><em>It will be beneficial to Base when the DEX deploys on the blockchain.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Contributors of Uniswap have started to discuss the potential of deploying on Coinbase&#8217;s Layer 2 Base.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-831.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="516" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-831-1024x516.png" alt="Uniswap Contributors Propose To Extend The DEX to Layer 2 Base" class="wp-image-188209" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-831-1024x516.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-831-300x151.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-831-768x387.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-831-1536x774.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-831-2048x1032.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-831-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-831-750x378.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-831-1140x575.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Uniswap Contributors Propose To Extend The DEX to Layer 2 Base 28"></a></figure></div>


<p>Three groups of Uniswap contributors <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-base/21249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> the proposal: she256, Michigan Blockchain, and GFX Labs. The proposal&#8217;s backers are members of Uniswap&#8217;s decentralized autonomous organization. One of the three, GFX Labs, will be in charge of the contract&#8217;s technical implementation on Base, but only if the proposal is accepted.</p>



<p>If the request is approved, it will be a boost to Coinbase&#8217;s project. The exchange initially unveiled a testnet version of Base in February, ahead of a planned mainnet debut later this year, with the goal of providing developers with a more accessible, cost-effective platform for creating decentralized applications on-chain.</p>



<p>One of the most popular decentralized financial apps is Uniswap v3. For the previous 24 hours, the decentralized exchange protocol that permits token swaps handled about $500 million in trade activity on the Ethereum mainnet alone.</p>



<p>v3 is now accessible on numerous EVM-compatible chains, including Ethereum, Celo, BNB Chain, and other Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum. Contributors are now focusing on Base as the next possible launch network.</p>

<p>The Uniswap Foundation suggested shortly after Base&#8217;s testnet debut that the governance process to install Uniswap&#8217;s version 3 on Base will begin, despite Base being in the test phase.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Uniswap <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186910-uniswap-overtakes-coinbase-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outperformed</a> Coinbase in terms of trade volume in April, marking the fourth month in a row. The DEX is a decentralized trading mechanism that comes in three flavors and is accessible on six different blockchains. Coinbase, on the other hand, only supports Ethereum and other EVM-compliant networks.</p>



<p>The Uniswap community has <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187496-uniswap-v3-deployment-to-moonbeam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the v3 deployment be resumed on Polkadot&#8217;s EVM-compatible parachain, Moonbeam.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>To avoid unlawful digital currency transactions, Pakistan has decided to block cryptocurrency services accessible on the internet in the nation.</em></li>



<li><em>After being put on the grey list in 2018, the nation was removed in October 2022.</em></li>



<li><em>The central bank of the country also said that crypto is a complete scam that would never be acknowledged.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aisha Ghaus, Pakistan&#8217;s Secretary of State for Finance, said that the Asian nation could not authorize cryptocurrency trading due to its removal from the Financial Action Task Force&#8217;s (FATF) &#8220;Grey List.&#8221;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-828.png"><img decoding="async" width="1199" height="717" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-828.png" alt="Pakistan Will Never Legalize Crypto Because Of Fraud Concerns" class="wp-image-188203" title="Pakistan Will Never Legalize Crypto Because Of Fraud Concerns 32"></a></figure></div>


<p>The minister further said that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the IT Ministry had begun working on a crypto ban. The Minister also said that the Financial Action Task Force had placed rules and that cryptocurrencies would not be permitted. This would imply that all cryptocurrency-related websites and services would be prohibited.</p>



<p>Although some governments debate cryptocurrency legalization, others continue to tighten down on their usage, and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/171690-pakistan-banks-blockchain-ekyc-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pakistan</a> is among the countries where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been contentious from their inception.</p>



<p>Pasha, a major member of the finance team headed by Ishaq Dar, said unequivocally that the government has not formally accepted cryptocurrency as legal cash. The central bank of the nation issued cautions about the hazards of cryptocurrencies and recommended financial institutions not to assist their usage.</p>



<p>The central bank further said that crypto is a complete scam that would never be accepted in Pakistan. Federal Investigation and the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) also ruled against Pakistani cryptocurrency investment.</p>



<p>SBP officials, according to local media sources, condemned cryptocurrency as pure fraud that would never be accepted in the nation. They cited anti-crypto efforts by major economies such as the United States, China, and Canada as reasons why the government should follow suit.</p>



<p>Pakistan has experienced a surge in cryptocurrency trading and mining, with thousands of views of relevant social media videos and online exchange transactions.</p>



<p>Mining for cryptocurrencies thrived in Pakistan until April 2018, when the government prohibited trading and mining virtual currencies. Despite the fact that many mining farms have been closed since the ban&#8217;s implementation, there is still a growing mining sector.</p>



<p>Most exchanges operate via ghost partners and are never detected by regulators. Nonetheless, the government has been working hard to put a halt to crypto trading.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fahrenheit, a consortium led by blockchain-based venture capital company Arrington Capital, leads the auction for insolvent lender Celsius.</em></li>



<li><em>The new offers are &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; greater than NovaWulf&#8217;s first bid.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/celsius-bankruptcy-auction-nears-end-with-fahrenheit-lead-2023-05-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em> report, the consortium Fahrenheit, which comprises venture capital firm Arrington Capital and miner U.S. Bitcoin Inc, is the top bidder in the auction for insolvent lender Celsius&#8217;s $2 billion in assets.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-827.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-827-1024x682.png" alt="Fahrenheit Is Now Leds The Celsius Bankruptcy Auction" class="wp-image-188201" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-827-1024x682.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-827-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-827-768x511.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-827-750x499.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-827-1140x759.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-827.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Fahrenheit Is Now Leds The Celsius Bankruptcy Auction 35"></a></figure></div>


<p>Celsius attorney Ross Kwasteniet told United States Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn that the auction took longer than anticipated but was very competitive. According to him, the new offers are &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; greater than the first proposal made by NovaWulf LLC, a digital asset investment business.</p>



<p>The initial bidder, NovaWulf, an investment entity created by the team behind bitcoin miner <a href="https://news.coincu.com/164212-terawulf-restructures-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TeraWulf</a>, set the auction conditions.</p>



<p>According to court records, the assets include Celsius&#8217;s mining operation, loan portfolio, staked cryptocurrencies, and other alternative investments.</p>



<p>Arrington Capital, U.S. Data Mining Group, investment company Proof Group Capital Management, former Algogrand CEO Steven Kokinos, and investment banker Ravi Kaza are among the investors in Fahrneheit. It is legally recognized as a limited liability business.</p>



<p>Celsius intends to pick between the Fahrenheit and NovaWulf proposals since both provide a method to maintain Celsius&#8217;s loan and bitcoin mining operations. Celsius has not set a date for final proposals, but Kwasteniet expects the auction to complete within a week.</p>



<p>BRIC&#8217;s proposal, which would solely protect the mining industry, will act as a backup bidder if the Fahrenheit or NovaWulf bids are rejected by regulators.</p>



<p>Kwasteniet believes Celsius will not suffer the same fate as Voyager Digital, a crypto lending startup forced to liquidate when regulatory worries thwarted Binance.US&#8217;s effort to purchase it.</p>



<p>In a now-deleted tweet, Michael Arrington, founder of the synonymous VC company, indicated Coinbase is also interested in the proposal. Another consortium, consisting of Van Eck Absolute Return Advisers Corporation, decentralized finance business Global X Digital, and Gemini Trust Company, submitted a proposal.</p>
