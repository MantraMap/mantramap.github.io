<h2><b>Paypal Earnings Insight</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to first quarter </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001633917/195d9afa-779f-4932-b227-90f0a170923e.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">reports filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), PayPal claimed a combined total of $943 million in cryptocurrency assets as of March 31, 2023. Remarkably, this was a significant increase from the previous quarter, when PayPal reported that it held around $604 million in cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Specifically, PayPal’s crypto holdings comprise $499 million in Bitcoin (up from $291 million in December), $362 million in Ether (up from $250 million), and $82 million in Bitcoin Cash BCH and Litecoin (up from $63 million).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, the online platform reported total financial liabilities for the quarter were $1.2 billion, with crypto assets accounting for 77.9%, indicating an increase of more than 10% from the reported Q4 liabilities for 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notably, the company has been expanding its cryptocurrency offerings since it launched its crypto service in the United States in 2021. The service allows users to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/education/how-to-buy-ethereum-using-paypal-in-minutes-beginners-guide-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400">buy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies directly through their PayPal accounts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, it appears that the payments corporation, which owns </span><a href="https://coingape.com/__trashed-3/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Venmo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, does not actually keep the crypto assets in its possession but rather relies on other parties to provide custodial services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Interestingly, the company acknowledges that this poses a liability for customers if third-party processors are unable to execute transactions. However, the SEC filing also states that no such failure has yet occurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is worth noting that the company had faced several oppositions in its quest to dominate the crypto space. For instance, Elon Musk had </span><a href="https://coingape.com/elon-musk-hints-of-building-payment-app-to-compete-with-paypal/"><span style="font-weight: 400">indicated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that he was working on a Twitter payment processor that will be superior to PayPal.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Significance of PayPal Inc’s Increased Crypto Holdings</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">PayPal&#8217;s expanded cryptocurrency holdings demonstrate the company&#8217;s belief in the future of digital currencies. The move also reflects the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, which are increasingly seen as legitimate investment assets by major financial institutions and corporations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, PayPal&#8217;s growing holdings may benefit the value of the cryptocurrencies it holds. As PayPal continues to buy and retain more cryptocurrencies, the demand for those assets rises, potentially driving up their prices.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="720" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/27225815/Polygon-blockchain-1.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="google polygon" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATIC Price Analysis: The MATIC coin has been in a correction phase for nearly three months, during which the price plunged from the top of $1.56 to the current price of $0.87, registering a total loss of 44.38%. Amid this downfall, the buyers lost crucial monthly support of $0.94, indicating the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/#:~:text=The%20live%20Polygon%20price%20today,MATIC%20coins%20and%20a%20max.">Polygon price</a> is poised for further correction. Here are the important levels to watch if the market witnesses prolong selling pressure.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A downsloping trendline gives specific direction to the ongoing correction phase.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A death crossover between the 50-and-200-day EMA could increase selling pressure in the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC is $431.5 Million, indicating a 1.8% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/g/gPlVEACq.png" alt="MATIC Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 8th, the MATIC price gave a decisive breakdown from the local support level of $0.94. This support level aligned with the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> accentuates the significance of this chart level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, a correction to the 50% FIB is considered healthy for the overall uptrend, but a breakdown below it starts reflecting weakness in bullish momentum. By the press time, the Polygon coin trades at the $0.874 mark, and the 2.89% loss reflects the suitable follow-up for this breakdown.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-cryptos-private-sale/">Best Cryptos Private Sale For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, in the coming trading days, the MATIC price may retest the $0.94 support as potential resistance and check price sustainability below the breakdown points. This retest could offer a short-selling opportunity to traders which may tumble the prices 15% down to revisit the December 2022 bottom support of $0.75.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a downsloping trendline is carrying this correction phase, and thus a breakout may signal the buyer&#8217;s attempt to regain trend control.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The falling 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> may offer additional dynamic resistance to lead the current retracement phase.</span></p>
<p><b>Relative strength index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> plunged to the oversold region reflects a minor pullback that is likely to stabilize the ongoing downtrend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATIC Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.877</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.94 and $1.03</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $0.75 and $0.7</span></li>
</ul>

His judgement was pronounced by United States District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan Federal Court. The judge has ordered Wahi to surrender by June 21st by 2pm in Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution in New Jersey.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wahi is a former product manager at the American cryptocurrency exchange. He leveraged his position at Coinbase to make huge profits for new token listings before they went public. He was able to achieve this feat together with his brother Nikhil Wahi and an associate Sameer Ramani. Altogether, they traded 55 digital assets between June 2021 and April 2022. In the end, the profit they all made amounted to a total of about $1.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were arrested in July 2022 by authorities when they were trying to catch a flight to India. In the end, the brothers pleaded guilty to the charges against them while Ishan </span><a href="https://coingape.com/court-to-consider-coinbases-lawsuit-against-sec-in-insider-trading-case/"><span style="font-weight: 400">agreed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to a sentence of between 36 and 47 months. He cited other insider trading cases that got little or no prison sentence. When Nikhi pled guilty in September 2022, he got a sentence of 10 months. Ramani is still missing and is yet to be apprehended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Several prosecutors insisted that Ishan got a sentence longer than three years so that he would serve as a lesson to others who may be considering committing a similar crime. So far, this is the second insider trading case that has been been escalated by US regulators over the past few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the second being the insider trading allegations </span><a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-opensea-ex-manager-convicted-in-nft-insider-trading/"><span style="font-weight: 400">levied against OpenSea’s Nathaniel Chastain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Just like Wahi, Chastain often buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) billed to be listed and featured on the platform’s front page. In all, Chastain raked in thousands of dollars in illegal profits.</span></p>
<h2><b>Coinbase Insider Trading Case to Set Rare Precedent</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sentence handed down to Ishan Wahi is a very significant one as it will serve as a major precedent upon which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can push for crackdown for other crypto industry insiders committing related offences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite its complexity as it is featuring digital collectibles, the OpenSea’s Chastain’s case may see a more direct settlement in the near term.</span></p>

He made the bearish comment over the lack of high quality and high user presence in blockchain based applications, in the context of expanding the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/web-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web 3.0</a> further into the mainstream world. Acknowledging the power of layer blockchains Bitcoin and Ethereum, he said the craze around memecoins will not help the market&#8217;s bigger cause.</p>

<p>Speaking about the recent craze around memecoins like the Pepe Coin, Nailwal said the constant demand for memecoins is not a good sign for the industry. This is not a good sign for the crypto market in the eyes of investors and regulators.</p>
<h2>Sandeep Nailwal Disappointed With PEPE Coin Rise</h2>
<p>Speaking about the recent rise in demand for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memecoins</a>, the Polygon cofounder said memecoins don’t help the bigger cause, when asked about PEPE during a Twitter <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1mrGmkYPyzgxy/peek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space</a>. He, however, acknowledged that there was no doubt that Bitcoin and Ethereum are the bellwethers of the crypto industry.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Not a good sign for crypto that institutions and investors see the rise of memecoins. Sad that memecoins keep coming and is not a good sign for the market in the eyes of investors and regulators.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Nailwal also made a comment about the development space in blockchain. He said he was bearish about it as there are no real high quality applications in the blockchain space. Ideally, the applications should have capacity to handle 50 to 100 million users, he added.</p>

The rising selling pressure prolonged the correction phase in these coins projecting a dip opportunity for interested traders; Here’s a list of the top 3 cryptocurrencies that are likely to resume their recovery in the near future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xrp(XRP) </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/c/CsPhgyQA.png" alt="XRP" width="1946" height="1105" />cSource- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing correction in the crypto market, the XRP price has witnessed a significant downfall over a month and plunged to a crucial support zone of $0.432-$0.42. However, this retracement phase responds to the famous bullish continuation pattern called ‘<a href="https://coingape.com/education/bull-flag-pattern-in-crypto-meaning-and-how-to-identify/">Flag</a>’. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a> traded at $0.425 and tried to support the pattern’s lower trendline and $0.43-$12 zone. Under the influence of this pattern, the coin price is a rebound from this level and breaches the overhead trendline resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential breakout will signal the resumption of a bullish recovery and set the XRP price to revisit the $0.55 high.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainlink(LINK)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/v/vO9cUxPq.png" alt="link" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 8th, the chainlink price gave a bearish breakdown from the neckline support of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/head-and-shoulder-pattern-how-to-identify-it-on-a-crypto-chart/">head and shoulder pattern</a>. This bearish reversal pattern may accelerate the underlying selling pressure in the LINK price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, this altcoin trades at $6.5 with an intraday loss of 1.17%. However, with sustained selling the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/chainlink/">Chainlink coin price</a> is poised for a 16% and revisit the $5.5-$5.4 support zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aforementioned level prevented sellers from pushing the LINK price any lower, acting as a strong accumulation zone.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano (ADA)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/1/1nOM6jgJ.png" alt="Cardano" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cardano coin in the daily chart shows a change in the trend-defining Dow Theory. The prior price action of lower lows and lower highs has switched to higher highs and higher lows as shown in the above chart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, connecting the lows of the rising <a href="https://coingape.com/price/cardano/">ADA price</a>, the technical chart shows a new support trendline, carrying the ongoing recovery rally. As of the Cardano price trades at $0.36 and is retesting the aforementioned support trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coin price shows sustainability above the trendline, interested buyers may find an entry opportunity that could lead to a fresh recovery rally.</span></p>

The regulations cover a wide range of issues, including the issuance and trading of crypto assets, the operation of crypto assets service providers, and the protection of investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Undoubtedly regulatory clarity is a major determinant in instilling confidence </span><span style="font-weight: 400">among investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">According to insights gleaned from a</span> <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1655883224726241281?t=u70CqjuWTXCDfxO8t8iNuw&amp;s=19" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">Twitter post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, VC investment in the EU is up by about 5.9% in the first quarter of 2022 to 47.6% in Q1 of 2023. This significant leap represents about 10X growth in about a year in the influx of VC investments since the novel MiCA bill was approved.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The MiCA effect <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1ea-1f1fa.png" alt="🇪🇺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><b>Impacts of Clear Regulations</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With clear regulations in the form of MiCA, the EU with a market of 450 million consumers is clearly on its path to becoming the next hub for crypto projects. Recall that as many as 517 European lawmakers </span><a href="https://coingape.com/eu-parliament-votes-in-to-pass-mica-bitcoin-drops-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400">voted in favor of the MiCA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, while 38 decided to vote against it, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">a sign that the support for comprehensive regulation is high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Prior to the introduction of the MiCA bill, there was a lack of clear regulatory guidelines for crypto assets in Europe. This resulted in a situation where investors were uncertain about the level of protection they could expect when investing in crypto assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the MiCA bill has addressed this issue by providing a harmonized regulatory framework that establishes clear rules and standards for the issuance and trading of crypto assets.</span></p>
<h2><b>MiCA Set to Shape the Crypto Industry</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under the regulations, all crypto asset services providers like exchanges, wallet providers, and other service providers will be required to obtain a license from their national regulator in order to operate in the EU. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likewise, the MiCA regulations also introduce a number of new requirements for crypto assets issuers. Issuers will be required to provide detailed disclosures to investors, including information about the underlying assets and the risks associated with investing in the asset. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another key aspect of the MiCA regulation is the introduction of a framework for </span><a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/stablecoin-news/"><span style="font-weight: 400">stablecoins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. As such, the MiCA regulations create a new category of stablecoins called “asset-referenced tokens”, which are subject to a lighter regulatory regime than other types of crypto assets.</span></p>

He has also suggested that regulators may crack down on crypto influencers who promote crypto products online without disclosing their related financial interests.</p>
<h2>Ireland Against Unbacked Crypto</h2>
<p>In a <a rel='nofollow'  rel='nofollow'  rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.centralbank.ie/news/article/blog-crypto-and-how-we-can-protect-the-consumer" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> published on the Central Bank&#8217;s website, Makhlouf stated that the purchase of cryptocurrencies is similar to purchasing a lottery ticket: &#8220;<em>You might win but you probably won&#8217;t.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that such products should not be described as investments and that the Central Bank is concerned about the potential for consumer harm.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In the case of crypto, this market is developing at pace and the risks to consumers and investors are rising, particularly as these products remain unregulated&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Criticizing the aggressive advertising of cryptocurrencies, he emphasized the need for transparency in the promotion of crypto products and said that influencers should disclose their related financial interests.</p>
<p>Recently, on April 18, 2023, the Central Bank of Ireland granted VASP authorization to Payward Europe Solutions, an Irish affiliate of <a rel='nofollow'  rel='nofollow'  rel='nofollow'  href="https://blog.kraken.com/post/18446/kraken-secures-virtual-asset-service-provider-vasp-registration-in-ireland/" rel="nofollow">Kraken</a> with its headquarters in Dublin. <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-establishes-7th-firm-in-ireland/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-coinbase-receives-vasp-license-in-ireland-amid-falling-market-cap/">Coinbase</a> expanded in the country last year in October and December respectively.</p>
<p>There is a case-by-case determination of whether a cryptocurrency can be regulated in Ireland. For example, currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ether do not fall under the existing regulations in Ireland because they are not “centrally issued and give no rights or entitlements to holders.”</p>
<h2>Supports EU MiCA Regulation</h2>
<p>The European Parliament <a href="https://coingape.com/eu-parliament-votes-in-to-pass-mica-bitcoin-drops-2/">recently</a> passed the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, which set common standards across Europe for supervising crypto firms. Makhlouf welcomed the regulations and suggested that regulators in Ireland and the EU would be tightening controls on the industry following recent collapses of crypto assets like TerraUSD stablecoin and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/Crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> FTX.</p>
<p>Makhlouf said that crypto would be supervised like any other financial market in proportion to the risks it posed, adding that crypto firms would eventually have to protect client funds, maintain high standards of governance and disclose relevant information just like mainstream financial firms.</p>

A top Dogecoin whale has moved almost 2 billion DOGE on Tuesday and has only 1 DOGE in the wallet. Typically, large whale activity follows massive price movement. Is DOGE price on the brink of a crash?</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Whale Moves 2 Billion DOGE</h2>
<p>On May 9, a whale <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/dogecoin/30d2792c37a4d55d0a3bd73161b18b17ff58e2a35c53648633929b08a43b2cf3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dumped</a> 300 million Dogecoin (DOGE) tokens worth $21.73 million to the crypto exchange Binance, as per WhaleStats.</p>
<p>However, the on-chain <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://blockchair.com/dogecoin/address/DDCRBABw7b1U7gSmgstb5SHWRS7gTqRWBc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> revealed that the Dogecoin whale has moved 1.98 billion DOGE worth $160 million in a transaction at 8.50 AM UTC. The whale sent 300 million to Binance and 1.68 billion to a new wallet address. The wallet address is now the 8th largest wallet holding, accounting for 1.21% of total Dogecoins.</p>
<p>Other whales are also dumping DOGE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) for either buying PEPE or temporarily exiting the market. In the last 24 hours, 2.20 billion DOGE coins have been moved.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu whales are also dumping SHIB for PEPE. A whale sold 6 million SHIB for buying 325 billion in mid-April and made millions by making the decision, as per <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1654351841189318658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> by Lookonchain.</p>

<h2>Will DOGE Price Crash?</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOGE price</a> fell over 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.073. The 24-hour low and high are $0.070 and $0.075, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased in the last 24 hours amid the selloff by whales.</p>
<p>DOGE price is trading below key levels and the probability of hitting the $0.065 support level is higher. Whales have likely seen this scenario as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin continue their downfall.</p>

This famous bullish reversal pattern is usually spotted at market tops and increases underlying selling momentum in a coin. From the breakdown point near $0.38, the altcoin plunged 3.5% and is currently trading at $0.367. Here’s how traders may grab a short-selling opportunity from this pattern.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish breakdown from the head and shoulder neckline encourages sellers to 18% fall</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ADA price plunged below the daily EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) indicating a potential rally may face multiple resistance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the ADA coin is $272.5 Million, indicating an 8% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EGAtYp7v.png" alt="Cardano Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/cardano/">Cardano price</a> is 0.38% and shows a green Doji candle in the daily. This candle of uncertainty formed after a downfall hints the ADA price may witness a minor bullish pullback to retest the breached neckline of the H&amp;S pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This retest will validate the price sustainability below the breached level of $0.38 and offer a short-selling opportunity to traders. Under ideal conditions, H&amp;S pattern breakdown offers a potential fall of the same distance between the head peak and neckline.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-web-3-phones-and-their-specifications/">Top Web 3 Phones And Their Specifications</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the ADA price is likely to tumble 18% and hit the March month bottom support of $0.3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, in the daily chart, a new resistance trendline is carrying the ongoing correction phase. Therefore, a breakout above this trendline will invalidate the bearish thesis and assist buyers to reclaim higher grounds.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> dives deeper into the bearish territory indicating the high bearish momentum in the market.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A potential bearish crossover between the 20-and-50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a> may offer a sell signal to market participants.</span></p>

<h2>Ripple Moves Ahead To Promote CBDC</h2>
<p>As per the report, Ripple estimates that CBDCs could grow from $100 million today to $213 billion by 2030. It stated multiple examples of why this surge might come ahead.</p>
<p>Ripple mentioned that the Central Bank of Brazil is launching a CBDC by 2024. While the Central Bank of Montenegro also pitched a pilot project around CBDC with Ripple. However, the Bank of England is expected to move forward with work around a digital pound.</p>
<p>It added that Digital Currency Monetary Authority dropped the Universal Monetary Unit (UMU) designed to push cross border transactions. <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/?utm_source=menubar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</a></strong></p>

However, the biggest transaction recorded by the tracker has been of moving 113.3 million XRP (approx worth $51.6 million) among unknown wallets.</p>
<p>However, whales have moved 60 million XRP (approx worth $13.3 million) in order to dump the token. A whale address moved 31 million XRP (approx worth $13 million) to the Bitstamp crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a whale address accumulated 50 million XRP (approx worth $21.8 million) amid the recent price dip. XRP price is down by 3% in the last 24 hours. It is trading at an average price of $0.42, at the press time.</p>

The memecoin was, in fact, at one stage leading the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> rally following its listing on Binance. However, a PEPE Coin price surge by 34 times over the last three weeks was followed by significant correction to the 300% weekly rise after the Binance listing announcement. Interestingly, the monumental rise in value for the memecoin came at a time when the bulk of crypto tokens were suffering from weekly losses.</p>

<h2>Pepe Coin Vs Shiba Inu</h2>
<p>An interesting similarity emerged when trading data for PEPE and SHIB were compared in initial days after Binance listing. The Shiba Inu memecoin was listed in the Binance innovation zone on May 10, 2021, almost two years prior to the PEPE listing. But it was the peak of the 2021 bull run scenario when Shiba Inu was listed, compared to the bearish environment in the current cycle. Yet, PEPE&#8217;s daily trading volume numbers have been almost close to that of SHIB in the first few days of Binance listing. To put it in perspective, SHIB&#8217;s first 10 days trading volume was at $2.21 billion, compared to PEPE&#8217;s $2.075 billion in the first four days.</p>

On April 8th, the daily chart showed a long-tail rejection called at a lower support trendline indicating the buyers are actively accumulating at this support which may lead to a potential reversal. Here’s how this pattern may further influence the XRP’s coin future trend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price is falling for four consecutive days reflecting aggressive selling pressure in the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish crossover between the 20-and-50-day EMAs may accelerate selling pressure in the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.1 Billion, indicating a 16% gain.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/m/myiSpAWT.png" alt="XRP Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ongoing correction in the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP coin price</a> is currently following a bullish flag pattern, under the influence of this pattern, the coin price witnessed a temporary pullback which continues to resonate within two converging trendlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the XRP price trades at $0.429 and hovers above the support trendline of this pattern. Moreover, the aforementioned trendline is currently aligned with an important monthly support of $0.43-$0.42, creating a strong accumulation zone for traders.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also read: <a href="https://coingape.com/ways-to-earn-passive-income-crypto/">Top 10 Ways To Earn Passive Income From Crypto In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the signs of bullish reversal from this level will more likely surge the XRP price back to overhead resistance, recording a 10% potential growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, the coin holders will get a better confirmation for a price recovery once the price breaches the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> near the oversold region indicates that investors may want to accumulate XRP at a cheaper price.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the recent downfall, the coin buyers lose the 200-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> support. If the coin price couldn’t reclaim this EMA in the coming days, the XRP may witness strong selling pressure.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.424</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Saga is a phone and much more. You can enjoy a simplified web3 experience with Seed Vault, a secure self-custody solution that protects your keys through biometric authentication and encryption,” the announcement reads, adding that, “With the Solana dApp Store, Saga users can access decentralized apps without having to interact and sign transactions through their desktop web browser.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saga was born out of Anatoly Yakovenko&#8217;s imagination to wield a handheld computer even before Apple came up with the first iPhone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was not until June 2022 that the Solana Labs Chief Executive Officer (CEO) announced the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-solana-labs-launches-android-phone-saga-but-will-it-impress-investors/"><span style="font-weight: 400">potential launch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of the mobile Android device. It was described as a phone with unique functionalities and features that are closely connected to the Solana network.</span></p>
<h2><b>Saga to Offer Premium User Experience With Features</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Potential users of the phone were assured of the capability of the phone to perform transactions inweb3, trade tokens, mint Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming on-chain, access decentralized applications (dApps). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In terms of specification, Saga has a 6.6-inch display, 512 GB of storage and private key security features. It was even recently </span><a href="https://coingape.com/top-web-3-phones-and-their-specifications/"><span style="font-weight: 400">listed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as one of the top Web3.0 phones with eye-catching specifications by CoinGape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A premium mobile experience that enables you to trade tokens while waiting in line for coffee, mint NFTs on your morning commute, and have instant access to the dApps you love most, anywhere, anytime – all powered by Android,” the phone’s description reads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some sources mentioned that the phone was going to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/solana-mobile-hints-at-saga-launch-date/"><span style="font-weight: 400">debut</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in April but it was already available for preorder on the website. The news of it&#8217;s debut even caused the price of the SOL token to jump at the time of launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that it has been made available, Saga owners will be given a Saga genesis token (NFT) upon setting up their device. This token will be used to access some of the DApps hosted on its personalized app store.</span></p>

Earlier, CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-expands-support-for-pepe-and-floki-price-to-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Binance listed another memecoin Pepe Coin (PEPE) and FLOKI in the innovation zone. The addition came amid renewed demand for the memecoin category in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a>, while PEPE Coin rose steadily to become the 57th ranked cryptocurrency by market cap.</p>
<p>Also Read: <a rel='nofollow'  href="http://coingape.com/expert-shares-bitcoin-doge-pepe-investing-strategy-at-bloomberg-event" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Expert Shares Bitcoin, DOGE, PEPE Investing Strategy At Bloomberg Event</strong></a></p>
<p>Following the recent demand after Binance listing, Floki Inu price stands a chance to breach the $0.0000685 neckline resistance, CoinGape price analysis <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/floki-price-analysis-floki-price-will-witness-60-rally-if-these-conditions-are-met/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>. On the other side, PEPE Coin too displayed some correction after the sudden spike with the Binance listing.</p>
<h2>The Floki Ecosystem</h2>
<p>The Floki Inu developers claim to be developing a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/RealFlokiInu/status/1655851197100703744?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three pronged solution</a> to expand its reach in the crypto market. The Valhalla Play To Earn game allows gamers to earn by playing blockchain games. The project is set to go live on mainnet sometime later in 2023. The memecoin is also focused on the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) game. The FlokiFi DeFi ecosystem is focused on creating useful DeFi solutions. Besides, the University of Floki crypto education platform powers new entrants with teachings on the crypto market. More importantly, all these three offerings are powered by the $FLOKI token, which could potentially unlock new sources of liquidity if they gain more traction.</p>
<p>Overall, Floki Inu is also influenced by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who recently <a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-elon-musk-declaring-new-ceo-pumps-dogecoin-floki-inu-shiba-inu-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a post that described Floki as the &#8220;new CEO of Twitter.”</p>

In the past two months, the coin price has bounced thrice from the support trendline indicating the buyers are actively accumulating at dips. Will buyers prolong the recovery further or sellers retake trend control?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple technical levels accumulated near the $1827 reflect a highly concentrated support.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullish reversal signs at the $1827 level project a potential upswing to $2000 </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $7.8 Billion, indicating a 10% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/h1azc41k.png" alt="Ethereum Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price falling from the past four days consecutively shows a drop from a $2000 high to an $1827 low, registering a 9% loss. This downfall brought the coin price to a high concentrated support zone at $1827.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aforementioned $1827 horizontal support level is also accompanied by an ascending trendline and a 23.6% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> creating a strong accumulation zone. Yesterday, the daily chart showed a long-tail rejection candle at $1827 support, indicating the buyers continue to defend this level.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">Best Cryptos Private Sale For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the Ethereum price trades at the $1855 mark, and the rejection candle at support reflects a high possibility for a bullish reversal. Thus, the Ethereum price may surge 8% this week and rechallenge the $2000 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the bullish momentum rises, a breakout above this $2000 resistance will encourage buyers to surpass the last swing high of $2130.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown below the support trendline will intensify the selling pressure and plunge the ETH price for a longer correction. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slight incline in the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> as Ethereum price retests the $1827 support indicates the buying pressure is rising for a potential reversal</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Along with other support levels mentioned, the 50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope also brings additional assistance for buyers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1854</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market has always been known for its volatility, but this is particularly true when it comes to meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe. These coins are highly speculative and often lack any intrinsic value, which makes them subject to extreme price swings. Dogecoin, also known as DOGE, hit its lowest price when it <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/expert-shares-bitcoin-doge-pepe-investing-strategy-at-bloomberg-event/" title="Expert Shares Bitcoin, DOGE, PEPE Investing Strategy At Bloomberg Event"></a></p>

These coins are highly speculative and often lack any intrinsic value, which makes them subject to extreme price swings.</p>
<p>Dogecoin, also known as DOGE, hit its lowest price when it briefly attained a price of $0.0000869 on May 7, 2015. On the other hand, it attained its highest price on May 8, 2021, with a price of $0.682 per Dogecoin. Its price has fallen significantly in the last 7 days, down by 7.29% but still has a market cap of $10,137,034,921.</p>
<p>Similarly, the price of the PEPE token has also been highly volatile. It is down 10.96% in the last 24 hours despite the 500% surge in the past two weeks. The price of PEPE has already lost 50% of its maximum value just after the largest <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> Binance announced the listing of the meme coin. Since then, the price of PEPE has decreased rapidly from $0.0000044 to $0.0000022, currently $0.000002003.</p>
<h2>What Helps With Crypto Volatility?</h2>
<p>Given this extreme volatility, it&#8217;s important for investors to approach meme coins with caution and follow sound investment principles. This is where Venn Link CEO Cici Lu&#8217;s advice on the crypto portfolio needs a spotlight.</p>
<p>At the <a rel='nofollow'  rel='nofollow'  rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/BloombergLive/status/1655820328810209282?s=20" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg Wealth Asia Summit 2023</a> in Hong Kong on May 9, 2023, Venn Link CEO Cici Lu shared her thoughts on the volatile nature of crypto assets.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to Lu, &#8220;When it comes to investing in crypto assets, it&#8217;s really important to have diversification and active management.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>She emphasized that diversification and active management are key principles that investors should follow when investing in crypto assets, particularly in the volatile meme coin market.</p>
<p>Different crypto assets often react differently to market changes, so diversifying investments across them can help mitigate losses. Active management involves regularly monitoring and adjusting investment portfolios in response to market changes to maximize returns and minimize risk.</p>
<p>In the case of meme coins, diversification can mean investing in other cryptocurrencies with more established track records and less volatility, such as <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>. By doing so, investors can reduce the risk of putting all their eggs in one basket and suffering significant losses.</p>

<p>The transfer has come almost a year after the Terra-LUNA crisis that duped $40 billion in investors&#8217; money and started a crackdown of the crypto market.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon&#8217;s Firm Terra Transfers 1.8 Million CVX</h2>
<p>Terraform Labs is one of the largest holders of Convex Finance (CVX) and locked large amounts of tokens last year. On May 9, Terraform Labs-linked wallet address moved 1.8 CVX tokens worth nearly $8.7 million to a wallet address starting with 0x15A5, after 277 days of inactivity.</p>
<p>As per Etherscan <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x450062d279f592a2e22322df9e73aac5baaa36e1f323e83d2496f9df55dbbdf8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a>, Terraform Labs transferred 100 CVX tokens to the wallet address 0x15A5. It followed another big transfer of 1.83 million CVX worth $8.7 million to the wallet address 0x15A5. The wallet currently has no CVX tokens now, but holds Convex CRV (cvxCRV) tokens worth $26.5k.</p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Terraform Labs held over 2 million vote-locked </span><span class="r-18u37iz">CVX, but it </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">was marked invalidated from vote locking contract due to inactivity. The last CVX transaction was on August 4, 2022, making today&#8217;s transfer of 1.8M </span><span class="r-18u37iz">CVX </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">the first activity after 277 days.</span></p>
<p>Interestingly, the transaction almost a year after the Terra-LUNA crisis has raised questions about transfers of tokens worth millions.</p>
<p>Terra co-founder <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-founder-do-kwon-extradition-to-south-korea-wsj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Do Kwon was arrested in Montenegro</a> after being on the run for several months.
