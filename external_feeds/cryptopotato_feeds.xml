            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Supporters of war-torn Ukraine have reportedly donated over $225 million worth of crypto to the country in its fight against Russia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prominent companies and figures part of the digital asset industry, such as the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance and Tron&#8217;s founder Justin Sun, have also contributed to the nation&#8217;s efforts.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Strong Start Followed by Stagnation</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a Crystal Blockchain report (<a href="https://fakti.bg/life/803023-taksuvaha-klient-na-restorant-vav-varna-za-tova-che-ne-iska-sos-na-picata-si?utm_source=mobilebg&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=firstpage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">seen</a> by </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CoinDesk</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">), Ukraine has received almost a quarter of a billion dollars in crypto assets as donations since the start of the military conflict with Russia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The authorities have used the funds to purchase ammunition, medical equipment, weapons, and other war supplies to continue resisting the Russian invasion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth mentioning that the largest chunk of the total contributions came in 2022, as they stagnated at the end of last year and the beginning of 2023. The country has received less than $10 million worth of crypto since May.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">March 2022 was the most successful month in terms of donations when Ukraine racked up almost $100 million. February 2022 (when Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin launched the &#8220;special military operation&#8221;) ranked second with over $30 million in digital assets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crystal Blockchain estimated that the most contributions ($83 million) came in the form of USDT. Ethereum (ETH) donations were second, comprising $79 million of the amount, whereas Bitcoin (BTC) ranked third ($41 million).<br />

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul Munter – principal advisor to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on accounting and auditing matters – issued a warning on Thursday to crypto accounting firms whose work is inappropriately marketed as a substitute for “audits.”</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-crypto-072723#_ftnref3" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">statement</a>, titled “The Potential Pitfalls of Purported Crypto “Assurance” Work”, claimed that clients of such firms often promote their work as being at “parity” with a financial statement audit.</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>“Such suggestions are false,” he asserted. “Non-audit arrangements are neither as rigorous nor as comprehensive as a financial statement audit, and may not provide any reasonable assurance to investors.”</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>The advisor referenced a March <a href="https://pcaobus.org/resources/information-for-investors/investor-advisories/investor-advisory-exercise-caution-with-third-party-verification-proof-of-reserve-reports" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a> from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which warned investors of accounting firms providing Proof of Reserves (PoR) reports for crypto exchanges.</li>
<li>PoR is a blockchain-based accounting method that <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/okx-releases-industry-leading-9th-consecutive-proof-of-reserves-in-july-showing-11-3-billion-in-primary-assets/" data-wpel-link="internal">some exchanges</a> have used to verify the number of crypto assets they have on hand. The PCAOB warned that such reports “are not audits,” as they do not account for a crypto firm’s liabilities, among other factors.</li>
<li>Munter’s statement added that accountants servicing crypto firms that mislead investors about the nature of the former’s work could be found liable under securities laws.</li>
<li>If accounting firms find that their clients make misleading statements, the Office of the Chief Accountant (OCA) recommended a “noisy withdrawal, disassociating itself from the client, including by way of its own public statements.”</li>
<li>A similar withdrawal <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-and-crypto-com-auditor-mazars-group-pauzes-work-with-crypto-clients/" data-wpel-link="internal">occurred</a> with Mazars Group in December 2022, when the firm distanced itself from all crypto firms shortly after releasing a PoR report on Binance.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The mine might cease operations during the winter when the hydroelectric station does not produce enough energy.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The President of the Kyrgyz Republic &#8211; Sadyr Japarov &#8211; has reportedly approved the building of a cryptocurrency mining farm at a hydropower plant near the country&#8217;s biggest river &#8211; the Naryn.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The political leader believes this development will allow the hydroelectric station to use its excessive energy since it can not sell it anywhere.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Permission Granted </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a local media outlet, President Japarov has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="http://kg.kabar.kg/news/prezident-sadyr-zhaparov-maining-boiuncha-zhoop-berdi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">allowed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the construction of a crypto mining farm at the Kambar-Ata-2 Hydro Power Plant. The investment will cost approximately $20 million and could be one way to avoid energy losses since there are periods when the station produces more electricity than necessary. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The plant was launched in 2010 and develops 120 MW of energy each year. However, it could employ only 90 MW of this quantity, meaning the remaining 30 MW &#8220;has been absorbed into the air.&#8221; In financial terms, it lost over $37 million due to that flaw. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We have enough electricity on summer days. It even exceeds. We cannot sell anywhere. Therefore, in order to benefit the energy system, we are allowing sites that can carry the load,&#8221; Japarov explained.</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[The SEC shouldn’t approve any Bitcoin spot ETF partnered with Coinbase without approving Grayscale and other applicants at the same time, the company says.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grayscale wrote a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday calling for the agency to simultaneously approve any qualifying Bitcoin spot ETF applications, so as to not &#8220;pick winners and losers.”</p>
<p>However, the firm also argued that Coinbase shouldn’t qualify as a surveillance partner to launch such a product, under the SEC’s pre-established rules.</p>
<h2>Why Coinbase Isn’t Good Enough</h2>
<p>Per the <a href="https://grayscale.com/grayscales-latest-gbtc-comment-letter/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">comment letter</a>, the SEC has already questioned the pricing data produced by ‘unregulated’ Bitcoin trading venues for years.</p>
<p>Grayscale referenced the SEC’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83913.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">explicit denial</a> of the GraniteShares ETP Trust in 2018, which intended to form a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA)with Gemini’s exchange. The SEC determined that Gemini did not represent a regulated market comparable to a national securities exchange.</p>
<p>The firm also pointed out the SEC’s rejection of Grayscale’s ETF application last year showed that the SEC wouldn’t give weight to market data sourced from a group of spot Bitcoin exchanges, including Coinbase. Oversight from both NYSDFS and FinCEN, alongside BitLicense regulation, was deemed irrelevant to whether the SEC would consider the group sufficient for an SSA.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We believe the Commission’s prior decisions have already determined that such an agreement with a venue lacking compulsory investigative authority and oversight by a comprehensive market, regulator does not satisfy Section 6(b)(5) in the absence of a surveillance sharing agreement with a market of significant size,” wrote Grayscale.</p></blockquote>
<p>Grayscale clarified that it was not “disputing the usefulness of information obtainable under a surveillance-sharing agreement with a spot bitcoin trading venue.”</p>
<h2>Grayscale’s Court Battle</h2>
<p>Starting in late June, multiple asset managers – including <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-starts-reviewing-several-spot-bitcoin-etf-including-blackrocks-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">BlackRock</a> – filed with the SEC to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. Many of those firms later named Coinbase as their ideal partner for an SSA to protect against market manipulation, an element of each filing that no applicant has managed to get right by the SEC thus far.</p>
<p>Unlike its friendlier competitors, Grayscale is attempting to convert its Bitcoin fund into an ETF by directly challenging the SEC in <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-has-70-odds-of-winning-sec-lawsuit-bloomberg-analyst/" data-wpel-link="internal">court</a>. The company stands by its thesis that CME Bitcoin Futures represent a market of sufficient size related to the Bitcoin spot market, sufficient for an SSA.</p>
<p>Should the SEC change its mind and approve a Coinbase-partnered ETF, Grayscale said that the agency should at least prioritize investors first – specifically those of its GBTC fund.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Commission would be required to afford the listing exchange for the Trust (and all other spot bitcoin ETPs whose Rule 19b-4 filings were previously disapproved) the opportunity to amend their Rule 19b-4 filings, so that all of these spot bitcoin ETP proposals can be approved simultaneously,” the company stated.</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[If the motion is approved, Zornberg would be the fourth attorney to pull out of the case as it nears its end.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lisa R. Zornberg, a prominent U.S. attorney representing Ripple Labs in the legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is seeking the court&#8217;s approval to withdraw from the case following her appointment as New York Chief Counsel by Mayor Eric Adams.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.880.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">recent filing</a>, Ripple asked the court to grant Zornberg&#8217;s request as she would no longer be associated with the American law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP from July 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>XRP Attorney Pulls Out of Ripple Lawsuit</h2>
<p>Ripple noted that other attorneys, including Andrew J. Ceresney, Erol N. Gulay, and Christopher S. Ford of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP, would continue the legal representation as Zornberg&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/nyregion/eric-adams-lisa-zornberg-chief-counsel.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">exit</a> would neither affect them nor the company&#8217;s interests.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ms. Zornberg&#8217;s withdrawal will not adversely affect the interests of Defendant. Ms. Zornberg is not asserting a retaining or charging lien. WHEREFORE, Defendant Ripple Labs Inc. respectfully requests that the Court grant Lisa R. Zornberg leave to withdraw as attorney of record in this action,&#8221; Ripple said.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Zornberg is not the first attorney to withdraw from the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. If the motion is approved, she would be the fourth to pull out of the case as it nears its end. The court recently greenlighted withdrawal motions from attorneys <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/19857399/873/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-ripple-labs-inc/?redirect_or_modal=True" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Anna R. Gressel</a>, Clayton J. Masterman, and Kylie Chiseul Kim, as they were no longer associated with the law firm representing Ripple.</p>
<h2>Ripple and SEC to Schedule Settlement Conference</h2>
<p>The withdrawals come as Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.879.0_1.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">ordered</a> Ripple and the SEC to devise three mutually convenient dates to schedule a settlement conference. Judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.878.0_2.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">referred</a> the lawsuit to Magistrate Judge Netburn on July 17, a few days after passing a landmark <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-explodes-16-as-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ripple-in-sec-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">verdict</a> on XRP&#8217;s status as a security.</p>
<p>The magistrate judge said Ripple and the SEC could proceed with providing the dates if they believed it would be productive in concluding the matter at hand. She asserted that the settlement conference must be fixed at least six to eight weeks in advance, as the court would be unable to accommodate last-minute requests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it remains unclear if the SEC will appeal Judge Torres&#8217; XRP ruling, even though the agency has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/is-xrp-in-trouble-again-sec-signals-appeal-in-ripple-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">hinted</a> at the possibility in a separate filing against Terraform Labs. Nonetheless, Ripple legal chief Stu Alderoty <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-appeal-will-strengthen-and-uphold-judges-decision-ripple-legal-counsel/" data-wpel-link="internal">believes</a> such a move may affirm and amplify the judge&#8217;s decision.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[As the US government continues turning over its debt at higher rates, can the Federal Reserve afford not to print?]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto investor and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told followers on Wednesday to “Buy BTC” in response to the United States government’s rapidly growing interest expense on its sovereign debt.</p>
<p>To some analysts, the trend suggests that the Federal Reserve will be forced to lower its benchmark interest rate again if the Federal government can no longer keep up.</p>
<h2>The US Debt Problem</h2>
<p>According to market analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeConsorti/status/1684584512318058497" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Joe Consorti</a>, the U.S. government is now paying $970 billion per year in interest payments – up $41 billion from Q2. That’s the highest interest expense of all time by a wide margin, with annual payments only reaching $600 billion as recently as Q1 2022.</p>
<p>Consorti expects interest costs to reach $1 trillion soon. That’s over 20% of the government’s $4.7 trillion federal tax revenue, according to <a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">US Debt Clock</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“As tax receipts continue to lag sovereign debt growth, interest payments will increasingly be funded with revenue from&#8230; more debt issuance,” wrote Consorti to Twitter on Thursday. “Get it now?”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="und" dir="ltr">Buy <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">$BTC</a>!!! <a href="https://t.co/UyGNaGXzyI" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/UyGNaGXzyI</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) <a href="https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1684694364679790592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Interest costs began to surge after the Federal Reserve began its monetary tightening cycle, during which it raised its benchmark rate from 0.25% to 5.25%. It’s also continued to sell Treasury debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, driving up rates for short-term T-bills.</p>
<p>Such rate hikes make it more difficult for the government to roll over its previously issued debt, as new loans force it to pay out buyers at a higher interest rate.</p>
<p>In June, the St. Louis Fed <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2023/06/02/assessing-the-costs-of-rolling-over-government-debt" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">published</a> an essay stating that while interest payments are large in absolute terms, they’re still “relatively small” against the size of the US economy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;However, the longer interest rates stay high, more and more of the fixed-rate marketable portion of the U.S. debt will be rolled over at higher rates, continuing to cause interest payments by the government to become a larger and larger portion of the budget,” the bank’s analysts added.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Where Does Bitcoin Come In?</h2>
<p>Mounting interest expenses suggest that the central bank may need to inject money into the economy again to keep it upright. This would likely be bullish for risk assets, including Bitcoin – which is know for having an absolutely fixed supply irrespective of economic circumstances.</p>
<p>Bitcoin already rose from $19,000 to $30,000 in March when the Federal Reserve bailed out depositors to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, while also adding another $300 billion in assets back to its balance sheet.</p>
<p>Mike Novogratz correctly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/venture-capitalist-mike-novogratz-predicts-30k-bitcoin-this-quarter/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a> the pump at the time. He also <a href="https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1681387712220102672" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">called</a> Bitcoin a “report card on fiscal stewardship” earlier this month, in response to the fast-depreciating Turkish Lira reaching another all-time high in Bitcoin terms.</p>
<p>Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan has repeatedly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/balaji-forfeits-and-settles-1-million-bitcoin-bet-but-stands-by-hyperinflation-thesis/" data-wpel-link="internal">argued</a> this year that mounting debt across all sectors of the economy could cause the government to “print trillions”, which will ultimately boost Bitcoin’s price.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[From potential crypto bills in the US to Fed's interest rate hike and Twitter's rebranding - let's unpack the past seven days. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although most prices in the cryptocurrency market have shown high levels of stagnation in the past week, there were still several notable developments on different fronts.</p>
<p>Starting with US regulations, this week saw discussions for a few separate bills, including the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, which Democrats claimed still &#8220;<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/congressional-stablecoin-bill-still-reeks-of-sam-bankman-fried-democrats-say/" data-wpel-link="internal">reeks</a>&#8221; of Sam Bankman-Fried &#8211; the disgraced former FTX exec who was among the chief supporters. On the other hand, Republicans were not too happy that the stablecoin legislative proposal also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/republicans-blast-white-house-for-failure-to-compromise-on-stablecoin-bill/" data-wpel-link="internal">failed</a> to pass.</p>
<p>Another talked-about point coming from the States was the Wednesday FOMC meeting. The Federal Reserve was expected to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/federal-reserve-raises-rates-again-by-0-25-bitcoin-trades-flat/" data-wpel-link="internal">increase</a> the key interest rates by 25 basis points after failing to do so during the previous such meeting.</p>
<p>Typically, such moves lead to enhanced volatility for bitcoin and the rest of the market, but this wasn&#8217;t the case on Wednesday. The primary cryptocurrency didn&#8217;t have the best week in terms of price action, as it failed to remain above $30,000 during the weekend and hasn&#8217;t been above that line since. Furthermore, it painted a monthly low beneath $29,000 on Monday.</p>
<p>Interesting news came out from Twitter as the owner &#8211; Elon Musk &#8211; announced a rebranding and a logo change to &#8220;X.&#8221; Additionally, he hinted at potential integration of Dogecoin, which sent the meme coin&#8217;s price flying to a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/doge-tapped-3-month-high-following-musk-engagement-btc-sustains-29k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">three-month peak</a> during the week.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most crypto assets suffered in the past week, with GALA, Injective, Mantle, and PEPE leading the adverse trend with double-digit price drops. Ripple&#8217;s native token, as well as Bitcoin SV, also posted 7-day declines of around 8%.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Dubai, UAE, July 28th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>Creeta has announced the creation of Dayroot, a hyper-realistic multiverse platform that extends the capabilities of the metaverse. It will enable players to enter a digital realm where anything is possible and where countless parallel universes exist. Dayroot is the first world to be created by Creta&#8217;s multiverse service.</p>
<p>Creta breaks the barriers of existing metaverse content by offering a high-performance public blockchain and web3-based multiverse platform. Headquartered in Dubai, Creta boasts a team of renowned developers, publishers, and blockchain experts with decades of experience in the gaming industry. Its team includes Ray Nakazato, a respected producer in the gaming industry, and Alexander Harutyunyan, the former CEO of Innova. Their vision is to create a next-generation, global-oriented web3 multiverse platform ecosystem that caters to both gamers and game creators alike.</p>
<p>Creta&#8217;s concept of a mega multiverse unites interconnected metaverses with stunning photorealistic visual quality. Initially, the platform will introduce three basic metaverse worlds, with plans to continually add diverse metaverses through partnerships. This design ensures that users can seamlessly explore and enjoy a multiverse world that transcends the boundaries of any single metaverse.</p>
<p>The technological backbone behind Creta’s ambitious concept is the Locus GameChain, capable of reducing server costs dramatically, and the high-performance public blockchain known as Locus Chain, which addresses scalability challenges.</p>
<p>The Creta multiverse aims to be an all-in-one hub for a wide range of content services, seamlessly integrating games, performances, shopping, and user-generated content spaces. This consolidation of experiences caters to the preferences of each user, ensuring a harmonious blend of light goal-achievement games, immersive high-quality content, and more.</p>
<p>Creta is also preparing to launch a web3-based community known as Creta SuperClub. This community-driven platform will empower users to share information, engage in discussions through clubs and forums, and make use of blockchain’s many advantages. Notably, users, not developers, will have ownership of the clubs and be able to trade various NFTs, such as game items, within the platform.</p>
<p>Creta Japan CEO Ray Nakazato said: “The Creta platform&#8217;s high-performance, blockchain-based photorealistic graphics hold infinite potential for expansion, promising an entirely new world of experiences that has never been seen before.”</p>
<p>The hyper-realistic multiverse platform offered by Creta has the potential to reshape the entertainment industry, offering a limitless range of experiences and uniting the worlds of gaming, blockchain, and web3 into a single, cohesive genre.</p>
<h2>About Creta</h2>

The company is run by the development team of acclaimed video game franchise Kingdom Under Fire and is supported by veterans from both blockchain and video game industries such as Yield Games Guild Japan and Yoshiki Okamoto, an award-winning game designer behind Monster Strike.
